President, the bill that I am introducing today, along with Senators Warner, Landrieu, Vitter, Coleman, Smith, and Nelson of Nebraska, would increase and expand the Teacher Tax deduction provided in current law. The Teacher Tax deduction is available to school teachers and other educators who incur out-of-pocket expenses in order to purchase classroom supplies for their students. The bill we are offering today would increase this above-the-line tax deduction to $400, allow the deduction to be taken for expenses related to professional development, and make the deduction permanent.  This bill builds upon a $250 tax deduction in current law authored by Senator Warner and myself, which became law as part of the tax relief package in 2001. This tax relief was later extended through the end of this year, but we need to act to extend it further.   I would suggest that there is no reason why we should not make the deduction permanent. Teachers who buy classroom supplies in order to improve the educational experience of their students deserve more than just our gratitude. They deserve this modest tax relief to thank them for their hard work.  So often teachers in my State, and throughout the country, spend their own money in order to improve the classroom experiences of their students. Many of us are familiar with a survey of the National Education Association that found that teachers spend, on average, $443 a year on classroom supplies. Other surveys show that they are spending even more than that. In fact, the National School Supply and Equipment Association found that educators spend an average of $826 to supplement classroom supplies, plus $926 for instructional materials on top of that--for a total of over $1,700 out of their own pockets.  In most States, including mine, teachers are very modestly paid for their jobs. I think it is so impressive that despite challenging jobs and modest salaries, teachers are willing to dig deep into their own pockets to enrich the classroom experience, because they care so deeply for their students.  Indeed, I have spoken to dozens of teachers in Maine who tell me they routinely spend far in excess of the $250 deduction limit that is in current law. I have made a practice of visiting schools all over Maine, and so far, I have had the opportunity to visit more than 160 schools in my State. At virtually every school I visit, I find teachers who are spending their own money to benefit their students. Year after year, these teachers spend hundreds of dollars on books, bulletin boards, computer software, crayons, construction paper, stamps, inkpads--everything you can think of. Let me just give you a couple of examples. Anita Hopkins and Kathi Toothaker, who are elementary school teachers from Augusta, ME, purchase books for their students to have as a classroom library, as well as workbooks and sight cards. They have also purchased special prizes for positive reinforcement for their students. Mrs. Hopkins estimates that she spends $800 to $1,000 of her own money on extra materials to make learning fun and to create a stimulating classroom environment.  This bill would also expand the Teacher Tax deduction to make it available to teachers who incur expenses for professional development. Whenever the provisions of ``No Child Left Behind'' are being debated, we hear a lot of discussion about the need for highly-qualified teachers. One of the best ways for teachers to improve their qualifications is through professional development. Yet, in towns in my State, and I suspect throughout the country, school budgets are often very tight, and money for professional development is either very limited or non-existent. For that reason, I believe we should allow this tax deduction to also apply when a teacher takes a course or attends a workshop and has to pay for it out of his or her own pocket.  In my view, students are the ultimate beneficiaries when teachers receive professional development to sharpen their skills or to learn a new approach to presenting material to their students. Studies have consistently shown that, other than involved parents, the single greatest determinant of classroom success is the presence of a well-qualified teacher. Educators themselves understand just how important professional development is to their ability to make a positive impact in the classroom.  The Teacher Tax relief that we have made available since 2001 is certainly a positive step, and I was proud to have authored that law, along with Senator Warner. This bill would increase that deduction from $250 to $400, reflecting more accurately what teachers really spend, and would make the deduction permanent. The National Education Association has endorsed this bill, and I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the NEA's letter be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.  This bill is a small but appropriate means of recognizing the many sacrifices that our teachers make every day to benefit the children of America. I urge my colleagues to support it.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Education Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.     Senator Susan Collins,     Senator John Warner,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Warner: On behalf of the National      Education Association's, NEA, 3.2 million members, we would      like to express our strong support for your legislation that      would increase, expand, and make permanent the tax deduction      for educators' out-of-pocket classroom supply expenses. We      thank you for your continued leadership and advocacy on this      important issue.       As you know, the educator tax deduction helps recognize the      financial sacrifices made by teachers and paraprofessionals,      who often reach into their own pockets to purchase classroom      supplies such as books, pencils, paper, and art supplies.      Studies show that teachers are spending more of their own      funds each year to supply their classrooms, including      purchasing essential items such as pencils, glue, scissors,      and facial tissues. For example, NEA's 2003 report Status of      the American Public School Teacher, 2000-2001 found that      teachers spent an average of $443 a year on classroom      supplies. More recently, the National School Supply and      Equipment Association found that in 2005-2006, educators      spent out of their own pockets an average of $826.00 for      supplies and an additional $926 for instructional materials,      for a total of $1,752.       By increasing the current deduction and making it      permanent, your legislation will make a real difference for      many educators, who often must sacrifice other personal needs      in order to pay for classroom supplies.       NEA also strongly supports your proposal to extend the tax      deduction to cover out-of-pocket professional development      expenses. Teacher quality is the single most critical factor      in maximizing student achievement. Ongoing professional      development is essential to ensure that educators stay up-to-     date on the skills and knowledge necessary to prepare      students for the challenges of the 21 st century. Your bill      will make a critical difference in helping educators access      quality training.       We thank you again for your work on this important      legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you      to support our nation's educators.           Sincerely,     Diane Shust,       Director of Government Relations.     Randall Moody,       Manager, Policy and Politics.
