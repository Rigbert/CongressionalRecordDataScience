 President, I am introducing a bill today to try to bring some uniform coverage of mammography to private insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, consistent with the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute guidelines. Joining me as cosponsors are Senators Mikulski, Wellstone and Johnson.  I am introducing this bill because I believe mammography is our best tool for finding breast cancer early and women will not get mammograms without good insurance coverage. We now have the two leading organizations, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute, agreeing on screening guidelines and we cannot assume that insurance companies will rush to follow those guidelines. In the current highly competitive climate of managed care, with plans and providers reducing services and benefits, with employers cutting back on coverage, only congressional action will guarantee women the health care they need, especially preventive services like this.                          Breast Cancer's Toll  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, after skin cancer. In 1996, 184,300 new cases were diagnosed and 44,300 women died. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among women, after lung cancer. Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women between ages 40 and 55.  Most women diagnosed with breast cancer are over age 50. For women age 40 to 44, the incidence rate is 125.4 per 100,000 women; for women ages 50 to 54, it jumps to 232.7 per 100,000.                      Early Detection Saves Lives  The sooner breast cancer is detected, the better the survival rate. If breast cancer is diagnosed when it is local--confined to the breast--the 5-year survival rate is 96 percent. If diagnosed later, when cancer has metastasized, the survival rate is 20 percent.  Regularly scheduled mammography screening offers the single best method of finding breast cancer early. Mammograms, while never absolutely certain, can detect cancer several years before physical symptoms are obvious to a women or her doctor. Mammography has a sensitivity that is 76-94 percent higher than that of a clinical breast exam. Its ability to find an absence of cancer is greater than 90 percent. For women over 50, mammography can reduce breast cancer mortality by at least 30 percent.  Earlier this year, the National Cancer Institute recommended that asymtomatic women in their 40s have a screening mammogram every one to two years. The American Cancer Society recommends that all women over age 40 should have annual screening mammograms.  A February 1997 CBS poll found that 71 percent of women think early detection of breast cancer significantly increases a woman's chances of surviving. 85 percent believe mammograms are safe and 88 percent trust the accuracy of mamograms. Between 1987 and 1992, the National Health Interview survey found that there was at least a two-fold increase in the percentage of women of all ages who had a recent mammogram.                     Compliance with Guidelines Low  So women by and large understand the need for mammograms. However, a study by the Centers for Disease Control found that only 41 percent of women age 40 to 49 reported having a recent mammogram. Only half of women aged 50 to 64 had a recent mammogram. And only 39 percent of women over age 65 reported a recent mammogram.                     Lack of Insurance a Deterrent  So the question is, if women understand the importance of mammograms, why is adherence to the guidelines so low? The CDC study said, ``Health insurance coverage and educational attainment were both strongly associated with [mammograms] for women 40-49 years of age.''  A survey by the Jacob Institute of Women's Health likewise found that 56 percent of women in their 40's and 47 percent of women in the 50's were meeting the ACS screening guideline. After lack of a family history, the cost of a mammogram was the principal reason for not having a mammogram.  The lack of insurance coverage, the CDC study found, is an important factor in determining which women follow the recommended guidelines. Among commercially insured women, more than half were following the guidelines. However, for women in government insurance programs, between 58 percent and 66 percent were not following the guidelines. For women with no insurance of any kind, 84 percent were not in compliance with the guidelines.  The cost of a mammogram also varies widely, depending on the radiologist's technique, the location, the interpretation needed. One unofficial estimate of cost is that a mammogram ranges from $75.00 to $200.00 per visit. A $200 medical charge is not something most Americans want to bear out of pocket. They expect their insurance plan to cover medically necessary services.                         Coverage Varies Widely  Commercial insurance coverage for mammograms varies widely, differing in terms of the age of the covered person and frequency of the service. Many plans follow the American Cancer Society's guidelines, but this is not documented. At least 38 states have mandated some type of coverage for commercial plans, but again the details vary. Medicare covers mammograms every other year. Federal law does not require Medicaid to have specific coverage. A 1993 Alan Guttmacher study attempting to describe coverages of commercial health insurance coverage of reproductive services is aptly titled ``Uneven & Unequal.'' So in summary, insurance coverage is ``all over the map.''                                The Bill  The bill addresses private commercial group and individual insurance plans, Medicare and Medicaid. It would--  Require private plans that cover diagnostic mammograms for women under 40 to also cover annual screening mammography.  Require Medicare and Medicaid to cover annual screening mammography for women over age 40. (Medicare now covers biannual screening. Federal law does not require State Medicaid programs to cover mammography for any age and State approaches vary widely.)  Prohibits plans from denying coverage for annual screening mammography because it is not medically necessary or not pursuant to a referral or recommendation by any health care provider;  Deny a woman eligibility or renewal to avoid these requirements;  Provide monetary payments or rebates to women to encourage women to accept less than the minimum protections of the bill;  Financially reward or punish providers for withholding mammographies.                          Support for the Bill  The bill is supported by the American Cancer Society, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the Susan B. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the Breast Cancer Resource Committee, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetrics, and Neonatal Nurses.  I believe this bill will put some important principles into insurance coverage for this very necessary service. I hope my colleagues will join me in promptly moving this bill to enactment.                                 ______                                       By
