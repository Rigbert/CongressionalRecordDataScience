Mr. Speaker, today I am reintroducing legislation directing the Department of the Interior to acquire subsurface inholdings in three conservation system units. Under this legislation, entitled the ``Alaska Peninsula Subsurface Consolidation Act of 1995,'' the United States would acquire 275,000 acres of oil and gas properties in the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve, the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge, and Becharof National Wildlife Refuge in exchange for Federal properties of equal value in Alaska.  The subsurface properties are currently owned by an Alaska Native corporation, Koniag, Inc., which received them under the terms of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. By an accident of geography, Koniag, the regional corporation of the Kodiak Archipelago, was unable to realize its full entitlement of land within the Kodiak area under ANCSA. The prior establishment of the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and the limitations of the islands forced Congress to redraw the regional corporation boundaries and grant Koniag and other Kodiak corporations rights on the Alaska Peninsula. Most of these rights were exchanged in 1980, but these subsurface holdings remain. Implementation of this bill will finally remove Koniag from the area and allow the Federal agencies better management capability.  Under the terms of the bill I am introducing, after a standard risk adjusted appraisal of the oil and gas rights, Koniag will exchange these holdings for Federal property in Alaska of equal value. In the event that Koniag and the Secretary of the Interior are unable after 5 years to swap lands accounting for the full value of the oil and gas, then Konaig will be given credits equal to the remaining untraded value of the rights. With these credits, Koniag or its assignee may bid on other Federal surplus properties. Any income from the disposal of its assets by Koniag will be shared with other Alaska Native corporations just as oil and gas income is shared under the terms of ANCSA section 7(i).  Mr. Speaker, a version of this bill has been considered and passed the House in 1992. Another version was approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in 1994. But we have never been able to get the bill all the way through the process. I hope to change that this year.  I have made a few changes in the bill which I am introducing today. The major change is to delete the wilderness designations which have previously been part of the bill. It was my hope that moderate wilderness designations in the bill would help the bill's consideration in this body and with the administration. Despite the courtesy and fair consideration by former Chairman Miller, we were unable to move the bill last year. At the same time, the wilderness provisions drew opposition from other native corporations, local governments, and the State of Alaska.  I have also made minor changes to the sections of the bill regarding the mineral appraisal and the property account in response to suggestions made by the Department of the Interior and Office of Management and Budget. These provisions are similar to those in the bill approved by the Senate last session and were acceptable to the Congressional Budget Office. If there are other improvements which can be made to the bill, I will entertain them during the hearing process.  I look forward to working with the Secretary, with Mr. Miller and the other members of the Resources Committee. I am confident we can resolve this long overdue issue for the benefit of the Alaskan Native community and for the American people.                          ____________________
