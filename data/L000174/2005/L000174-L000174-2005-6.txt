Over the last week, this Nation and this Senate have been engaged in a debate about the importance of protecting and preserving those rights as we consider how best to revise and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. We have also learned about the White House's domestic surveillance program that short-circuited the judicial safeguards established by Congress.  Today we engage in an action unique to the Senate. We consider for confirmation to lifetime appointments to the judiciary a number of nominees. This is an instance in which all three branches of the government are involved. The President nominates, the Senate considers the nominations and, if confirmed, the nominee is appointed to become a member of the judiciary. The judiciary has a particularly important role in the protection of the rights and liberties of all Americans. It was Justice O'Connor who, writing for the Supreme Court, noted that even wartime does not give the President a ``blank check'' when it comes to actions that impact Americans' rights. Every day in courtrooms across the country federal judges are the last line of defense for Americans' rights.  If anyone doubts the importance of the position of Federal district court judges, they need look no further than the district court judges assigned to sit on Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA Court. This court was designed specifically to act as a check on the Executive Branch, and when it is consulted as the law requires, it performs a crucial role in our Government's system of checks and balances. In an extraordinary development, we read today that a federal judge assigned by the Chief Justice of the United States to serve on that court has resigned in the face of the disclosure of this President's secret surveillance program outside of the legal FISA process.  With the votes today, the Senate will be called upon to grant or withhold its consent to another seven judicial nominees. If they are confirmed, the Senate will have confirmed 225 of this President's judicial nominees to lifetime appointments. If they are confirmed, the Senate will increase the number of confirmations this year by 50 percent in just one day, from 14 to 21.  I chaired the Judiciary Committee for the second half of 2001. No judges had been confirmed that year before I became chair. In the last 5 months of the year we were able to have hearings, Committee consideration, and Senate votes on 28 new judges. We worked hard in spite of the 9/11 attacks and the anthrax attacks and succeeded in reducing vacancies and filling longstanding vacancies. Indeed in the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of this President's nominees. It took Republicans more than twice as long to match our record. Democrats proceeded in spite of the recent history of Republicans pocket filibustering more than 60 of President Clinton's qualified, moderate nominees.  As is clear from our record since that time, we have been willing to continue working with the Republican majority to fill vacancies on the federal bench--if only the President would send nominees. Unfortunately, along with home heating prices, gasoline prices, interest rates, the budget deficit and the trade deficit, judicial vacancies have also increased dramatically this year. It almost seems that unless the White House can pick a partisan political fight, it really does not care very much about the Federal judiciary. I noted in the spring that we had not received new nominations this year from the President. Only recently has that begun to change but there are still more than 25 vacancies without a nominee. I urge the President, as the Democratic leader and I have urged him for some time, to work with Senators on both sides of the aisle to identify qualified, consensus candidates to fill these vacancies.
