I believe a number of committees have already considered this legislation carefully. The issue is not new. What we want to ensure, Mr. Whip, is that the legislation is properly drawn and drafted because obviously it is an important piece of legislation with serious consequences, and we want to make sure that it is done properly.  The Rules Committee, in answer to your second question, we do believe that the Rules Committee can consider this and will consider the work that has been done by other committees because again this subject matter is something we have already considered. We believe it is important to move this matter early in the session so the public has confidence that there are consequences. There are not only consequences in terms of criminal convictions which we have seen, but also consequences in terms of the pensions that are earned during the performance of your duties, and that the American taxpayer is not happy with pensions being paid to those who have abused their oath of office and their responsibilities to the American public.  But the gentleman is correct, we have just given notice; but we do have Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Wednesday we will consider that, and then you will have another 48 hours or thereabouts before it comes to the floor.  I am hopeful that we will work together on this. I think we share the view that this is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about making sure that Members comport themselves properly; and if they do not, that there are consequences. And I think then we can assure the taxpayer that they will not be subsidizing, through pensions, wrongdoers who fail to meet their duties under the Constitution.
