President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from Connecticut, because it is complicated. This is something that--it is also very difficult to actually explain a bill to 69 people and get that many cosponsors. But it is something we have been concerned about for a long time. Ten years ago, on the light aircraft, we actually had this language--even stronger than it is now. In that period of time, there hasn't been one accident that can be related to a third-class medical. I think the time has proven itself in 10 years.  To respond, I would be very happy to work with the Senator from Connecticut on problems that may rise that I don't envision right now. I appreciate very much his cooperation and also his staying around this late at night.  Thank you so much.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
