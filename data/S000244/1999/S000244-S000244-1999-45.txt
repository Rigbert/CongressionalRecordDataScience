Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, but I do not think that it is fair to say that the Committee on Science has been parsimonious relative to solar renewable energy. The base bill recommends a 6.7 percent increase above appropriated 1999 levels to 401.9 million for fiscal 2000 and an additional 4 percent increase to $418.1 million for fiscal 2001. This amendment pluses those numbers up further at a time when we are operating under discretionary spending caps and under some severe budget constraints.  During my early years on the Committee on Science we, on a bipartisan basis, attempted to put some sense and some market forces into solar and renewable energy research because frankly the programs were overfunded following the 1979 oil crisis, and those efforts were successful; and I think we were able to better focus the money on it so that the taxpayers got more bang for the buck.  So I am going to tell my friends from Colorado and New York that there is going to be a little quid pro quo to my good judgment in support of this amendment, and that is going to be some vigorous oversight over the solar and renewable energy programs over the next year; and I hope that they will exercise equally good judgment to support that so that we do not go back to the morass of merely throwing money at the program like we did in the late 1970s and early 1980s, over two administrations, one a Democratic administration and one a Republican administration.
