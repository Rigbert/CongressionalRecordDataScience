President, I want to thank Senator Moynihan for submitting this resolution on the first legislative day of the 105th Congress in support of Ngawang Choephel and other prisoners of conscience in Tibet.  I first learned about the detention of Tibetan music and dance scholar and former Middlebury College student Ngawang Choephel about a year ago. Students and faculty at Middlebury were leading a letter-writing campaign to urge Chinese authorities to release information about their friend and colleague, who had traveled in 1995 to Tibet to make a documentary film of traditional Tibetan dance and music after spending several months as a Fulbright scholar at Middlebury. No one had seen or herd from Mr. Choephel, until an exiled Tibetan reported seeing him in a Tibetan prison.  I wrote to the head of the Chinese Communist Party to find out what I could about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts, his health, the evidence against him, and whether he had access to a lawyer. I received no reply. I inquired further. Finally, in October, more than a year after his detention, Chinese authorities reported that Mr. Choephel was charged with violating the State Security Law. He was accused of espionage, and it was insinuated that he was a spy financed by the United States Government. No evidence to support such a claim has ever been produced. The State Department issued a statement calling for Mr. Choephel's release.  There is no evidence that Mr. Choephel was engaged in any improper activity or even any political activity whatsoever during his trip to Tibet. The 16 hours of film Mr. Choephel sent to India during the first weeks of his project contain the traditional music and dance that he intended to document. Like the State Department, I believe that the Chinese have made a terrible mistake in this case.  In November, I accompanied Senator Daschle on a trip to China. In meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other officials, I raised Ngawang Choephel's case and urged the President to look into it personally. I have received no response to those inquiries. Only weeks after returning from Beijing, I learned that Mr. Choephel had been sentenced to 18 years in prison, and I immediately wrote again to President Jiang Zemin, urging that Mr. Choephel be released.  Mr. Choephel's reported confession, secret trial, and unusually long prison sentence underscore the longstanding disregard for the rule of law and the lack of respect for political and cultural rights in Tibet and China. Mr. Choephel is one of thousands who have been persecuted for attempting to preserve what remains of Tibetan culture.  The resolution introduced by Senator Moynihan calls on the Chinese Government to release Mr. Choephel unconditionally. It also calls on United States officials to raise his case in all meetings with Chinese authorities, to support a resolution on human rights in Tibet and China in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, to urge the Chinese to allow international human rights groups to monitor human rights in Tibet, and to support an exchange program for Tibetan students.  These are measures that will emphasize the importance the United States Senate places on improving respect for human rights in China and Tibet. It is particularly important that the administration takes a stronger position in support of the resolution on China and Tibet in the U.N. Human Rights Commission this year.  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Moynihan again for his concern and his leadership on Tibet over the years. I urge all Senators to support this resolution.                          ____________________
