DODD. I thank my colleague from Illinois. Again, I urge Members to follow what he has proposed here. He said it very well. We do require in this bill that there be overvotes, not undervotes. I don't know if my colleague from Illinois made that distinction. There is nothing in this bill that requires that a person be notified of an undervote. Senator McCain, in fact, raised this issue with me. I thought he brought up a very good point. There are many of us--we can all identify with this--who have gone in to vote and there were some positions where we just did not know the people. We did not know anything about them whatsoever. So from time to time, we do not cast a ballot on those particular races. We make the conscious decision not to cast a ballot.  We don't want to necessarily be notified that we have not voted for the deputy sheriff in some place. So we have excluded any reference to undervote references, only to overvote where, again, everyone wants to be notified if they voted for two candidates for President or two candidates for Senate, or Governor. The overvote issue is extremely important.
