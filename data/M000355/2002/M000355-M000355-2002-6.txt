 It is my understanding that some voter registration applications currently in use are ambiguous with regard to questions about an applicant's citizenship status. Because of these ambiguous questions and instructions for answering the questions, the conferees concluded that registration forms should provide additional guidance to registration applicants and election officials who process voter registrations.  This legislation requires that voter registration applications contain a question asking whether the applicant is a U.S. citizen and boxes for the applicant to answer the question by checking ``yes'' or ``no.'' If neither box is checked, the election official must return the application to the individual with instructions to complete the form. In effect, we have created a second-chance registration opportunity. The individual's registration application cannot be processed and the individual cannot be registered unless the citizenship question is answered--and answered affirmatively. The registration form shall also inform the applicant of this procedure I have just described.
