President, a number of Senators have spoken on this issue. And I also know that the Senate bipartisan leadership and the House bipartisan leadership are meeting with the President, so there will not be a rollcall vote immediately.  I urge Senators who wish to speak on this subject to come to the floor and speak. I see the distinguished Senator from California, and I ask the Senator if she wishes to speak.
