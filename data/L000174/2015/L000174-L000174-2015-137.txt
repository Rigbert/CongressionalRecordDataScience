President, I wish to recognize George Schenk, founder of one of Vermont's most beloved restaurants, American Flatbread. Thirty years ago, American Flatbread was built from the ground up, driven by George's own enthusiasm, innovation, and drive. He baked his first pizza--flatbread as he prefers to call it--in a wood-fired stone oven of his own design. Today, American Flatbread still bakes its creations in the same stone ovens.  George started with a vision where his food was not just great tasting and nutritional, but also nurturing and healing the soul. He accomplished that and so much more. Anyone who has sat down at American Flatbread after a long day hiking, skiing or even just to visit understands the satisfaction of eating at George's restaurant. He and his staff maintain a commitment to the core values of the integrity of a meal, using organic and locally sourced ingredients, including those grown in a greenhouse next door. George cultivates these ingredients to deliver on his promise of ``good, flavorful, nutritious food that gives both joy and health.''  American Flatbread also reflects the best of Vermont's community traditions--caring for one another. Food is often given to help local hospitals and families in need, and those same citizens give back when they can. Like many Vermont towns, Waitsfield was devastated by Tropical Storm Irene, and among the damaged businesses was American Flatbread. Despite the damage, they were able to reopen in just a few short days thanks to the work of hundreds of local volunteers in both their time and in donations.  Since the fire was lit in that first stone oven, George has stayed true to his vision of a sustainable and community-oriented business, one that has flourished while calling Vermont its home. In honor of American Flatbread turning 30, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Sally Pollak's story from the May 28, 2015, edition of the Burlington Free Press.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 28, 2015]          American Flatbread Turns 30, Throws Community Party       Waitsfield.--Thirty years ago in his side yard in Warren,      George Schenk made a pizza in his wood-fired field stone      oven.       The toppings were simple: olive oil, garlic, Parmesan and      herbs from his garden.       ``I didn't know if it was going to stick to the rock,''      Schenk said. ``I didn't know if it was going to bake. The      oven had no door.''       Two couples who were hanging out drinking wine shared that      pizza, or flatbread in Schenk vernacular.       Their response was like a wave at a football stadium on a      smaller scale, Schenk said. Smiles moved from face to face.       ``We just thought it was great,'' said Lyndon Virkler, dean      of education at New England Culinary Institute, who was one      of the original flatbread eaters. ``Because of the nice hot      rock it had a nice, crisp crust. And real simple, pure      flavors.''       What was meant to be a side dish became the ``highlight of      the evening,'' Virkler said. He had met Schenk--a ski bum--     five years earlier in the kitchen at Sam Rupert's, a Warren      restaurant. Virkler was chef and Schenk was a salad maker      with creativity and drive, Virkler said.       ``We've often reflected on our place in history,'' Virkler      said. ``My wife and I being able to sample the first      flatbread.''       Schenk knew that night 30 years ago he had made something      he and other people enjoyed eating. Beyond that, he found      something that was gratifying to make: from building the oven      to splitting wood and making a fire to kneading the dough.       ``I was looking for a professional cooking opportunity that      felt right,'' Schenk said. ``Not necessarily being on a line      behind closed doors.''       Schenk's pizza--American Flatbread--has been around ever      since: never behind closed doors and often outside. It      started once a week at Tucker Hill Inn before Schenck opened      American Flatbread at Lareau Farm in Waitsfield in 1992. That      restaurant spawned a dozen American Flatbreads in New      England, one in Hawaii and one in British Columbia.       American Flatbread will be available to all next Saturday,      when Schenk celebrates 30 years of flatbread with free pizza      and salad at his Waitsfield restaurant. Bigger than the      birthday party, the event is to recognize community members      who give to their communities in a variety of ways, he said.       ``It's the whole range of human experience,'' Schenk said,      listing the spheres of people and organizations he intends to      honor: religious, local government, volunteer fire and      ambulance personnel, people who serve seniors and the ill and      injured, those who are involved in the arts and work to      protect the environment.       ``Here in this small valley there are 54 registered      nonprofits,'' Schenk said.       Schenk spoke of the help his business received after two      floods--in 1998 and 2011--damaged the restaurant and grounds      at Lareau Farm, site of American Flatbread.       ``Over 400 peopled helped us dig out,'' Schenk said.      ``People donated tractors, cleaned firewood, mucked out the      basement and moved debris. In the absence of that help, this      little business would have failed.''       Money also was donated, including a $25,000 interest-free      loan.       ``People get really squirrely about money,'' Schenk said.      But this loan was without that kind of attitude. The check      came with a post-it note that read: ``Thinking of you.'' When      Schenk repaid his last loan installment of $1,000, the check      was returned uncashed, he said.       ``In various iterations that story repeated itself over and      over,'' Schenk said. ``With acts of profound kindness, at a      time of need and loss.''       The celebration next Saturday is to do something ``nice,''      Schenk said--choosing with care a word an English teacher      advised him long ago to stay away from.                       Words with a side of pizza       Words matter to Schenk. Over the years they have achieved a      place of importance in his business.       The restaurant in Waitsfield has gardens that grow food for      flatbreads and salad, a campfire on the stone patio, and      banners printed with Schenk's writings on food, family,      community, philosophy, and social issues.       His compositions, which he calls ``dedications,'' appear in      the menus at American Flatbread. Schenck has written more      than 1,400 over the past 28 years.       ``I have often felt as though if I didn't write, the      flatbread wasn't complete, it wasn't as good,'' Schenk said.      ``Maybe in truth, I was not as good or complete. It provided      an internal discipline that I needed.''       In his semi-retirement, Schenk, 62, is reading through the      archive of his dedications with plans to publish them in a      book.       Reading through his dedications, the ones that emerge as      most meaningful to him are about his family and the time he      spent raising his two children, now grown, Schenk said.       ``I'm acutely aware that those days and events are past and      will never come again,'' Schenk said. ``The dedications      captured something about their childhoods and my experiences      that I wouldn't otherwise have.''       A dedication called ``The Family Bed'' is on the porch at      American Flatbread.       It reads in part:       ``We are together. Laughing and talking, getting ready for      bed. 'Read to me first,' cries Willis who is three. I look at      Hanna, half grown at eight years, she looks back at me with      patience. `Pick out your books and jump into bed, I'll be      with you in just a minute.' (I go downstairs and fill the old      stove with big chunks of wood. It is cold for April.) I hop      back up, two stairs at a time, and join them in the big      bed.''       Nearby is a dedication titled ``Children and the Kitchen.''      Schenk wrote:       ``Children have a natural curiosity about the goings on in      a kitchen. It is important to nurture this curiosity so that      they have as their own the skills and care of good cooking.      Almost all food work, from the garden to washing dishes,      including knife-work, is child-friendly.''                          Dreaming in the dirt       The garden is where Schenk prefers to spend time these      days. He has a plot in the staff garden at Flatbread, and he      works in a greenhouse at Lareau Farm.       Schenk loves the physical activity of gardening, and being      outside in sunlight and fresh air. He has a particular      interest in the nutrient content of the soil, and values the      way garden work helps produce food that is ``nutrient dense''      and rich in flavor, Schenk said.       ``There's a kind of psychological peace and health that      comes with the work,'' he said. ``Our palates really can      guide us to health affirming food.''       He has built in his garden a structure he calls a ``soil      invertebrate condominium.''       Soil invertebrates, insects and worms, stimulate soil      bacteria, which improve the biology and chemistry of the      soil. The creatures also aerate the soil, and help with pest      control, Schenk said. They allow Schenk to play in the dirt,      and peek into that ``magic place'' where they live.       ``I've come to take an enormous amount of happiness from      this work, and peace,'' Schenk said last week in his garden.      ``As I become older, that peace and well being has become      something that I value greatly. My goal wasn't to go out and      create a pizza empire. It was to have a healthy and happy      life.''       He sold his restaurant development group a few years ago,      and now works as a Flatbread consultant. Thursday, he trucked      buckets of clay gathered at Lareau Farm and sapling alders      from a swamp in Roxbury to Rockport, Maine, to build an oven      for a new American Flatbread restaurant.       ``It was about letting go of my ego,'' Schenk said of his      selling the development group. ``When we idealize the      American corporate dream and growth, that's what we see and      hold up as a model of success.       ``I got caught up in someone else's dream. As I grew, I      came to realize that it wasn't my dream.''       Schenk dreams in the dirt these days, a place he hopes is      teeming with activity.       ``Systems that are more complex tend to be more stable,''      he said. ``It's stability that we're looking for in our      lives.''                          ____________________
