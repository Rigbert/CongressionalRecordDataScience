Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Boehlert amendment and compliment the gentleman in his effort.  Mr. Chairman, I object to the amendment of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Nadler] for two basic reasons. You talk about a willing seller-willing buyer. A willing buyer, yes, but not always the seller. There have been cases where Fish and Wildlife has gone into an area and drawn a refuge around different landholders in long, spidery ways, surrounding them, and then declaring the area around these private landholders as a refuge, and they are inside the refuge, being then an inholder.  Then what happens, the land value decreases dramatically from anybody else, because they are under certain restrictions because it is called a buffer zone. So what would occur under the gentleman's thoughts here would be in reality an agency willing to go in and get 499 acres around an area, and the willing seller would only have one buyer. Any time you have one buyer, and that buyer being the U.S. Government, and one owner being put in that kind of spot, it has a devastating effect on that one owner. We have seen that occur not just with this administration, but other administrations also. So this is not partisan.  We are trying to avoid that. We are allowing them to get a certain amount of acreage in an emergency case. But every other time they have got to come back to this Congress to authorize, for us to say it is the right thing to do, and not be put into the position of making the landowners subvergent to the Federal Government.
