Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the Federal Government has a responsibility to demonstrate its capability to meet its contractual obligation by addressing the spent fuel and other high-level nuclear waste at permanently shutdown reactors.

I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
