President, the Homeland Security Committee of the Senate has been conducting a thoroughly comprehensive, bipartisan, and thorough investigation into the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina. We have held 15 hearings, the latest of which was today. We have interviewed 270 witnesses. We have reviewed 800,000--800,000--pages of documents. We have a completely bipartisan staff of investigators, attorneys, and other experts.  We are working together. We are making great progress. We will finish in March. We will produce a report and legislation. And, most important, we will finish our work before the next hurricane season is here.  I urge opposition to the amendment, and I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is not germane to the measure now before the Senate. I raise a point of order under section 305(b) of the Budget Act.
