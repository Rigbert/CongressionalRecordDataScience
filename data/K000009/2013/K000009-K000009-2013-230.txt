Speaker. I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Helen Moss, who passed from this life on Saturday, November 9, 2013. Helen Moss was an indefatigable and socially minded community leader on many fronts. The living partnership she and her husband, Richard, formed were constant forces for community betterment across the Cleveland region.  Dedicated to success and committed to the pursuit of innovative research, Helen created the Helen Moss Cancer Research Foundation in 2000. The purpose of the foundation is to encourage and support education in Integrative Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Care in Northeastern Ohio. She chose to turn her final heroic struggle into continuing good for her community: in 2012, she helped to establish the Parker Hannifin/Helen Moss Cancer Research Foundation Professorship in Integrative Oncology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.  In addition to her support of health research, Helen played an active role in the local community. She was elected as a councilwoman for the Village of Bratenahl in 2001. Additionally, she was selected to be the President of the Ohio Ballet in Akron in 1982 and was appointed to the Ohio Arts Council in 1986. An elegant woman, strong, and vitally engaged citizen, she held a precious appreciation for beauty--in the arts, in the built environment, in literature and music. Helen was inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame in 2009.  Helen Moss leaves to cherish her life and legacy her husband Richard Fleischman, their four children, grandchildren and extended family and friends. We join them in honoring the life and service of an exceptional woman.                          ____________________
