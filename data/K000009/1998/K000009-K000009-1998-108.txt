Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lucas County Mental Health Board in Northwest Ohio. The year 1998 marks the 30th anniversary of the Lucas County Mental Health Board, and the agency is celebrating a commemorative event on September 9, 1998 to recognize the achievement.  The Lucas County Mental Health Board ably and effectively has served thousands of our most vulnerable citizens through three decades which have seen monumental change and a complete overhaul in the treatment of mental basis. Through it all, the Lucas County Mental Health Board has adapted, growing to meet the changing needs of its clients and their families. The agency administers sites throughout the county which handle the unique needs of children with mental illness, people with milder forms of illness, those who are most severely disabled, families, and people needing short term help to get them through the rough spots of their lives. Always, the people of the Lucas County Mental Health Board strive to provide these services remembering the dignity of those they counsel, providing both caring treatment and advocacy.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to salute the men and women, past and present, of the Lucas County Mental Health Board whose careers have been dedicated to lifting the stigma and the suffering of mental illness from so many. Their efforts and their victories large and small are commendable, and are truly making our community and the lives of its residents a better place. For their unsung efforts, we offer a grateful thank you.                          ____________________
