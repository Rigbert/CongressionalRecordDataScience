 President, I ask Senator Hollings, am I correct in my understanding that the Manager's Amendment to the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2002 includes an additional $4,000,000 for Washington State's share under the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund, raising the total for Washington State to $24,150,000 and the total for this account to $74,000,000?
