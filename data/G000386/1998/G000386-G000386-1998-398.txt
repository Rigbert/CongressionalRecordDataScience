 President, I have two different items that I want to visit with my colleagues about. No. 1 is on international trade, and the second one will be on the Massiah-Jackson nomination that is before the Senate.  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the submission of S. Con. Res. 74 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')                          ____________________
