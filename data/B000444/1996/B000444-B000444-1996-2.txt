  I must say, however, I am disappointed this bipartisan spirit has not allowed us to confirm seven judicial nominations remaining on the calendar--all well-qualified people who have had hearings and were reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee.  I think that we should stop, right now, and talk about what's going on here.  No one understands better than I the heat that can be generated over judges in an election year. But let me set the Record straight--absolutely straight: The Senate, under Democratic leadership, faithfully confirmed Republican Judges in Presidential election years.  All year, Republicans have been offering assurances that the Senate would continue this bipartisan approach and put judges through.  But today, it has become crystal clear that the bipartisan spirit of the past has been broken. And let's tell it like it is: My Republican colleagues have decided to grind confirmations to a halt as we head toward the coming Presidential election.  Currently, there are 63 vacancies on the Federal bench.  This year, the Judiciary Committee has held only 5 nominations hearings, and reported out only 23 nominees to fill these vacancies. We should have done more.  The Judicial Nominees who were fortunate enough to pass through the committee this session have been further held up here on the floor.  Not one judge was confirmed before July 10 this year and none have been confirmed since August 2.  As a result, the Senate has confirmed only 17 district judges and no circuit judges this session. Seven nominees are currently pending on the floor--three for the district courts and four for the circuit courts.  Some have suggested that shutting down the confirmation process is par for the course in an election year. They are wrong. And let me set the record straight.  George Bush made nearly one-third of his 253 judicial nominations in 1992, a Presidential election year. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held 15 nominations hearings that year, including 3 in July, 2 in August, and 1 in September.  In 1992--the last Presidential election year--the Senate continued to confirm judges through the waning days of the 102d Congress. We even confirmed seven judges on October 8--the last day of the second session.  As a result, the Senate confirmed all 66 nominees the Judiciary Committee reported out that year--55 for the District courts and 11 for the circuit courts. Let me repeat: This session, only 17 district judges have been confirmed and no circuit judges have been confirmed.  And let me say: 1992 was not an off year. To the contrary: It represented the Senate's practices over the last decade:  In 1988--an election year--we conformed 42 district and circuit court nominees, including 12 judges confirmed in October that year.  In 1984--an election year--we confirmed 43 nominees, including 13 judges in October.  And in 1980--an election year--we confirmed 64 nominees, including 10 judges on September 29.  Overall, during the past 16 years, since 1980, the Senate has confirmed an average of 51 nominees each year.  Overall, during the last 4 election years, the Senate has done even better, confirming an average of 54 nominees each year.  Let me repeat: our track record this session: The Senate has only confirmed 17 judges.  The Senate has been dragging its feet despite the undeniable fact that these judges are badly needed. The Federaltrial and appellate courts to which we confirm judges apply our Federal laws. Without a steady supply of judges, these courts cannot enforce our laws.  Right now, 12 of the Nation's 94 Federal judicial districts and 5 of the 12 circuit courts have judicial emergency vacancies--that's what the Judicial Conference of the United States calls vacancies that have existed for 18 months or more.  These emergency districts had an average of 635 criminal case filings in 1995--almost twice the national average of 355 filings. There average backlog of 4,153 cases exceeds the national average of 2,853 cases by 46 percent--1,300 cases.  The President has nominated judges for 15 of the 17 emergency courts. Three have received hearings and await a committee vote, three more are bottled up on the floor.  This is not the way we should be doing business here--and this is most certainly not business as usual as far as I'm concerned.  We should put a stop to the politics, and confirm these judges today.                          ____________________
