President, acting Commissioner Kautter's response is deeply troubling, for several reasons.  First, why did it take so long? Every bureaucracy has its problems, but almost 5 weeks, on a time-sensitive matter, the answer to which should be clear in 5 minutes? As I said on the Senate floor last week: ``It looks to me like the administration has a policy on their hands that they know is corrupt--that they know is undemocratic. And so they're playing hide the ball. Because the more the public hears about this dark money rule, the less they like it.''  Further, the argument Acting Commissioner Kautter makes in the letter is utter nonsense. In the first place, he mischaracterizes the CRA, in a way that would render the entire law unworkable. For over 20 years, here is how the CRA has worked: If the administration submits something to Congress under the CRA, that is that; it is subject to congressional review under the terms of the CRA. In the Senate, that means the clock starts, and the period for the consideration of a disapproval resolution begins. If, on the other hand, the administration does not submit a matter under the CRA, but a Senator or Representative believes that the matter nevertheless should be subject to the CRA, that Senator or Congressman can ask the Government Accountability Office to review whether the CRA applies. This has happened about 20 times since 1996. Congress has never required the GAO to opine on the applicability of the CRA to a rule formally submitted by an agency to the Congress for review under the CRA. In Acting Commissioner Kautter's letter, he fabricates out of whole cloth a new requirement for congressional review, which runs counter to precedent established over the past two decades.  Acting Commissioner Kautter takes the position that the administration's submission of the rule under the CRA is not dispositive. It is, instead, just a starting point, to, as he writes, ``allow[ ] Congress to consider whether a revenue procedure is subject to the CRA by requesting advice from GAO.'' This is unprecedented because all previous requests to GAO related to matters that had not been submitted under the CRA. It is inconsistent with the plain text of the CRA and with longstanding practice, in which we only resort to a GAO opinion for matters that have not already been submitted under the CRA. It also is completely unworkable because it would require GAO to review every rule submitted under the CRA, to confirm that it is indeed subject to the CRA. Said another way, it would require the Senate to look behind all 4,271 rules submitted by agencies to the Senate in this Congress under the CRA to determine if the CRA, in fact, applied. We cannot have ``do-overs'' here.  Second, Acting Commissioner Kautter's position is inconsistent with administration practice. In submitting the dark money rule to the Senate, the administration was not simply trying to be courteous and transparent, making sure the Senate was aware of the latest developments at the IRS. It was, instead, complying with the CRA, based on a determination that the rule was subject to the CRA.  This is reflected in the process established in the Internal Revenue Manual, IRM. One section of the IRM relates to ``Congressional Review of Rules.'' After describing the CRA general rule and three exceptions, the IRM says, ``Revenue rulings, revenue procedures, notices, and announcements that are rules under the [CRA] must be submitted for congressional review before they can become effective. Whether a revenue ruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement is considered arule subject to reporting is determined on a case-by-case basis. Ministerial revenue rulings and revenue procedures; notices and announcements relating to error corrections, personnel matters, or proposed rules; and press releases generally will not be considered rules under [the CRA].''  Thus, the IRS's own process requires the agency to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether a document issued by the IRS constitutes a rule for purpose of the CRA. The IRS in fact exercises judgment about whether to submit a revenue procedure as a rule under the CRA: As of September 10, the IRS had issued 45 revenue procedures in 2018, only 27 of which were submitted to the Senate. Specifically, in this case, on July 26, over the signature of the Chief of the IRS Publications and Regulations Branch, the IRS and the Treasury Department submitted, to Vice President Pence, as President of the Senate, a copy of Rev. Proc. 2018-38, entitled a Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act. The submission was docketed in the Senate as EC-6097, and it was referred to the Finance Committee.  Finally, even if the administration had not submitted the dark money rule under the CRA, there is no question the rule is subject to the CRA. The CRA applies to rules as defined under the Administrative Procedure Act, which states in relevant part that a rule is ``the whole or part of an agency statement of general . . . applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy,'' with three exceptions: rules of particular applicability; rules relating to agency management or personnel; and rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations of nonagency parties.  The dark money rule is clearly a statement of general applicability and future effect. The only real question, then, is whether it is subject to one of the exceptions, particularly the exception for ``rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice that [do] not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties.''  Here, it is clear that the rule has a substantial effect on nonagency parties. Under the provisions of IRC section 6103, State tax administrators may obtain from IRS tax-exempt donor information for State tax administration purposes. As a result of Rev. Proc. 2018-38, State tax administrators will no longer have the right to obtain donor information from the IRS, undermining States' ability to enforce tax-exempt rules on organizations operating within their borders. Further, as the Treasury Department clearly stated in a July 16 press release, Rev. Proc. 2018-38 will reduce the burden of disclosure and filing obligations of tax-exempt organizations because they no longer will be required to disclose the identifies of large donors. This is a big deal. It will significantly inhibit IRS enforcement efforts, and it will make it easier for dark money to continue to flood in. Indeed, that is why so many groups have been urging that the disclosure requirement be repealed.  As a final note, the IRS may argue that repeal of the disclosure rule is insignificant because the IRS doesn't systematically cross-check this data against other sources of tax information. This is a large part of the problem of IRS failing to enforce existing laws relating to political activity of tax-exempt organizations. To my mind, the IRS should be using this information in order to maintain the integrity of our tax-exempt rules and election laws. If, for example, an organization named Russian Oligarchs, LLC made large contributions to a tax-exempt organization, it seems to me that this is something the IRS should want to know. At a time when foreign actors are actively attempting to interfere in American elections, law enforcement, the IRS, and State tax administrators need to have visibility into the financial flows of political nonprofits. The argument that we should no longer collect this information because the IRS is failing to use the information to enforce the law gets things precisely backward.  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Tester and me as we work to overturn this outrageous dark money rule.                          ____________________
