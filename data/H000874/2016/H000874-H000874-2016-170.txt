 I am wondering whether or not our Members would expect, at some time in the future, to have such a bill presented for a vote on the floor so that the American people could see, as I understand the Speaker's premise being that he wants to lay out an agenda so that in this Presidential election, there will be alternatives.  My question to the whip is: Will this House be expecting to vote on an alternative, to consider an alternative with amendments perhaps made in order as well?  I yield to my friend from Louisiana.
