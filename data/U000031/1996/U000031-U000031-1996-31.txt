Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. William Sinclair. Please join me in congratulating Bill as he retires after spending almost two decades as the city manager of my hometown, St. Joseph, MI. For 18 great years he has dedicated his hard work and efforts into making St. Joseph a quality city and a great a place to call home.  Bill's career in public service reaches back to 1954 when began working as a surveyor and cartographer for the city of Detroit. His time in Detroit was interrupted for 2 years by a tour of duty in the U.S. Army. After spending a few more years in Detroit, Bill lent his engineering expertise to the cities of Birmingham and Rochester before calling the west side of the State his new home.  He has also been active in other aspects of the community. Bill has served on the Twin Cities Airport Board, the Harbor Authority, and has been a fixture in the Michigan Municipal League.  Over the past 18 years, local officials, city councils, businesses, and residents, alike, have all correctly sung the praises of this wonderful civic leader. He has been a fixture in our community and an integral part of its growth. His dedication, vision, and commitment has been an important ingredient in the rebirth of the twin cities area.  Mr. Speaker, I have been lucky enough to work with Bill Sinclair on many different occasions. Time and time again I have counted on Bill for his assistance, his advice and his abundant energy. I know that though Bill is officially retiring, looking out for the best interests of the people of the St. Joseph-Benton Harbor area will continue to be a major focal point in his life. Someone this dedicated simply could not have it any other way.  Mr. Speaker, please join with me on behalf of the people of Michigan's Sixth Congressional District in thanking Bill Sinclair for 18years of dedication to St. Joseph, MI. I wish him and his wife, Hilda, a long, healthy, and happy retirement. All the best, Bill, and thank you for all that you have done.                          ____________________
