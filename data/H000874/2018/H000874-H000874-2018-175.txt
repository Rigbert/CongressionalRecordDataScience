Speaker, I thank the Speaker, and I thank Mrs. Lowey.  Mr. Speaker, we brought this country from the brink of depression to a growing, robust economy with a stock market that has almost tripled by passing the National Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Not a single Republican voted for that, Mr. Speaker. Not one. I wonder how many will vote for this bill after they have said time after time, after time, after time: Read the bill; have 3 days' layover.  Actually, your 3-day rule is a 24-hour-and-2-second rule: the last second of the first day, 24 hours of the second day, and the first second of the third day. You put everybody in a quandary because this is a good product that the Appropriations Committee has delivered. It does good things for our country, both in terms of national security and in terms of domestic investment.  What a sad state of affairs. How dysfunctional this body has become. How marginalized has the Appropriations Committee, on which I was so proud to serve, has become. Rushing it through in just a matter of minutes. It is a sad day, Mr. Speaker.
