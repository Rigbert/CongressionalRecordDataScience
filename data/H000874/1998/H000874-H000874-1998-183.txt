Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee rose and said this is a bipartisan bill, and he is correct in that assertion, it is a bipartisan bill. Within the constraints of the funds available, the chairman and ranking member have tried to work a bill that responsibly allows the legislative branch of government to proceed and allows this body to maintain its responsibilities to its employees. I am sure the chairman and each of us that serves on this subcommittee, as well as our ranking member, could have made additions to this bill, had resources been available which we think would have enhanced this bill and given to the legislative branch a better ability to do its job; however, those constraints exist.  Mr. Speaker, I rise, however, expressing disappointment in this rule. Basically the rule is one that tries to facilitate the consideration of this bill. I had, however, offered an amendment which I did not offer in subcommittee, but which I wanted to offer on the floor. That amendment would have provided for the increased expenditures allocated to various committees, for reasons presumably not anticipated at the time, that this House passes a funding resolution out of the Committee on House Oversight, on which I also serve.  Mr. Speaker, this so-called emergency funding, very frankly, was included for the purposes of getting the House oversight's funding resolution below certain targets so that certain people on the floor of the House would vote for it on the contention that it was not more funding than occurred pursuant to their plan; which is simply to say it was a device to shift some $8 million out of the bill and to a fund that has been referred to as a slush fund, but suffice it to say a fund out of which nonanticipated expenditures for committees can be funded.  Let me first of all say that is a not an unreasonable effort; that is to say, to provide funding for unanticipated needs. In fact, we have a very legitimate example of this Congress acting in the fashion that I think is appropriate and that would be provided for by my amendment, had it been allowed, and that was before the Committee on Rules. A hearing was held on the funding of the special committee to oversee China, the so-called Cox-Dicks committee. The Committee on Rules had an extended hearing, adopted a rule, and made a proposal, and we adopted a resolution on the floor by vote of the Congress, by the House of Representatives. There is, Mr. Speaker, in my opinion no reason why that should not be done for every committee.  Now the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Wise) got up and was speaking about the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight's hearings. Frankly, they have come to us for a number of unanticipated expenditures. In fact, one of the subcommittees, I think the expenditure was not unanticipated at all; this is the Teamsters' investigation and labor investigation generally. It was, however, a way of getting some extra funding without having it adopted on the floor of the House. I think that was unfortunate.  My amendment, if allowed by this rule, would have simply provided not that there could not be funding but that the House of Representatives would have to vote on that. Now, frankly, colleagues who are now in the majority took over and said that they wanted to have business done in an open fashion, and we were going to live by the rules everybody else had to live by, and that we would take responsibility for those expenditures that we made, and frankly we were going to cut spending in the House of Representatives.  Lo and behold, they created a fund that now even the Committee on House Oversight does not have hearings on.                              {time}  1245  Because our chairman, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) says in fact this is a Speaker's decision. We just perform a ministerial function, which is to say we are a pass-through. So I tell my friends on both sides of the aisle, currently that $8 million is decided by one person.  Now, if that is the way you think this House ought to be run, if that is the way you think the taxpayers' money ought to be spent, so be it. But if you believe that the taxpayers' money, that we all talk so much about, ought to be appropriated and expended pursuant to a vote of the representatives of those people who pay those taxes, then I would suggest to you that you would defeat this rule and allow the amendment to go forward, which does not preclude the expenditure at all, but simply says that it must be voted on by all the Members of the House.  Is that such an unreasonable proposal? Is that such a divergence from regular order that the Committee on Rules would decide not to allow that, I think reasonable and common sense rule, to be considered by the House?  I regret that I must oppose this rule.
