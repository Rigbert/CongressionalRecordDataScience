Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's view. I share that view. We want to try to get this done. I am going to ask him about the week following.  I understand floor time is at a premium, but we are not going to meet, apparently, on Friday if we get the supplemental done in a timely fashion, so we are not going to be using that time.  My only point is that if we do not know until Monday at noontime or Monday at 10 o'clock, it makes it more difficult for us. Frankly, I think it would be appropriate if the gentleman could perhaps agree that this will be on Tuesday, because he is not sure it is going to get over on Monday. I think that puts us in a little better shape.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, we will inform the leadership of the minority as soon as we know. We are urging the other body to move quickly, and we will keep the leadership of the minority informed at every step of this process so their side will have plenty of notice. Hopefully, we will have this decision done by tomorrow, and the gentleman will have plenty of time to do his planning.
