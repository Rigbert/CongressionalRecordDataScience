President, I am very happy to join with Senator McConnell, who is chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee of the Senate Agriculture Committee, in introducing this bill to permit the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer up to $2 million of additional funding to the WIC Farmers' Market Program upon consultation with the Appropriations Committees of the other body and of the Senate.  This program was funded up to $6.75 million in this year's appropriations bill. We greatly appreciate that the appropriations committees were able to provide that funding.  We are advised by the Department of Agriculture that because of the way the language is technically worded that USDA cannot reprogram additional funds into that WIC Farmers' Market Program. As it turns out some states need additional funding as my colleague Senator McConnell points out in his floor statement and that a few States need funding to set up a WIC Farmers' Market Program.  We recognize that we will need the support of all Senators to pass this bill at this stage. This bill does not mandate the spending of additional funds,it simply permits USDA to transfer up to $2 million to this program if the Secretary determines that such transfer is a good idea. We assume they will fully consult with the appropriate members of the Appropriations Committees to assure that this is done in a manner that is satisfactory to them.  It is important to us that this consultation take place.  The WIC Farmers' Market Program provides vouchers to low-income families who are on the WIC program. They can use the vouchers to buy fresh fruits and vegetables or other farm products at farmers' markets. The authorizing law, passed without objection in the Senate, mandates that States contribute a significant share of the cost of the program. It thus leverages Federal money with State and local funding to provide farm products to children and their parents on the WIC program.  This program has been an incentive in my home State of Vermont for farmers to work together and set up additional farmers' markets. This has been good for local communities, for the farmers selling their products and for families on the WIC program.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2155       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO FARMERS' MARKET                    NUTRITION PROGRAM.       For fiscal year 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture may      transfer after consultation with the appropriations      committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate,      from any funds available to the Secretary, up to $2,000,000      to the farmers' market nutrition program under section 17(m)      of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786(m)).      Amounts authorized to be transferred under the preceding      sentence shall be in addition to any amounts authorized to be      made available to the program under title IV of the      Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,      and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997 (110 Stat.      1590).  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today along with my colleague Senator Leahy, we are introducing legislation that will permit the Secretary of Agriculture authority to transfer funds to the WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.  The WIC Farmers' Market Nutrition Program [FMNP] has become a very successful program in assisting low-income families, farmers, and local economies.  A total of 28 States and three Indian tribal organizations now participate in the FMNP. Because of the limitation on funding, several States, including Kentucky, have been restricted in the size of the program that they can offer. Several States would like the opportunity to expand this program based on their experience and feedback from farmers that participate.  For a State to have a FMNP requires the filing of an application in the fall with USDA, a commitment that the State will match 30 percent of the total Federal funds with either cash or in-kind services and support.  The benefits of FMNP are significant. WIC participants enhance the nutrition in their diet from of fresh fruits and vegetables. In fiscal year 1995 the FMNP served nearly 1 million low-income mothers and children participating in the WIC program. As a result of the FMNP: 71 percent of the WIC participants ate more fresh fruits and vegetables; 40 percent tried fruits and vegetables they had never eaten before; 48 percent spent cash and/or food stamps in addition to their FNMP coupons; 66 percent plan to continue shopping at farmers markets and; 72 percent plan to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables year round.  Farmers' incomes will increase because of the new market for their products. A survey of participants in 1995 revealed that: 84 percent of farmers increased their sales; 23 percent increased their fruit and vegetable production; 36 percent grew additional types of fruits and vegetables and; 37 percent said they would increase their production in 1996.  The Kentucky Farm Bureau has initiated a new program to boost sales of Kentucky farm products involving 25 roadside farm markets. Studies confirm that consumers prefer to buy locally-grown produce.  This is another example of organizations and State agencies working together to provide a service to consumers, it introduces fresh fruit and vegetables that are locally grown, and it enhances farmer income.  Mr. President, this is a good bill that benefits everyone and I hope we are able to pass this important legislation before we adjourn.
