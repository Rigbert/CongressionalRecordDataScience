Leader. That was going to be my question. Does the gentleman expect both the energy conference report and the Medicare conference report, the prescription drug report, to be on the floor next week?  Mr. DeLAY. Well, if the gentleman will yield further, we still hope to finish both of these bills before we complete the first session. There have been various discussions between both bodies, even though these discussions have not been formal in nature. At this point, I just cannot give a specific time frame for when these discussions will produce a recommendation for the conferees to consider and when the House would consider these final conference reports.  There are very difficult discussions going on. We had hoped that we could vote on these two bills next week, but just the physical writing of the bill on Medicare would take 8 to 10 days. So that is why I say Members should not make pre-Thanksgiving plans.
