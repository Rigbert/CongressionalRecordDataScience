Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that observation, and I would hope we do follow that practice. Because, clearly, while the budget document, in particular for those of us who serve on the Committee on Appropriations, is a relatively broad-brush document, it does very pointedly speak to the priorities that Members have and that we think our country ought to have. Because of that, it becomes even more important, I think, in the people's House that the people's representatives have an opportunity to offer alternatives so that not only Members, but the American public can form a judgment of their own as to what alternative is in the best interest of our country.  So I appreciate the gentleman's observation that full substitutes, and usually, as you know, that is what we have been offering, and certainly it is the intention of the gentleman from South Carolina, as the ranking member, to offer a substitute. Of course we do not know what ultimately is going to happen, we will have to see what the Committee on the Budget produces, but I am sure that the gentleman from South Carolina will want to offer a substitute.  The gentleman mentioned enforcement mechanisms. The Senate, as you know, the other body, has adopted an enforcement mechanism, which we think if you are going to have an enforcement mechanism makes sense.  First of all, does the gentleman know whether the enforcement mechanism will be in a separate piece or legislation included in the budget offering itself?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.
