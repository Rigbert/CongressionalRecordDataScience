 I said all I want to say. I sincerely mean what I said about let's decide whether we are going to have this system or not.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Delaware. I will just take a few minutes, I say to my dear friend from Delaware. I just want to point out I don't think the decision necessarily has to be to shut it down or to fund it. I think it is to reform the system.  The Senator from New York just came on and talked about how the general funds subsidize aviation. The fact is that $3.08 over the last 5 years has come out of the general fund per passenger. Compare that with the Sunset Limited, which is $347 per passenger; the Texas Eagle, which is $258 per passenger; the Pennsylvanian, which is $292 per passenger; the Lake County Limited, which has been canceled--$1,200 per passenger.  The fact is that most of the funding for highways and for air service in America comes out of user fees. It comes out of trust funds that are funded by user fees. And we just laid a whole lot more on the airlines in the interest of aviation safety.  But the fact is that if it is going to cost $347 per passenger, then the Senator from Delaware is right: You either shut it down or you tell the American people that we are going to fund the Sunset Limited for $347 per passenger forever. Or we are going to tell the American people that we are going to fund the Northeast corridor, we are going to fund the Far West and other places in the country where it is economically viable and, in many cases, as the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Vermont have pointed out, vital to have that service.  The problem with Amtrak has not been in the Northeast, although the mismanagement--I am sorry you were not here while we talked about Acela and those incredible failures.
