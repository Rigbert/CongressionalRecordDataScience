 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an individual who worked tirelessly to strengthen Kentucky's economy through his contributions to the coal and the banking industries. James Lawrence ``Jim'' Rose of Lexington, KY, passed away on December 19, 2011. He was 73 years old. Although Mr. Lawrence may not be with us today, the legacy he has forged throughout his lifetime will carry on for many years to come.  Jim Lawrence was born in Clay County, KY, but received his education in the small town of Berea, where he graduated from the Berea Foundation High School and Berea College before completing his education at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. Jim was passionate about education and made it a priority for himself, and he set out to make it one for the youth of the Commonwealth as well. He was in large part responsible for the project to construct Lexington Christian Academy's 75-acre ``Rose Campus'' in Lexington, KY.  Although Mr. Rose was involved in all sorts of different business aspects, his most noted business accomplishments were those in the banking and coal industries. Mr. Rose returned to Clay County and started a small coal company in 1959. Over the next three decades, his business would receive numerous national awards for conducting the best mining rescues and operating the safest mines in the United States, and the company would eventually grow to be one of the top three producers of coal in the State of Kentucky upon his retirement in 1993.  Mr. Rose made tremendous strides in the world of banking as well. He formed a bank holding company in his hometown of Manchester, KY; the town served as the site where Jim would also open his first bank in 1978. He went on to open seven more banks throughout central and southern Kentucky. Mr. Rose was an exceptional consultant and manager, and under him the many banks he had acquired flourished.  We are all undoubtedly aware that Mr. Rose made a permanent mark on the economy of Kentucky, but let us not forget today that Jim was first and foremost a devout man of God and a beloved family man. Mr. Rose was a husband and a father who is survived by his wife of 49 years, Judy Sizemore Rose, and by his son James F. Rose and by his daughter Sonya Rose Hiler. Jim also leaves behind eight grandchildren and three step-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Dwayne Scott Rose.  The legacy left by Mr. Rose is one that will not be easily forgotten. He was able to give so much to the business world, working tirelessly for the people of Kentucky, and he was also able to pour his heart into building relationships with his employees and his family members. Mr. Rose led a life that one could be nothing but proud of.  I would like to ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in commemorating the life and works of Mr. James Lawrence Rose, an innovative, committed and truly genuine entrepreneur.  There was an article recently printed in the Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo on the accomplished life of Mr. James Lawrence ``Jim'' Rose. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel Echo, Dec. 23, 2011]                 Bank, Coal Company Founder Dies at 73                            (By Carol Mills)       James ``Jim'' Rose, 73, died Monday of complications from a      heart attack in Lexington.       Rose, who moved to Lexington in 1988, was a former Laurel      Countian. He began his career by starting a small coal      company in 1959 in Clay County where he was born. He moved      his family to Laurel County in 1975.       Over three decades he grew his coal business dramatically,      founding Interstate Coal Company, which had several      operations in eastern Kentucky, including one in Laurel      County on Ky. 192 where College Park is now. The coal stacks      are still on the property, which is owned by the city and the      county. Rose retired from the coal business in 1993.       While Rose was still in the coal business, he entered the      banking business by buying a bank in his hometown of      Manchester in 1978. He formed a bank holding company, United      Bancorp of Kentucky, and acquired seven additional banks in      London (London Bank & Trust, now PNC), Danville,      Nicholasville, Richmond, Versailles, Corbin, and Harlan.      United Bancorp merged with National City in 1995.       Lawrence Kuhl went to work for Rose at the London Bank &      Trust in 1983 as vice-president and two years later as      president.       ``He was an outstanding person,'' Kuhl said. ``He was so      compassionate for humanity. He loved to help people in need.      He hired a number of people throughout southeastern Kentucky      to work in his coal mines as well as in his banks, and he was      a very, very caring person. He helped a lot of individuals.      His whole family is like that. He has given Cardinal Hill      millions of dollars to help recuperate people. He was a super      fellow, very intelligent, a good businessman.''       Charles Elza worked for Rose as president of London Bank &      Trust for seven years from 1978 to 1985 before Kuhl took the      helm.       ``He was a great guy, a hard worker,'' Elza said. ``He was      a great family man. He loved his kids. He and his wife really      had a heart for people who had a hard time. He worked hard.      Before he made a lot of money, I heard     he would go to work in the coal business Monday morning and      wouldn't come home until Friday. He would sleep on the job.      He provided a lot of jobs for people.       ``I was in the coal business, too, before working at the      bank,'' Elza recalled. ``My brother and I sold coal to      Interstate Coal Company, which he (Rose) owned.''       Dr. Paul Smith and his wife, Ann, have been friends with      Rose ever since he moved his family to London from      Manchester.       ``We got acquainted through our children,'' Ann Smith said.      ``They were all in the band, some played sports. We went to      what our children did and they went to what their children      did and we just got together. We had the same values in      rearing our family.       ``Mr. Rose was a wonderful man,'' she added. ``He was      absolutely a good man. He was a hard worker, he was always      helping someone out, and he walked the talk. He was nice, and      so is Judy (wife). They're both very talented musicians. Jim      was a classical pianist, just as well as playing boogie,      woogie. They're just a wonderful family. Jim was a good      person to work for. He was very well liked by his workers. He      was very fair and just.''       Rose was a graduate of Berea Foundation High School and      attended Berea College and the University of Kentucky. He      served in leadership positions in numerous coal and banking      organizations. He was also active in civic and charitable      organizations such as the Scott Rose Foundation, which was      formed in memory of his son, Dwayne Scott, who was killed in      an automobile crash in Richmond. The foundation helps      mentally and physically handicapped people. Rose also started      the Scott Rose Games in honor of his late son. The games,      which helped raise money for charity, ran its course after      several years and was discontinued.       Rose had served on the boards of UK., Centre College, Lees      College, and the U.K. Medical Center, and was a founding      member of Kentucky Educational Television (KET).       He leaves his wife Judy Sizemore Rose, a son James      ``Jamie'' Rose, a daughter Sonya Rose Hiler, eight      grandchildren, and three step-grandchildren.       Services were Thursday at the Lexington Christian Academy      chapel and a private burial will follow at a later date at      A.R. Dyche Memorial Park in London.                          ____________________
