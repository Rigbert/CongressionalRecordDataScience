President, the current version of class action legislation has undergone a number of changes since it was reported by the Judiciary Committee. Some of these changes have been improvements. I want to note that. Some have not. I know that Senators Dodd, Landrieu, Schumer, Kohl, and Carper negotiated some procedural improvements to S. 1751. I believe these do help. I appreciate their efforts to rein in some of the worst aspects of the bill.  For example, these improvements restricted the use of worthless coupon settlements. I agree with that. To hear some of the commentators about this bill, you would think that was not in there, but I want everybody to know it is. They also eliminated some provisions that were harmful to civil rights and consumer plaintiffs who endure hardships as a result of initiating and pursuing litigation.  But in other aspects, the compromise failed to achieve their intended goals. For example, one provision seeks to reduce the delay plaintiffs can experience when a case is removed to Federal court. It sets a time limit for appeals and remand orders. But there is not a concomitant measure that would set a timeline for the district court to rule on the actual remand motion.  This may seem like a bit of arcane lawyer's jargon, but it is a lot more than that. It means that you could be a plaintiff, be in State court legitimately. You suddenly get plucked out of State court. But then they could put you on the Federal docket. Somebody could say, OK, we are just going to leave it there year after year after year after year, and there is nothing you could do about it. There is no recourse. I understand that Senator Feingold will offer an amendment to set a reasonable time limit for the district court to rule on these remand orders. It seems like common sense. Rule them up or rule them down, but have a time to do it. I hope all Senators will support him.  In addition, I am disturbed the bill may deny justice to consumers and others in class actions involving multiple State laws. The recent trend in the Federal courts is to not certify class actions if multiple State laws are involved; thus, the class action bill could force nationwide class actions into Federal court and then just be dismissed for involving too many State laws. It is kind of a way of making sure that you never reach the merits of thecase, whether in Federal courts or State courts, because you could get rid of it on a technicality. I understand Senator Bingaman has an amendment to prevent this from happening. I would support that.  I am also concerned with provisions contained in the most recent iteration of this class action bill before the Senate. I try to keep up with it, but it keeps undergoing so many changes. But this latest part would deprive Vermonters of the right to band together to protect themselves against violations of State civil rights, consumer, health, and environmental protection laws in their own State courts. What it is saying is, we here in the Senate can make a far better judgment than the people of Vermont going into State courts on State matters or the people of Tennessee going into Tennessee court on a Tennessee matter.  I hear so many speeches about how we have to protect our States and keep the heavy hand of government from them, but basically we are saying that if a group of people, say, in Iowa, want to band together to protect themselves against a violation of State civil rights or consumer or health or environmental protection laws, and do it just in their own State courts, they can't do it because the U.S. Senate has figured we know a lot better than the people of Iowa or Tennessee or Vermont.  This bill continues to deprive citizens of the right to sue on State law claims in their own State courts if the principal defendant is a citizen of another State, even if that defendant has a substantial presence in the plaintiff's home State and even if the harm done was in the plaintiff's home State. In other words, you might have somebody from State A, but they have invested a huge amount in the second State. They are involved in things in that second State. They do something in that second State. They may deprive citizens of their rights in that second State, and they can't sue in that State. I understand that Senator Breaux intends to offer an amendment to keep these in-State class actions in State courts. They should be.  I am also troubled by the scope of the legislation in that it federalizes a lot more than class actions. This goes way beyond class actions. Despite the fact that such a provision was struck from the bill during markup in the Judiciary Committee, mass torts now again are included in the bill. This expansion simply amplifies the harm done to citizens' rights and to the possibility of vindicating those rights in their own State courts.  Some special interest groups are distorting the state of class action litigation by relying on a few anecdotes in an ends-oriented attempt to impede plaintiffs bringing class action cases. It will make a lot of money in radio and TV stations. The ads are designed to actually be seen or heard only by 535 people--Members of Congress.  I think we should take steps to correct actual problems in class action litigation where they occur. But simply shoving most suits into Federal court will not correct the real problems faced by plaintiffs and defendants. We have done something like this by taking a whole lot of criminal matters that should easily be handled in State courts and put them into the Federal courts, and the Federal courts are so overloaded they don't get to either the criminal or civil cases.  Our State-based tort system has grown over 200 years. It remains one of the greatest and most powerful vehicles for justice anywhere in the world. One reason for that is the availability of class action litigation to let ordinary people band together to take on powerful corporations or, in some cases, even their own Government. Nobody has the money by themselves to take on the Government. Nobody has the money by themselves to take on some multibillion-dollar corporation. Banding together, sometimes they can.  Defrauded investors, deceived consumers, victims of defective products, environmental torts, and thousands of other people are currently able to access class action lawsuits in their State court system to seek and receive justice. They can band together to afford a competent lawyer. Whether they are getting together to force manufacturers to recall products or to clean up after devastating environmental harm or to vindicate basic civil rights, they are using class action. We should not try to make it more difficult or costly for them to right those wrongs, although many people who cause the wrongs would love us to put roadblocks in the way.  So the so-called Class Action Fairness Act falls short in the expectation set by its title. It is going to leave many injured parties who have valid claims with no way to seek relief. Class action suits have enabled our citizens to receive justice and expose wrongdoing by corporations and their own Government. It has given the average American a local venue and a chance.  This legislation may be the last authorization bill the Senate considers this year. We have only passed one appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year. The Senate has so few days left. Can you imagine that? There are 14 appropriations bills and we have only passed 1. We have not passed a budget yet. I think that is supposed to be done in March or April. We are not going to do our appropriations bills. Everybody knows that. Someone will write a huge omnibus bill with the White House and try to cram it through. So I think because this is the last authorization bill, you are going to have Senators on both sides of the aisle with both germane and nongermane amendments.  So we will vote and see where we go. There were improvements made. We showed we could make improvements. But as soon as it started really being improved, the doors got slammed shut.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter on behalf of the attorneys general of California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West Virginia in opposition to S. 2062 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                State of New York,                               Office of the Attorney General,                                        Albany, NY, June 22, 2004.     Hon. Bill Frist,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Minority Leader: On behalf      of the Attorneys General of California, Illinois, Iowa,      Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New      Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West Virginia, we      are writing in opposition to S. 2062, the so-called ``Class      Action Fairness Act,'' which reportedly will be scheduled for      a vote in the next few weeks. Although S. 2062 has been      improved in some ways over similar legislation considered      last year (S. 274), it still unduly limits the right of      individuals to seek redress for corporate wrongdoing in their      state courts. We therefore strongly recommend that this      legislation not be enacted in its present form.       As you know, under S. 2062, almost all class actions      brought by private individuals in state court based on state      law claims would be forced into federal court, and for the      reasons set forth below many of these cases may not be able      to continue as class actions. All Attorneys General      aggressively prosecute violations of our states' laws through      public enforcement actions filed in state court. Particularly      in these times of state fiscal constraints, class actions      provide an important ``private attorney general'' supplement      to our efforts to obtain redress for violations of state      consumer protection, civil rights, labor, public health and      environmental laws.       We recognize that some class action lawsuits in state and      federal courts have resulted in substantial attorneys' fees      but minimal benefits to the class members, and we support      targeted efforts to prevent such abuses and preserve the      integrity of the class action mechanism. However, S. 2062      fundamentally alters the basic principles of federalism, and      if enacted would result in far greater harm than good. It      therefore is not surprising that organizations such as AARP,      AFL-CIO, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union,      Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP and Public      Citizen all oppose this legislation in its present form.       1. Class Actions Should Not Be ``Federalized''       S. 2062 would vastly expand federal diversity jurisdiction,      and thereby would result in most class actions being filed in      or removed to federal court. This transfer of jurisdiction in      cases raising questions of state law will inappropriately      usurp the primary role of state courts in developing their      own state tort and contract laws, and will impair their      ability to establish consistent interpretations of those      laws. There is no compelling need for such a sweeping change      in our long-established system for adjudicating state law      issues. Indeed, by transferring most state court class      actions to an already overburdened federal court system, this      bill will delay (if not deny) justice to substantial numbers      of injured citizens. The federal judiciary faces a serious      challenge in managing     its current caseload, and thus it is no surprise that the      Judicial Conference of the United States has opposed the      ``federalization'' of class action litigation.       S. 2062 is fundamentally flawed because under this      legislation, most class actions brought against a defendant      who is not a ``citizen'' of the state will be removed to      federal court, no matter how substantial a presence the      defendant has in the state or how much harm the defendant has      caused in the state. While the amendments made last fall give      the federal judge discretion to decline jurisdiction in some      cases if more than one-third of the plaintiffs are from the      same state, and place additional limitations on the exercise      of federal court jurisdiction if more than two-thirds of the      plaintiffs are from a single state, even in those      circumstances there are additional hurdles that frequently      will prevent the case from being heard in state court.       2. Many Multi-State Class Actions Cannot Be Brought in      Federal Court       Another significant problem with S. 2062 is that many      federal courts have refused to certify multi-state class      actions because the court would be required to apply the law      of different jurisdictions to different plaintiffs--even if      the laws of those jurisdictions are very similar. Thus, cases      commenced as state class actions and them removed to federal      court may not be able to be continued as class actions in      federal court.       In theory, injured plaintiffs in each state could bring a      separate class action lawsuit in federal court, but that      defeats one of the main purposes of class actions, which is      to conserve judicial resources. Moreover, while the      population of some states may be large enough to warrant a      separate class action involving only residents of those      states, it is very unlikely that similar lawsuits will be      brought on behalf of the residents of many smaller states. We      understand that Senator Jeff Bingaman will be proposing an      amendment to address this problem, and that amendment should      be adopted.       3. Civil Rights and Labor Cases Should be Exempted       Proponents of S. 2062 point to allegedly ``collusive''      consumer class action settlements in which plaintiffs'      attorneys received substantial fee awards, while the class      members merely received ``coupons'' towards the purchase of      other goods sold by defendants. If so, then this ``reform''      should apply only to consumer class actions. Class action      treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for      adjudicating the claims of low-wage workers and victims of      discrimination, and there is no apparent need to place      limitations on these types of actions. Senator Kennedy      reportedly will offer an amendment on this issue, which also      should be adopted.       4. The Notification Provisions Are Misguided       S. 2062 requires that federal and state regulators be      notified of proposed class action settlements, and be      provided with copies of the complaint, class notice, proposed      settlement and other materials. Apparently this provision is      intended to protect against ``collusive'' settlements between      defendants and plaintiffs' counsel, but those materials would      be unlikely to reveal evidence of collusion, and thus would      provide little or no basis for objecting to the settlement.      In addition, class members could be misled into believing      that their interests are being protected by their government      representatives, simply because the notice was sent to the      Attorney General of the United States and other federal and      state regulators.       Equal access to the American system of justice is a      foundation of our democracy. S. 2062 would effect a sweeping      reordering of our nation's system of justice that will      disenfranchise individual citizens from obtaining redress for      harm, and thereby impede efforts against egregious corporate      wrongdoing. Although the Attorneys General of California,      Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota,      Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Vermont, and West      Virginia oppose S. 2062 in its present form, we fully support      the goal of preventing abusive class action settlements, and      would be willing to provide assistance in your effort to      implement necessary reforms while maintaining our federal      system of justice and safeguarding the interests of the      public.           Sincerely,     Eliot Spitzer,       Attorney General of the State of New York.     W.A. Drew Edmondson,       Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma.
