The statement made on the floor by Senator Hatch and others that this has never been done or only been leaked--he used that term this morning--is not a fact.  I concede the point made by my colleague that they do draw a line. The Department of Justice said no to everything, but they did disclose the information I just described when it came to Robert Bork. At this moment in time I don't think this Department of Justice has even entered into an honest conversation with the Senate Judiciary Committee members about whether that line can be drawn. They have said categorically that they are not going to allow anything to be produced.  That is why we are at this impasse. It is troublesome to have a nominee with great credentials, a great resume, a good paying job as an attorney in the District of Columbia. He has not served as a judge so he does not have written opinions. We are trying to get to the heart of the matter. What are his values? Is he conservative or something else?
