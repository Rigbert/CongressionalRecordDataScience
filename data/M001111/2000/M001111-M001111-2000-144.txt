 President, I congratulate the Senator from Maine also for working on this issue.  My amendment, I think, fixes one problem with which many of us were concerned. However, regarding the title I portability funds in the bill, I am reading the language of the bill on page 127. It says:       Subparagraph (b): Provided by the schools directly or      through the provision of supplemental education services with      any governmental or nongovernmental agency, school, post-     secondary educational institution, or other entity, including      a private organization or business.  The language in the bill allows title I portability funds to go to a public or private school.  In committee, we asked if it could go to a private school. We didn't use the word ``vouchers.'' We said: Could this portability money go to a private school? The answer is yes. That is what the language does. The amendment before us fixes the Straight A's question, but it does not fix title I portability.
