Chair, I oppose the gentleman's amendment. It is just one more instance where the majority is saddling the consumer with ever-increasing energy bills. We know how the standards have really saved consumers money over the years. I have some figures here that are very interesting.  A typical household saves about $216 a year off their energy bills now as a result of renewed standards. As people replace their appliances with newer models, they can expect to save more than $453 annually by 2030. The cumulative utility bill savings to consumers from all standards in effect since 1987 are estimated to be nearly $1 trillion by 2020 and grow to nearly $2 trillion through 2030.  Invention does matter. And the application of that to our daily life really matters. The efficiency standards have spurred innovation that dramatically expanded options for consumers. It is time to choose common sense over rigid ideology, and it is time to listen to the manufacturing companies, consumer groups, and efficiency advocates, who all agree this rider is harmful.  I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on the Buck amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
