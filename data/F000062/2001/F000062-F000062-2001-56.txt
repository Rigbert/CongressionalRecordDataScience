 President, once again, I thank the ranking member for her cooperation, and I thank the staff.  I want to have printed in the Record a letter from the Department of the Navy specifically on the subject of the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard cleanup. There have been real problems in this cleanup which has been characterized by delay and the inability to move forward. One major event was a toxic fire underground that burned undetected for 2 weeks before it was put out. I think the Navy understands certainly my depth of feeling, and I think it is supported by the ranking member, that they move expeditiously to clean up this base. This letter states their determination to do so.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Department of the Navy,                              Assistant Secretary of the Navy,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Construction, Committee on          Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairman: I am writing in response to your      queries regarding the Department of the Navy's environmental      clean-up program at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard.       The Navy fully shares your commitment to completing the      environmental remediation of the former Hunters Point Naval      Shipyard. While progress on the remediation efforts may have      been inadequate in the past, I can assure you that the Navy      is committed to fully funding the cleanup of Hunters Point,      and to moving expeditiously to complete this top priority      project on schedule.       With help from your Committee, the Navy is prepared to      execute the total projected FY 2002 program of $50.6 million      at Hunters Point. Deputy Assistant Secretary Holaday has been      meeting with your staff on this issue, and is working with      other congressional committee staff to ensure they understand      the importance the Department places on receiving full      funding for Hunters Point.       I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this issue      more fully. I look forward to working closely with you and      with the local community to successfully complete the      environmental remediation and property transfer at Hunters      Point.                                                     H.T. Johnson.                           Amendment No. 1692
