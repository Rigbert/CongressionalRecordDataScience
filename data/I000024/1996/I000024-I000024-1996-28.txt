President, I had intended to offer an amendment regarding the Federal Aviation Administration's [FAA] emergency revocation powers; however, after conferring with the chairman and ranking member I have withdrawn my amendment because they have agreed to work with me on this issue in the 105th Congress.  Aviation safety not only requires consistent diligence, but also balance. It is balance that my amendment sought to achieve between the rights of the airmen to use their certificates and the need for the FAA to immediately revoke the certificates of unsafe operators. Over the past several years we have witnessed a sharp increase in the number of emergency revocations. In an revocation action, brought on an emergency basis, the airman or other certificate holder loses the use of the certificate immediately, without an intermediary review by an impartial third party. The result is that the airman is grounded and in most cases out of work until the issue is adjudicated.  My amendment would have established a procedure whereby the airman could request a hearing before the NTSB Board on an expedited basis to determine if a true emergency existed and therefore justified the immediate revocation of the airman's certificate. If the NTSB decided no emergency existed, then the airman could have use of his certificate while the FAA pursued their case against the airman. If the NTSB decided an emergency existed then the revocation would remain in effect until the case could be fully adjudicated.  Given the chairman's assurances of his willingness to work with me on this issue in the 105th Congress, I have withdrawn my amendment and look forward to working him and the ranking member to address this problem.
