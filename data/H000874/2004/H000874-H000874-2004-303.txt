Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  As the gentleman knows, I would hope the Speaker would go into these discussions with the President armed with the fact that well over two-thirds of the House voted for this bill and, therefore, a very strong sentiment that this bill is the appropriate level of funding. And, in fact, I think the Senate level probably would have passed with a pretty healthy majority as well on this floor.  In any event, I am hopeful that when the Speaker determines how he wants to proceed and appoints conferees, I would certainly hope that all of the conferees will be included in the meetings of the conference to discuss the resolution of the differences between the bodies and the shape and levels of the conference report that would be reported back to the House.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield.
