 President, in response to the leader's suggestion that Senator Hatch and I go off, I am always happy to go off with Senator Hatch. What I would like to suggest is that in the meantime we move on an amendment that the President wants in this bill, the wiretap amendment, while he and I are off. We can continue to make progress. I just think we should debate it in case we do not even get close.
