This exceptional group of heroes consists ofChet Newsome, of Lowell, Indiana, and John and Mark Thanos, both of Chesterton, Indiana, whose bravery and self-sacrifice are an inspiration to us all.   On Saturday, August 9, 2008, at 5:30 a.m., Chet Newsome, a local truck driver, was awakened by the sound of what he has described as a blood-curdling scream from one of his neighbors. After hurrying outside to see what was happening, Chet saw his neighbor's garage engulfed in flames. He could hear the screams of two men who were trapped inside, so Chet ran to his garage for his ax, and without hesitation, began to hammer away at the door. After breaking through the door, Chet could see that one of the men was able to escape through a side door, but the other man remained trapped inside. Again, without hesitation and without thinking of himself, Chet reached in and was able to grip the severely burned man's belt and pull him to safety. Without Chet's quick thinking and immediate action, the outcome of this tragic event would have seen a very different outcome. For his bravery, the town of Lowell and the entire First Congressional District owe Chet Newsome their respect and gratitude.   On Sunday, September 14, 2008, at approximately 10:30 a.m., John and Mark Thanos were alerted by screams in their neighborhood. They soon learned that two young boys had fallen into a nearby ditch that had filled with rain. By the time they arrived, one of the boys had managed to escape the waters, but the other was being pulled into a culvert under the street. In a truly selfless act, Mark, an English teacher for the last 20 at Wheeler High School, and his father, John, a retired custodian who worked for many years for the Merrillville Community School Corporation, realized something needed to be done. They plunged into the ditch to save the 10-year-old boy, but the waters were too strong. While the boy was rescued, neither John nor Mark survived the ordeal. To those who knew John and Mark Thanos, it was no surprise that when called upon in such a horrific situation, they would answer without hesitation and would put the safety of others ahead of themselves. There is no greater sacrifice than to give one's life to save another, and John and Mark Thanos made the ultimate sacrifice to save the life of a child. For their heroism, they are to be forever remembered by the people of northwest Indiana and beyond.   These real-life heroes represent true courage and bravery, and they are the greatest example of the valor and strength of our country and its citizens.   Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending and acknowledging these outstanding heroes of northwest Indiana. Their bravery while putting aside personal safety to ensure the safety of others is worthy of the highest honor and respect. I am grateful and am truly honored to recognize these astonishing individuals and their remarkable acts of heroism.                          ____________________
