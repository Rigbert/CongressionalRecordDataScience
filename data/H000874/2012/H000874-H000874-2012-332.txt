Speaker, I don't know whether you were able to hear that response. As Gabby looked with that extraordinary smile, the twinkle in her eyes, she said to me and to all of us, ``I miss you.'' Do any of us doubt that that is the case?  Pia, we are blessed in this House to be served by extraordinary people, of which you are a perfect example, by people who love us but love their country even more, who serve our constituents so extraordinarily well, who evidence every day care for us and care for the work that we do, which we could not do, Pia, without people like yourself and all of your colleagues that we call staff. Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, God has blessed Gabrielle Giffords, and he has sent a blessing to all of us in the person of Gabrielle Giffords. And God blessed Gabby as well with an extraordinary mom and dad and an extraordinary partner in life.  Mark, we owe you a debt of gratitude. Our country owes you a debt of gratitude. I look forward to the day when you and Gabby will be returning here, returned to full health and full ability to serve.  Gabby, America thanks you. It thanks you for the example that you have given of overcoming adversity, and doing so with a spirit unparalleled. God bless you and Godspeed.
