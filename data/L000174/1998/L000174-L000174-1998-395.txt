President, I rise today to commend the Vietnam Veterans of America for 20 years of service to veterans and their communities. In particular, I want to recognize the first chapter of the VVA, which was founded in Rutland, Vermont.  If we remember back to the late 1970s, our nation was dealing with the aftermath of a war in which more than 58,000 Americans lost their lives and 2.8 million veterans had served. Many of those veterans were struggling with physical, emotional, and social problems directly related to their service in Vietnam.  Those problems were worsened by the attitude of many Americans who could not separate their opposition to the war from their treatment of our soldiers who had fought it. It was in that spirit that a group of Vietnam veterans from Vermont approached a resourceful young veteran named Bobby Muller. I am proud to say that Bobby Muller has become a close friend of mine and in fact was in Vermont with me just last week. The Vermonters, led by Donny Beaudette and Jake Jacobsen, founded the first chapter of what is now the Vietnam Veterans of America. I remember it well. They were soon joined by other Vermonters like Clark Howland, Mike Dodge, John Bergeron, and others. Together, Chapter One made it their mission to be there for Vermont Vietnam veterans and indeed all veterans.  In the twenty years since then, Chapter One has accomplished that mission, and in the process they have improved the whole Rutland community. They have not only offered assistance to fellow veterans, they have saved the lives of countless troubled veterans who had no where else to turn. Chapter One is responsible for the Dodge Development Center, a veterans center and shelter for homeless veterans which I havebeen proud to support. Members participate in the annual Rutland Loyalty Day Parade, Memorial Day and Veterans Day and annual POW/MIA Day ceremonies. Chapter One has also initiated an ``Honor the Vet Program'' with area businesses. Under this program, local businesses agree to provide a discount to any veteran with a veteran organization membership card.  In short, Mr. President, VVA Chapter One honors Vermont, just as its veterans honored us with their service in Vietnam. There are now four chapters carrying on the VVA tradition in Vermont. Besides Chapter One in Rutland, there is now chapter Chapter 601 in Bennington, Chapter 723 in Chester and Chapter 753 in St. Albans.  I thank them for all they have done and I wish them the best on this landmark occasion.                          ____________________
