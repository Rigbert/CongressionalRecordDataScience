Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. Jackson-Lee].  Mr. Chairman, this is the second budget-busting amendment that we have heard from the other side. It even violates the principles of offsets contained in the 1993 Clinton budget bill, $35 million more for an earmarked program that the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. Jackson-Lee] wants to spend it on with no offset whatsoever, either in NASA or outside of NASA. This means that the Administrator of NASA is going to have to figure out where to find this $35 million. The author of the amendment does not come up and say where to find the $35 million. She punts that whole issue over to the administration, and that is an abdication of congressional responsibility.  Now is the Administrator supposed to take this money out of the Johnson Space Flight Center? Is he supposed to take this money out of mission control for bringing the space station up into orbit? That is not specific, and an Administrator of NASA would have to do that.  I think that the amount of money that is in this bill which was agreed to by the Committee on Appropriations and passed by the House of Representatives is an adequate amount for this program. We should not have an extra $35 million increase for NASA without saying where it is going to come out of, and I would urge that the committee reject this amendment.                              {time}  1430
