President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached letter from the Supply Chain Security Coalition be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                         SCSC,                                                September 7, 2006.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental          Affairs,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: We understand that the Senate will      take up port security legislation in the very near future. We      are writing to express the Supply Chain Security Coalition's      support for strong legislation that will improve the security      of our ports and the global supply chain, while also ensuring      the continued strength and vitality of the U.S. economy.      Toward this end, we worked to help pass H.R. 4954, the SAFE      Ports Act, which the House of Representatives approved on May      6, 2006 on a vote of 421-2. It is our hope that the Senate      legislation will closely mirror those aspects of the House      bill that build upon the multi-layered, risk assessment model      currently used by the Department of Homeland Security and      which have worked to keep our ports safe for the last several      years.       However, while we strongly support improving the security      of our nation's ports, we will oppose any proposal or      amendment that would require all U.S. bound cargo containers      to be scanned for radiation and density, so called ``100%      scanning'' amendments. Such amendments would require every      container to be scanned in a foreign port before the      container is loaded on a vessel destined for the U.S. Such a      mandate is unrealistic     and could potentially decrease security by forcing containers      to sit for extended periods of time, which would then put      them at greater risk of tampering. A 100 percent scanning      mandate would also divert resources away from the current      successful risk assessment approach, which utilizes      sophisticated risk-analysis tools to determine which      containers may pose a risk and ensures that those containers      are handled appropriately. Finally, such a mandate has the      potential to significantly impede the flow of commerce.      According to the World Shipping Council, when the U.S.      Customs and Board Protection Agency (CBP) currently scans      questionable cargo, it takes 1-3 days to release that      container back into the stream of commerce. With 11 to 12      million containers entering the U.S. every year, it is      obvious that a mandate of 100% scanning has the potential to      do significant damage to the flow of goods and to the U.S.      economy.       Rather than mandating 100% scanning, we believe port      security legislation should authorize additional testing and      evaluation of scanning technology. Both the ``GreenLane      Maritime Cargo Security Act'' passed by the: Senate Homeland      Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the House-     approved SAFE Ports Act address this issue by calling for      pilot projects to test the effectiveness and operational      ability to conduct 100 percent container scanning. In      addition, the House bill requires the Secretary of Homeland      Security to conduct an evaluation of scanning systems, taking      into consideration false alarm rates and other operational      issues, the impact on trade, the need for international      cooperation, and the ability to integrate and deploy these      systems overseas. These provisions represent the best      approach to addressing this issue and will help to answer      important operational and economic questions that will be      critical to understanding how to effectively implement      improved container scanning.       We also urge the Senate to remember that current security      procedures do a great deal to ensure that U.S. bound cargo is      safe. The Customs and Border Protection Agency conducts      sophisticated analyses of shipment data for all U.S. bound      cargo before it is loaded on vessels. This is known as the      ``24-Hour Rule,'' and with this information, CBP conducts a      risk assessment through its Automated Targeting System to      determine which containers pose the highest risk. One hundred      percent of containers that are deemed to be ``high-risk'' are      then inspected. In addition, CBP is in the process of      deploying Radiation Portal Monitors (RPMs) at all U.S. ports      and plans to have close to 100 percent implementation by the      end of 2007.       We urge the Senate to pass legislation that builds on this      and the other effective procedures that make up the well-     established multi-layered risk assessment model used by the      Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Coast Guard, CBP      and other government agencies. Congress should outline      policies and goals and let DHS find the best and most      effective way to meet those goals. Before any technology is      mandated, the government should ensure the technology's      functionality and application. In addition, government must      continue to work with the private sector users of the system      to determine the best methods to deploy new technologies in      order to achieve maximum results.       We look forward to working with you on improving the      public-private partnership to enhance supply chain security.      And again, we urge you to oppose any amendment mandating 100%      container scanning.           Sincerely,       Agriculture Ocean Transportation Coalition.       Airforwarders Association.
