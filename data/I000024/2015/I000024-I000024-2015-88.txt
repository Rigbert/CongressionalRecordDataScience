President, from January through August of 2014, over 8,100 aliens that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had identified for deportation were released back into our communities by sanctuary jurisdictions. Over 5,000 of those released had a criminal history. In that same time period, 1,900 of those 8,100 went on to be charged with another 7,500 crimes.  These are crimes that would not have been committed had local authorities cooperated with Federal authorities in enforcing our laws.  This summer, everyone heard the case of Kate Steinle who was shot and killed in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant who had seven felony convictions and had been deported five times. Rather than turn him over to ICE, San Francisco released him, allowing him to commit more crimes. This guy even admitted that he was in San Francisco because their liberal laws would protect him.  While this one case received the media attention it deserved, many other preventable crimes don't.  For example, the city of Los Angeles released one immigrant who had been arrested for the continuous sexual abuse of a child. ICE wanted custody of this deviant. ICE tried to get custody of him. However, rather than hand him over to Federal law enforcement and get this guy out of our country and away from our children, Los Angeles ignored ICE's detainer and released him. He was later arrested for sodomy of a victim under 10 years old. Another child became a victim of this predator because liberal policies would rather release him into our communities then get him out of our country.  This year, sanctuary cities have already released more than 9,000 criminal aliens from jail and these criminals are committing more crimes.  In California, an immigrant was arrested for battery last year, but instead of turning him over to ICE, the local sheriff released him. This July, he raped and beat a 64-year-old woman so severely that she died 8 days later--yet another preventable death due to the intentional failure of a jurisdiction to comply with federal law.  How many more do we have to have before people realize what these policies are doing to our communities? Over 300 States, cities, and counties have sanctuary laws, ordinances, or policies that protect criminals and hurt the innocent. These jurisdictions continue to receive money from the Federal Government even though they continue to ignore Federal laws and rebuff Federal agencies working to enforce the laws.  Enough is enough.  I believe that, if a jurisdiction chooses not to cooperate with federal law enforcement, they should not be the beneficiary of federal grants. This is why I cosponsored S. 2146, the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, which my colleagues on the other side of the aisle filibustered. It is why I have cosponsored similar legislation introduced by Senator Sessions.  Unfortunately, others would rather let politics come before doing what they know is right and failed to protect our communities from further victimization. When the proper enforcement of current law could save lives and protect the innocent, how could you not vote to do so?                          ____________________
