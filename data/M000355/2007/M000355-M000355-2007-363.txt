 President, let me say to my friend the majority leader, I think that is fine. Just a suggestion: If we go down that path of trying to get cloture on every single amendment, if cloture is invoked, then it would further delay completion of the bill potentially by somebody insisting on using postcloture time. We have no desire to make it difficult to get through this bill. We would, however, like to have votes on our amendments.  I think the better way to proceed, as the majority leader has suggested, is to see if we can come to agreement on amendments and side by sides and move the process along, which sounds to me is what the majority leader is suggesting, and that is fine with me.
