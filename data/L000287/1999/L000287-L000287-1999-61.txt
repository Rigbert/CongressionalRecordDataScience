Mr. Speaker, we are a rich and powerful Nation in the midst of strong economic growth. As we approach the 21st century, we must ask ourselves, what is our next greatest challenge? How will we target our investments to become stronger as a Nation and as a people?  I have always said, and I will continue to say, Mr. Speaker, that there is no greater challenge and nothing that is more important than the education of our next generation. We do not have a person to waste. Every student in this Nation who wants to go to college, no matter how rich or poor, should have the opportunity to go. Education is a great equalizer. A good education can shine the light of hope and opportunity in every corner of our Nation, no matter how poor, how hopeless, or how downtrodden.  For nearly 30 years Pell Grants have been the key that have unlocked the American dream. For millions of American students who had the talent, had the desire, but lacked the funds, the Pell Grant made the difference between college and a dead end job.  In the last decade, the cost for college has increased at rates of 5 to 8 percent, outpacing inflation and putting a college education further out of reach for those who can least afford it. Until recently, the size of the maximum Pell Grant stayed the same.  Two years ago, many of my colleagues and I, along with the President, fought for and won the largest increase in the Pell Grant in 20 years. That brought the maximum Pell Grant up from $2,700 to $3,000.  Mr. Speaker, we can even do better. Today's Pell Grant provides only 35 percent of the average cost of a 4-year State college. Too few families today can afford to write a check for $10,000 to cover tuition for State schools, and for so many families, private education is out of the question.  Mr. Speaker, I remember growing up in rural Alabama in the forties and fifties. My family could never have afforded the college tuition at Harvard, Yale, or even the University of Georgia. For so many of us, college was a distant dream, a pipe dream. Without the help of financial aid or work study, we could never have afforded to go to college.  We have come a long way in opening the doors of college for all Americans, but we can do better. We can do more. For this reason, I am joining my colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) in sponsoring legislation that will raise the maximum authorized Pell Grant to a level that reflects the rising cost of college.  I ask all of my colleagues to join me and my colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), in making education a priority, and to ensure that in the days of economic prosperity, no one but no one is left out or left behind.                          ____________________
