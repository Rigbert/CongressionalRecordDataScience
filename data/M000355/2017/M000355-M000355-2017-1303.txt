 President, before I say anything else this morning, I want to say this: What we saw in Manchester last night almost defies description. It was, in the words of Prime Minister May, a ``callous terror attack'' that stood out ``for its appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenseless children and young people, who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives.''  Although we will continue to learn more about what happened, this much is very clear: Many have died, many more have been injured, and, as the Prime Minister told us, many of them were children. It is hard to imagine the pain the families of these victims must be feeling today. On behalf of the Senate and our country, let me express our heartfelt condolences to the victims, their families, and to the British people, who have been our friends and allies through many challenges.  The Senate also recognizes the many first responders, medical professionals, and citizens who stepped in to provide help.  As I speak, I know that the intelligence professionals from both of our countries are already working to discover whether this was the result of an individual attacker or directed by ISIL. In either case, the people of America will stand with our allies and provide any assistance we possibly can.                          ____________________
