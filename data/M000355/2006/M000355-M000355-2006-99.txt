 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated first responder, Mr. Thomas Kuster. A former Louisville fire chief, Mr. Kuster made Kentucky his home after being stationed with the Army at Fort Knox. He began his service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky by joining the Louisville Fire Department in 1957; he quickly rose through its ranks and was appointed fire chief in 1976.  While serving as Jefferson County judge-executive, I was pleased to name Mr. Kuster to head the county's fire protection in 1980. Years later, he would finish his long career of public service as Louisville's public safety director, supervising the city's fire and police departments, EMS, and health programs.  Earlier this month, Mr. Kuster passed away, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost a loyal public servant. The Louisville Courier-Journal published an article highlighting Mr. Kuster's career and dedication to the safety of his fellow man. I ask that the full article be printed in the Congressional Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying respect to this honored Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Sept. 12, 2006]           Thomas Kuster, Former Louisville Fire Chief, Dies                            (By Paula Burba)       Retired Louisville Fire Chief Thomas Kuster, who also      served as Louisville's public safety director and Jefferson      County fire protection administrator, died Saturday at      Baptist Hospital East: He was 69.       ``Tom was a fireman's fireman, a true gentleman who cared      about public safety. He dedicated his life to protecting the      people of Louisville,'' Louisville Mayor Jerry Abramson said      in a statement yesterday.       A native of Newark, Ohio, Kuster was stationed at Fort Knox      for three years and decided to stay in Kentucky. He joined      the Louisville Fire Department in 1957 shortly after leaving      the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1964, captain in      1966, district chief in 1970 and assistant chief five years      later.       He was appointed fire chief in 1976 by Mayor Harvey Sloane      and served in that position until 1979, years that included      the last strike by the city's firefighters.       ``He held things together,'' said Capt. Paul Routon,      current president of the firefighters Local 345. ``I think he      was the right guy at the time for it. When we came back to      work, his stance was `Let's put this behind us and move      forward.' I think he did it.''       ``Philosophically, I'm management,'' Kuster said in July      1978 when firefighters had finally voted to end the 95-hour      strike--during which he had slept about six hours and      responded to fire runs with other nonunion supervisors and      members of the National Guard. At the same time, Kuster said,      ``I understand, or feel like I understand their [striking      firefighters'] position.''       City officials praised his leadership, while firefighters      on the picket lines shook his hand.       ``He didn't demand respect. He knew how to get respect,''      Assistant Chief Randy Winstead said yesterday.       Winstead described Kuster as ``real regimental, real      serious'' and credited Kuster's acceptance of ``social      change'' as one way ``he turned the fire department around.''       ``You look at (photos of) all the other chiefs,'' Winstead      said, ``they all look like your grandfather. Except there's      Tom with sideburns and long hair.''       He was also the first chief to allow firefighters to wear      T-shirts instead of uniform shirts inside the firehouse,      Winstead said.       Kuster resigned as fire chief in 1979 after successfully      resisting several efforts, according to newspaper stories, by      Mayor William Stansbury's administration to demote several      assistant chiefs for what he saw as political reasons.       Kuster worked in administration at the Louisville Water Co.      until then County Judge Mitch McConnell chose him to head the      county's fire protection in 1980.       In 1983, Kuster accepted a job as fire chief in Raleigh,      N.C., where he served until 1985.       He returned to Louisville as the first department head      named by Mayor-elect Abramson in 1985. He was appointed      Louisville's public safety director, overseeing the police      and fire departments, EMS and health programs. He held that      position until 1993.       ``Louisville will always be grateful for Tom's public      service,'' Abramson said.                          ____________________[Page S10640]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TRIBUTE TO MR.
