Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroic acts of a young man from my district. Kirk Fistick set aside his own fears of disease and infection to save another life. What sets this courageous act apart is that it took place in Russia. By crossing both language and cultural barriers with this remarkable act, Kirk became an Ambassador for the United States. Kirk's heroic acts led the Boy Scouts of America to award him the Honor Medal, an honor only given to 36 people in 1993.  Kirk was one of 40 students selected by the National Freedom Support Act Scholarship to represent our country as a foreign exchange student in Russia. One day during his stay in Russia, he came across a man on the side of the road who had stopped breathing. Kirk risked his own life to perform CPR three times before the ambulance arrived and was able to keep him alive until he could receive medical care. Kirk reminds us all, Russian and American, that the Good Samaritan still exists today.  Kirk Fistick is the son of Robert and Patricia Fistick who reside in Charlotte Hall, MD. Kirk has an exceptional list of accomplishments. In addition to recently being awarded the Honor Medal, Kirk is an Eagle Scout and was awarded a National Certificate of Merit by the Boy Scouts of America for his help at the site of an automobile accident.  Kirk's life has not been all fun and games. He had to endure a 2-year bout with Lyme disease which he contracted during the summer of 1993. At times during these 2 years he was so critically ill he could not walk or sit up straight and required hospitalization or home care, but Kirk is a fighter. Throughout his illness, he managed to achieve honor roll status and played ice hockey as part of his physical therapy.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join with me in honoring this outstanding young man for his many accomplishments and congratulate him on being awarded the Honor Medal.                          ____________________
