 President, I rise today to once again introduce my flat tax bill, the Smart, Manageable and Responsible Tax Act, referred to as the SMART Act.  In the United States, there are few, if any, days that are viewed with the same resentment and contempt year after year as April 15: national tax day.  Our current Tax Code totals more than 70,000 pages, making tax compliance unnecessarily complex, confusing and costly. During the past 10 years, there have been over 4,400 changes to the Tax Code, including an estimated 579 changes in 2010 alone.  The inclusion of the additional 1099 tax reporting requirements in the health care reform bill are just one example of the onerous requirements throughout our Tax Code.  As we have learned since the passage of these requirements last March, incremental improvements to the TaxCode are not easy. It took Congress over a year to finally agree to repeal the 1099 changes that common sense tells us are essential to alleviating the burdens on small business. Yet our Tax Code is riddled with other similarly ill-conceived requirements.  Over the course of a year, individuals spend an average of 26 hours, over half of a work week, preparing for their tax filings.  Although this has been standard practice for decades, I do not believe average taxpayers should have to pore over IRS regulations for hours or pay someone to prepare their returns. Unfortunately, under our convoluted tax system they are left with little choice.  I have said a number of times before that our current tax system is unfair. It punishes success and stifles economic growth. The best remedy is to adopt a single tax rate for all taxpayers. Transitioning to a flat tax would not only increase fairness in the Tax Code, it would also increase the incentives to work and invest.  By eliminating the thousands of tax loopholes, deductions, and credits that can often only be utilized with extensive tax planning and expensive advisers, hardworking Americans can rest assured that corporations with billions of dollars in profit and sophisticated taxpayers are not able to unfairly reduce or eliminate their tax liabilities and leave middle-class Americans footing the bill.  The SMART Act also reforms our corporate Tax Code. The United States currently has the second highest corporate tax rate in the world. American companies routinely make the difficult decision to move operations overseas to reduce their tax burden. Under my legislation, companies would pay a flat tax rate of 17 percent on their profits. Cutting the corporate tax rate in half would increase domestic companies' competitiveness with foreign corporations and eliminate the incentives to shift jobs overseas.  This bill provides a simple, commonsense solution to the complexities and inequities of the current tax system. Taxpayers would be able to determine their tax liability quickly and easily, and file a tax return the size of a postcard.  The SMART Tax would repeal the current Internal Tax Code and replace it with a single tax rate for all taxpayers of 17 percent on all salaries, wages, and pensions. The only exemptions would be a personal exemption of $13,410 for a single person; $17,120 for a head of household; $26,810 for a married couple filing jointly; and $5,780 for each dependent, with these amounts indexed to inflation.  Additionally, under my legislation, earnings from savings and investments would not be included in taxable income. Eliminating this double taxation would increase the savings rate in our country and immediately spur investments in the economy, create jobs and boost economic growth.  Approximately 60 percent of individual taxpayers now pay preparers to complete their taxes for them. An additional 29 percent of individuals use tax software to assist with their filings. What this means for most people is that in addition to paying the government every year, they must pay someone or buy software to tell them exactly how much to pay their government.  The American people want and need fundamental tax reform that would save time and money and bring fairness to our tax structure. The legislation I am introducing today would implement much-needed reforms that eliminate onerous paperwork and promote economic growth in our country.  I recognize that this bill is a monumental shift away from our current tax laws, but our economy needs a boost, and we must not allow the enormity of the task to deter us from enacting better, more efficient tax laws. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
