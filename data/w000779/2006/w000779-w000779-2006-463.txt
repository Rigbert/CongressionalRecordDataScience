I am asking that we insist on what we did in the Finance Committee and what Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus have worked closely with me on. It is our feeling that we do need to have a broader and more comprehensive discussion about this down the road, but we took a modest step in the right direction in the Finance Committee. That is what I wish to preserve with this motion.
