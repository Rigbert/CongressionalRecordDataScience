Mr. Chairman, I would just like my colleagues to look at this little diagram. This is what CARA would take out of the total budget. It is 0.002 percent. That is all it takes out of it. And this amendment would be the first time that a new criteria is set on every bill. Only CARA does it apply to.  Now, the thing that bothers me is that CARA is not about new spending. There is approximately, with the help of the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) $1 billion a year that has already been spent. But under this amendment, none of that money would be spent. So we would cut out. No new parks, no wildlife refuge additions, no grants to States, no assistance to landowners or endangered species. None of that would occur.  So what the amendment does is eliminate, in fact, until all that criteria is met, no more spending period for the Department of Interior. And I am sure the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) would love that.
