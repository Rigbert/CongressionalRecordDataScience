 President, Chairman Murray, and Senator Boxer, I rise to discuss with you the importance of funding for the Surface Transportation Board in this legislation, as well as the funding that Chairman Murray has provided to the Federal Railroad Administration to continue to administer its grant awards.  As you know, opponents of California's high-speed rail project are attempting to use the Federal permitting process in order to prevent the Nation's first high-speed rail project from moving forward and succeeding.  The Surface Transportation Board funding will provide the resources necessary to continue the Board's efforts to permit the growth of passenger rail projects in the United States. The funding in the bill for the Federal Railroad Administration will ensure that this agency is able to monitor and administer the grants it already awarded.
