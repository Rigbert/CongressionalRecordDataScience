Kennedy, Mr. Obama, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                              S. Res. 303       Whereas on November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Nigerian      writer, environmental activist, and nominee for the Nobel      Peace Prize, along with 8 colleagues, together known as the      ``Ogoni 9'', were hanged by the military government of      Nigeria, based on charges widely regarded as false;       Whereas the Ogoni 9 had been nonviolently campaigning for      improved living standards and a clean environment for the      Ogoni People, whose Niger Delta land, air, and water was, and      remains, severely polluted from oil extraction, and whose      standard of living, despite the great mineral wealth their      land has yielded since the early 1960s, is among the lowest      in the world;       Whereas the international condemnation that followed the      executions included the suspension of Nigeria from the      British Commonwealth of Nations;       Whereas in 1996 a United Nations mission to Nigeria found      the military tribunal in contravention of international and      domestic law, and recommended financial relief for the      survivors of the Ogoni 9 and improvements in the      socioeconomic conditions of the Ogoni and other minorities in      the Delta;       Whereas 10 years later, none of the United Nations      recommendations have been implemented, and the environmental      and social situations have deteriorated for the Ogoni and      other Delta communities;       Whereas the Ogoni 9 remain convicted of a crime of which      they were unfairly tried;       Whereas Ogoniland remains severely polluted and gas flaring      continues unabated;       Whereas the security and stability in the Niger Delta are      threatened by a proliferation of small arms, armed gangs, and      black market oil bunkering;       Whereas despite these pressures, Ogoniland remains an      island of nonviolence, and the Ogoni voted in high numbers in      the 1999 elections;       Whereas stability in the Niger Delta is necessary to      prevent an increase in global oil costs; and       Whereas in the interest of the protection of human rights,      justice, and stability in the Delta, redress should be given      to the Ogonis and their use of nonviolent means should be      recognized: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) urges the Government of Nigeria to conduct a thorough      judicial review of the trial of the Ogoni 9 and to provide      just compensation to the survivors of the Ogoni 9 if a      miscarriage of justice is found;       (2) urges the Government of Nigeria, international donors,      and international oil companies operating in the Delta to      increase assistance significantly to improve the lives of the      Ogoni and other affected communities and for pollution      abatement and cleanup in the Niger Delta region, in close      consultation with local communities;       (3) urges the Government of Nigeria to ensure that all      members of the security forces receive training in      international standards on the use of force and firearms,      particularly the 1979 United Nations Code of Conduct for Law      Enforcement Officials and the 1990 United Nations Basic      Principles on the Use of Force and Fire Arms by Law      Enforcement Officials;       (4) calls upon the Department of State to seek urgently to      ensure that American oil companies operating in the Niger      Delta comply, at a minimum, with the Voluntary Principles for      Security and Human Rights; and       (5) urges the Secretary General of the United Nations to      institute a 10-year followup mission to Ogoniland.
