Speaker, this month our community celebrates the fiftieth jubilee of Reverend I.J. Johnson is the pastor of St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church in Toledo, Ohio.  Amazingly, Reverend Johnson entered the ministry at age twelve. By nineteen, he began pastoring in his home state of Alabama. He received his Bachelor of Theology degree from Easonian Baptist Seminary in Birmingham, Alabama, and served four churches until coming to Ohio in 1955. In July of that year, he was invited by Dr. Israel Walker to conduct a revival at St. Mary's Baptist Church. During this visit he met the woman who would become his wife. On August 26, 1958, Reverend Johnson and Mother Betty Rae Johnson were married. Together they raised four children: Reverend C.L. Johnson, Reverend Michael Johnson. Denisee Williams and Angela Taylor.  In October of 1955, Pastor Johnson founded and organized St. Mark's Missionary Baptist Church. Started with just three members, the church grew over the half-century to more than 2,000 souls.  Enjoying a well-earned reputation as a spiritual leader, Pastor Johnson has been invited to conduct revivals in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, and Tennessee. All of this in addition to his ministry at St. Mark's. He has established a yearly fellowship with Historical First Baptist Church of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1981, Pastor Johnson invited Dr. Martin Luther King Sr. to St. Mark's, at which time the first album recorded by the church choir was dedicated. The album was entitled ``Our Day Will Come.''  Many of our area ministers count Pastor Johnson as mentor. Perhaps the greatest testament to his nurturing ability is the fact that both of his sons are now preachers in their own right. Not only ministers, but many in our community have been beneficiaries of his counsel. Truly a community leader, Pastor Johnson served as president of the Baptist Ministers Conference for eight years. Other associations include the Fairside Community Organization, Northwestern Ohio Missionary Baptist Association, Lucas County Mental Health Board, Interracial Interfaith Committee, Evangelical Board of the National Baptist Convention, and NAACP. A welcome advisor, Reverend Johnson has also been specially recognized by our area's elected leaders.  Reverend Johnson's charismatic leadership, dynamic example, personal spirituality, and careful teachings have brought many people to live their lives in the steps of Jesus Christ. He embodies God's teachings as written in Matthew, 4:19; ``Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.''[Extensions of Remarks][Page E776]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               FIFTIETH JUBILEE OF REVEREND I.J.
