Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Scott amendment. It strips all of the mandatory minimum penalties out of the bill.  The amendment seeks to strip the core provisions of the bill. Let me remind everyone of the nature of the problem we face today. More than 57,000 law enforcement officers were assaulted in 2003, or one in every 10 officers serving in the United States. The numbers have been increasing since 1999, even as every other crime has decreased or held steady.  The Executive Director of the Fraternal Order of Police noted recently ``There is less respect for authority in general and police officers specifically. The predisposition of criminals to use firearms is probably at the highest point of our history.''  The secure access proposal addresses this problem by sending a message of deterrence. The existing penalty for assaulting a law enforcement officer is 8 years, 15 if with a weapon. Under current criminal law, a false statement made to an FBI agent in a terrorism investigation carries the same penalty as a violent assault of a police officer.  Federal, State, and local judges have suffered from rising threats, and deadly attacks have been directed against judges as well as courthouse participants.                              {time}  1645  According to the Administrative Office of United States Courts, there are almost 700 threats made a year against Federal judges, and in numerous cases Federal judges have had security details assigned to them for fear of attack by members of terrorist organizations, violent gangs, and disgruntled litigants.  H.R. 1751 provides a reasonable penalty structure for assaults against judges, prosecutors and public safety officers, as well as members of their families. The bill adopts a penalty structure requiring 1 to 10 years for an assault that results in bodily injury, such as a cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, disfigurement, pain or illness; 3 to 12 years for substantial bodily injury, temporary but substantial disfigurement, temporary but substantial loss or impairment; and 10 to 30 years for serious bodily injury, substantial risk of death, extreme physical pain, protracted and obvious disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ or mental faculty.  These penalties roughly correspond to existing guideline ranges and simply ensure that Federal judges impose the required penalty, but can exercise discretion to a higher penalty if warranted.  Law enforcement officers deserve our fullest protection, brazen criminals show less and less regard for the police and the hard work that they do. Our message is simple: If you attack a police officer or kill a police officer, you will be going to jail for a long time.  As revised, the mandatory minimums are commensurate with existing Federal sentencing guidelines, but in the absence of a mandatory minimum guideline system, there is too much at risk to leave the sentencing to judges who have already demonstrated their willingness to depart from the guidelines when presented with a case.  Mandatory minimum penalties are effective for ensuring consistency in sentencing. Since the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, judges now have virtually unlimited discretion to ignore the Federal sentencing guidelines and impose whatever sentence they like, all to the detriment of public safety and fairness and sentencing through consistent and clear punishment schemes. Judges are now completely unaccountable.  Congress has a duty to set sentencing policies for Federal crimes and to make sure that judges impose such sentences. Unfortunately, that has not been the experience since the Booker decision. Once freed from mandatory sentencing schemes, Federal judges are now starting to ignore the guidelines: In one of every 10 criminal cases, they are imposing sentences below the previously mandated guideline range.  In a recently released report, the Sentencing Commission data confirmed that this trend is continuing, and specifically broke out such data by circuits, which showed that judges in the Second and Ninth Circuits followed the guideline ranges in imposing sentences in a substantially lower percentage than the other circuits. Sentences now for similar crimes are being handed in disparate fashion, depending on the region where the offense occurs. This is not equal justice under the law in the Federal system.  Those judges, when they go to the Supreme Court, ought to look at the motto that is underneath the roof of the Court at the main entrance when they walk in. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
