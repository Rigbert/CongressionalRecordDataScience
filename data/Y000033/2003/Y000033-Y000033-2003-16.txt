Madam Chairman, I think the gentleman made a very good point about the bipartisan bill. As the gentleman read Members' names off of amendments that were worked out, it shows we can work together and that there is a good relationship between the majority and the minority. In fact, some of those amendments, if there was any hostility, I would not have accepted by some of the Members; but because we tried to work out the differences, I believe we have come out with a very good bill.  Again, I want to thank the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member for their work on this legislation, understanding there will be some discussion on other amendments. Overall, we have settled every difficult amendment prior to coming to the floor. That is one thing I pride this committee on, is working behind the scenes, in front of the scenes, and making sure the scene is finally done. And this bill does it, and I compliment the gentlemen. I also thank the staff who worked very hard on this legislation over the past 6 to 8 months. We have come out with a very good product.
