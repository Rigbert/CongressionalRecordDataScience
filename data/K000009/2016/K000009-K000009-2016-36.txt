Speaker, our laws allow law-abiding citizens the right to possess guns. But why should that right allow those who are reasonably suspected of terrorist activity to purchase weapons of mass destruction?  Gun ownership is not an absolute right. Some weapons should be banned, and some people should not be allowed to buy guns.  Specifically, let's start today with the proposition that if you are on the terrorist watch list, you should be placed on the gun no buy list. Yes, if you are on the terrorist watch list, you should not be able to buy a gun.  Why defend people who are reasonably, reasonably, reasonably suspected by the FBI to be terrorists or terrorist sympathizers?  H.R. 5611 fails to value the safety, security, and the lives of the American people. It is simple. We must vote on legislation that truly says, no fly, no buy.  Speaker Ryan, bring up the King-Thompson bill, H.R. 1076, to assure that those individuals on the terrorist no-fly list should not be able to buy guns.  Speaker Ryan, protect the American people.                          ____________________
