 President, I rise to speak for a few minutes in morning business.  In August, I received a letter from a constituent, Mr. John Dodgen, of Humboldt, IA. Along with the letter, Mr. Dodgen enclosed a copy of an opinion piece he authored regarding the war on terror that was published in the local newspaper.  In his opinion piece, Mr. Dodgen rightly asserts that the United States is engaged in a global war on terror with an enemy whose goal is the elimination of the United States. I also strongly agree with his premise that we must take the fight to the terrorists where they operate or we will be forced to confront them on our soil. This is a war that we must win, and we must remain on the offense until the war is won.  Mr. Dodgen raises some compelling thoughts in his opinion piece. Rather than try to summarize all of Mr. Dodgen's points and recommendations, I would like to submit for the Record his thoughts on controlling terrorism.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Mr. Dodgen's opinion piece be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Controlling Terrorism       Our world is made-up of two dramatically opposed factions.      Those who enjoy freedom versus those who would enslave the      world. This is not a debatable subject--it's an all out world      war of ideologies.       As a nation of freedom, we are engaged in a conflict that      must be won or our world culture will be reduced to the dark      ages. We are engaged in a conflict for survival.       The nations of Iran, Syria, North Korea, and the terrorists      of Hezbollah all seek one objective--the destruction of      Israel and the United States. They are like ``mad dogs''.      There is no way to reason with them to a peace loving state.      The only solution with a rabies infected dog is to destroy      it. This same strategy does not apply to all Muslims, only      those lunatic, malicious, hateful, and destruction-minded      fanatics who declared war on ``infidels'' several years ago.      In World War II the allies stopped Hitler, Mussolini and      Japan from destroying half the world. Ninety percent of my      Navy amphibious group were killed or wounded invading the      Philippines and millions of others were killed in tragic      World War II.       While we still have a chance to stamp out the hate and      suicidal destructive force in our world, the U.S. and our      allies should confront Iran, Syria, North Korea, and      Hezbollah with an ultimatum to destroy their rockets and      nuclear warhead pursuits or we will have no alternative but      to destroy them ourselves with or without the United Nations      blessing. It's totally unrealistic to think that negotiations      with these evil nations will solve or alleviate the threat,      so we should bring this to a head before they attack any      other nations and unleash their evil hatred and destruction      on innocent, peace-loving people. We should use every means      within our power to reduce their threat to insignificance.      There is no other course; we should act now while our      declared and profound enemies are vulnerable to our      containment. If we wait and try to solve our world's conflict      with diplomacy and negotiation, we are fooling ourselves and      eventually our nation and our love for freedom and peaceful      existence on Earth will be destroyed.       In past history, two postures for our nation--The Monroe      Doctrine and Teddy Roosevelt's ``Walk Softly And Carry A Big      Stick Policy--along with President Kennedy's demand that      Russia withdraw rockets with nuclear warheads from Cuba, kept      us from wars to maintain our freedom. Now we need to declare      and carry out the United States world position that we will      not tolerate ``evil and war mongering'' nations, and unless      they cease and desist of such a threat they will have the      United States and its overwhelming power to force them to do      so. We were able to convince Libya to stop its terrorism with      a well placed bomb; we can do the same with the other      terrorist nations listed.       America needs to withdraw from the United Nations as they      have utterly failed from their beginning existence to keep      the peace or more than temporarily stop aggression and human      suffering. What the world needs is for the United States to      establish a ``World Peace Council'' made up of: The President      of the United States; The Prime Minister of England; Queen      Elizabeth and/or Australia's Governor General; The President      and/or The Prime Minister of Russia; The President of China;      The Emperor and/or Prime Minister of Japan; The President of      India.       These nations could meet for three days every month to      determine the issues requiring their attention, determine the      appropriate action, and then enforce their decision based on      the majority vote of the council. A veto would be prohibited.      Funding would be on an assessed basis from the seven nations      plus other voluntary freedom loving nations and a chosen      General whose International Police Force would be enlisted on      a country by country basis to carry out the seven nations'      solution.       If any of the nations selected to form the World Peace      Council chooses not to serve or withdraws, then the remaining      members would select a nation for their replacement. In the      case of a tie vote, another candidate would be chosen until a      majority vote determined the successor.       As a Christian, it is utterly deplorable for me to come to      the above conclusion. However; as a practical human being and      a concerned U.S. Citizen, I acknowledge that terrorism is a      fact that must be recognized and dealt with. I therefore urge      our Congress and President to declare an ultimatum on the      nations of terrorists and restrain them while we still have      the power and resolve to do so. We cannot wait until we have      another Pearl Harbor, Cuban Missile Crisis, or 9/11 before we      stop this aggression.                          ____________________
