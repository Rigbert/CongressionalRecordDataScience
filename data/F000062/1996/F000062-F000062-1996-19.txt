 President, I commend the Senate for approving last night, at my urging, H.R. 3056, which makes a small change in Federal law to enable a California county that operates a Medicaid managed care plan to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries in another county. This bill, introduced by Congressman Frank Riggs, is needed because the Health Care Financing Administration concluded that current law limits coverage under these county-operated plans solely to the county in which an organization operates.  This bill was requested by Solano and Napa Counties in California so that Solano County could expand its Health Partnership Plan to Napa County, thus providing care to 12,000 individuals. Currently, these Medicaid beneficiaries have ``hit or miss'' health care. Some are refused care by private physicians. The health care they do get is inconsistent and unreliable. Many end up in emergency rooms when illnesses are exacerbated and care is expensive. When Solano started its plan, emergency room visits were cut in half the first year because Medicaid beneficiaries were linked up with a primary care physician. This resulted in major savings.  In short, this bill will mean more access, more care and better health.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill could save up to $500,000 per year.  The bill is supported by Gov. Pete Wilson, the California Department of Health Services, and the Solano and Napa County Boards of Supervisors.  I thank Senators Lott, Daschle, Roth, and Moynihan for their help in moving this legislation and I urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
