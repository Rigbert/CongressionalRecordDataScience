 President, the Dodd amendment is the pending amendment. Let me just say to my colleagues, if the motion to table the Dodd amendment, which I will shortly make, is approved, then the next vote will be on final passage and we will be to the completion of this legislation.  Senator Shelby has indicated if the motion to table is not approved, he will have further observations to make about the Dodd amendment.  So Mr. President, at this time on behalf of the Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, and myself, I move to table the Dodd amendment.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
