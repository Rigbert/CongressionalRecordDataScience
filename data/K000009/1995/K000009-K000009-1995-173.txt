Speaker, I agree with my colleagues who were on the floor here of the absolute necessity of the United States balancing its budget and putting our financial house in order. But this afternoon, I want to talk to you about a different deficit, the trade deficit, and a piece of legislation I am introducing today, the Professional Trade Service Corps Act, which is essential to America correcting that deficit as well.  U.S. trade policy for the last two decades under both Democratic and Republican Presidents has been a major net loser for our Nation, its businesses and our workers. While some individual corporations and certain shareholders have benefited, overall the productive wealth of America has been diminished, as ballooning trade deficits have fueled the movement of our dollars offshore, as our citizens bought more and more imported goods coming into this country rather than our exports being sold abroad.  Trade deficits represent a serious decapitalization of this country, with more and more of our people's money moving abroad to pay for the goods they are buying from foreign importers, while foreign capital pours into this country. The economic accounts tell the story.  In 1980, our country was a net lender to the world, as foreign interests owed us more than $400 billion.                              {time}  1230  Today, however, the United States owes foreign creditors nearly $800 billion. We are now a net debtor nation.  As foreign imports, including many from U.S.-based firms that have escaped offshore, surge into our country, jobs that should have been created here, good-paying jobs, are now being located elsewhere in the world.  Furthermore, the value of our dollar continues its decade-long decline as U.S. dollars flood into the international market to pay for the goods that we are buying from other places.  Last year our country racked up yet another record deficit with the world in merchandise trade of over $166 billion. For January of this year, the United States set a monthly record deficit of $12 billion more in just 1 month, and keep in mind $1 billion of debt in trade translates into 23,000 lost jobs in this country.  These deficits represent real lost jobs, stagnant wages, and decreased living standards as your dollar buys less in this country.  You might be watching the trade talks that are going on with Japan right now. Last year we had over $66 billion in trade deficit with Japan, more of their goods coming in here than our goods being able to get into that market, because in fact it is a closed market, and if you just look at the automotive segment of that deficit, which represents half of our deficit with Japan, if we could solve that problem we could build in this country 100 factories, each employing over 5,000 workers, 100 factories, each employing over 5,000 workers, if we only solved half the trade problem that we have with Japan.  In short, these deficits hurt every American in our communities, and that is why today I am introducing the Professional Trade Service Corps bill to upgrade U.S. trade negotiating functions through creation of a specialized tenured body of trained professional trade negotiators for this country. The Corps' mission would be to conduct U.S. trade negotiations and streamline the trade functions of this Government.  The Professional Trade Service Corps incorporates a three-tier strategy to address the need for more skilled and committed U.S. trade negotiators. First the proposal would accomplish that goal by creating an elite professional body of American negotiators to address the issues of short tenure and the revolving door among our trade negotiators.  The average trade negotiators for our country stay in their position 2 years. The average negotiator for Japan stays in his position 30 years, speaks several languages, and has worked in various countries around the world.  Our bill would also establish a Trade Services Institute to train our current and future U.S. trade negotiators in the practices, culture, and customs of our trade competitors.  Then finally the bill restricts Trade Service Corps officials as well as other senior members of the executive and legislative branches from representing or advising foreign interests immediately after leaving Government service.  U.S. trade negotiators serve on the front lines of today's battle to win market share in the increasingly competitive international marketplace. To win, our country must have highly trained, professional, tenured, and committed trade negotiators with integrity at the table negotiating the best terms for America's workers and America's businesses.  I ask my colleagues to please join me in cosponsoring the Professional Trade Service Corps Act. Put this country on an equal footing at the international bargaining tables that control our destiny in terms of jobs and development in this country.                          ____________________
