 President, today I wish to pay tribute to LTC George Warfield Floyd Chapman, a war hero who sacrificed much to ensure the safety and freedom of his fellow Americans.  Lieutenant Colonel Chapman recently passed away at the age of 92, leaving behind a great legacy of faith, courage, and honor. Born in Lovely, KY, in January 1915, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman graduated from Pike Jr. College in 1937 and from Eastern Kentucky University in 1940.  In 1941, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was drafted and commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Infantry Division. In 1943, shortly after marrying his late wife of 64 years, Katherine Carole Coble, he was sent to Europe to fight in World War II.  In 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was captured by the German Army during the Battle of Anzio, Italy, a tragic conflict that witnessed the staggering loss of many British and American soldiers. He then spent the next year in prisoner of war camps in Germany and Poland, wounded and enduring great hardships and suffering.  Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was awarded the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts for his wartime service, but in no way do these truly reflect all that he gave for his country.  After his return from Europe, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman and his wife Katherine moved to Texas where they raised three sons. Lieutenant Colonel Chapman worked in production for the Continental Oil Company and remained active in the U.S. Army Reserve, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. By the time he retired from the Continental Oil Company in 1962, he had earned a master's degree from Texas A University.  Lieutenant Colonel Chapman was a hard worker who not only dedicated much of his life to his country but also to his family as a devoted husband and exceptional father. He was also a historian, maintaining an excellent knowledge and passion for understanding life, history, and politics.  Mr. President, Lieutenant Colonel Chapman will be forever remembered not only as a hero of World War II, but also as a hero in the hearts of his beloved family members. They treasure the gifts he gave to them and to his country. Lieutenant Colonel Chapman belongs to a select group of individuals to whom our country will forever be indebted. I would ask my colleagues to rise today in honor of all those who gave so much to this country, including a great Kentuckian, LTC George Warfield Floyd Chapman.                          ____________________
