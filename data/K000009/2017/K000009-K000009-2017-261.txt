Speaker, the Constitution clearly states: ``No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.''  The law defines public service as a public trust. It requires government employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, and laws and ethical principles above private gain. At his inauguration, President-elect Donald J. Trump will swear an oath to uphold the Constitution. Given the immensity of Mr. Trump's business dealings, grave concerns exist that he will immediately be in violation of this oath. Every one of his personal investments will pose a conflict of interest. Any ongoing foreign business relationship threatens to violate the Constitution's Emoluments Clause. The Constitution must be upheld.  Our Founding Fathers identified the principles important to the bedrock of our democracy; they included an anticorruption measure known as the Emolument Clause. Its inclusion emphasized their desire to preserve independence from external influence. There is no question this principle should apply to this President, as it has to every other President of our nation.  Mr. Trump has achieved great wealth and his investments spread across the United States and dozens of foreign countries. His personal finances are directly impacted not only by our own policy but also by policies adopted in other nations. His debt obligations pose great conflicts of interests and the possibility of hidden influences will eclipse every action and decision Mr. Trump makes. There is no way to be sure of the full depth of Mr. Trump's conflicts. He continues to refuse to release his tax returns, a key component of accountability provided by every President and presidential candidate since Richard Nixon.  When asked what he will do to eliminate the conflicts, Mr. Trump has said it's ``a very simple situation'' and ``routine.'' Yet, thus far, he has not explained how he will address the conflicts. Meanwhile, there has been little division between Mr. Trump's business interests and his transition. This fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants approach is unconstitutional and dangerous to liberty.  Our Founding Fathers would not accept this uncertainty and subversion of the Constitution. They constructed the Clause to clearly forbid self-serving dealings. They established a clear baseline of unacceptable conduct, rather than force after-the-fact judgement. Further, they granted Congress the power to validate exchanges.  This is why I am introducing a joint resolution, the ``No Congressional Consent for President Donald J. Trump to Accept Foreign Emoluments of Any Kind Whatsoever.'' It empowers Congress to act by explicitly denying consent for Mr. Trump to accept any and all emoluments, whatever they may be.  The resolution details that since the President is a federal office holder, he is subject to the strict scrutiny of the Emolument Clause. As such, the President cannot accept any Emolument without the consent of Congress and since emolument is broadly qualified, the consent or denial is in effect for a full spectrum of transactions. Specifically, these transactions include emoluments from foreign States and corporations owned or controlled by foreign governments. Further, the resolution explicitly denies Congressional consent for Mr. Trump's acceptance of any emolument, whatever it may be and requires President Trump to report back to Congress on specific action taken to ensure his compliance with the Emoluments Clause.  Mr. Speaker, Congress must act to uphold our Constitution and decide what should be allowed and what cannot be tolerated with Mr. Trump's business dealings. Without full sunlight and full separation of private interests from the public trust, we must deny any acceptance of any emolument.                          ____________________
