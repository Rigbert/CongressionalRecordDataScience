Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I thank the chairman of the Committee on Rules.  There will be an amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Barr). I understand that will be debated. But I would suggest that everybody will have at least an hour if they wish to go to dinner or go to the office to do some work, and then after 8 o'clock all holds are barred and we hope to bring this to finalization by 9 o'clock.               Amendment No. 36 Offered by Mr. Gutierrez
