President, I am submitting for inclusion in the Record a letter from the Congressional Budget Office providing cost estimates for two bills ordered reported from the Committee on Environment and Public Works on May 23, 2006 and reported without written report to the full Senate on May 24, 2006, S. 801 and S. 2650. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 24, 2006,     Hon. James M. Inhofe, Chairman,     Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      reviewed the following legislation, as ordered reported by      the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on May      23, 2006:       S. 801, a bill to designate the United States courthouse      located at 300 North Hogan Street, Jacksonville, Florida, as      the ``John Milton Bryan Simpson United States Courthouse'';       S. 2650, a bill to designate the Federal courthouse to be      constructed in Greenville,     South Carolina, as the ``Carroll A. Campbell, Jr. Federal      Courthouse.''       CBO estimates that enactment of these bills would have no      significant impact on the Federal budget and would not affect      direct spending or revenues. These bills contain no      intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in      the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on      State, local, or tribal governments. If you wish further      details on this estimate, we will be pleased to provide them.           Sincerely,                                                 Donald B. Marron,     Acting Director.                          ____________________
