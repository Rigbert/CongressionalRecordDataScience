Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to Riverside County, California, are exceptional. On April 14th, Warren D. ``Dusty'' Williams will be retiring from the Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District after 39 years of dedicated service, including over 13 years as its General Manager-Chief Engineer.  Dusty began his career in June 1977 as a student intern with the District. For the next four decades, he dedicated himself to loyal, conscientious, innovative and outstanding service to residents of the area, culminating with his leadership of the organization. Dusty is recognized as a national leader on flood safety, stormwater capture and environmental regulatory issues. He served as President of the National Association of Flood and Stormwater Management Agencies, on national committees including the National Committee on Levee Safety, and has testified before several Congressional Committees on such important issues as levee safety and amendments to the federal Clean Water Act.  Dusty has also been a strong local partner with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; guiding ongoing and critical federal projects including the Santa Ana Main Stem Project and the Murrieta Creek Flood Control Environmental Restoration and Recreation Projects through technical, fiscal and administrative hurdles. I believe the reason Dusty was such an effective leader was the depth and range of his technical expertise, effective communication skills, commitment to excellence and loyalty to his community.  In light of all that Dusty has done for our region and the Riverside County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, it is only fitting to honor him on the occasion of his retirement. Dusty has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and my friend. To conclude, Mr. Speaker I want to thank Dusty for his service to the people of Riverside County--his dedication, insight and passion for flood management will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
