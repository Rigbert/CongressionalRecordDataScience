President, I am pleased that the majority leader has moved the nomination of Robert C. Chambers to be a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. Mr. Chambers has the strong support of Senator Robert C. Byrd and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV. Mr. Chambers has been engaged in the private practice of law for almost 20 years and served as a delegate in the West Virginia House of Delegates, chairman of that body's judiciary committee, and speaker of the West Virginia House of Delegates. The ABA found him to be qualified and the Judiciary Committee unanimously reported this nomination to the Senate in July.  I congratulate Mr. Chambers and his family and look forward to his service on the Federal court.  As I noted yesterday, we have a good deal of work ahead of us if we are to fulfill our responsibilities and confirm the other fine nominees who are pending before us and are needed in the Federal courts around the country. I commend the majority leader for returning to the Executive Calendar today to take up this judicial nomination.                          ____________________
