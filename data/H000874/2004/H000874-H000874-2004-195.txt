                             {time}  1500  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I can say that substitutes would certainly be allowed, I would assume. I do not want to preempt what the Committee on Rules might do. As far as amendments to these bills, I would have to refer to the Committee on Rules, as we do not know what they might rule.
