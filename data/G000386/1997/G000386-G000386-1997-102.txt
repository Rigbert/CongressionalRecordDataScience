 President, today I am introducing the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Good Samaritan Act of 1997. This bill will help Federal officers do what they do best: protect lives. Under this bill, any Federal law enforcement officer who, while off duty, should unexpectedly arrive at or is present at a crime will be able to take appropriate action.  Mr. President, perhaps a hypothetical example would best explain the intent of this legislation. Lets say a law enforcement officer stops at a convenience store on his way home from work one evening. While picking up a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread, a criminal attempts to rob this particular store. Now most law enforcement folks will tell you that, in this situation, they would feel compelled to take some kind of appropriate action. But in many jurisdictions, if they dotake action and are hurt, or are forced to hurt the criminal, they may not be eligible for their health benefits, and may be open to be sued by the criminal for their actions. The law enforcement officer, acting on his training, and intervening in a situation that he had the training and ability to deal with, would have to cover these expenses from his own pocket. Mr. President, this does not sound fair to me. It can create a situation where the officer may feel unable to act in response to his sense of duty because of concerns that he will be penalized for acting. This legislation would eliminate these legitimate worries.  Let me make it clear that this bill does not expand Federal law enforcement authority. A Federal officer could only make a citizen's arrest, if necessary, and local law enforcement officials would still have jurisdiction in the case. My office has spoken with the National Association of Attorneys General, and they are supportive of this legislation.  I hope that my colleagues will take the time to look at this legislation, and join Senator Alfonse D'Amato and me in sponsoring this bill. Our Government has invested a lot of time, energy, and trust in the training and support of our Federal law enforcement officers. We need to be sure that they are able to perform their duties--and to act as we would hope and expect them to act.  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator Grassley in the introduction of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Good Samaritan Act. This bill is essential to protect trained federal law enforcement officers who want to offer assistance when they witness a crime but are afraid of the repercussions afterwards if it is not a crime defined under their agency's authorizing statute.  Agents in the federal law enforcement community are charged with the investigation of criminal activities defined in their authorizing statute. For example, DEA agents investigate drug crimes and a Secret Service agent's role is limited to financial crimes. If acting ``within the scope of their employment'', meaning they deal with only those crimes listed in their agency's authorizing statute, the actions of the Special Agent will not result in personal liability. In addition, the employing agency may assign counsel or provide worker's compensation if the Special Agent was injured in the line of duty.  However, when an off-duty Federal Agent witnesses the commission of a violent crime, such as a DEA agent witnessing a robbery, the intervention is deemed to be outside the scope of his or her employment. Unfortunately, that special agent's intervention may subject the off-duty Federal Law Enforcement Agent to personal liability--without the protections afforded them if they were on duty.  There are few cases nation-wide but it has affected the intervention of our Federal Law Enforcement Officers. In one instance, two DEA agents on a surveillance saw a parked car occupied by a man and a young woman. The car was not part of the surveillance. This did not stop the agents from intervening when they saw the young woman struggling with the man and screaming for help. Their assistance was not ``within the scope of their employment'' but these trained agents wanted to help, using their expertise in crisis situations. The DEA agents certainly were not thinking a lawsuit when they intervened but because their actions were outside the scope, they were acting as private citizens--subjecting their personal assets to a lawsuit.  Federal agents who unexpectedly encounter violence in our communities face an unconscionable choice: 1.) stand by and allow the violence to occur; 2.) refuse help to the victim and allow the perpetrator to escape; or 3.) intervene as a private citizen and risk bankruptcy by a potential lawsuit.  Currently, there exists no federal statute authorizing Federal Special Agents to intervene during the commission of certain violent crimes outside the scope of their statutory authority, and protecting their personal assets when they assist someone in need. I urge my colleagues to review the merits of this bill and join in this effort to relieve the fear of our specially trained law enforcement agent and possibly encouraging their intervention when citizens need it the most.  This bill explicitly defines when a specially trained agent may be protected if he or she offers assistance ``outside the scope of their employment''. These instances are limited to:  (A) the protection of any person in his presence from the imminent infliction of bodily harm;  (B) offering immediate help to any victim who suffers bodily harm in his presence; and  (C) preventing the escape of any person he reasonably believes to be responsible for inflicting, attempting or threatening to inflict, bodily harm to another in his presence.  It will provide the Agent with the same qualified immunity that he has if the act was within the ``scope of his employment'': counsel will be provided to the agent, the Federal Government will indemnify for the damages caused, worker's compensation will be available.  This bill will not curtail the rights of an injured party. It does not prevent an injured party from suing for damages incurred during the intervention by the Agent nor will it restrict the amount of damages that an injured party may receive if the court finds that the Agent acted unreasonably.  This bill will not expand the powers or authorities of Federal law enforcement agencies or give Federal law enforcement agents authority to investigate or to direct any state or local law enforcement body, usurping the powers of the state or local law enforcement agencies, outside of their jurisdiction. Finally, this bill will not restrict the filing of criminal charges if the action of the Agent fits the current statutory definition.  Federal law enforcement agents need this protection and I urge its passage.                                 ______                                       By
