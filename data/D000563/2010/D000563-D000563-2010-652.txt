I know the Senator from New Jersey has been a leader on the whole question of liability and the damages that should be paid by BP for what they have done as a result of this Deepwater Horizon rig blowing up, 11 innocent people killed. We should always remember that as the first casualty and now the ongoing damage.  I would ask the Senator from New Jersey, having just gone to the Gulf of Mexico yesterday with five of our Senate colleagues on a bipartisan trip--the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar; Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano--is it not true that in the first 3 months of this year, British Petroleum reported profits of $5\1/2\ billion, up 135 percent over the first quarter of last year?
