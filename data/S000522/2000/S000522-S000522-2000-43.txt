Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), my good friend, for yielding the time to me.  Madam Speaker, the House has before it today a piece of legislation that will go a long way towards helping veterans and their families file claims for VA benefits. I think the gentlemanfrom New York (Mr. Quinn) rightly summarized it. The idea behind this bill is to make the VA more veterans user-friendly, so that the benefits that we owe to those who serve this country can be accorded to them.                              {time}  1045   very happy and I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Quinn), my good friend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) for their good work in crafting this legislation.  Madam Speaker, as things now stand, it is up to veterans to prove that they are entitled to receive a particular benefit. This is how the Veterans Court of Appeals interpreted, last October, the requirement that a veteran's claim be well grounded before the VA consider it. Once determined to be well grounded, the VA must help obtain evidence related to the claim's actual merits.  The preliminary process approving eligibility for a claim can be an onerous one for veterans, as well as for their families. Take, for example, the claims for service-connected disabilities. Veterans must, one, present evidence that they sustained a disease or injury during military service. We all know from our case work how often the St. Louis fire comes up. Two, a diagnosis of a current disability; and three, a medical opinion stating that the in-service injury or disease caused the current disability.  The reality is that many veterans are unable to secure the medical records and other documents that they need because of poor health, difficult economic circumstances or an unfamiliarity with how to navigate a very complex Federal bureaucracy system, and thus have their legitimate claims dismissed outright as not well grounded. Or, they just get deterred in the process.  We all know again through our case work how often a veteran will come to one of our offices or a town meeting or one-to-one meeting and say, ``I am just exhausted, will you please help me?''  Under H.R. 4864, the VA would have to help the veterans obtain service records and a medical examination if the former serviceman or woman has symptoms of a current disability or evidence of an injury or disease sustained during medical service. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 would also require other Federal agencies to furnish service records to the VA at no cost to the claimant.  Today's bill reassures veterans and their families that the country they served in uniform is on their side when it comes to getting assistance that they have more than earned. I urge support for this legislation.
