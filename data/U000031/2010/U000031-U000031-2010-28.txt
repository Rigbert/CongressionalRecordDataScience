While the name of the festival has changed throughout the years, this year's inaugural ``Sturgis Dam Days'' will surely foster lasting memories for the multitude of generations that look forward to the annual festival.  The 6-day festival brings the entire community together to celebrate the city's rich history and pay special tribute to the Sturgis Dam, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2011.  The hydroelectric dam transmits electricity 18 miles to the Sturgis Municipal Power Plant, giving Sturgis the moniker of the ``Electric City.'' While the dam generates power for the town, ask most folks about it and they will highlight the postcard-perfect views of the dam: the flowing St. Joseph River and the surrounding scenes at the adjacent Covered Bridge Park.  This year's Sturgis Dam Days festival includes a variety of events throughout the week for all to enjoy. The Sturgis Chamber of Commerce kicked off the festival by welcoming the community for dinner and the St. Joseph Sheriff's Department transformed into the Pony Express in period clothing to give the official proclamation to commence the celebration. Events throughout the week include an art fair; the American Legion Hog Roast; ``Experience Sturgis,'' a history walk through the city; a family picnic in Franks Park; a vintage Sturgis Biscuits baseball game; the Relay for Life at Sturgis High School; a parade down US-I2; and the culminating event, the Sturgis Dam Rodeo.  The festival has been a beacon of economic activity and growth through the years, and continues to draw countless families to the region each year.  I congratulate the city of Sturgis and all of its residents for sharing such a wonderful community event. Through the years the annual festival has become woven into the fabric of the lives of so many folks throughout southwest Michigan. Sturgis has such a rich heritage and offers so much to the region's families. I look forward to the festival's continued success with many more Sturgis Dam Day celebrations for years to come.                          ____________________
