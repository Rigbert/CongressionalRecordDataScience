President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Oregon in submitting this concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress that health care coverage is of the utmost importance and that a National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month should be established to promote awareness and education about the importance of health insurance coverage.  One of my top priorities in the Senate has been to expand access to affordable health care for all Americans. There still are far too many Americans without health insurance. An estimated 42 million Americans do not have health care coverage, including more than 150,000 people in Maine.  The simple fact is that people with health insurance are healthier than those who are uninsured. People without health insurance are less likely to seek care when they need it, and to forgo services such as periodic check-ups and preventive services. As a consequence, they are more likely to be hospitalized or require costly medical attention for conditions that could be preventable. Not only does this put the health of these individuals at greater risk, but it also puts additional pressures on our hospitals and emergency rooms, which already are financially challenged. Compared with people who have health coverage, uninsured adults are four times and uninsured children five times more likely to use the emergency room. The costs of care for these individuals are often absorbed by providers and passed on to the covered population through increased fees and insurance premiums.  This is one of the reasons that the cost of health insurance has soared in recent years. In Maine, employers, and in particular small employers, have faced premium increases of 15 to 30 percent or more. This is a remarkable contrast to the mid-to-late1990s, when health insurance premiums rose less than 3 percent, if at all. Clearly we must do more to make health insurance more available and affordable.  Since most Americans get their health insurance through the workplace, it is a common assumption that people without health insurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most uninsured Americans are members of families with at least one full-time worker. As many as 82 percent of Americans who do not have health insurance are in a family with a worker.  In Maine, small business is not just a segment of the economy, it is the economy. I am therefore particularly concerned that uninsured, working Americans are most often employees of small businesses. Some 60 percent of uninsured workers are employed by small firms. Small businesses want to provide health insurance for their employees, but the cost is often just too high. This is why I have introduced legislation with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, to help small employers cope with rising costs. Our bill, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act, will provide new tax credits for small businesses to help make health insurance more affordable. It will encourage those small businesses that do not currently offer health insurance to do and will help businesses that do offer insurance to continue coverage even in the face of rising costs.  While costs are clearly an problem, knowledge should not be an additional barrier to health insurance access. Public education and awareness initiatives are also critical to the success ofour efforts to expand health coverage. Many small employers are not fully aware of the laws that have already been enacted by both States and the Federal Government to make this benefit more affordable. For example, in one recent survey, 57 percent of small employers did not know that they can deduct 100 percent of their health insurance premiums as a business expense. More than 60 percent did not know that insurers may not deny them health coverage even when the health status of their workers is poor. Small businesses clearly need better information about health insurance, which is why public awareness, outreach and education programs like the one this resolution is promoting are so important.  The same is true for our public programs. One of the first bills I cosponsored as a Senator was legislation to establish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides insurance for the children of low-income parents who cannot afford health insurance, yet make too much money to qualify for Medicaid. This important program now provides affordable health insurance coverage to over two million children nationwide, including over 10,000 in Maine's Cub Care and expanded Medicaid program. Even so, hundreds of thousands of qualified children nationwide have yet to be enrolled in this program, many because their parents simply don't know that they are eligible for the assistance.  The resolution we are submitting today is simple. It expresses the sense of Congress that a National Importance of Health Care Coverage Month be established to promote a comprehensive educational effort about the importance of health care coverage; increase awareness of the available health care coverage options; and inform those eligible for public insurance programs about ways to access those programs. The resolution further calls on the President to issue a proclamation calling on the federal government, States, local governments and businesses in the United States to conduct appropriate programs and activities to promote this educational effort.  The resolution we are submitting today will assist in our efforts to expand access to affordable health care by helping small businesses, families and uninsured individuals learn more about health insurance and the various options which may already be available to them, and I urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                          ____________________
