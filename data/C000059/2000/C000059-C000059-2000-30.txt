 Madam Speaker, H.R. 4312 introduced by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson) directs the Secretary of Interior to conduct a study of the suitability and feasibility of establishing an Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage Area in the State of Connecticut and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The Housatonic River and associated valley lie in the southwestern corner of Massachusetts and the northwestern corner of Connecticut. The river flows approximately 148 miles eventually emptying into Long Island Sound. The proposed study area would consist of a 60-mile segment of the Housatonic River's watershed extending from Lanesboro, Massachusetts south to Kent, Connecticut.  H.R. 4312 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to determine whether the area has an assemblage of resources that represent distinctive assets of American heritage, reflects traditions and customs that are valuable national history, provides conservation and recreational opportunities, and contains important resources important to the identity of the area.  The study would include demonstrated local support for the heritage area, identifies a lead management entity and has a conceptual boundary map supported by the public. This is a bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4312.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
