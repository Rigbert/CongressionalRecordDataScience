'' That is going to increase the economic growth of the Nation. It makes sense to do that. Well, there is nothing that increases the economic growth of this Nation more than investing in the higher education of our children.  It is getting increasingly difficult for young men and women like me who come from a middle-income household--I guess technically lower middle-income, but a middle-income household--to be able to go off to college.  It is just getting very, very, very hard. If my father were making the money he made then now, he would be making about $34,000 a year, if I am not mistaken. He had four children he sent to college. How do you send four children to the State university--the State university--on $34,000 a year? My father, it seems to me, and my mother and their counterparts today--my dad is now 80--think that college education is the single most important legacy, other than our religion, other than our Catholicism, in my case. The single most important thing my parents wanted to leave with me was to have a college education, which they did not have.  It is getting awfully hard for people to do it. I think this is a sound investment. I think it is just. I know it is almost oratory if it is only a resolution, but it increases the prospects that we will find the wherewithal to go on record and actually change the law.  So I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I thank my friend from Minnesota for his leadership. I realize he says this is bipartisan. I heard this idea generated from my Republican colleagues as well as my Democratic colleagues. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.
