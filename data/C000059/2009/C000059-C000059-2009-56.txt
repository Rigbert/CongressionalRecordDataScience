I rise today to recognize and honor one of those individuals: Mr. Ralph Klaasen. On Friday, October 16, 2009, Ralph passed away. He will be deeply missed.  Ralph, a San Clemente resident since 1946, was a strong advocate for the south Orange County senior community for decades, serving as president of South County Senior Services and helping raise funds to build two San Clemente senior centers.  Ralph Klaasen, along with Rex Tyner, co-chaired a successful campaign to build the current senior center at 242 Avenida Del Mar in 1982 and then another campaign to build its larger successor, the Dorothy Visser Senior Center, now under construction at 121 Avenida Victoria.  Ralph also helped rally support to build Casa de Seniors, an affordable senior-housing complex. Through his work with South County Senior Services, he helped establish and administer other senior centers and programs from Dana Point to Laguna Hills.  Born in San Diego and raised in Whittier, Ralph attended Whittier College before enlisting in the Navy during World War II. He served in the Pacific Theater from Guadalcanal to Okinawa. ``There were 13 major battles and I was in 12 of them,'' he once recalled. ``It was a long ordeal.''  When the war ended in 1945, Ralph Klaasen returned to his parents' house in Dana Point. He went to work in San Clemente and worked for the city for a short period in the 1940's but spent most of his career working in banking for Bank of America, Laguna Federal Savings and Great American while raising a family in town.  As Laguna Federal's longtime branch manager, Ralph was involved in community events and local charities. In 1975, the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce saluted him as the city's Citizen of the Year.  He retired in 1985 but continued to contribute to his community. In 2001, the city honored him on San Clemente's Wall of Recognition.  Ralph's dedication to his community is a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Ralph's family and friends; although Ralph may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
