President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this measure and commend Senator Campbell for his leadership on this matter. This is a measure the Senate passed last year as S. 1644. The Senate's action in May, 2002, unfortunately met with resistance in the House of Representatives and our bill was not enacted into law last year as it should have been.  Senator Campbell correctly proceeded to reintroduce the bill as S. 330, earlier this year. The bill provides for two things: highway signs to guide visitors to veterans cemeteries and a criminal provision for the willful destruction of memorials and cemeteries for our Armed Forces veterans.  I have urged all Senators, Republicans and Democrats, to support this modest legislative effort to help honor our Armed Forces veterans. In addition, of course, I will continue to support efforts to improve medical services, veterans hospitals, and other benefits for the women and men who risk and have risked their lives and livelihoods to protect all of us.  I asked the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to include this matter on the agenda for Judiciary Committee action last week I thank him for accommodating our request and am happy that this bill was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee to the full Senate. I am confident that the Senate will again pass it. I trust that this year the House of Representatives will act favorably on this good legislation to honor our veterans.
