 President, March 30 marks the fifth anniversary of the horrific terrorist attack against the Khmer Nation Party (KNP) in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.  Nineteen people were killed, and 141 injured, when four grenades were thrown during a legal and peaceful rally organized by opposition leader Sam Rainsy to protest the lack of justice and the rule of law in Cambodia. Among the injured was American democracy-worker Ron Abney.  Sam Rainsy's message was right on the mark. There was no justice in Cambodia then, and there is none today.  On this tragic anniversary, the United States and other freedom-loving countries should condemn the corrupt and ineffective Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) for failing to protect its citizens and to investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of this terrorist crime.  Unlike hard line Prime Minister Hun Sen and certain diplomats in Phnom Penh, this Senator has not forgotten those murdered and injured by terrorists on March 30, 1997. This Senator vividly recalls the desecration by Cambodian authorities of the Buddhist stupa erected by the opposition party in the memory of those senselessly killed. And this Senator is left wondering why the RGC expended more time and effort destroying the stupa than investigating the crime itself.  I ask that the U.S. Senate honor the memory of those slain in the terrorist attack by having the names of the victims publicly known appear in the Record following my remarks. The victims and their families remain in my thoughts and prayers are:  Mr. Cheth Duong Daravuth; Mr. Han Mony; Mr. Sam Sarin; Ms. Yong Sok Neuv; Ms. Yong Srey; Ms. Yos Siem; Ms. Chanty Pheakdey; Mr. Ros Sear; Ms. Sok Kheng; Mr. Yoeun Yorn; Mr. Chea Nang; and Mr. Nam Thy.                          ____________________
