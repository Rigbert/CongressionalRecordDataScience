Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I know the Speaker of the House, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), is on the floor and he is about to leave. With him is his deputy chief of staff, Mr. Stokke. Before he leaves, I want to take the opportunity to thank him and Mr. Stokke. Both of these gentlemen were vitally interested in this legislation. Both were extraordinarily helpful in seeking its passage. The Speaker has committed to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I that he will work with us to make sure that this obligation is not an unfunded mandate, but in fact that we give the States the resources necessary. I wanted to thank the Speaker before he leaves the floor and thank Mr. Stokke, as well.
