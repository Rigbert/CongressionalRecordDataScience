Speaker, I thank the Majority Leader. You announced next week you expect to have legislative business on Monday through Friday. For purposes of planning, how confident are you that we will be here on Friday? Do you think we might be able to get through our work by Thursday evening?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, our current plan is to consider the State Department authorization during the early part of the week, followed by NASA authorization and concluding the week with the PATRIOT Act. I would expect debate on both the PATRIOT Act and the State Department authorization bill to take a considerable amount of time. I would imagine that both of those bills will have a number of amendments. Because of that, Members need to be prepared to be here voting next Friday.
