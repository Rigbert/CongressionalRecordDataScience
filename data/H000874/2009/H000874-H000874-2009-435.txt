If you talk to your leaders and the majority, they will tell you it is more daunting than it first appears.  Having said that, obviously, the schedule has been submitted to all the Members, all the Members know what we have scheduled in terms of days to be in session. Hopefully they have notice of that, they are cognizant of that, particularly their schedulers are cognizant of that.  We have provided, we believe, sufficient days in which to do the work that the American public expects us to get done and that we expect that needs to be done. If there are more days, we will add days.  Having said that, we are in, obviously, the first weeks of the session. A lot has been going on, which is not on the floor, simply in getting organized, the committees getting organized, getting committee members appointed by both the Republican and the Democratic sides so that much has been going on, notwithstanding the fact there have been long days on the floor. But in the early days of the session, obviously, much is going on to get ready for future floor action.
