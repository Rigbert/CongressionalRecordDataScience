 I had the pleasure of getting to know Rachel over the course of her 24-year career with the Secret Service--and I can say, with the utmost confidence, that she served our country with dignity and integrity every step of the way.  Whenever I or another Member of Congress would visit the White House, we could always count on Rachel to greet us with a smile or funny story. And whenever foreign dignitaries visited Capitol Hill, we could always count on Rachel to be right there with them, ensuring that foreign officials had a safe and comfortable experience while visiting our Nation's capital.  Rachel always fulfilled her duties with all of the dependability, professionalism and love of country that one would expect from a Secret Service agent. But she also brought a kind and lighthearted nature to the job that I, for one, will never forget.  And let me add that I have had the pleasure of employing Secret Service agents in my office through Congressional fellowship programs and, like Rachel, each and every one of them has represented the best our Nation has to offer.  From her upbringing in Orange City, Iowa, to her studies at Northwestern and Sangamon State Universities, to the U.S. Secret Service, Rachel has always excelled and stood out as a leader and as someone people can count on.  As she moves on to bigger and better things, I'd like to congratulate Rachel Klay on a proud career of service to our country and wish her the best of luck in whatever the future holds.                          ____________________
