President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care Quality Incentive Act of 2003.  This legislation seeks to address low child care payment or reimbursement rates. Payment rates determine the level at which States will reimburse child care providers who care for those low-income children who receive a subsidy.  Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care children get and whether families can find quality child care in their communities. Low payment rates mean limited parental access to quality child care.  Child care providers are also affected when rates are set below the market rate. Low payment rates force child care providers serving low-income children to cut corners in ways that lower the quality of child care such as reducing staff or decreasing salaries and benefits, eliminating professional development opportunities, and forgoing books and other literacy materials. Providers who avoid this route may simply not accept low-income children with subsidies or may even go out of business.  These dilemmas can be avoided if we help states set payment rates that keep pace with the marketplace.  Currently, the Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG, requires States to ensure that their rates are sufficient to ``ensure equal access'' for eligible families to child care services comparable to those available to non-eligible families in the private market. CCDBG regulations require states to conduct market rate surveys everyother year, but there is no requirement for states to actually use the market rate surveys to set payment rates.  Unfortunately, more than half of the States do not make payment rates based on the 75th percentile, by which families could access care from 75 out of 100 local providers, of a current market survey.  The need for quality child care has never been greater, as our welfare reform policy directs more of our low-income families to find work and our educational policy demands more of our students and schools. Yet, States, due to severe budget crunches, are cutting back on rates and other quality initiatives and restricting eligibility for subsidies.  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Dodd, Kennedy, and Murray in once again introducing the Child Care Quality Incentive Act, which seeks to redouble our child care efforts and renew the child care partnership with the States by providing incentive funding to increase payment rates.  Our legislation establishes a new, mandatory pool of funding under the Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG. This new funding, coupled with mandatory, current market rate surveys, will form the foundation for significant increases in state payment rates for the provision of quality child care.  We have received overwhelming support for this bill from the child care community, including endorsements from USA Child Care, Children's Defense Fund, Catholic Charities of USA, YMCA of USA, the National Child Care Association, and a host of organizations and agencies across the country.  Children are the hope of America, and they need the best of America. We cannot ask working families to choose between paying the rent, buying food, and being able to afford the quality care their children need. We've made a lot of progress in improving the health, safety, and well-being of children in this country. If we are serious about putting parents to work and protecting children, we must invest more in child care help for families.  This year, Congress is slated to reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The time for action on rates is now. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, Murray, and me in this endeavor to improve the quality of child care by cosponsoring the Child Care Quality Incentive Act and working to include its provisions in the CCDBG reauthorization.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 668       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive      Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that      much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and      nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care      and education leads to increased cognitive abilities,      positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of      long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term      economic and social self-sufficiency.       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including      6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day      in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1      in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy      development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care      that threatens the safety and health of children.       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $12,000 per      year.       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child      care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal      subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For      families with young children and a monthly income under      $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent      of their income.       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the      maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for      the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to      ensure that quality care is accessible to all families.       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care      children get and whether families can find quality child care      in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates      force child care providers serving low-income children to cut      corners in ways that impact the quality of care for the      children, including reducing the number of staff, eliminating      professional development opportunities, and cutting enriching      educational activities and services.       (7) Children in low-quality child care are more likely to      have delayed reading and language skills, and display more      aggression toward other children and adults.       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child      care as child care providers are able to attract and retain      qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional      training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and      purchase basic supplies, children's literature, and      developmentally appropriate educational materials.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the      quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child      care payment rates.     SEC. 3. PAYMENT RATES.
