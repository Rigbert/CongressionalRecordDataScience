We are facing a ``perfect storm'' of exceedingly cold winter weather, high energy prices, and a difficult economy.  This amendment is a modest amendment with very little budget impact. But it is an amendment that will make a real difference in the lives of low-income families in Maine and States across the Nation.  No one should have to choose between being warm in the winter, buying prescription drugs, or buying the food they need to remain healthy. This amendment will address the needs of thousands of low-income families across this Nation so that they will not be faced with those choices.  Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment.
