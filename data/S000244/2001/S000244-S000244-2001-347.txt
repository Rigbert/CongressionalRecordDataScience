Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 119, and I would like to commend the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Myrick), the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), the chairman of the Committee on Rules, and all of the members of the Committee on Rules for their hard work on this fair rule.  Mr. Speaker, this rule is almost identical to the rule passed in the 106th Congress to consider similar legislation that provides for thorough consideration of H.R. 503 by authorizing 2 hours of debate and an opportunity for the minority to offer a substitute amendment which will be debated for 1 hour. This is a fair rule which will provide ample time for both debate and amendment.  Furthermore, the rule provides that the amendment committed in the Committee on Rules report, which makes a technical change to the Uniform Code of Military Justice shall be considered as adopted when the rule is adopted. I appreciate the indulgence of the Committee on Rules with regard to the small perfecting provision, and I would also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump) for working with me to facilitate the consideration of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this rule.
