President, it is with great sorrow, but also great pride, that this Senate retires one of its most eloquent, learned, and successful Members--the senior Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  I have known my distinguished colleague for over two decades, admiring his compassion, his dedication, and his acumen on key issues, from environmental protection to social, racial, and economic justice for all. It has been an honor and education to have worked with him on the critical issues of eradicating poverty, elevating human rights, and promoting peace around the world. He and I have also worked together closer to home, protecting and restoring the precious waters of Lake Champlain--a glacially-carved jewel of New England that spans 120 northern miles between our neighboring states, half claimed on my side, half claimed on his.  Twenty-four years of distinguished service in the United States Senate would be a legacy in and of itself for any man. Yet my colleague, Senator Moynihan, has done so much more. He served our country for a full twenty years in the Naval Reserve, with three years of active Navy duty at the end of the second World War. He has been a Fulbright Scholar and a professor of government at Harvard University. He has the unique distinction of serving in four successive Presidential administrations--the only person in American history to have ever done so. He represented our country as a distinguished Ambassador to India, a representative to the United Nations, and President of the U.N. Security Council. He has served on countless public and private sector commissions, committees, and panels, addressing issues from education to science to finance. Most recently, he chaired the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy--a key commission that examined our nation's secrecy laws and led to his authorship of ``Secrecy: The American Experience.'' This book joins the seventeen other works of literature that my friend and colleague has written or edited.  What I will miss in many ways are those special times we would have when some Members would gather in the Senate dining room and a person would bring up a question of history; then we would receive a tutorial from Professor Moynihan. I see my good friend, the deputy Democratic leader, on the floor, the Senator from Nevada, smiling because he knows what those were like. I recall a couple times when we had so many Democrats and Republicans crowded into the Democratic part of the dining room to hear Senator Moynihan tie together something from the time of Franklin Roosevelt through Ronald Reagan, to the current time, and show what the connection was, somebody would have to call up to the Senate Chamber and explain, keep the rollcall going a bit longer; at least a quorum of the Senate has to hear the end of this story before we can come to vote.  My good friend will be missed in the Senate, but I wish him well and envy him the time he will now have to spend with his lovely wife of 44 years, Liz, his three wonderful children, and his precious grandchildren. I join the entire Senate and this Nation in wishing Senator Moynihan well in his new life and commending him for his tireless dedication and service to the people of this country and our world.                          ____________________
