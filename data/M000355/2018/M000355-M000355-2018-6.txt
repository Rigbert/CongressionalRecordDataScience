 Vice President and colleagues, here where we are. It is now clear there are enough votes to proceed to the pending legislation on government funding, disaster relief, and border security.  Within the Republican conference, there is strong support for the President's reasonable request for more resources to tackle the urgent situation at our southern border. Republicans support the House-passed bill, which includes additional border security funding. We are also, however, eager to complete the remaining appropriations bills that the Senate has already passed.  However, obviously, since any eventual solution requires 60 votes here in the Senate, it has been clear from the beginning that two things are necessary: support from enough Senate Democrats to pass the proposal at 60 and a Presidential signature.  As a result, the Senate has voted to proceed to legislation before us in order to preserve maximum flexibility for a productive conversation to continue between the White House and our Democratic colleagues. I hope Senate Democrats will work with the White House on an agreement that can pass both Houses of Congress and receive the President's signature.  Colleagues, when an agreement is reached, it will receive a vote here on the Senate floor.                            Motion to Concur  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 695.
