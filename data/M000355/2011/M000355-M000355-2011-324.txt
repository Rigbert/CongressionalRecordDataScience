 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the incredible endeavors of a hardworking and extremely talented Kentuckian, Chris Grigsby of Laurel County, KY. Chris's lifetime of experience has taken him to many places, but he has always been proud to call Kentucky home.  Chris Grigsby graduated from Laurel County High School in London, KY. At the age of nine he taught himself how to play the guitar, mandolin, bass, and the fiddle, and continues to play and teach them to his family, stating that music is a major part of his life. After graduating high school, Mr. Grigsby enrolled in the Marine Corps.  Mr. Grigsby's passion for his position in the Marine Corps grew as he continued to travel the world and experience the endless opportunities that it provided. He was stationed for 2 years at Camp David where he was able to work closely with President Ronald Reagan. As his years in the Marine Corps came to a close, Grigsby found talent in other professions including, auctioning, truck driving, as well as being a police and security officer.  After working as a truck driver for 3 years, then as an officer with the London Police Department, as well as conducting his own truck hauling service, Grigsby came to realize his true passion was to be closer to home with his wife Bobbie and their family of five. As he set aside his traveling days he was offered a job at the U.S. Courthouse where he continues to be the lead court security officer. This August 17, Chris and Bobbie will celebrate their 21st marriage anniversary.  Chris Grigsby is a man who gives so others can prosper, and leads by setting an example. His life stands as an illustration that kindness does go a long way. A wonderful article about Mr. Chris Grigsby appeared recently in the Sentinel Echo, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Sentinel Echo, May 2, 2011]          All That He's Done, His Children Are His Number One                            (By Sue Minton)       If gas prices were as high in 1968 as they are today, then      2-year-old Chris Grigsby and     his family may have been residents of Rockcastle County      instead of Laurel County.       Grigsby likes to joke about how his family came to Laurel      County.       ``They were originally from Perry County. My grandparents      and parents were part of the migration north to find jobs in      the late 50s and early 60s,'' he said.       In 1968 his parents decided to come back to Kentucky from      Michigan. ``I joke, they were moving back to Hazard and ran      out of gas in London and just stayed,'' Grigsby said. ``But      they didn't.''       Before the Pomp and Circumstance of his 1984 graduation      played out, Grigsby had joined the Marines. He graduated from      Laurel County High School in June and reported to boot camp      on Halloween Day.       He referred to his stay in the Marine Corps as the ``best      worst'' thing that has ever happened to him.       ``It gave me the opportunity to get out and see a little      bit of the world,'' he said. ``I always wanted to be a part      of something. If I was going to do anything, I wanted to be      the best at it that I could. And the Marines have the      reputation of being the toughest `the elite.' You join the      Army, you join the Navy, but you become a Marine.''       While at Parris Island in boot camp he was selected for the      Yankee White Program.       ``I was stationed at Marine Barracks `8th and I' in      Washington, D.C., the oldest post in the Marine Corps,'' he      said. ``While waiting on White House security clearance I got      selected to go to the Pentagon. I was there for three months      working with Casper Weinberger on a security detail for the      secretary of defense,''       Once Grigsby received his clearance he was stationed at      Camp David for two years.       ``We primarily worked internal security for the camp,'' he      said. ``I worked my way up through the ranks to the position      of platoon sergeant. And that put me in direct contact with      President Ronald Reagan.''       Grigsby recalls eating lunch with President Reagan once and      remembers how nice the event was. ``He was the most wonderful      person. There was no faultness to him. Sometimes you meet      people and they put on this air of caring, but I felt like he      genuinely cared about the people.''       In 1988 Grigsby was discharged from the Marines and      considers himself lucky.       ``I remember vividly, in 1990 we were in the middle of      Operation Desert Shield. My trucking partner and I were going      to Union City, Tenn., to get a load of tires for Toyota. We      were about Elizabethtown when the radio announced that we      were taking fire and that was the start of Desert Storm. I      was very fortunate that I got in and out before it began.''       After his stay in the Marines, Grigsby worked as an      auctioneer, long-haul truck driver, police officer and a      security officer.       ``While in the marines I attended auctioneer school and      tried my hand at that,'' he said. ``Vernon Holt, a local      agent with Century 21, sponsored me to get my apprentice      license. I went to California to help a cousin get his      auction business started. But I never really pursued it.''       But, while `trying his hand' at it Grigsby met his wife,      Bobbie.       ``I was working as an auctioneer at the stockyard in      Richmond, trying to get my foot in the auctioneer door. She      was there with her family buying horses and I met her at the      diner, On August 17, we will be married 21 years.''       When auctioneering didn't work out, Grigsby decided he      would like to learn how to drive a tractor-trailer. He went      to truck driving school and long-hauled for about three years      traveling to any place that was east of Denver, Colo.,      delivering mostly Toyota parts.       After being laid off from truck driving, he was hired as an      officer for the London Police Department. While there he was      one of the first officers to implement the narcotics K-9      Unit.       After leaving the London Police Department he once again      decided to truck. This time buying his own vehicle.       ``I went back on the road for financial opportunities,'' he      said, ``hauling whatever needed to go wherever for seven      years. My claim is I've hauled everything from asbestos to      zucchini.''       ``I liked seeing the country, but it was difficult for me.      By this time we had two of our five children, and we were a      close family. It was hard to be gone. There were things at      home that needed my attention. In 2002 I got out of the      trucking business and went to work at the United States      Courthouse.''       Currently Grigsby is the lead court security officer. He is      the supervisor of a crew of men that are special deputies      U.S. Marshals. ``We primarily provide security for the      courthouse, the judges and visitors.''       Grigsby said on a couple of occasions they have had some      excitement.       ``We have been fortunate. It is not something that occurs      every day. But there is a chance that it could happen,'' he      added. ``Security work is not what we do, it is what we can      do and what we will do. We put our lives on the line every      day. It is kind of like police work, but then it is not. In      security you have to be ready to go from zero to all out in a      split second. But, I like the job. it has all the      necessities--pay is good, home time is good.''       Grigsby spends some of what spare time he has playing      music.       ``I have played music since I was nine years old,'' he      said. ``Music is a major part of my life and my family's      lives.''       Grigsby, a self-taught musician, plays the guitar, fiddle,      mandolin and bass. His older children, Emily and Charlie, who      have had a few lessons but are taught mostly by their Dad,      play several instruments.       ``And it will just be a matter of time before Sarah and      Grace start playing,'' he said. ``They, Emily and Charlie,      along with Sarah sing and Grace does some,'' he said. Grigsby      and Bobbie also sing. They perform a wide variety of      different music, but mostly gospel.       ``Music has always been a part of my life. Some families      play sports--basketball, baseball, cheerleading--we play      music. And through our music we have been to Laurel Heights,      Laurel Village, and assisted living homes playing and singing      for the people. We also play at festivals, schools and our      church, Corinth Baptist.''       Grigsby feels his biggest achievement is his children--     Emily, Charlie, Sarah, Grace and 10-month-old Danica.       When the interview was almost over, Grigsby referred to a      scene in the movie ``Evan Almighty.''       ``God contacts Evan to build an ark. There is one part      where his wife, Joan, is upset because they are having to      leave, and God appears to her and says ``If someone prays for      patience, do you think God gives them patience? Or does he      give them the opportunity to be patient? That stuck with me.      The world would be a much better place if we were kinder to      each other. We live in such a traumatic world. If we would      just take the time to speak to someone at the store or on the      street and just be friendly, that would be the difference.      That's what I try to do, just be kind to others.''                          ____________________
