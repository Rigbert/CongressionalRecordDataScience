Frelinghuysen), who is our ranking member.  I appreciate your kind words. Certainly, as we head forward to 2010, I look forward to the continued bipartisanship that we have enjoyed on the subcommittee both at a member and at a staff level.  I simply want to address Members of the House to share my concern with the ranking member about the final number relative to the Yucca Mountain depository as far as nuclear waste. I would point out that, in fiscal year 2008, $286 million was provided for that project. I would point out that the House mark for this project was $60 million higher. We were at $247 million. Unfortunately, a compromise was obviously involved here. The figure ultimately ended up at $145 million. I am not happy with it. The gentleman expressed his unhappiness.  Certainly, I want to continue to work--looking at all of these nuclear accounts and as a supporter of nuclear as part of the solution to our energy problem and climate problem--to make sure that this is not untoward as far as the continued progress of the industry. So I do appreciate and share the gentleman's concern.
