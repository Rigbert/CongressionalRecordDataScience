The Senator probably saw the survey that there are people against giving families the right to hold health insurance companies accountable in court, and they say, well, if you work for an employer who provides health insurance, those families may turn around and sue the employer, as opposed to the health insurance company. So we looked at that and did a survey; we investigated. We found out that only in a very rare situation has that occurred. Here is an example.  In one circumstance, the employer collected the health insurance premiums from the employee and then didn't pay the health insurance company. So when the family tried to get coverage for medical care, the next thing that occurred was they found out the premiums had not been paid by the employer. That was the only example we could find. But if the employer picks a health insurance company and they make a decision, we could not find a single case where the employer was held liable because of the health insurance company's bad medical decision.  So that, I think, is a red herring, one that really does a disservice to American families who deserve this right.
