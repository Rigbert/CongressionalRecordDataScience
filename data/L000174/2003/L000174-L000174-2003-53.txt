President, I heard the Senator's question about delaying on this question of judges. Could it be that our friends on the other side, having blocked 61 of the President's nominees usually because of one Republican's objection, are concerned that Democrats have helped confirm a record number of President Bush's nominees, has stopped less than any President in recent history, and that maybe they want to obscure their own record and not be in the position to praise ours?
