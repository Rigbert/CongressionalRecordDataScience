President, I wish to discuss an amendment that would expand the Financial Stability Council established in S. 3217 to include the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration. It is important that the council incorporate a Federal credit union regulator to ensure consumer regulation protections. Ninety-two million Americans are members of credit unions.  Insofar as S. 3217, section 1023 provides that any member agency of the council may set aside a final regulation or provision prescribed by the bureau, a national credit union representative should sit on the council to ensure fairness for its members.  Moreover, similar legislation passed by the House included the Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration in its Financial Services Oversight Council, so this amendment would make the composition of the council in both the House and Senate consistent.  Finally, given their size, no single credit union poses a systemic risk to the overall U.S. financial system.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this statement and the supporting letters from the Credit Union National Association, the largest credit union advocacy organization representing nearly 90 percent of America's 8,700 State and federally chartered credit unions, National Credit Union Administration, and the National Association of Federal Credit Unions.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Credit Union National                                                  Association,                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2010.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Credit Union      National Association, I am writing in support of your      amendment to S. 3217 which would add the National Credit      Union Administration (NCUA) to the Financial Stability      Oversight Council (the Council). CUNA is the largest credit      union advocacy organization representing nearly 90 percent of      America's 8,700 state and federally chartered credit unions      and their 92 million members.       Because of the relative size of credit unions, we believe      no single credit union is large enough to impose any systemic      risk on the overall financial system. Nevertheless, we      believe there would be value in having the federal credit      union regulator on the Council if for no other reason than      Section 1023 of the underlying bill gives the members of the      Council the authority to petition to stay or set aside rules      promulgated by the Bureau under limited circumstances when      the rules may put the safety and soundness of the banking      system or the stability of the financial sector of the United      States at risk. Your amendment would ensure that the credit      union regulator has a voice in the review of the consumer      regulations.       The House-passed version of this legislation includes the      NCUA Chairman on the Financial Services Oversight Council;      therefore, your amendment would eliminate a difference      between the House-passed version and the Senate bill under      consideration and ensure that all of the federal financial      regulators are part of the Council.       On behalf of America's credit unions, thank you very much      for introducing this amendment. We look forward to working      with you to secure its inclusion in S. 3217.           Sincerely,                                                   Daniel A. Mica,     President & CEO.                                  ____                                                   National Credit                                         Union Administration,                                      Alexandria, VA, May 5, 2010.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins:       Thank you for your leadership in drafting an amendment to      S. 3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of      2010, to add the Chairman of the National Credit Union      Administration (NCUA) as a voting member of the Financial      Stability Oversight Council (the Council).       I have had the opportunity to review the proposed      amendment. I wish to express my strong support for both the      amendment and the underlying bill.       As you know, the NCUA was not included as a member of the      Council in the legislation as reported by the Senate      Committee on     Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Among other duties and      responsibilities, members of the Council may petition the      full Council to set aside a rule (or a part thereof) issued      by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection if that rule      threatens the safety and soundness of the U.S. financial      sector or our system of depository institutions.       It bears noting that the NCUA Chairman is a designated      member of the Consumer Financial Protection Oversight Board      in the House-passed measure. If adopted, I believe your      amendment would help harmonize the House and Senate bills      with respect to oversight of the Consumer Financial      Protection Agency or Bureau, particularly in regard to the      credit union system.       Thank you again for your leadership on this important      matter and for the opportunity to review and comment on your      amendment.           Sincerely,                                                      Debbie Matz,     Chairman.                                  ____                                           National Association of                                        Federal Credit Unions,                                       Arlington, VA, May 5, 2010.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing on behalf of the      National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU), the      only trade organization exclusively representing the      interests of our nation's federal credit unions, in support      of your amendment to the Restoring American Financial      Stability Act of 2010 (S. 3217) that would add the Chairman      of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to the      Financial Stability Oversight Council established in the      underlying bill.       We applaud your efforts to ensure that the voices of credit      unions are heard by placing NCUA on the oversight council. As      you know, this is an issue of fairness and will enable the      NCUA to petition for the review of a rule issued by the      Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Without passage of      this amendment, credit unions would not have the ability to      appeal rule making that could have a detrimental effect on      the credit union industry.       We thank you and your staff for your work on this amendment      as the Senate takes up comprehensive financial regulatory      reform. If we can answer any questions or provide you with      further information on this matter, please do not hesitate to      contact me or NAFCU's Director of Legislative Affairs Brad      Thaler at (703) 522-4770.           Sincerely,                                                B. Dan Berger,                                         Executive Vice President,     Government Affairs.                          ____________________
