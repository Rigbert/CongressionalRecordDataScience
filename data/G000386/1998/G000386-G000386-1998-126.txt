 In doing this, I have seen personally what is happening all across my state because of growing illegal drug use. This doesn't just affect kids, although they are the most vulnerable for use. Drug use affects whole families and communities. I agree that we must speak out against efforts to make our drug problem worse than it already is. We need to blow the whistle on these efforts to legalize by indirect means. I want to thank my distinguished colleague for taking the time to help me think through these issues.
