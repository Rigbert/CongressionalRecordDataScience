Chairman, I have to reclaim my time.  I would simply respond to the gentleman that we want to drive home the point, because it is not a coincidence that the Ex-Im Bank found religion on Monday of last week. The fact is, and it is not a coincidence, that today and yesterday and last year the Ex-Im Bank, under their policy handbook and under the law, were prohibited from making a loan like that.  It is a fact that the Secretary of Commerce wrote to the Ex-Im Bank and said, ``Do not make this loan. You have 280 million excess tons. You have lost 23,000 jobs in this country. You have 18 companies in bankruptcy, andanother one went over the cliff last Monday.''  They do not listen. The only thing they are going to understand is this entire House today voting to cut the recommendation that is contained in this bill, which I again would emphasize would leave the Ex-Im Bank at $100 million more than the President of the United States asked for in his budget request.  I would implore my colleagues to vote for the Mollohan-Visclosky amendment.
