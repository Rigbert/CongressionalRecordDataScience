Speaker, I rise to congratulate MedStar St. Mary's Hospital in Leonardtown, Maryland, for being named one of the Nation's 100 Top Hospitals by Truven Health Analytics.  This honor comes as St. Mary's concludes celebrations marking its centennial year, having been established in 1912 to provide quality medical care to families in rural St. Mary's County. Over the years, as the County's communities have grown, so too have its medical needs, and St. Mary's Hospital has become a full-service hospital with ninety-five beds and state-of-the-art facilities.  St. Mary's Hospital provides surrounding communities with inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services with a reputation for compassionate care and excellence in performance. It's no wonder to those of us familiar with St. Mary's Hospital that it has achieved the distinction this year as one of the hundred best hospitals in America.  Last August, St. Mary's Hospital received an $84,335 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Rural Health Network Development Planning Grant Program. This grant is supporting the development of a Community Health Center Planning Network to meet the needs of underserved areas in rural St. Mary's County. Improving access to affordable care for those living in Maryland's Fifth District remains one of my highest priorities. I was proud to have helped St. Mary's Hospital secure the grant, and I look forward to continuing to work with its administrators and staff to ensure it has the resources it needs to fulfill its mission of providing quality care in our communities.  I join in thanking all the doctors, nurses, administrators, support staff, and emergency responders who have made St. Mary's Hospital the success it is today. After a century of service to Southern Maryland, St. Mary's is surely headed for many more years of excellence.                          ____________________
