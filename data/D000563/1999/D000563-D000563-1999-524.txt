President, during the course of this week we have come to the Senate floor many times to discuss pending legislation of great importance to families across America.  Last night--I guess this morning, in the early morning hours--the House of Representatives failed to pass the gun control legislation which the Senate enacted 3 weeks ago.  You may remember that Vice President Gore came to the floor, cast the deciding vote, broke the tie, and we passed a bill which would try to close the loopholes for the sales of firearms at so-called gun shows, trying to find a way--any way we can--to reduce the likelihood that guns will get into the hands of children and criminals.  America's heart was broken by Littleton, CO. Families across America, who may have heard these numbing statistics about 13 children a day dying, finally realized it could happen there--it could happen in Littleton, CO, in Conyers, GA, in Jonesboro, AR, in Pearl, MS, West Paducah, KY, Springfield, OR, or in Springfield, IL, my hometown. It could happen anywhere.  Guns are just too easy to come by in America. Troubled kids, who are always a problem, become tragedies when they take these guns into the classrooms, killing their classmates and teachers.  So we passed legislation, good legislation, bipartisan legislation, and sent it to the House of Representatives. Frankly, they decided, because of the political heat that might be generated, to call for a vote in the middle of the night, at 1:15 in the morning, to ask the House of Representatives to go on the Record, because the leadership in the House thought Americans would not notice it if it happened in the middle of the night. The National Rifle Association did not think Americans would care. They are both wrong.  America understands what happened in the dark of night. There was a shot in the dark, and it hit American families right where they live--families who worry about whether sending their kids to school anymore is a safe thing to do, families who wonder, when they say good-bye to their child in the morning, if those are the last words they will ever share with their child.  That is where we are in America. That is where gun violence has brought us. But this is not a fatal shot on the American families. They have, I guess, the hope and the confidence that this Congress will come to its senses and once and for all say no to these gun lobbies and yes to safety in our schools.  The big debate in the House was whether or not we ought to post the Ten Commandments in schools. Let me go on the Record and say I support values for families. I support strengthening families. I believe that those families who believe, as my family did, that the practice of religion is an important part of values, those families should be encouraged in every way whatsoever. We should make sure our kids grow up with values. But it is so naive to believe that simply posting the Ten Commandments in schools is going to change the climate in America.  Perhaps, though, we could post the Ten Commandments at the gun shows and underline the Commandment that says: Thou shalt not kill, saying to people who want to buy and sell these guns without any background checks, accept your moral responsibility for what is about to occur.  The Illinois State Police did a survey of the crime guns they had confiscated recently and found over 25 percent of them came out of these gun shows, sold to people who, frankly, face no background check whatsoever.  We tried to close that loophole in the Senate; the House has failed. We cannot leave this issue alone.                          ____________________
