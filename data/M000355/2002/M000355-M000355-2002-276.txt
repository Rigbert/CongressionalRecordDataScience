 It seems to me that is a particularly inappropriate use of the Social Security surplus, which is, in fact, going to be spent this year on such items as fighting the war abroad and homeland security.  I want to echo the comments of Senator Kit Bond. There are 64,337 precincts in America that use punchcards. Nearly 50 million voters vote on punchcards. The practical effect of the amendment of the Senator from Illinois is to replace the vast majority of those with some system, which is why the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the committee, who would otherwise be in favor of this amendment, has stated that this begins to unravel the bill.  If we mandate a particular voting system in this way, there will be lots of other amendments coming in mandating other kinds of methods of voting. So I hope this amendment will be defeated. I think it is a path we do not want to go down if we are serious about trying to enact this legislation. I know the chairman of the committee and I are certainly serious about it. We think it would be a step in the right direction and an appropriate step to take. We have managed to get together on the bipartisan basis and we hope we can keep that bipartisan spirit together and move this bill toward passage.  I am unaware of any other debate. Did Senator Bond reserve the remainder of his time?
