 President, last year we approved the most comprehensive welfare reform this Nation has ever known. Because the changes were so comprehensive, this body approved the bill with much reservation, particularly on the provision for the elderly and disabled legal immigrants.  Today, I correct one of the major challenges left over from the welfare reform last year that if uncorrected, will have a devastating impact on the States and counties by shifting the cost of caring for the seriously ill and destitute disabled and elderly legal immigrants who have absolutely no other means of support.  I am here to offer the Elderly and Disabled Legal Immigrant Support Act with Senator Boxer as the cosponsor in the Senate, and Congressman Campbell and Congresswoman Lofgren as sponsors in the House of Representatives.  The Elderly and Disabled Legal Immigrant Support Act of 1997 would exempt from the current ban on SSI, those elderly, disabled and/or blind legal immigrants, who came to this country prior to passage of the welfare bill--August 22, 1996, who can demonstrate that they have no family and have no other source of support. This legislation prohibits SSI for all legal immigrants coming to this country following the date of enactment of the welfare reform bill, August 22, 1996.  This legislation corrects what I believe is a grave mistake in the Federal welfare reform law--a blanket denial of SSI to all legal noncitizens, no matter how elderly, disabled, destitute and ill they may be.  Over 20 California county supervisors, both Republican and Democrat, have spoken out, in one voice, that the legal immigrant provisions of the welfare law will be disastrous for California counties and this legislation is critical for the Counties and for the country.  In California alone, 200,000 to 326,000 people may lose SSI by August 22, 1997.  Los Angeles County estimates that eliminating benefits for 93,000 legal immigrants in its county could cost up to $236 million a year.  San Francisco estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn to the county's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to $74 million.  Many top immigrant States and counties will also bear the burden of caring for the elderly, disabled, and blind legal immigrants who are banned from SSI.  New York--126,860 legal immigrants may lose their SSI, costing the State approximately $240 million annually.  Florida--77,920 legal immigrants may lose their SSI, costing the State approximately $300 million annually.  Texas--59,160 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  Illinois--25,960 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  New Jersey--25,500 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  Massachusetts--25,140 legal immigrants may lose their SSI.  The Republican Governors who supported the welfare reform bill now realize that the new law, as written, will result in a huge financial cost-shift to their states.  President Clinton has also recognized that legal immigrants who become disabled after entry should not be banned from SSI and food stamps and has allocated $13.7 billion in the 1998 budget for this population who have nowhere else to turn.  As we speak, 125,000 SSI cancellation notices are going out to elderly, disabled, and blind legal immigrants every week. Many elderly and disabled legal immigrants have absolutely no family or friends to turn to for support and will be destitute. They have no one to turn to, except county relief programs or, at worst, homeless shelters. Effective August 22 of this year, all legal immigrants currently receiving SSI will be cut from the rolls regardless of their circumstances.  I know that prior to welfare reform, the door was open for sponsors to bring in their parents and then neglect to support them or, if they are unable to support them, to know that legal immigrants were eligible for SSI. The number of noncitizens collecting SSI had increased by 477 percent in the 14 years from 1980 to 1994, while for citizens the numbers increased by 33 percent during the same period. Clearly, one can extrapolate from these statistics that legal immigrants were using SSI at 15 times the rate of citizens.  I hold the sponsors accountable for the support of legal immigrants they bring into the country who they have pledged to support. But the Federal welfare reform banning SSI for virtually all legal immigrants--even those whose sponsors cannot afford to support them, or those refugees who have no sponsors at all--will create extreme hardship for those elderly, blind, and disabled legal immigrants who are unable to support themselves.  Let me tell you the story about a 73-year-old legal immigrant in San Francisco on SSI. She was welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee from Communism with no family in the United States. She speaks no English and she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis three times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will lose SSI, her only source of support. Her well-being will become the responsibility of the county.  I urge my colleagues to seriously consider and support this limited exemption from the current ban on SSI by allowing those elderly, blind, or disabled individuals, who were in the country prior to August 22, 1996, and who have no other means of support, to continue on SSI. The ban on SSI would apply to those coming into the country after August 22, 1996.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a chart on number of aliens receiving SSI payments by legal status and State be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 392       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. EXCEPTION TO ELIGIBILITY RESTRICTIONS FOR PUBLIC                    BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN LEGAL ALIENS.       (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title V of the Illegal      Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996      (Public Law 104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-1772) is amended by      adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 511. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN LEGAL ALIENS.       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, an alien who was lawfully present in the United States      on August 22, 1996, and who lawfully resides in a State, is      age 65 or older, is disabled and/or blind, as determined      under paragraph (2) and/or (3) of section 1614(a) of the      Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1382c(a)), whose family is      incapable of support, and who can demonstrate that he or she      has no other sufficient means of support other than that      provided under the program described in subsection (b), shall      be eligible to receive benefits under such program.       ``(b) Program Described.--The program described in this      subsection is the program described in section 402(a)(3)(A)      of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity      Reconciliation Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1612(a)(3)(A)).''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)      takes effect as if included in the enactment of subtitle A of      title V of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant      Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208; 110 Stat.      3009-1772).       (c) Notice and Redetermination.--The Commissioner of Social      Security shall, not later than 30 days after the date of      enactment of this Act, notify an individual described in      section 511(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and      Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (as added by this Act)      and who, as of such date, has been redetermined to be      ineligible for the program described in section 511(b) of the      Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act      of 1996 (as so added), that the individual's eligibility for      such program shall be redetermined again, and shall conduct      such redetermination in a timely manner.
