 President, this is an absurd amendment. This amendment would provide $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top three-tenths of 1 percent, and 99.7 percent of the American people do not get a nickel. Despite all the rhetoric we hear around here about fiscal responsibility, this isn't paid for. It is another $1 trillion over 10 years to our national debt.  I yield to the Senator from Michigan.
