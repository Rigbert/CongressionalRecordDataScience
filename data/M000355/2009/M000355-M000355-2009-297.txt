 We were reminded in a very vivid way yesterday that they are on constant alert and that they are in constant danger.  Fortunately, incidents such as the one that took place yesterday are rare. We are all glad for that. And we are glad we have such a professional, well-trained, and courageous group of men and women to keep us safe day in and day out. They are always ready. On behalf of the entire Senate family, I want to express my appreciation for their hard work and their courage in the line of duty.                          ____________________
