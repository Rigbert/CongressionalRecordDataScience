 President, I thank the ranking member.  Mr. President, I am very proud to rise in support of Professor Paul Cassell who is nominated to be a judge for the district court in Utah.  I think one of the best ways to learn about a person is to work with them on an issue. I have had the pleasure, along with Senator Kyl, of working with Paul Cassell on a constitutional amendment to protect victims of violent crime.  In the course of several meetings, I have found Professor Cassell to be bright, sensitive, and evenhanded, with a very deep concern for those victimized by crime.  I am not the only one. I would like to quickly read the opening paragraph from Doug Beloof of Northwestern School of Law at the Lewis & Clark College:       I am an associate professor of law at Lewis & Clark law      school in Portland, Oregon. I am a registered Democrat. It      has been my pleasure to know Professor Paul Cassell      personally and professionally for several years. I am writing      to urge you to confirm him. As his resume reflects, he is      brilliant. He is one of the quickest conceptual thinkers and      writers I have ever met. There is no question that he is well      qualified for the district court position.  I find myself strongly in agreement. I have found in my course in public life that very few care really to be identified with victims of crime. In this sense, Paul Cassell is really a jewel. I have seen him come forward time after time on behalf of victims of violent crimes. On a pro bono basis, he represented the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing in their unsuccessful efforts to ensure they could observe the trial and still testify at the sentencing proceedings.  He has worked on behalf of sexual assault victims. This month he is filing briefs in the Utah Supreme Court on behalf of the Rape Recovery Center to protect the confidentiality of rape crisis victims.  Because of his tireless work on behalf of crime victims, Professor Cassell's nomination has earned the support of victim's groups around the country including: the Klaas Kids Foundation; Crime Victims United of California; the National Victims Constitutional; Amendment Network; Memory of Victims Everywhere; National Organization for Victim Assistance; and Justice for Murder Victims.  Let me a read just a couple excerpts from his letters of support:  John Stein, Deputy Director of the National Organization for Victim Assistance describes him as       . . . a fair, ethical, and highly competent attorney and      colleague. [Professor Cassell] has demonstrated a balanced      commitment to the cause of justice for all Americans      including crime victims.  Douglas Beloof, a Professor of Law at Lewis and Clark school in Portland, Oregon wrote:       Professor Cassell's character and temperament . . . are      extremely well suited for the District Court position. The      citizens of Utah could not find a better legal mind or a more      decent human being.  Professor Cassell also comes before the Senate with impressive academic credentials.  Professor Cassell graduated from Stanford University and from Stanford Law School, where he was Order of the Coif and president of the Stanford Law Review.  He clerked for then-Judge Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and subsequently Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court.  After a successful career in the Department of Justice, Mr. Cassell entered academia and became a professor of law at the University of Utah. His scholarship includes over 25 published law review articles.  In sum, I thank Chairman Leahy for setting this nomination for a vote, and I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Professor Cassell to the Utah District Court.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a series of letters from national organizations supporting victims and also supporting Dr. Paul Cassell for appointment to the district court.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             National Organization                                        for Victim Assistance,                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hon. Jon Kyl,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kyl: On behalf of the National      Organization for Victim Assistance, we are writing to express      our strong support for the confirmation of Professor Paul      Cassell to the Federal District Court for the District of      Utah.       We have worked with Professor Cassell for many years, and      have come to know him as a fair, ethical, and highly      competent attorney and colleague. Paul has demonstrated a      balanced commitment to the cause of justice for all      Americans, including crime victims. We are honored by his      longstanding association with NOVA. In his work on the Crime      Victims' Rights Amendment he has shown his ability to      understand many different points of view, as is evidenced by      his collaboration with another NOVA friend, Professor      Lawrence Tribe.       We strongly believe that Professor Cassell will be a credit      to the Federal Judiciary and we urge your unqualified support      for his confirmation.           Very Truly Yours,     John H. Stein,       Deputy Director.

Re request for your support for Paul G. Cassell for          confirmation to the 10th Federal District Court.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: In keeping with yours and our      tireless push for the ``U.S. Constitutional Amendment for the      rights of victims,'' we ask for your strong support of Paul      G. Cassell for confirmation to the 10th Federal District      Court for the District of Utah.       Mr. Cassell stands for everything that we are attempting to      accomplish. He is a man totally dedicated to public safety      and victims rights and will be an asset in making the justice      system fair and honest for the law-abiding citizens who just      happen to become a crime victim.       We thank you for continuing to be a strong crime victim's      advocate. We appreciate your great effort on behalf of      victims of crime.       Please feel free to call on us anytime we may be of      assistance.

Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: In keeping with your tireless      pursuit of justice for crime victims and advocacy for a      Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment, we urgently request      that you support Professor Paul G. Cassell's confirmation to      the 10th Federal District Court. A graduate of Stanford, he      was an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of      Virginia. Professor Cassell writes, lectures and testifies      extensively in the areas of criminal justice reform and the      rights of crime victims.       Thank you very much.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert W.

Re confirmation of Paul G. Cassell.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of crime victims      everywhere, please support the confirmation of Paul G.      Cassell to the Federal District Court for the District of      Utah. Historically, Professor Cassell has long been one of      America's most active and vocal advocates of victim's rights.       As one who has been victimized by violent crime I      understand how difficult it can be to find articulate,      educated advocates for our position. Professor Cassell is one      such person: a leader whom goes to battle for the rights of      the innocent, especially crime victims. We need more, not      less individuals of Professor Cassell's caliber working on      behalf of all honest Americans.       Please support and vote `aye' to confirm Professor Cassell.      He will be a continuing asset to a federal court system that      too often prioritizes the rights of the wrong individual.       Thank you for your consideration on this matter.           Sincerely,     Marc Klaas.                                  ____                                   Justice for Murder Victims,                                San Francisco, CA, March 14, 2002.

Re please give strong support to Paul G. Cassell for          confirmation to the 10th Federal District Court.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As one of the hardest hit crime      victims in the Nation, I extend my appreciation for your      great effort on behalf of the victims of violent crime. Thank      you for continuing to be a strong crime victim's advocate. We      value your hard work and continued loyalty to bring forth a      ``U.S. Constitutional Amendment'' for the rights of crime      victims. [You may have been advised that after fourteen years      an arrest has finally been made on one of the killers of my      brother and sister-in-law.]       Knowing of Paul Cassell's wonderful work in the justice      area, we would guess that you plan to support him for      confirmation to the 10th Federal District Court. We do      request your very strong support for him.       If you know of Mr. Cassell, you are aware he is a man      totally dedicated to making our justice system fair for the      honest, law-abiding citizen, who just happens to become a      victim of crime.       In April 1996, I had the privilege of meeting Paul as we      both testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary in support of      your U.S. Constitutional Amendment. Paul Cassell is a leader,      doing battle for the rights of the honest people (especially      crime victims). Paul has great integrity, fairness and we      victims are proud to support him for the Federal District      Court of our great Nation.       Thank you again and again for your great effort on behalf      of victims of crime.           My kindest personal regards and with sincerity and      appreciation,                                       Collene (Thompson) Campbell     Former mayor, San Juan Capistrano.                                  ____                                                 National Victims'                             Constitutional Amendment Network,                                       Denver, CO, March 13, 2002.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senator for California, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the National Victims'      Constitutional Amendment Network (NVCAN), I wish to express      our strong support for Paul Cassell, Esquire, who has been      nominated to serve as a federal judge. Those of us who have      been privileged to know and work with Mr. Cassell have deep      respect and admiration for his leadership and service to the      criminal justice system and the society it serves.       Paul Cassell has a distinguished record of outstanding      service to others. He is currently a Professor of Law at the      University of Utah College of Law, where he teaches criminal      procedure. He has written and lectured extensively regarding      crime victims' rights, serving on the Utah Council on      Victims, where he was instrumental in obtaining the passage      of the Utah State Victims' Rights Amendment. He worked with      total commitment and dedication on behalf of 89 victims of      the Oklahoma City bombing in their efforts to obtain their      lawful rights to watch proceedings in that case.       His career includes a wealth of experiences that reflect      his exceptional ability to strive for balance and fairness in      the criminal justice system so that true justice is achieved.      Clearly, those qualities have been demonstrated in abundance      as NVCAN has worked for the passage of the U.S.      Constitutional amendment for crime victims' rights.       Paul Cassell is a man of honor and integrity who will bring      a keen intellect, ethical conduct and distinction to the      federal bench. We in NVCAN have witnessed him as one of our      most active contributors and a passionate advocate for equal      justice under the law. We hope you will carefully consider      our strong support for his confirmation.           Sincerely,     Roberta Roper,     Robert Preston,                                                  Co-Chairpersons.
