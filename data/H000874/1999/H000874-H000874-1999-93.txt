Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, in November 1991, with 259 Republicans and Democrats voting for it, we passed a campaign finance reform bill. It went to the Senate and 57 Senators some days later voted to send that bill to President Bush. That bill limited the amount of money in campaigns. It limited soft money. It provided for campaign finance reform. Unfortunately, that bill was vetoed.  We are now here, some 7 years later, and we have another opportunity to do what the American public expects us to do, to make their elections as honest and open as we possibly can. Is it difficult? Yes. Is it impossible? No. The Shays-Meehan perfect? Obviously not. But it is our best opportunity in this Congress to speak out on behalf of the American public's desire for clean and fair campaigns.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for Shays-Meehan, but if we are to pass Shays-Meehan, we must also reject those amendments that will divide us, divide the consensus for this campaign finance reform bill which received just last year 252 votes in favor of it. Reject those substitutes, some on merit, some because they are designed specifically to defeat Shays-Meehan without giving the opportunity of the 435 of us who were sent here by our neighbors to vote on their behalf, to ensure that democracy is pursued in an honest fashion in this, the last best hope on the face of the Earth. I urge my colleagues to vote for Shays-Meehan and against general amendments.
