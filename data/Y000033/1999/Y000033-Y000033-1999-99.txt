Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the language beginning on page 37, line 23 and ending on page 38, line 13, as follows:  Provided further, that Public Law 94-241, as amended, is further amended (1) in section 4(b) by deleting ``2002'' and inserting ``1999'' and inserting after the words ``$11,000,000 annually'' the following: ``and for fiscal year 2000, payments to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be $6 million, but shall return to the level of $11,000,000 annually for fiscal year 2001 and 2002. In fiscal year 2003 the payment to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall be $5,000,000''; (2) deleting the word ``and'' at the end of subsection (4)(c)(2); (3) deleting the period at the end of subsection (4)(c)(3) and inserting in lieu thereof ``and''; and (4) in section (4)(c) by adding a new subsection as follows: ``(4) for fiscal year 2000, $5,000,000 shall be provided to Guam.''  This language clearly amends an underlying statute, Public Law 94-241, by reducing mandatory payments to be made to the Northern Mariana Islands and authorizes funds for another entity not contemplated in Public Law 94-241. This constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2(b) of Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Representatives.  I ask that the Chair sustain my point of order.  Guam is due the $5 million that is in the present bill for compact impact. This administration should work to fund Guam for this unfunded mandate but not penalize Mariana's covenant funds.                              {time}  1045  Mr. Chairman, I ask to sustain my point of order.
