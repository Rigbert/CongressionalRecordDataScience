Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking Chairman Cohen, Chairman Conyers, Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Poe and all of their staff for their support and work on this issue. I am proud to sponsor this resolution and hope that all of my colleagues will support this simple but important effort.  This is an important effort. It's an important step. Youth dating violence is spreading all across our country. In my congressional district, the Center for Disease Control, the Fulton County district attorney, the Partnership Against Domestic Violence, colleges, high schools, and yes, even middle schools have been seeing an increase in abusive teen relationships. Fear, stalking, bullying, violence and abuse are unacceptable and always shocking. But it is tragic that domestic abuse is a very real part of our children's relationships. We see it in the headlines. We see it on the streets. We see it withour own children. Mr. Speaker, we must break this chain. We must stop the cycle from being repeated over and over again.  The CDC worked with Liz Claiborne, Inc. to develop Dating Matters: Understanding Teen Dating Violence Prevention. This is a free online training course for teachers, youth leaders and family members. I encourage all those watching this discussion and debate to research this issue, take the course and watch for the signs. I think the time has come, Mr. Speaker, for us to teach our young people the way of nonviolence, our children, our teenagers, our college-aged students.  Last month, I know that many across the country recognized Teen Dating Violence Prevention Month. I hope they continue through Women's History Month and really the entire year. We used to think a week was enough time, but it is just not enough. Mr. Speaker, our communities must have the information and the training to stop teen dating violence. I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution.
