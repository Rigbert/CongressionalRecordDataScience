President, I want to take a moment to pay tribute to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who some here also know from his service as Jordan's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and as Jordan's Ambassador to the United States.  The High Commissioner has held his post since September 1, 2014, and his term will end on August 31, 2018. He has carried out his responsibilities with exceptional courage, compassion, commitment, and even humor, qualities that are indispensable for any successful U.N. High Commissioner. In so doing, he has been the target of relentless attacks by government officials who abuse their authority by manipulating their countries' electoral processes and security forces to arrest, imprison, abuse, and even assassinate their critics, whether independent journalists, members of political opposition parties, or civil society activists.  In a speech delivered Tuesday at an international conference marking the 25th anniversary of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted on June 25, 2003, in response to the atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia, the High Commissioner warned that human rights are under siege in many parts of the world, including Europe.  He said, ``This anniversary could be the occasion for a polite celebration of the achievements of my Office over the past two and a half decades--and they are many. But today is not a time for soporific complacency. Human rights are sorely under pressure around the world--no longer a priority: a pariah. The legitimacy of human rights principles is attacked. The practice of human rights norms is in retreat. Here in Europe, ethno-populist parties are in the ascendant in many countries--fueling hatred and scarring their societies with deepening divisions.''  No one should be surprised by this. We see the consequences every day, including in countries that are friends and allies of the United States. Legitimate dissent is labeled ``terrorism.'' Those who defend human rights are themselves maligned and targeted. Dictators are feted, and their crimes are ignored. Xenophobia and racism are treated as legitimate responses to domestic problems.  As the High Commissioner noted, it is incumbent on each of us to defend human rights and to counter those who promote hatred and intolerance. What is the alternative? Despotism. Fascism. Isolationism. Forces and ideologies we have resisted and fought against for generations. We owe it to past and future generations, as the High Commissioner said, ``to stand by our achievements and the advances which have been made.'' This is not only a moral imperative for upholding the values our country stands for and preserving our international reputation, but a pragmatic necessity for protecting our interests at home and abroad.  I want to thank the High Commissioner for his extraordinary efforts during the past 4 extremely challenging years. He has been a tireless, principled defender of universal human rights,and in doing so, he has set a high bar for those who follow in his footsteps.  I ask unanimous consent that the High Commissioner's remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Statement by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al        Hussein on the 25th Anniversary of the Vienna Declaration     Minister Kneissl.     Excellencies, Colleagues, Friends.       Twenty five years ago, it was here, in this city of      confluence and cultural connection that the Vienna      Declaration and Programme of Action was adopted--and with its      crucial description of human rights as ``universal,      indivisible, interdependent and interrelated'', cut through      the artificial division of civil and political rights from      rights that are cultural, economic and social.       The Cold War had ended, and the first words of the preamble      marked a great hope for a new era, with interdependent      countries engaging in a common approach to the causes of      human suffering:       ``Considering that the promotion and protection of human      rights is a matter of priority for the international      community.''       It was here that the world unanimously reaffirmed that      every refugee from persecution is entitled to asylum, and      called for effective protection for all those who are      compelled to become migrants.       It was here that States urged immediate and strong measures      to combat racism, xenophobia and religious hatred, and to      ensure participation by the poorest people in decision-     making.       It was here in Vienna that States recommended the creation      of the mandate which I am honoured to occupy: the UN High      Commissioner for Human Rights.       But today we seem to be headed in another direction.       Backwards. To a landscape of increasingly strident, zero-     sum nationalism, where the jealously guarded short-term      interests of individual leaders outweigh the search for      solutions to our common ills. Backwards, to an era of      contempt for the rights of people who have been forced to      flee their homes, because the threats they face there are      more dangerous even than the perils of their voyage.       Backwards, to a time of proxy regional and global warfare--     a time when military operations could deliberately target      civilians and civilian sites such as hospitals, and chemical      gases were openly used for military purposes.       Backwards, to an era when racists and xenophobes      deliberately enflamed hatred and discrimination among the      public, while carefully cloaking themselves in the guise of      democracy and the rule of law.       Backwards, to an era when women were not permitted to      control their own choices and their own bodies. An era when      criticism was criminalised, and human rights activism brought      jail--or worse.       So this anniversary could be the occasion for a polite      celebration of the achievements of my Office over the past      two and a half decades--and they are many. But today is not a      time for soporific complacency. Human rights are sorely under      pressure around the world--no longer a priority: a pariah.      The legitimacy of human rights principles is attacked. The      practise of human rights norms is in retreat. Here in Europe,      ethno-populist parties are in the ascendant in many      countries--fuelling hatred and scarring their societies with      deepening divisions.       Where these parties have achieved power, they have sought      to undermine the independence of the judiciary and silence      many critical voices in the independent media and civil      society. They have propagated distorted and false views of      migrants and human rights activists. Almost everywhere,      across Europe the hatred they direct at migrants has      infiltrated the mainstream parties and skewed the political      landscape towards greater violence and suffering.       In this country--which more than most should be aware of      the dangers of ethnically divisive rhetoric, given the      historical role of Karl Lueger--false and incendiary      statements have been recently made which are fundamentally at      odds with the Vienna Declaration.       Minister Kneissl, Excellencies,       As Viktor Frankl so often wrote, it is compassion, and      contribution to the lives of others, which form the anchor of      an honourable life. And the way to honour the Vienna      Declaration and Programme of Action is to act on it. Human      rights are not just words to be nodded at sagely at      anniversaries. They are meant, above all, to be put into      practice, and anchored especially in the daily experiences of      the poorest and most marginalised people--such as those who      flee the destruction of their hopes by conflict and      deprivation.       There will be no peace for any country until there is      respect, and justice. There will be no sustainable prosperity      unless all can benefit. Human equality and dignity are the      path towards peace in the world: the path of real patriotism,      building societies grounded in harmony, not divisiveness and      hate.       So it is time to stand up for what the Vienna Declaration      truly represents.       We need to use this anniversary to begin to mobilize a much      broader community to defend human rights with our fierce, and      passionate commitment. We need to make clear the vital, life-     saving importance of human rights for the daily lives and      global future of our fellow human beings.       Many of us do still have space to voice our concerns. We      need to stand by our achievements and the advances which have      been made.       We need to push back against the haters, the destroyers,      the isolationists and ethno-nationalists.       We need to move forward, defiantly, to ensure that those      indivisible, universal, interdependent and interrelated      rights are able to build on each other to shape a world of      well-being and safety.       There is no time to lose. Let this be a turning point, so      that the Vienna Declaration can stand proud--not as a      decaying museum piece, but as the flag-bearer for a resurgent      movement to build peace and progress.       Thank you.                          ____________________
