 President, together Senator Cantwell and I commend Mayor Haggerton for his long-standing dedication to public service. Over the past 30 years, Mayor Haggerton has always been an unwavering partner for the citizens of Tukwila, available with a friendly smile and positive attitude. We express our sincere gratitude, respect, and appreciation to Mr. Jim Haggerton for his service to the city and residents of Tukwila, South King County, and the State of Washington and for his friendship and partnership as we have worked with him in Washington, DC, on behalf of the people of the great State of Washington.                          ____________________
