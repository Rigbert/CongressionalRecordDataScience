Speaker, I appreciate what the gentlewoman has just said. Let me suggest if an agreement is reached tomorrow or the next day or the day after, I think everybody in the House, if an agreement is reached, will come here, most of us, and vote to ratify that agreement on January 2 or 3.  It will make no difference that we have recessed or adjourned and put the Government back to work. We will do that. Why? Because our President will have agreed, your Speaker will have agreed, and the majority leader will have agreed. Therefore, my point was, this gets you nothing other than a continuing disruption of the Government and the country.  I agree with the gentlewoman. If an agreement is reached, we will ratify it. I hope that happens, because I share your objective.
