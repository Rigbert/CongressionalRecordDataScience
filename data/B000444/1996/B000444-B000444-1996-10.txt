 President, I am pleased today to introduce on behalf of the Administration the Presidential Honors Scholarship Act of 1996. I want to commend President Clinton for this particular initiative and for his overall outstanding leadership on behalf of education.  Over the past 4 years, I have worked with President Clinton most closely on anti-crime and drug legislation. But, I have watched, admired, and tried to help his efforts on behalf of education as well. George Bush said he wanted to be the education president. Bill Clinton has been. And, this bill on merit scholarships is an important part of his agenda.  In August, I introduced comprehensive legislation to make college more affordable for middle-class families. The Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher Education is Affordable and Dependable Act--GET AHEAD for short--would provide tax cuts for the cost of college, encourage families to save for a college education, and award merit scholarships to high school students in the top of their classes academically.  I included merit scholarships in the Get Ahead Act and I have agreed--even though our proposals differ in a few minor details--to introduce the administration's bill today for one simple reason. We need to reward students who succeed in meeting high academic standards.  If we are going to reform education--I mean, really reform education so that our children will be an educated workforce able to compete in the international economy--then we must first set tough academic standards. Students must know what is expected of them. Parents must know what their children should be learning. Teachers must stay focused on the mission of educating children. And, we all should know that a high school diploma means something.  But, Mr. President, not only should States be setting high academic standards for our students--with support and assistance from the Federal Government--but we should be rewarding those students who meet the high standards. The best way to reward them is to make it just a little bit easier to go to college, which is by the way, another key incredient--in addition to tough standards--in ensuring a highly educated American workforce.  The Presidential Honors Scholarship Act would provide a $1,000 scholarship to all graduating seniors in public and private schools who finish in the top 5 percent of their class. These Presidential honors scholars could use the scholarship in their freshman year at the college of their choice, and the scholarship would not be used in determining eligibility for other financial aid.  Although $1,000 may not seem like a lot, it is about two-thirds of the cost of the average tuition at a community college. And, more importantly, it is the principle that counts. Those who work hard and succeed ought to be recognized and rewarded.  Now, there are some--and I have heard from them already--who believe that the money for merit scholarships would be better spent helping those in financial need. I do not disagree with the notion that we should help all students who are qualified to go to college get to college. But, of those who finish in the top 5 percent of their high school graduating class--those who would benefit from this bill--81 percent come from families with incomes under $75,000 per year. I suggest they are exactly the ones in need, given the high cost of college today--and there were reports in this morning's paper that tuition costs at public colleges have gone up another 6 percent, more than double the rate of inflation. But, regardless of who benefits, I also believe that we should start to reward excellence for excellence's sake.  I have no illusions--and the administration does not either--that this bill is going to pass here in the waning days of the 104th Congress. Our intent is merely to introduce the bill now, and to come back next year to try to see it become law as part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I encourage my colleagues to take a look at this legislation and to support the idea of merit scholarships.                          ____________________
