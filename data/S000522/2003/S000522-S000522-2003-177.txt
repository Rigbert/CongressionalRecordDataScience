Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 199) calling on the Government of the People's Republic of China immediately and unconditionally to release Dr. Yang Jianli, calling on the President of the United States to continue working on behalf of Dr. Yang Jianli for his release, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 199       Whereas according to the United States Department of      State's 2002 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in      China, the Government of the People's Republic of China has      ``continued to commit numerous and serious [human rights]      abuses'', including ``instances of . . . arbitrary arrest and      detention, lengthy incommunicado detention, and denial of due      process'';       Whereas according to the 2002 Country Reports on Human      Rights Practices in China, ``the country's criminal      procedures were not in compliance with international      standards'', ``the lack of due process in the judicial system      remained a serious problem'', and ``authorities routinely      violated legal protections in the cases of political      dissidents'';       Whereas Dr. Yang Jianli, an internationally renowned      scholar, prodemocracy activist, and President of the      Foundation for China in the 21st Century, is an alien      lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United      States;       Whereas Dr. Yang Jianli has been detained incommunicado by      the Government of the People's Republic of China since April      26, 2002, when he was arrested for reportedly entering China      with false or incomplete identity documents;       Whereas according to the United Nations Commission on Human      Rights Resolution 1997/38, ``prolonged incommunicado      detention may . . . itself constitute a form of cruel,      inhuman, or degrading treatment'', which is prohibited by      international law;       Whereas Dr. Yang Jianli has been deprived of his basic      human rights by being denied access to legal counsel and      contact with his wife and two children (who are United States      citizens), and has also been denied his right to trial within      a reasonable time or to release;       Whereas on May 7, 2003, the United Nations Working Group on      Arbitrary Detention expressed the opinion that ``[t]he non-     observance of Mr. Yang Jianli's right to a fair trial is of      such gravity as to give his deprivation of liberty an      arbitrary character. Therefore, his arrest and detention is      arbitrary being in contravention of Article 9 of the      Universal Declaration on Human Rights and of Article 9 of the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights''; and       Whereas the arbitrary imprisonment and the violation of the      human rights of United States citizens and permanent resident      aliens by the Government of the People's Republic of China      are sources of continuing, grave concern to the House of      Representatives: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the House of Representatives--       (A) condemns and deplores the incommunicado detention of      Dr. Yang Jianli, and calls for his immediate and      unconditional release;       (B) condemns and deplores the lack of due process afforded      to Dr. Yang;       (C) strongly urges the Government of the People's Republic      of China to respond to the repeated requests by Members of      the House of Representatives for information about Dr. Yang's      whereabouts and condition; and       (D) strongly urges the Government of the People's Republic      of China to consider the implications for the broader      relationship between the United States and the People's      Republic of China of detaining permanent resident aliens of      the United States without providing them access to legal      counsel or family members; and       (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that      the United States--       (A) should make the immediate release of Dr. Yang Jianli by      the Government of the People's Republic of China a top      concern of United States foreign policy;       (B) should continue to make every effort to assist Dr. Yang      Jianli and his family while discussions of his release are      ongoing;       (C) should make it clear to the Government of the People's      Republic of China that the detention of United States      citizens and permanent resident aliens and the infliction of      human rights violations on these groups are not in the      interest of the Government of the People's Republic of China      because they create obstacles to improved bilateral relations      and cooperation with the United States; and       (D) should reiterate the deep concern of the United States      regarding the continued imprisonment of Dr. Yang Jianli and      other United States citizens and permanent resident aliens      whose human rights are being violated, and discuss their      legal status and immediate humanitarian needs with the      Government of the People's Republic of China.
