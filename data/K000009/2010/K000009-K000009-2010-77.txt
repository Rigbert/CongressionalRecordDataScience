To all of our colleagues from across this country, and certainly from the Polish American Caucus here in the Congress--Congressman Lipinski, Congressman Dingell, Congressman Chris Murphy, Congressman Mike Quigley of Chicago, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Cleveland, Ohio, Congresswoman Marcia Fudge of the same region--all of us are united in our common grief as well as common hope that the future of Poland in this millennium will be very bright, and America stands with you at this very historic moment.       This is a black day for Poland and for her children around      the world, including all of us at Kresy-Siberia who are      working for the remembrance and recognition of our collective      history.       Those who perished today were all leaders in the Nation's      quest for remembrance and identity.       Many were close friends of the Kresy-Siberia Foundation,      and among those we have lost are:       Two of the Honorary Patrons of the Kresy-Siberia Virtual      Museum; Ryszard Kaczorowski, the last Polish President-in-     Exile, and Janusz Krupski, Ministry for Veterans and      Repressed Persons.       Our first important backer, Maciejski, President of the      ``lnota Polska'' (Polish Union) Association, who had the      courage and vision to be the first major sponsor of our      virtual museum and whose organization now hosts our office in      Warsaw.       Janusz Kurtyka, President of the Institute for National      Remembrance, who headed one of our Foundation's most      important Partners.       Andrzej Przewonik, Secretary overseeing the Council for the      Protection of Memory of Struggle and Marytdom, an important      friend and collaborator of the Kresy-Siberia Foundation.       President Kaczyski and especially Mrs. Kaczyska, who we met      in Warsaw last September, who were both aware of and very      supportive of Kresy-Siberia.       Scores of leaders of the Siberian Association, the Katyn      Families Association, the Golgotha of the East Foundation,      and all our friends and colleagues drawn to the common flame      of Katyn and all lost in the flames of the presidential jet      crash.       The tragic irony of this circumstance is not lost on us.       Like the cream of the Polish nation murdered 70 years ago,      and who the Presidential party was en route to commemorate at      Katyn, an entire leadership group of our nation has been lost      to us. Literally, the entire chiefs of staff of the Army, Air      Force, and Navy have all perished. Along with scores of      parliamentarians, government officials, religious leaders,      and historical activists like us.       We Poles will recover, for as a Nation we always have. But      we have lost a strong core of our most passionate and      historically aware patriots.       We are in shock and mourning.       Our thoughts and prayers are with the Nation and with the      families of those who lost their loved ones.       May Poland and all her children around the world rally in      unity at this tragic blow.                                                Stefan Wisniowski,     Foundation President, Kresy-Siberia Foundation.                                  ____       Dear Friends,       As we mourn the loss of President Lech and Maria Kaczynski      and their talented delegation of leaders, we must make sure      that these deaths were not in vain.       After a cover up of the Katyn Massacre, which lasted for      decades, today the truth about Katyn was on television--and      page-one news around the world!       As the anthem says, ``Poland has not perished while we are      alive.''       President Kaczynski and his cabinet presided over a period      of prosperity, and today Poland has the 18th largest economy      in the world, a free press where people can speak their      minds, and a stable democratic system where voters elect      their leaders.       These are great strides made by our fatherland over the      past 20 years and we should all be proud. So wherever you      are, go visit a Polish Consulate, a Polish church, club, or      cultural center and share your condolences. But remember to      count your blessings as well!           All the best,                                             Alex Storozynski,                                   President & Executive Director,                                        The Kosciuszko Foundation.                               ____________________
