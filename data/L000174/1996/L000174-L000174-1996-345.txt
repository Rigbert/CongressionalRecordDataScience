President, the foreign operations conference report, which was signed into law on February 12, categorically prohibits the use of any funds for abortion. It also prohibits the use of any funds in China.  But that legislation contains a provision that was inserted by the House at the behest of the right-to-life lobby, which will cut funding for voluntary, international family programs by one-third.  Those family planning programs have one purpose--to give couples in developing countries the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions. The funds are used to purchase and distribute contraceptives, to improve the quality and safety of contraceptives, to educate couples about spacing the births of their children, and maternal and child health.  Why anyone would be against that is a mystery to me, but that is what the House did. And because they recessed immediately afterward, the Senate had no opportunity to amend it. We were presented with the choice of closing down the Government again, or accepting the House provision word for word.  Anyone who wants to see fewer abortions, and fewer women die from botched abortions, should deplore what the House did, and support the Hatfield language in this bill.  The House provision would prohibit the obligation of any family planning funds before July 1 unless they are specifically authorized.  The whole purpose of that provision was to give an incentive to the authorizing committees to resolve the Mexico City issue. We were told that was what they wanted--an opportunity to resolve it themselves.  But the authorization conferees hardly discussed the issue. In fact, they specifically decided not to authorize these programs. In one of the more hypocritical maneuvers I have seen in a long time, the House authorizers revealed that their real agenda is to destroy the international family planning program.  Without an authorization, the House provision says that only 65 percent of the fiscal year 1995 level for family planning may be obligated, and then only at the rate of 6.7 percent per month.  What will be the effect of the House provision? According to conservative estimates: 7 million couples in developing countries who have used modern contraceptives, will be left without access to them; there will be 4 million more unintended pregnancies; 1.9 million more unplanned births; 1.6 million more abortions; 8,000 more women dying in pregnancy; and 134,000 more infant deaths.  Mr. President, that would be unforgivable, particularly since it is entirely avoidable.  The United States has been the world's leader in the effort to stabilize population growth. Tens of millions of people are born into terrible poverty each year. Anyone with an ounce of sense knows that if we make it harder for people to avoid pregnancy, the result will be more abortions, not less.  The Hatfield language ensures that that will not happen. It would prevent the House provision from going into affect if the President determines that it would result in significantly more abortions.  Every Senator, whether pro-life or pro-choice, should support the Hatfieldlanguage, and oppose this amendment. I want to commend Senator Hatfield for his leadership on this, and for his determination to correct this problem. He is solidly pro-life, but he is also a stalwart supporter of family planning because he knows what family planning is the way to reduce abortions.  That is what we all want, and why all Senators should vote to keep the Hatfield language in the bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a two newspaper editorials which are representative of dozens of similar editorials from around the country expressing strong support for Senator Hatfield's position, be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 12, 1996]                         Family Planning Fiasco       The continuing resolution that brought government workers      back to the job last January is due to expire at the end of      the week. One of the matters that must be settled before that      can be done is the future of American assistance to family      planning efforts abroad. This has nothing to do with      abortion, since no U.S. funds can be spent outside the United      States for that purpose. Rather, what is at stake is this      country's extremely valuable and long-supported work in the      developing world to provide couples with information and      materials needed to plan the spacing and total numbers of      their children.       In January, one regular appropriations bill was attached to      the continuing resolution by the House. It cut international      family planning money 35 percent below 1995 levels, and it      put two additional restrictions on these expenditures:      Nothing can be spent before July 1, and thereafter the funds      would be doled out at the rate of 6.7 percent a month until      the new fiscal year begins on October 1. This amounts to an      effective cut of 85 percent in a single year, which is a      terrible idea. Sen. Mark Hatfield, chairman of the      Appropriations Committee, has put a saving clause in the      pending bill that would allow the president to spend      appropriated funds without these two restrictions if he can      demonstrate that they will have the effect of reducing demand      for family planning services and lead to a significant      increase in abortions. That won't be hard to do. An effort      will be made, probably today, to strike the Hatfield language      and retain the restrictions.       The united States contributes about 17 percent of all      public funds spent on family planning in the developing world      outside China, which does not receive this kind of aid.      Various organizations have made estimates on what would      follow a cut of 85 percent--how many unplanned children would      be born, how many women would die in childbirth or having      abortions, for instance. Predictably, these figures have been      challenged by others who believe that the poorest people in      the world will simply buy their own contraceptives or remain      abstinent. But the exact numbers don't matter, for the damage      will be severe. American foreign aid has been instrumental in      the developing world's increasing family planning success.      This, in turn, has spurred economic progress and brought      about tremendous improvement in the health and welfare of      women and children in recipient countries. Legislators more      interested in pleasing an extreme slice of the American      electorate than in saving lives and reaching out to the poor      of the world should not be allowed to succeed.                                                                    ____            [From the Portland, Press Herald, Mar. 12, 1996]             Senate Should Protect Needed International Aid       The abandoned baby girls pictured here testify eloquently      to the need for U.S. support of voluntary international      family planning programs.       A key vote on that support is expected in the Senate today.       The babies shown here, abandoned in India, are far from      alone. World population expands by nearly 100 million people      a year. Ninety percent are born in developing countries.      Countless are desperately poor and unwanted.       Family planning programs, long supported by U.S. aid,      provide assistance that can break the desperate cycle. They      give families the power to plan. They do not provide      abortions. U.S. law has forbidden use of foreign aid funds      for abortion for two decades.       Even so, opponents continue to attack the funding on that      basis. That's why the Hatfield Amendment coming before the      Senate is so important. It would enable the president to      override restrictions, now in place on family planning aid if      he can report to Congress that they unwisely ``will result in      significantly more abortions, as well as a greater unmet need      for family planning services.''       That is an amendment in the best interest of everyone      involved.       The Senate should approve it.
