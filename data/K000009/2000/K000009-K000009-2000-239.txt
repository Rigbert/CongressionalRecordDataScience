Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to pay tribute to the remarkable life and career of our trusted former colleague, the Honorable Henry Gonzalez of Texas. Dogged, brilliant, committed, indefatigable, a champion for the destitute--such was our Chairman of the Banking Committee. During my early years in the Congress, as a member of that committee, I had the great pleasure of serving with this able gentleman. He served in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt, a man who believed in opportunity for all Americans and dedicated his life to that cause.  On the Banking Committee, his work in improving housing for people from all walks of life and incomes is legendary. In him ticked a strong democratic heart. Every corner of America is better because of his service. He stood up for human rights here at home and abroad, no matter what the cost. He was unflinching when he knew his cause was just.  Recently, as we broke ground for the dedication of the new World War II Memorial in our Nation's capital, I especially named Henry Gonzalez as a key figure in congressional efforts to pass legislation to bring that element to full life as a part of our Nation's history. He was a gentleman with many facets, and many concerns. He was a son of the World War II generation that preserved liberty for modern times, and his selfless dedication grew from that experience and his own humble beginnings. I include here those remarks for the Record.  In extending deepest sympathy to his family, including his son Charles who has succeeded him in this Congress, I am mindful that those of us who have been influenced by his great mind and soul have been lifted to service above self. May he rest in peace and the good works that he fashioned inspire others for generations to come. Truly he was a man both ahead of his time, and a pioneer to the future.    Remarks by the Honorable Marcy Kaptur at World War II Memorial                Groundbreaking Ceremony, November 11, 2000       Reverend Clergy, Mr. President, Honored Guests All. We, the      children of freedom, on this first Veterans' Day of the new      century, gather to offer highest tribute, long overdue, and      our everlasting respect, gratitude, and love to Americans of      the 20th century whose valor and sacrifice yielded the modern      triumph of liberty over tyranny. This is a memorial not to a      man but to a time and a people.       This is a long-anticipated day. It was 1987 when this      Memorial was first conceived. As many have said, it has taken      longer to build the Memorial than to fight the war. Today,      with the support of Americans from all walks of life, our      veterans service organizations and overwhelming, bipartisan      support in Congress, the Memorial is a reality. I do not have      the time to mention all the Members of Congress who deserve      thanks for their contributions to this cause, but certain      Members in particular must be recognized. Rep. Sonny      Montgomery, now retired, a true champion of veterans in the      House, and Senator Strom Thurmond, our unfailing advocate in      the Senate, as well as Rep. Bill Clay, of Missouri and two      retired Members, Rep. Henry Gonzalez and Senator John Glenn.      At the end of World War I, the French poet Guillaume      Apollinaire declaring himself ``against forgetting'' wrote of      his fallen comrades: ``You asked neither for glory nor for      tears.''       Five years ago, at the close of the 50th anniversary      ceremonies for World War II, Americans consecrated this      ground with soil from the resting places around the world of      those who served and died on all fronts. We, too, declared      ourselves against forgetting. We pledged then that America      would honor and remember their selfless devotion on this Mall      that commemorates democracy's march.       Apollinaire's words resonated again as E.B. Sledge      reflected on the moment the Second World War ended: ``. . .      sitting in a stunned silence, we remembered our dead . . . so      many dead . . . Except for a few widely scattered shouts of      joy, the survivors of the abyss sat hollow-eyed, trying to      comprehend a world without war.''       Yes. Individual acts by ordinary men and women in an      extraordinary time--one exhausting skirmish, one determined      attack, one valiant act of heroism, one digged determination      to give your all, one heroic act after another--by the      thousands--by the millions--bound our country together as it      has not been since, bound the living to the dead in common      purpose and in service to freedom, and to life.       As a Marine wrote about his company, `` I cannot say too      much for the men . . . I have seen a spirit of brotherhood .      . . that goes with one foot here amid the friends we see, and      the other foot there amid the friends we see no longer, and      one foot is as steady as the other.''       Today we break ground. It is only fitting that the event      that reshaped the modern world in the 20th century and marked      our nation's emergence from isolationism to the leader of the      free world be commemorated on this site.       Our work will not be complete until the light from the      central sculpture of the Memorial intersects the shadow cast      by the Washington Monument across the Lincoln Memorial      Reflecting Pool and the struggles for freedom of the 18th,      19th, and 20th centuries converge in one moment.       Here freedom will shine. She will shine.       This Memorial honors those still living who served abroad      and on the home front and also those lost--the nearly 300,000      Americans who died in combat, and those millions who survived      the war but who have since passed away. Among that number I      count my inspired constituent Roger Durbin of Berkey, Ohio, a      letter carrier who fought bravely with the Army's 101st      Armored Division in the Battle of the Bulge and who, because      he could not forget, asked me in 1987 why there was no      memorial in our nation's Capitol to which he could bring his      grandchildren. Roger is with us spiritually today. To help us      remember him and his contribution to America, we have with us      a delegation from his American Legion Post, the Joseph Diehn      Post in Sylvania, Ohio, and his beloved family, his widow      Marian his granddaughter, Melissa, an art historian and      member of the World War II Memorial Advisory Board.       This is a memorial to heroic sacrifice. It is also a      memorial for the living--positioned between the Washington      Monument and Lincoln Memorial--to remember how freedom in the      20th century was preserved for ensuing generations.       Poet Keith Douglas died in foreign combat in 1944 at age      24. In predicting his own end, he wrote about what he called      time's wrong-way telescope, and how he thought it might      simplify him as people looked back at him over the distance      of years. ``Through that lens,'' he demanded, ``see if I      seem/substance or nothing: of the world/deserving mention, or      charitable oblivion . . .'' And then he ended with the      request, ``Remember me when I am dead/and simplify me when      I'm dead.'' What a strange and striking charge that is!       And yet here today we pledge that as the World War II      Memorial is built, through the simplifying elements of stone,      water, and light. There will be no charitable oblivion.      America will not forget. The world will not forget. When we      as a people can no longer remember the complicated      individuals who walked in freedom's march--a husband, a      sister, a friend, a brother, and uncle, a father--when those      individuals become simplified in histories and in family      stories, still when future generations journey to this holy      place, America will not forget. Freedom's children will not      forget.                               ____________________
