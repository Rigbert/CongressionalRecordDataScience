President, I stand here today to pay tribute to Vermont's only professional sports team, the Vermont Expos, who won the New York Penn League baseball championship last week.  In 1994, the Vermont Expos arrived in Burlington thanks to my good friend Ray Pecor, who worked exhaustively with State and local officials to bring professional baseball back to Vermont. He wanted the Expos to be a team the entire State could be proud of. Now,after just 3 years in Vermont, the Expos are champions.  This year, the Expos played with a never say die style. They came from behind regularly to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In the championship series, the Expos came from behind to win in three of their four playoff victories. This never say die attitude not only made baseball extremely exciting in Vermont this summer, but helped the Expos develop a mystique that many teams take years to build.  The gritty style of play the Expos showed throughout the year reflects the attitude of their manager, Kevin Higgins, who had the responsibility of molding a team of rookies into a championship ball club. After the Expos beat the St. Catharines Stompers, 4 to 3, on Wednesday to win the championship, Higgins acknowledged that ``these are the best fans in the league and I think they know it.''  The workmanlike efforts of the Expos also reflect the hard work of their General Manager, Kyle Bostwick of St. Albans, and his predecessor, the late Tom Racine of Burlington. These two men were major factors in bringing a championship ball club to Burlington.  Never before have I seen a community become so attached to a team so quickly. Take John Douglas of Colchester, who housed Expos teammates Jamey Carroll and Shannon Swaino for the season. Douglas said he treats the two young men as if they were his own.  But the bond between the team and their fans goes beyond the cool summer nights at Centennial Field. It stretches into the very culture of our State. In Vermont, we take pride in our work ethic. We believe that hard work will be rewarded. In all my years of following professional sports, I have never seen a team that so typified the culture around them. I can honestly say this group of young ballplayers will never be forgotten.  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Vermont Expos and their fans for winning the 1996 New York Penn League championship. Now there are two ``Champs'' in Vermont.                          ____________________
