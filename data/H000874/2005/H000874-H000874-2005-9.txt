Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I do not know that I have ever voted against this bill, and I am not sure I am going to tonight, but I share the view of the ranking Democrat on our committee (Mr. Obey) that this bill has been misused. This bill, as Mr. Young has said so correctly, is not controversial as it relates to the defense of our Nation and the support of our troops. This bill has been held hostage to the issue of the abuse of detainees for some 3 months. Finally, that was resolved, in my opinion correctly. It has been burdened now with very controversial issues, and it has been subjected to a cut of the very defense that it seeks to support. I know that is not what either the chairman of the committee or the chairman of the subcommittee or indeed the ranking member wanted to see happen, but it is a sad handling of this bill.  I thank the gentleman for his leadership.
