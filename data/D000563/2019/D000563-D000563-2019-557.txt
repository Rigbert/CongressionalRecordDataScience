President, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is charged with protecting workers and job applicants against discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information.  Janet Dhillon, the latest nominee to be a member of that board, has spent her career, unfortunately, doing the opposite. She has spent years advocating for corporations over workers and has a track record that puts her in direct opposition to the mission of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. For example, under Ms. Dhillon's leadership, the Retail Litigation Center filed briefs in support of policies making it more difficult for employers to be held liable for harassment.  I am also concerned that Ms. Dhillon has declined to answer whether she would uphold the EEOC's current position that the Civil Rights Act forbids employment discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.
