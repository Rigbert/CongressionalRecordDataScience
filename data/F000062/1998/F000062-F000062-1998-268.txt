''  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, I ask unanimous consent their letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Cystic Fibrosis Foundation,                                                 February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The current frenzied atmosphere on      Capitol Hill surrounding the issue of human cloning instills      great fear in the scientific community. On behalf of cystic      fibrosis (CF) scientists, researchers, caregivers, and most      importantly patients, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF)      asks all members of Congress to take the time to study the      potentially harmful ramifications of prohibitive human      cloning legislation. As America's governing body, Congress      has an unequivocal responsibility to hold public hearings on      this issue in order to fully understand the scope of this      debate. The CFF agrees that the cloning of a complete human      being should not be done. However, we have grave concerns      over current legislation that is crafted in such a way to      restrict the advancement of lifesaving biomedical research.       A voluntary moratorium on human cloning should suffice to      prevent scientists from attempting to clone a complete human      being in the laboratory. Nevertheless, if it is decided that      legislation must be drafted, extreme care should be taken not      to restrict the capacity to pursue cutting edge technologies      which hold great promise. For example, the strategy that may      ultimately be needed to achieve a cure for CF through gene      therapy techniques is called somatic cell/stem cell gene      transfer therapy.       Enactment of the Bond/Frist Cloning Prohibition Act in its      current form and other existing pieces of legislation would      prevent the use of this kind of technology. This would be a      critical set-back in our ability to develop new therapies to      treat individuals with CF and other life-threatening      diseases. To consider the passage of legislation without      appropriate debate from the scientific community, as well as      a public airing of the consequences on future biomedical      research, will do irreparable damage.       For the 30,000 children and young adults with CF in this      country, the message is clear. Do not allow hasty and      capricious action to impede our ability to impact on this      disease. It is equally important to note that until essential      scientific debate has reached completion, the cloning of a      complete human being cannot occur, as the regulatory      safeguards of the FDA already in place prevent such an act.       Your attention to this critical matter is appreciated.           Sincerely yours,                                           Robert J. Beall, Ph.D.,                                                President and CEO.
