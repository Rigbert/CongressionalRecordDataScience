 Unfortunately, because my time has been reduced, I am going to have to reduce the time I was going to use to praise the chair of the subcommittee for her work on this bill. But I do want to make a point of saying this: I have served on this subcommittee. This is not an easy assignment. I congratulate Senators Landrieu and DeWine for bringing forth an excellent bill. It is a bill which is a challenge every single year.  Why is this bill a challenge? Because every Member of the Congress who ever wanted to be mayor of a town gets the chance to be ``mayor for a day'' on the DC appropriations bill. Senators from some of the largest States in the Nation can't wait to make decisions that are ordinarily made by mayors and members of city councils.
