The instant check system was proposed by the National Rifle Association as a way of avoiding the Brady law. They said, ``We will do this by computer; we will punch it in.''  The fellow who is selling the gun, the dealer, will punch in the information and find out if you are a dangerous person; if not, they can sell it to you.  Now they have decided they want the computer check but they don't want to pay for it, they want the taxpayers to pay for it, and take the money out of the FBI.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
