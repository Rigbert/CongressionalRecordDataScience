Senator Bennett is correct. Members of Congress have to make a decision early in their career: Are they going to travel? I think it has been one of the most valuable experiences of my public life. I have made a point of always announcing in advance where I am going and why I am going, giving full disclosure so that people know. I can say without exception that every time I have taken a trip, carefully planned, I have come back with a better knowledge of the world and a better appreciation of our home.  I have learned things on these trips I just could not appreciate reading in a book. I have met people on these trips who have changed my life. I don't say that loosely; I mean it.  Over 15 years ago, I met a man in Bangladesh named Muhammad Yunus. We had gone to Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries on Earth. This economics professor took us out to show us that he was testing a concept from his economics class called micro credit. He believed--this professor believed--that if you loan a small amount of money to the poorest people on Earth, they would pay it back, and that that small amount of money would change their lives. A simple concept, but he was out to prove it would work, and he proved it over and over again until that concept reached 100 million people on the face of the Earth. That man was recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. I met Muhammad Yunus on an official trip. I have fought for micro credit ever since, and I consider him a real inspiration to my public life.
