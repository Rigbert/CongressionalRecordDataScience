 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  First of all, the Senator from New Mexico works very closely and very hard as a member of the committee I chair. I appreciate his hard work and he should not take personal anything I am saying about his amendment.  Let me remind people what the Federal medical assistance percentage is all about. We call that FMAP for short. It sets the amount of money that the Federal Government contributes toward the costs of a State's Medicaid Program.  When States are doing well economically, their Federal share goes down.
