Madam Speaker, today I wish to honor Grant Ainsworth Thompson who has recently left the world of politics to follow his calling in the Church. Grant served as my Communications Director for the last 5 years. Prior to that, he worked as a Legislative Assistant in my office focusing on Veterans Affairs and Postal issues.  Grant Ainsworth Thompson was born June 9, 1962 here in Washington, DC and was educated in the DC public school system. After graduating from Cardozo High School in 1981, he spent a number of years working in the private sector as both a substance abuse counselor and for United Airlines. He then chose to pursue a higher education and attended the University of the District of Columbia from 1991 to 1995, majoring in Mass Media and Television Production. Grant has been happily married to Margaret for 22 years and is the father of 2 sons: Justin, 21 and Jeremy, 17.  Grant used his skills in communications and management to help me better serve the people of Alaska. He was a driving force behind my office's expansion into cutting edge media and always seemed to know what the ``next big thing'' would be. His positive personality and confidential counsel were invaluable to me and my staff; he will be sorely missed.  Grant was an integral part of my office for many years and it deeply saddens me to see him leave. We often joked that he was my ``brother,'' as we share the same birthday. I wish him all the best as he begins a new chapter in his life. Grant is now going to continue the work he started as Pastor and Founder of the Church of the Rock Praise Factory, located in Washington, DC. He will continue to be involved in many community outreach programs over the coming years, spreading the word of the Lord, and helping those in need. Grant Ainsworth Thompson is a truly great American, with a heart the size of Alaska.                          ____________________
