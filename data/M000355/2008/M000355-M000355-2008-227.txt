 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend, Nelda Barton-Collings. Mrs. Barton-Collings is a well-respected Kentuckian and businesswoman, recently retired after serving 28 years on the Republican National Committee.  Mrs. Barton-Collings resides in Corbin, KY, where she was married to Dr. Harold Bryan Barton. After the passing of Dr. Barton she took on the ownership and operation of his two nursing homes. At the same time, she took night classes to become a licensed nursing home administrator. She has since grown those two nursing homes into numerous nursing homes and banks throughout eastern Kentucky.  Mrs. Barton-Collings used her vast business skills to serve her community, State, and eventually her Nation by committing to public service. She started out as a precinct chair, and then rose to become Kentucky's national committeewoman for the GOP. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan appointed her to the Federal Council on Aging. In 1990, she was the first woman elected chairman of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce while serving on the President's Council on Rural America and the National Advisory Council to Small Business Administration, through an appointment by President George H.W. Bush.  She has long been a voice of great leadership on the Republican National Committee, where she was the first woman from Kentucky to address the RNC and call the meeting to order. Her position gave her opportunities to extend democratic ideas and philosophy to the former Soviet Union. She and 40 other political and business professionals volunteered to visit the Soviet Union in 1990 to discuss the foundations of a democratic government. ``They want freedom so badly; we hoped that we have helped them in some way,'' she said of her experience in the Soviet Union.  Nelda has given the good people of Kentucky and this Nation over 28 years of public service, and I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in honoring this committed public servant. The News Journal in Corbin, KY, published an article highlighting her accomplishments and what a champion she is for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the News Journal, May 28, 2008]          Longtime Supporter Honored With Portrait, Classroom       On Sunday, May 18, friends and family of Nelda Barton-     Collings gathered at Cumberland Inn on the campus of      University of the Cumberlands to recognize this extraordinary      woman at a luncheon given in her honor.       As Dr. Jim Taylor, UC president said, ``Today we honor a      lady who has made, and who continues to make a significant      and substantial contribution to our area, to our state, and,      indeed, to our nation. Dr. Nelda Barton-Colllings truly is a      legend in her own time.'' After the luncheon, the assembly      proceeded to the Hutton School of Business, where a portrait      of Mrs. Barton-Collings adorns a special classroom, which      bears her name, in recognition of her faithfulness and      support of UC.       A native of Providence, Webster County, Kentucky, Barton-     Collings attended Western Kentucky University for two years      before she entered the Norton Memorial Infirmary in      Louisville, where she became a certified medical      technologist. In Corbin, as the wife of Dr. Harold Bryan      Barton, she became active in local organizations and held      leadership positions in church, political, civic, medical,      youth, educational and women's groups.       After Dr. Barton's death, she took over his business, which      consisted of two nursing homes, and completed the      Williamsburg Nursing Home, then under construction. At that      time, she enrolled in night classes at University of the      Cumberlands and later became a Kentucky Licensed Nursing Home      Administrator. She and her business partner continued to      build or buy a total of eight long-term healthcare facilities      in Eastern Kentucky. A business woman ahead of her time,      Barton-Collings has owned banks, pharmacies, rental      properties, weekly newspapers, a cinema, and several other      businesses. The newspapers, long-term care facilities and      banks have won state awards and recognitions.       In 1990, Barton-Collings became the first woman elected      chairman of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. In 1982, she      received a Presidential appointment from President Ronald      Reagan to the Federal Council on Aging, where she served      until 1987. From 1990-92, she served on the President's      Council on Rural America and the National Advisory Council to      Small Business Administration, appointed by President George      H.W. Bush.       As an active member of the Republican Party for more than      50 years, Barton-Collings moved up the ranks from a precinct      chair to Republican National Committee member representing      Kentucky, a position she held for 28 years. Elected vice      chair for an eight-year term and secretary of the Republican      National Committee for another eight years, Barton-Collings      earned the honor of calling to order the Republican National      Convention in 1996.       But, this was not her first convention appearance, as she      was the first woman from Kentucky to present an address at a      Republican National Convention, when, in Detroit, Michigan,      in 1980, she spoke on ``The Business of Caring for the      Elderly.'' During her tenure on the Republican National      Committee, she was a charter member and appointed secretary-     treasurer of the National Institute on International Affairs,      and she served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, which      allowed her to travel extensively to foreign countries to      promote democracy.       Recently honored by the Kentucky Commission on Women as a      ``Kentucky Woman Remembered'' for her many achievements,      Barton-Collings's portrait now hangs in the Kentucky State      Capitol.       Through the years, she has received numerous other awards      and honors, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from      University of the Cumberlands, as well as the Kentucky      Medical Association's Outstanding Layperson Award, the John      Sherman Cooper Distinguished Service Award from Kentucky      Young Republicans and the Dwight David Eisenhower Award.       Currently, the chairman of the board of Bretara, LLC and      Tri County Cineplex, LLC, Barton-Collings also serves on the      Kentucky Economic Development Partnership Board; as secretary      of the University of Kentucky Center on Aging; and as chair      of University of the Cumberlands Board of Visitors.       Married to Dr. Jack Collings of Owensboro, Kentucky from      March of 1992 until his death in 2000, Barton-Collings is the      mother of five, grandmother of ten, step-grandmother of      twelve, and great-grandmother of two.       Dr. Jim Taylor, University of the Cumberlands president,      said, ``It is entirely appropriate that Mrs. Barton-     Collings's picture hangs in this room where our students will      study business principles and practices, for she certainly      exemplifies the ideal of a true businesswoman.       Through her remarkable career and her stellar service to      her fellow humans, she is a role model for our aspiring      business leaders, and we are honored that she is an alumna of      University of the Cumberlands, Nelda, as we say here in these      beautiful mountains, `You do us proud.'
