Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the leader for that information with reference to how it is going to be considered.  As the gentleman, as the leader will recall, and I am sure the chairman of the Committee on Rules will recall, when last considered, the Democrats, the minority, was given a substitute, and a waiver was given with respect to that substitute as well. We would hope that that would be repeated again this year.  Again, notwithstanding the accelerated consideration, clearly we would hope that we would be able to offer, with an appropriate waiver, an alternative to the proposal that emanates from the Committee on Rules.  Could the leader tell me whether that is the intention?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, Mr. Speaker, I have watched the chairman of the Committee on Rules work for many years now, going on 9 years as chairman of the Committee on Rules, I believe. The whole time that he has been chairman he has, I think, treated the minority with utmost and extreme fairness.
