 President, for more than a year now, Democrats in Washington have been focused--some would say fixated--on making dramatic changes to the American health care system as we know it.  It is an open debate as to whether spending so much time and energy on this issue was in the best interest of the public at a time of record unemployment and a need to address jobs and the economy. But what is not open to debate is, the plan they came up with was fundamentally flawed--that it focused too much on expanding the size and cost of government and not enough on the core problem with our health care system, which is cost.  This is why Americans have been telling Democrats in Washington to scrap their plan and start over. This is why so many Americans are so frustrated with government right now.
