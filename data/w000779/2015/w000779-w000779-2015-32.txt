President, this year marks the 40th anniversary of the Skanner News Group, a renowned print and online news publication that serves African and African-American communities in Portland, OR, and the Northwest.  Since 1975, the Skanner News Group has provided in-depth and essential coverage of its community as it relates to politics, social justice, civil rights, art, and food, all while holding true to its mission statement: ``Challenging people to shape a better future now.'' The Skanner certainly has been a catalyst for change. In the late 1980s, it was the Skanner's coverage of the debate to rename Union Avenue in Northeast Portland for Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard that played a crucial role in ensuring the community's request was fulfilled. Whether it is honoring minority-owned businesses or running profiles on the Black Lives Matter movement, the Skanner is there to cover and inform all of us in Portland about the most important issues and topics of our time.  The Skanner's long list of awards is a testament not just to the importance of this publication, but also the quality of its reporting. It has received multiple National Newspaper Publishers Association awards and is a three-timewinner of the West Coast Black Publishers Association's ``Publisher of the Year'' award. As well as the national recognitions are local well-earned accolades that further demonstrate what the Skanner means to readers across the Northwest.  Behind the success of this historic publication is a hard-working team that has been instrumental in building the Skanner these past four decades and positioning it for success for decades to come. I would like to especially acknowledge cofounders Bobbie and Bernie Foster, two people I consider the heart and soul of this operation. Beyond the publication, they created the Skanner Foundation, which runs a scholarship program that awards $1,000 each to the best and brightest young people to help them accomplish their educational goals. Bobbie and Bernie's passion for giving back is a key component of what makes them and the Skanner so special.  In addition to all this great work, the foundation organizes an annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., breakfast that is renowned in Oregon as being an event that justly honors one of the greatest civil rights leaders of our time. I have been privileged to attend the breakfast and know full well what a huge impact it has.  The Skanner News Group is an institution that serves to better our community, by inspiring, uplifting, and informing. I would like to congratulate the staff on reaching their 40th anniversary and wish them the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
