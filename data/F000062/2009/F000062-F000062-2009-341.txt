  The Coburn amendment would destroy a court-approved settlement of an 18-year legal battle involving the release of water from the Friant Dam, from which 15,000 farmers get their water over the restoration of salmon in the San Joaquin Valley. The agreement is agreed upon by the Governor of California, the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of Reclamation, the water contractors. It has a broad consensus. The reason is because the belief is--and my belief is--that the Federal Government has lost the case and, therefore, the judge would order a huge release of water from this dam which would provide a lack of certainty for the farmers and would not provide for the salmon restoration.  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has argued against the settlement agreement--court approved--by saying its goal is 500 fish. Its goal is not 500 fish; it is 30,000. It is to restore a historic salmon fishery.  Secondly, under the settlement, the State of California relieves the Federal Government of a number of payments: $200 million from the State, and the water contractors pick up another $200 million, equaling $400 million, which the Federal Government would have had to have paid.  So this is a court settlement. It should stand. It is the right thing. I urge a no vote on the Coburn amendment.
