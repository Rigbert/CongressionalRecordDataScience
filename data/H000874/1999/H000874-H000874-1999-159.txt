Chairman, is it the gentleman's perception that George Washington said, ``I know Air Force One is out at Andrews, but I am a good guy, and I am just not going to use it''? Because if that is the gentleman's perception, I must inform him, with all due respect, that Air Force One was not there to use. But I have a sneaking hunch if he had had a horse that flew, he would have used it.
