President, I am disappointed that the Senate is bypassing normal procedure to debate a controversial bill on which the Senate refused to proceed 8 years ago. That was the last action taken on this kind of bill. Since then 8 years have passed. Our Constitution has not changed. I am thankful for that. The complex issues and federalism concerns that so many Senators voiced 8 years ago still remain. So if anything has changed, it is difficult to know. Instead of regular order and allowing the committee of jurisdiction to gather the facts, to consider the legislation, to amend it or reject it, we find ourselves proceeding almost helter-skelter on what is a very serious matter with important personal, privacy and legal implications.  It is a striking contrast that we turn to this bill after last week's bipartisan unifying effort in which we took four months to hold nine hearings and work with our counterparts in the House to reauthorize key provisions of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965. If that process exemplified the Senate at its best, this proceeding stands in sharp contrast. The press is reporting that the Senate is being required to turn to this bill at this time as part of the Republican-designed run up to the elections. Having spent time on a constitutional amendment that would have cut back on the Bill or Rights, having wasted precious time seeking to write discrimination into the Constitution, this is next on their campaign checklist of items needed to rev up their voting base. In fact, having just seen the President reject our efforts to authorize Federal funds for vital stem cell research with his first official veto, they now rush to reopen the abortion debate. I am a little surprised they are not seeking another vote on some further intervention into the circumstances of Terri Schiavo and her family.  In fact, the bill before us, like the legislation rushed to the floor to intervene in Florida's legal system in the case of Terri Schiavo, is another case of congressional overreaching and of trying to federalize decisions that previously have been left to the States. I unequivocally support the goal of fostering closer familial relationships and the value of encouraging parental involvement in a child's decision about how to respond to an unplanned pregnancy. We all do. That is not the issue. I thank Senators Boxer, Menendez, Lautenberg, and Feinstein for bringing amendments seeking to make this legislative consideration worthwhile and beneficial to those in need of government help, rather than an imposition of the heavy hand of government intervention. I support their amendments.  The underlying bill, however, raises challenging issues of federalism that caused many of us to reject it before and will lead me to oppose it, again. I find it ironic that many of the same people who insist that fully considered State laws on civil union and civil partnership and marriage not be respected, are those who in the context of this legislation insist that State laws be held to bind people even when they travel outside their States, and that Federal criminal law become the enforcement mechanism to ensure that they are binding.  The underlying bill does little to strengthen communication and trust in families. While I know as a father that most parents hope their children would turn to them in times of crisis, no law will make that happen. No law will force a young pregnant woman to talk to her parents when she is too frightened to do so. This bill does not increase the perception of choices for such young women. Rather, it is likely to drive young women who are afraid to seek help from their families away from their families and greatly increase the dangers they face from an unwanted pregnancy.  The nature of our Federal system revolves around States maintaining their historically dominant role in developing and implementing policies that affect family matters, such as marriage, divorce, end-of-life choices, child custody and policies on parental involvement in minors' abortion decisions. I respect that. I respect each State to define those family relationships and have resisted Federal intrusion into those matters. Congress should not dictate the nature of family relationships. I had hoped we learned our lesson on this when the American people reacted with outrage to the President and Congress intervening in the Terri Schiavo matter.  Twenty-six States have adopted parental consent or notification laws that are currently enforced and meet the bill's definition of a ``law requiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision.'' That means that the remaining States--the 24 States that include Vermont--either have opted for no such law, or have decided on a State law that allows for the involvement of adults other than a parent or guardian in the minor's reproductive decision. While I respect the 26 notification law States, I also respect the 24 other States and the privacy rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The direct consequence of this billwould be to federalize the reach of the most constricted notification laws and to override the policies in the remaining States.  It is telling that the bill does not expressly establish a Federal parental consent requirement. It does not directly override the various State laws in this area of traditional State interest. Instead, it seeks to do indirectly what it will not and likely could not do directly. Doing so makes it no less an abuse of Federal power. The underlying bill would use the power and resources of the Federal Government to force favored States' laws into effect in the other States that have made other legislative choices. It would impose a law that a State has chosen not to adopt on that State, regardless of the choice its people have made through the legislative process. Most troubling of all, it would create a Federal crime as a mechanism for such Federal interference. It is an affront to federalism and an exercise in heavy-handed overcriminalization.  Make no mistake: Despite the proponents' contention that this bill does not attempt to regulate any purely intrastate activities, the effect of this bill would be to impose the policies of certain States on the remaining ones. Just because some in Congress may prefer the policies of certain States over those in the others does not mean we should give those policies Federal enforcement authority across the Nation. Doing so is not only wrong, it sets a dangerous precedent.  An example apart from family law: Should residents of States that prohibit gambling not be able to travel to Las Vegas or Atlantic City or the many other places that now allow it? It is the nature of our Federal system that when residents of a State travel to neighboring States or across the Nation, they must conform their behavior to the laws of the States they visit? When residents of each State are forced to carry with them only the laws of their own State, we will have turned our Federal system on its ear.  Congress has wisely repealed laws in the past that require residents of each State to carry with them only the laws of their own State. We saw this when the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution was passed. That outlawed slavery and repealed article IV, section 2, paragraph 3 of the Constitution, which authorized return of runaway slaves to their owners. That constitutional authority and such laws as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 enabled slave owners from slave States to reclaim slaves who managed to escape to free States or territories. None of us--and certainly not the sponsors of this legislation--would ever condone slavery. Those discredited laws and the infamous Dred Scott case are about the only precedent we have for a bill like this that would use the force of Federal law to enforce a particular State's laws against people wherever those people may travel.  I was proud in November, 2004, when the Senate unanimously passed a resolution sponsored by Senators McCain, Hatch, Kennedy, and Reid to express the sense of the Senate that John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson should be pardoned for his ``crime'' of transporting a white woman across State lines for ``an immoral purpose.'' The injustice done to Jack Johnson was something we all joined to try to correct many years later. Let us not allow the misuse of Federal power, again.  This bill would sweep into its criminal and civil liability reach extended family members, including grandparents or aunts or uncles, who respond to a cry for help from a young relative by helping her travel across State lines to terminate a pregnancy. In addition to close family members, any other person to whom a young pregnant woman may turn for help, including health care providers and religious counselors, could be dragged into court and face prison time on criminal charges. Rev. Doctor Katherine Hancock Ragsdale once helped a stranger, a 15-year-old girl. The girl feared for her safety if her father learned of her pregnancy, and she had no relative to turn to for help. She was alone and desperate. Should offering comfort subject Reverend Ragsdale to Federal prosecution?  The purported goal of this bill, to foster closer familial relationships, will not be served by threatening to throw into jail any grandmother or aunt or sibling who helps a young relative. The result of this bill will be to discourage young women from turning to a trusted adult for advice and assistance. Instead, these young women may be forced then into the hands of strangers or into isolation.  Keep in mind what this bill does not do. It does not prohibit pregnant minors from traveling across State lines to have an abortion, even if their purpose is to avoid their parents. The perverse effect of the bill, if it is to be followed, would be to encourage more young women to travel alone to obtain abortions. I will not support an effort that may lead back to the days of ``back alley'' abortions. How can anyone view these outcomes as desirable or fostering closer familial ties? Young pregnant women who seek the counsel and involvement of close family members when they cannot confide in their parents--for example, where a parent has committed incest or there is a history of child abuse--would subject those same close relatives to the risk of criminal prosecution and civil suit, if the young woman subsequently travels across State lines to terminate her pregnancy. Is that really what we want? We should not compound these most difficult circumstances by taking actions that if successful will succeed in isolating young pregnant women, forcing them to run away from home or pushing them to seek protection from strangers at a time of crisis.  No law will force a young pregnant woman to involve her parents in her abortion decision if she is determined to keep that fact secret from her parents. No law can force a familial connection that does not exist. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the percentages of minors who inform parents about their intent to have abortions are essentially the same in States with and without notification laws. The President remarked just last week that ``governments can't change hearts.'' States have found that there are families in which parental notification laws are not effective.  While doing nothing to foster familial relationships, this bill would do serious damage to important federalism and constitutional principles. The underlying bill imposes significant new burdens on a woman's right to choose and impinges on the right to travel and the privileges and immunities due under the Constitution to every citizen. Peter J. Rubin of Georgetown University Law Center and Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School have argued that this language, adopted by the House in 2002, violates both ``the rights of States to enact and enforce their own laws governing conduct within their territorial boundaries, and the rights of the residents of each of the United States . . . to travel to and from any State of the Union for lawful purposes, a right strongly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court.'' These leading constitutional scholars contend that the bill as drafted is unconstitutional. I will ask that a copy of their analysis be printed in the Record, at the conclusion of my statement.  For all these reasons--legal, constitutional, practical and institutional--I will vote against the underlying bill. I urge all Senators to respect federalism, the Constitution and families by rejecting this attempt to politicize fundamental decisions and family relationships.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the aforementioned analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                September 5, 2001.     To: United State House of Representatives Committee on the          Judiciary, Subcommittee on the Constitution     From: Laurence H. Tribe, Tyler Professor of Constitutional          Law, Harvard University Peter J. Rubin, Associate          Professor of Law, Georgetown University     Re H.R. 476 and Constitutional Principles of Federalism                              Introduction       We have been asked to submit our assessment of whether H.R.      476, now pending before the House, is consistent with      constitutional principles of federalism. It is our considered      view that the proposed statute violates those principles,      principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order.      That statute violates the rights of states to enact and      enforce their own laws governing conduct within their      territorial boundaries, and the rights of the residents of      each of the United States and of the District of Columbia to      travel to and from any state of the Union for lawful      purposes, a right strongly reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in      its recent landmark     decision in Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). We have      therefore concluded that the proposed law would, if enacted,      violate the Constitution of the United States.       H.R. 476 would provide criminal and civil penalties,      including imprisonment for up to one year, for any person who      ``knowingly transports an individual who has not attained the      age of 18 years across a State line, with the intent that      such individual obtain an abortion. . . [if] an abortion is      performed on the individual, in a State other than the State      where the individual resides, without the parental consent or      notification, or the judicial authorization, that would have      been required by that law in the State where the individual      resides.''       H.R. 476, Sec. 2 (a) (proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2431(a)(1)      and (2)). In other words, this law makes it a federal crime      to assist a pregnant minor to obtain a lawful abortion. The      criminal penalties kick in if the abortion the young woman      seeks would be performed in a state other than her state of      residence, and in accord with the less restrictive laws of      that state, unless she complies with the more severe      restrictions her home state imposes upon abortions performed      upon minors within its territorial limits. The law contains      no exceptions for situations where the young woman's home      state purports to disclaim any such extraterritorial effect      for its parental consultation rules, or where it is a      pregnant young woman's close friend, or her aunt or      grandmother, or a member of the clergy, who accompanies her      ``across a State line'' on this frightening journey, even      where she would have obtained the abortion anyway, whether      lawfully in another state after a more perilous trip alone,      or illegally (and less safely) in her home state because she      is too frightened to seek a judicial bypass or too terrified      of physical abuse to notify a parent or legal guardian who      may, indeed, be the cause of her pregnancy. It does not      exempt health care providers, including doctors, from      possible criminal or civil penalties. Nor does it uniformly      apply home-state laws on pregnant minors who obtain out-of-     state abortions. The law applies only where the young woman      seeks to go from a state with a more restrictive regime into      a state with a less restrictive one.       This amounts to a statutory attempt to force this most      vulnerable class of young women to carry the restrictive laws      of their home states strapped to their backs, bearing the      great weight of those laws like the bars of a prison that      follows them wherever they go (unless they are willing to go      alone). Such a law violates the basic premises upon which our      federal system is constructed, and therefore violates the      Constitution of the United States.                                Analysis       The essence of federalism is that the several states have      not only different physical territories and different      topographies but also different political and legal regimes.      Crossing the border into another state, which every citizen      has a right to do, may perhaps not permit the traveler to      escape all tax or other fiscal or recordkeeping duties owed      to the state as a condition of remaining a resident and thus      a citizen of that state, but necessarily permits the traveler      temporarily to shed her home state's regime of laws      regulating primary conduct in favor of the legal regime of      the state she has chosen to visit. Whether cast in terms of      the destination state's authority to enact laws effective      throughout its domain without having to make exceptions for      travelers from other states, or cast in terms of the      individual's right to travel--which would almost certainly be      deterred and would in any event be rendered virtually      meaningless if the traveler could not shake the conduct-     constraining laws of her home state--the proposition that a      state may not project its laws into other states by following      its citizens there is bedrock in our federal system.       One need reflect only briefly on what rejecting that      proposition would mean in order to understand how axiomatic      it is to the structure of federalism. Suppose that your home      state or Congress could lock you into the legal regime of      your home state as you travel across the country. This would      mean that the speed limits, marriage regulations,      restrictions on adoption, rules about assisted suicide,      firearms regulations, and all other controls over behavior      enacted by the state you sought to leave behind, either      temporarily or permanently, would in fact follow you into all      49 of the other states as you traveled the length and breadth      of the nation in search of more hospitable ``rules of the      road.'' If your search was for a more favorable legal      environment in which to make your home, you might as well      just look up the laws of distant states on the internet      rather than roaming about in a futile effort at sampling      them, since you will not actually experience those laws by      traveling there. And if your search was for a less hostile      legal environment in which to attend college or spend a      summer vacation or obtain a medical procedure, you might as      well skip even the internet, since the theoretically less      hostile laws of other jurisdictions will mean nothing to you      so long as your state of residence remains unchanged.       Unless the right to travel interstate means nothing more      than the right to change the scenery, opting for the open      fields of Kansas or the mountains of Colorado or the beaches      of Florida but all the while living under the legal regime of      whichever state you call home, telling you that the laws      governing your behavior will remain constant as you cross      from one state into another and then another is tantamount to      telling you that you may in truth be compelled to remain at      home--although you may, of course, engage in a simulacrum of      interstate travel, with an experience much like that of the      visitor to a virtual reality arcade who is strapped into      special equipment that provides the look and feel of      alternative physical environments--from sea to shining sea--     but that does not alter the political and legal environment      one iota. And, of course, if home-state legislation, or      congressional legislation, may saddle the home state's      citizens with that state's abortion regulation regime, then      it may saddle them with their home state's adoption and      marriage regimes as well, and with piece after piece of the      home state's legal fabric until the home state's citizens are      all safely and tightly wrapped in the straitjacket of the      home state's entire legal regime. There are no constitutional      scissors that can cut this process short, no principled      metric that can supply a stopping point. The principle      underlying H.R. 476 is nothing less, therefore, than the      principle that individuals may indeed be tightly bound by the      legal regimes of their home states even as they traverse the      nation by traveling to other states with very different      regimes of law. It follows, therefore, that--unless the right      to engage in interstate travel that is so central to our      federal system is indeed only a right to change the      surrounding scenery--H.R. 476 rests on a principle that      obliterates that right completely.       It is irrelevant to the federalism analysis that the      proposed federal statute does not literally prohibit the      minor herself from obtaining an out-of-state abortion without      complying with the parental consent or notification laws of      her home state, criminalizing instead only the conduct of      assisting such a young woman by transporting her across state      lines. The manifest and indeed avowed purpose of the statute      is to prevent the pregnant minor from crossing state lines to      obtain an abortion that is lawful in her state of destination      whenever it would have violated her home state's law to      obtain an abortion there because the pregnant woman has not      fully complied with her home state's requirements for      parental consent or notification. The means used to achieve      this end do not alter the constitutional calculus.      Prohibiting assistance in crossing state lines in the manner      of this proposed statute suffers the same infirmity with      respect to our federal structure as would a direct ban on      traveling across state lines to obtain an abortion that      complies with all the laws of the state where it is performed      without first complying also with the laws that would apply      to obtaining an abortion in one's home state.       The federalism principle we have described operates      routinely in our national life. Indeed, it is so commonplace      it is taken for granted. Thus, for example, neither Virginia      nor Congress could prohibit residents of Virginia, where      casino gambling is illegal, from traveling interstate to      gamble in a casino in Nevada. (Indeed, the economy of Nevada      essentially depends upon this aspect of federalism for its      continued vitality.) People who like to hunt cannot be      prohibited from traveling to states where hunting is legal in      order to avail themselves of those pro-hunting laws just      because such hunting may be illegal in their home state. And      citizens of every state must be free, for example, to read      and watch material, even constitutionally unprotected      material, in New York City the distribution of which might be      unlawful in their own states, but which New York has chosen      not to forbid. To call interstate travel for such purposes an      ``evasion'' or ``circumvention'' of one's home-state laws--as      H.R. 476 purports to do, see H.R. 476, Sec. 2(a) (heading of      the proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2431) (``Transportation of minors      in circumvention of certain laws relating to abortion'')--is      to misunderstand the basic premise of federalism: one is      entitled to avoid those laws by traveling interstate. Doing      so amounts to neither evasion nor circumvention.       Put simply, you may not be compelled to abandon your      citizenship in your home state as a condition of voting with      your feet for the legal and political regime of whatever      other state you wish to visit. The fact that you intend to      return home cannot undercut your right, while in another      state, to be governed by its rules of primary conduct rather      than by the rules of primary conduct of the state from which      you came and to which you will return. When in Rome, perhaps      you will not do as the Romans do, but you are entitled--if      this figurative Rome is within the United States--to be      governed as the Romans are. If something is lawful for one of      them to do, it must be lawful for you as well. The fact that      each state is free, notwithstanding Article IV, to make      certain benefits available on a preferential basis to its own      citizens does not mean that a state's criminal laws may be      replaced with stricter ones for the visiting citizen from      another state, whether by that state's own choice or by      virtue of the law of the visitor's state or by virtue of a      congressional enactment. To be sure, a state need not treat      the travels of its citizens to other states as suddenly      lifting otherwise applicable restrictions when they return      home. Thus, a state that bans the possession of gambling      equipment, of specific kinds of weapons, of liquor, or of      obscene material may certainly enforce such bans against      anyone who would bring the contraband items into the      jurisdiction, including its own residents returning from a      gambling state, a hunting state, a drinking state, or a     state that chooses not to outlaw obscenity. But that is a far      cry from projecting one state's restrictive gambling,      firearms, alcohol, or obscenity laws into another state      whenever citizens of the first state venture there.       Thus states cannot prohibit the lawful out-of-state conduct      of their citizens, nor may they impose criminal-law-backed      burdens--as H.R. 476 would do--upon those lawfully engaged in      business or other activity within their sister states.      Indeed, this principle is so fundamental that it runs through      the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in cases that are nominally      about provisions and rights as diverse as the Commerce      Clause, the Due Process Clause, and the right to travel,      which is itself derived from several distinct constitutional      sources. See, e.g., Healy v. Beer Institute, 491 U.S. 324,      336 n. 13 (1989) (Commerce Clause decision quoting Edgar v.      Mite Corp., 457 U.S. 624, 643 (1982) (plurality opinion),      which in turn quoted the Court's Due Process decision in      Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 197 (1977)) (``The limits      on a State's power to enact substantive legislation are      similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts. In      either case, `any attempt ``directly'' to assert      extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would      offend sister States and exceed the inherent limit of the      State's power.' '').       The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this fundamental      principle in its landmark right to travel decision, Saenz v.      Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). There the Court held that, even      with congressional approval, the State of California was      powerless to carve out an exception to its otherwise-     applicable legal regime by providing recently-arrived      residents with only the welfare benefits that they would have      been entitled to receive under the laws of their former      states of residence. This attempt to saddle these interstate      travelers with the laws of their former home states--even if      only the welfare laws, laws that would operate far less      directly and less powerfully than would a special criminal-     law restriction on primary conduct--was held to impose an      unconstitutional penalty upon their right to interstate      travel, which, the Court held, is guaranteed them by the      Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth      Amendment. See Saenz, 526 U.S. at 503-504.       Although Saenz concerned new residents of a state, the      decision also reaffirmed that the constitutional right to      travel under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article      IV, Section 2, provides a similar type of protection to a      non-resident who enters a state not to settle, but with an      intent eventually to return to her home state: ``[B]y virtue      of a person's state citizenship, a citizen of one State who      travels in other States, intending to return home at the end      of his journey, is entitled to enjoy the `Privileges and      Immunities of Citizens in the several States' that he visits.      This provision removes `from the citizens of each State the      disabilities of alienage in the other States.' Paul v.      Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869). It provides important      protections for nonresidents who enter a State whether to      obtain employment, Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U.S. 518 (1978), to      procure medical services, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179, 200      (1973), or even to engage in commercial shrimp fishing,      Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U.S. 385 (1948).''       Saenz, 526 U.S. at 501-502 ( footnotes and parenthetical      omitted).       Indeed, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973), which was      decided over a quarter century ago, and to which the Saenz      court referred, specifically held that, under Article IV of      the Constitution, a state may not restrict the ability of      visiting non-residents to obtain abortions on the same terms      and conditions under which they are made available by law to      state residents. ``[T]he Privileges and Immunities Clause,      Const. Art. IV, Sec. 2, protects persons . . . who enter [a      state] seeking the medical services that are available      there.'' Id. at 200.       Thus, in terms of protection from being hobbled by the laws      of one's home state wherever one travels, nothing turns on      whether the interstate traveler intends to remain permanently      in her destination state, or to return to her state of      origin. Combined with the Court's holding that, like the      states, Congress may not contravene the principles of      federalism that are sometimes described under the ``right to      travel'' label, Saenz reinforces the conclusion, if it were      not clear before, that even if enacted by Congress, a law      like H.R. 476 that attempts by reference to a state's own      laws to control that state's resident's out-of-state conduct      on pains of criminal punishment, whether of that resident or      of whoever might assist her to travel interstate, would      violate the federal Constitution. See also Shapiro v.      Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-630 (1969) (invalidating an Act      of Congress mandating a durational residency requirement for      recently arrived District of Columbia residents seeking to      obtain welfare assistance).       In 1999, this Committee heard testimony from Professor Lino      Graglia of the University of Texas School of Law. An opponent      of constitutional abortion rights, he candidly conceded that      the proposed law would ``make it . . . more dangerous for      young women to exercise their constitutional right to obtain      a safe and legal abortion.'' Testimony of Lino A. Graglia on      H.R. 1218 before the Constitution Subcommittee of the      Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of Representatives,      May 27, 1999 at 1. He also concluded, however, that ``the Act      furthers the principle of federalism to the extent that it      reinforces or makes effective the very small amount of      policymaking authority on the abortion issue that the Supreme      Court, an arm of the national government, has permitted to      remain with the States.'' Id. at 2. He testified that he      supported the bill because he would support ``anything      Congress can do to move control of the issue back into the      hands of the States.'' Id. at 1.       Of course, as the description of H.R. 476 we have given      above demonstrates, that proposed statute would do nothing to      move ``back'' into the hands of the states any of the control      over abortion that was precluded by Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113      (1973), and its progeny. The several states already have      their own distinctive regimes for regulating the provision of      abortion services to pregnant minors, regimes that are      permitted under the Supreme Court's abortion rulings. That,      indeed, is the very premise of this proposed law. But, rather      than respecting federalism by permitting each state's law to      operate within its own sphere, the proposed federal statute      would contravene that essential principle of federalism by      saddling the abortion-seeking young woman with the      restrictive law of her home state wherever she may travel      within the United States unless she travels unaided. Indeed,      it would add insult to this federalism injury by imposing its      regime regardless of the wishes of her home state, whose      legislature might recoil from the prospect of transforming      its parental notification laws, enacted ostensibly to      encourage the provision of loving support and advice to      distraught young women, into an obstacle to the most      desperate of these young women, compelling them in the moment      of their greatest despair to choose between, on the one hand,      telling someone close to them of their situation and perhaps      exposing this loved one to criminal punishment, and, on the      other, going to the back alleys or on an unaccompanied trip      to another, possibly distant state. This Federal statute      would therefore violate rather than reinforce basic      constitutional principles of federalism.       The fact that the proposed law applies only to those      assisting the interstate travel of minors seeking abortions      may make the federalism-based constitutional infirmity      somewhat less obvious--while at the same time rendering the      law more vulnerable to constitutional challenge because of      the danger in which it will place the class of frightened,      perhaps desperate young women least able to travel safely on      their own. The importance of protecting the relationship      between parents and their minor children cannot be gainsaid.      But in the end, the fact that the proposed statute involves      the interstate travel only of minors does not alter our      conclusion.       No less than the right to end a pregnancy, the      constitutional right to travel interstate and to take      advantage of the laws of other states exists even for those      citizens who are not yet eighteen. ``Constitutional rights do      not mature and come into being magically only when one      attains the state-defined age of majority. Minors, as well as      adults, are protected by the Constitution and possess      constitutional rights.'' Planned Parenthood of Central      Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 74 (1976). Nonetheless,      the Court has held that, in furtherance of the minor's best      interests, government may in some circumstances have more      leeway to regulate where minors are concerned. Thus, whereas      a law that sought, for example, to burden adult women with      their home state's constitutionally acceptable waiting      periods for abortion (or with their home state's      constitutionally permissible medical regulations that may      make abortion more costly) even when they traveled out of      state to avoid those waiting periods (or other regulations)      would obviously be unconstitutional, it might be argued that      a law like the proposed one, which seeks to force a young      woman to comply with her home state's parental consent laws      regardless of her circumstances, is, because of its focus on      minors, somehow saved from constitutional invalidity.       It is not, for at least two reasons. First, the importance      of the constitutional right in question for the pregnant      minor too desperate even to seek judicial approval for      abortion in her home state--either because of its futility      there, or because of her terror at a judicial proceeding held      to discuss her pregnancy and personal circumstances--means      that government's power to burden that choice is severely      restricted. As Justice Powell wrote over two decades ago:       ``The pregnant minor's options are much different from      those facing a minor in other situations, such as deciding      whether to marry. . . . A pregnant adolescent . . . cannot      preserve for long the possibility of aborting, which      effectively expires in a matter of weeks from the onset of      pregnancy.''       ``Moreover, the potentially severe detriment facing a      pregnant woman is not mitigated by her minority. Indeed,      considering her probable education, employment skills,      financial resources, and emotional maturity, unwanted      motherhood may be exceptionally burdensome for a minor. In      addition, the fact of having a child brings with it adult      legal responsibility, for parenthood, like attainment of the      age of majority, is one of the traditional criteria for the      termination of the legal disabilities of minority. In sum,      there are few situations in which denying a minor the right      to make an important decision will have consequences so grave      and indelible.''       Bellotti v. Baird (Bellotti II), 443 U.S. 622, 642 (1979)      (plurality opinion) (citations omitted).       Second, the fact that the penalties on travel out of state      by minors who do not first seek parental consent or judicial      bypass are triggered only by intent to obtain a lawful      abortion and only if the minor's home state has more      stringent ``minor protection'' provisions in the form of      parental involvement rules than the state of destination,      renders any protection-of-minors exception to the basic rule      of federalism unavailable.       To begin with, the proposed law, unlike one that      evenhandedly defers to each state's determination of what      will best protect the emotional health and physical safety of      its pregnant minors who seek to terminate their pregnancies,      simply defers to states with strict parental control laws and      subordinates the interests of states that have decided that      legally-mandated consent or notification is not a sound means      of protecting pregnant minors. The law does not purport to      impose a uniform nationwide requirement that all pregnant      young women should be subject to the abortion laws of their      home states and only those abortion laws wherever they may      travel. Thus, under H.R. 476, a pregnant minor whose parents      believe that it would be both destructive and profoundly      disrespectful to their mature, sexually active daughter to      require her by law to obtain their consent before having an      abortion, and who live in a state whose laws reflect that      view, would, despite the judgment expressed in the laws of      her home state, still be required to obtain parental consent      should she seek an abortion in a neighboring state with a      stricter parental involvement law--something she might do,      for example, because that is where the nearest abortion      provider is located. This substantively slanted way in which      H.R. 476 would operate fatally undermines any argument that      might otherwise be available that principles of federalism      must give way because this law seeks to ensure that the      health and safety of pregnant minors are protected in the way      their home states have decided would be best.       In addition, the proposed law, again unlike one protecting      parental involvement generally, selectively targets one form      of control: control with respect to the constitutionally      protected procedure of terminating a pregnancy before      viability. The proposed law does not do a thing for parental      control if the minor is being assisted into another state      (or, where the relevant regulation is local, into another      city or county) for the purpose of obtaining a tattoo, or      endoscopic surgery to correct a foot problem, or laser      surgery for an eye defect. The law is activated only when the      medical procedure being obtained in another state is the      termination of a pregnancy. It is as though Congress proposed      to assist parents in controlling their children when, and      only when, those children wish to buy constitutionally      protected but sexually explicit books about methods of birth      control and abortion in states where the sale of such books      to these minors is entirely lawful.       The basic constitutional principle that such laws overlook      is that the greater power does not necessarily include the      lesser. Thus, for example, even though so-called ``fighting      words'' may be banned altogether despite the First Amendment,      it is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court held in 1992, for      government selectively to ban those fighting words that are      racist or anti-semitic in character. See R.A.V. v. City of      St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391-392 (1992). To take another      example, Congress could not make it a crime to assist a minor      who has had an abortion in the past to cross a state line in      order to obtain a lawful form of cosmetic surgery elsewhere      if that minor has not complied with her state's valid      parental involvement law for such surgery. Even though      Congress might enact a broader law that would cover all the      minors in the class described, it could not enact a law aimed      only at those who have had abortions. Such a law would      impermissibly single out abortion for special burdens. The      proposed law does so as well. Thus, even if a law that were      properly drawn to protect minors could constitutionally      displace one of the basic rules of federalism, the proposed      statute can not.       Lastly, in oral testimony given in 1999 before the      Subcommittee on the Constitution, Professor John Harrison of      the University of Virginia, while conceding that ordinarily a      law such as this, which purported to impose upon an      individual her home state's laws in order to prevent her from      engaging in lawful conduct in one of the other states, would      be constitutionally ``doubtful,'' argued that the      constitutionality of this law is resolved by the fact that it      relates to ``domestic relations,'' a sphere in which,      according to Professor Harrison, ``the state with the primary      jurisdiction over the rights and responsibilities of parties      to the domestic relations is the state of residence. . . and      not the state where the conduct'' at issue occurs. See      transcript of the Hearing of the Constitution Subcommittee of      the House Judiciary Committee on the Child Custody Protection      Act, May 27, 1999.       This ``domestic relations exception'' to principles of      federalism described by Professor Harrison, however, does not      exist, at least not in any context relevant to the      constitutionality of H.R. 476. To be sure, acting pursuant to      Article IV, Sec. 1, Congress has prescribed special state      obligations to accord full faith and credit to judgments in      the domestic relations context--for example, to child custody      determinations and child support orders. 28 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 1738A, 1738B. These provisions also establish      choice of law principles governing modification of domestic      relations orders. In addition, in a controversial provision      whose constitutionality is open to question, Congress has      said that states are not required to accord full faith and      credit to same-sex marriages. Id. at Sec. 1738C.       But the special measures adopted by Congress in the      domestic relations context can provide no justification for      H.R. 476. There is a world of difference between provisions      like Sec. Sec. 1738A and 1738B, which prescribe the full      faith and credit to which state judicial decrees and      judgments are entitled, and proposed H.R. 476, which in      effect gives state statutes extraterritorial operation--by      purporting to impose criminal liability for interstate travel      undertaken to engage in conduct lawful within the territorial      jurisdiction of the state in which the conduct is to occur,      based solely upon the laws in effect in the state of      residence of the individual who seeks to travel to a state      where she can engage in that conduct lawfully.       The Supreme Court has always differentiated ``the credit      owed to laws (legislative measures and common law) and to      judgments.'' Baker v. General Motors Corp., 522 U.S. 222, 232      (1998). For example, while a state may not decline on public      policy grounds to give full faith and credit to a judicial      judgment from another state, see, e.g., Fauntleroy v. Lum,      210 U.S. 230, 237 (1908), a forum state has always been free      to consider its own public policies in declining to follow      the legislative enactments of other states. See Nevada v.      Hall, 440 U.S. 410, 421-24 (1979). In short, under the Full      Faith and Credit Clause, a state has never been compelled      ``to substitute the statutes of other states for its own      statutes dealing with a subject matter concerning which it is      competent to legislate.'' Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v.      Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U.S. 493, 501 (1939). In      fact, the Full Faith and Credit Clause was meant to prevent      ``parochial entrenchment on the interests of other States.''      Thomas v. Washington Gas Light Co., 448 U.S. 261, 272 (1980)      (plurality opinion). A state is under no obligation to      enforce another state's statute with which it disagrees.       But H.R. 476 would run afoul of that principle. It imposes      the restrictive laws of a woman's home state wherever she      travels, in derogation of the usual rules regarding choice of      law and full faith and credit.
