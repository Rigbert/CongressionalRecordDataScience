 KYL. Again, so long as the person placing the wager is doing so using a ``closed-loop subscriber-based service'' the person is not required to be physically present at a facility that is open to the public to make a lawful wager.  Mr. McCONNELL. What if the facts are the same as my first interactive account wagering question (i.e., both customer and facility are physically present in the same state) but the race on which the account holder is wagering is being contested in another state or foreign country and the facility where the account wagering system originates is commingling its pools, including its account wagering pools, into the pools of the out-of-state host track where the race is being run. Will this fit within the exceptions found in Section 3 of S. 474?
