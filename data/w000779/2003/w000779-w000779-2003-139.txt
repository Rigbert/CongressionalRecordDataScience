President: Today, I introduce, for myself and Mrs. Feinstein, the Community and Forest Protection Act. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:       (1) In 2002, approximately six and one half million acres      of forest lands in the U.S. burned with varying degrees of      severity, 21 people lost their lives, and over 3000      structures were destroyed. The Forest Service and Bureau of      Land Management spent more than $1 billion fighting these      fires.       (2) 73 million acres of public lands are classified as      condition class 3 fire risks. This includes 23 million acres      that are in strategic areas designated by the U.S. Forest      Service for emergency treatment to withstand catastrophic      fire.       (3) The forest management policy of fire suppression has      resulted in an accumulation of fuel loads, dead and dying      trees, and non-native species that create fuel ladders which      allow fires to reach the crowns of large old trees and cause      catastrophic fire.       (4) The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the      Interior should immediately undertake an emergency program to      reduce the risk of catastrophic fire.       (5) This emergency program should prioritize the protection      of homes and communities and the restoration of forest health      on lands at the highest risk of catastrophic fire. All fuel      reduction treatments should protect old growth stands and      large trees to ensure a rich and continued species diversity      in the nation's forests.     SECTION 1.
