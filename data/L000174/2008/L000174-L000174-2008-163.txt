President, I wish to pay tribute to June Salander of Rutland, VT. On June 28, 2008, June will celebrate her 100th birthday.  June Salander has led a remarkable life. Like many Jewish immigrants, she came to the United States via Ellis Island in 1920 after a journey from Ros, Poland, making the trip with her mother, brother, and sister. Family and a supportive Jewish community were always positioned as cornerstones of June's upbringing. In 1941 she married her husband Lew Salander and moved to Rutland, VT, where she has remained an active community member ever since. A strong believer in the idea that it takes a village to raise a child, June has lent her time volunteering at the Rutland Hospital and teaching Hebrew school classes. June has remained an active citizen into her golden years, earning her real estate license at the age of 62 and taking up tennis at the impressive age of 73. Her commitment to education and community outreach expands to the home with June's famous cooking. June warms the homes and lives of others with her legendary apple strudel which she has shared through cooking lessons. She continues to inspire with her dedication to continual learning and improvement.  June Salander inspires with her energy and enthusiasm within the religious community as well. The Rutland Jewish Center has remained an integral part of her social and cultural life. June's daughter, Menasha, accurately describes the center as June's living room, kitchen, dining room, and backyard. Deeply rooted community involvement remains a core value, and to further uphold and solidify the Jewish tradition, June was Bat Mitzvahed at the extraordinary age of 89. It is believed that June is the oldest Rutland resident to complete the significant ceremony. Her commitment to observing Judaism and keeping tradition alive through education is a landmark of encouragement and pride for the Jewish community. I congratulate June Salander as she reaches yet another remarkable milestone, her 100th birthday. The message she has instilled in others through a lifetime of active citizenship is commendable. I am confident that June's spiritually fulfilling and publicly active life will continue to inspire others for years to come.  On a personal note, my wife Marcelle and I have cherished her friendship for a third of a century, as we did that of her wonderful husband.                          ____________________
