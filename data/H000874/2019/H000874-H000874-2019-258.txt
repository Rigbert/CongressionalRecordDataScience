Scalise, the Republican whip, for yielding.  On Tuesday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour debate, and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.  Members are being advised that debate on amendments to H.R. 2740 will begin at 3 p.m. on Tuesday.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.  Members are reminded that when the House is considering appropriation bills, votes will occur after 7 p.m.  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes on Friday may occur between 2 and 3 p.m.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.  The House will continue consideration of H.R. 2740, the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020.  The House will also begin consideration of H.R. 3055, which is the Commerce, Justice, Science, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act.  This will be the second minibus that will be coming to the floor over this work period. It is my intention, Mr. Speaker, to pass all 12 appropriation bills in this work period.  This package is yet another step toward the House doing its work to avoid another shutdown, which has such a negative effect on the Nation and a negative effect on the morale of those who work for the American people in the Federal Government.  Hopefully, it will result in an agreement between the House and the Senate, and a signature of the President, which will preclude a repeat of the shutdown.
