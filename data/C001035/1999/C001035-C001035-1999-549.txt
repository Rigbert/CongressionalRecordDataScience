President, I am pleased to join the distinguished senior Senator from the State of Maine, Senator Snowe, in introducing private relief legislation for Nancy B. Wilson.  By way of background, Al Wilson worked for Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, and he and his wife Edna had two children. In 1945, tragedy stuck the family when Edna suffered a severe mental breakdown and was permanently placed in a mental institution, leaving Al to care for the children.  Five years later, Al met Nancy Butler, who immediately began caring for Al's two young children, as well as her son. Nancy took residence with Al and soon began to raise the children as her own. The eldest child has written that Nancy ``is the person who brought me up in place of my biological mother, who was institutionalized. I think of Nancy as my real mother.''  Al and Nancy wanted to get married, but Al was prohibited from divorcing Edna by a Massachusetts state law. The law barred a divorce for reasons of insanity or institutionalization for insanity. The Congressional Research Service confirmed that a ``divorce could not have been granted under Massachusetts law during the 1960's and 1970's solely because one spouse was insane.''  On April 12, 1969, Edna Wilson died. Twenty days later, on May 2, 1969, Nancy and Al were married. Al died of cancer seven months later on December 5, 1969. Nancy had lived with Al for 19 years.  Upon turning sixty-four years old on March 21, 1991, Nancy applied to the Social Security Administration for survivor insurance benefits from Al's wage earnings. She was refused benefits based upon the limited term of her legal marriage. According to Social Security regulations, a couple must be married for at least nine months for a spouse to collect survivor benefits.  Nancy has exhausted the available legal remedies, taking full advantage of the administrative appeals process. Nancy filed a request for reconsideration and appeared at a hearing before an administrative law judge. On January 28, 1992, the Social Security Administration issued its final decision denying her claim for benefits.  The private relief bill we are introducing would allow Nancy to receive widow's benefits from her husband's earnings. Nancy Wilson was, for all practical purposes, married to Al Wilson. She cohabited with him for nineteen years prior to their marriage. She raised his children, allowing him to work and accumulate a Social Security benefit. Nancy and Al were legally prevented from marrying by Massachusetts state law, even though his marriage with his first wife had essentially ended.  Mr. President, the unique circumstances of Mrs. Wilson epitomize why Congress has the power to enact private relief legislation. Her situation fulfills the intent of the Social Security Act. Al and Nancy were prohibited from marrying; clearly they would have if the law allowed them to do so. This unique situation is an exception that will not be repeated. Since their marriage, a no-fault divorce statute has been enacted in Massachusetts, which prevents this situation from occurring again. Mrs. Wilson's case is a compelling one which we believe the Senate should alleviate.                                 ______                                       By
