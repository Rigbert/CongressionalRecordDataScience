President, Jones Academy was founded over 100 years ago, in 1891, on the site of an earlier school operated by the Choctaw Nation. Its sister institution was the Wheelock Academy for Girls, founded earlier than Jones and providing an academic curriculum for girls. Both programs were federally funded through the Office of Indian Affairs--later renamed the Bureau of Indian Affairs--with many private and tribal donations.  Until 1950, the situation worked. While the Bureau of Indian Affairs technically ran the school, the relative isolation of the school and the constant presence of a large Indian Tribe meant that the children at Jones Academy received an education adequate for their academic and personal needs. In 1952, the Federal Government instituted the termination policy. In 1953, the BIA approached the Public School District of Hartshorne, OK. They offered to close the academic programs for Jones Academy and totally close Wheelock Academy. The children were to be bused to Hartshorne School District, in exchange for local public education of these children. The school district agreed, provided they continued to receive Johnson-O'Malley payments as well as impact aid payments for Indian students. Over tribal objections, this arrangement was instituted and Jones Academy became a dormitory-only program. It has remained such for 45 years.  An agreement between the Choctaw Nation and the Hartshorne School District was reached in 2003 to allow children in the lowest grades, 1-6, to attend classes on campus, at Jones Academy, thus receiving better support and avoiding lengthy busing. As part of this agreement, and to assist the children through better programs, the Choctaw Nation has constructed and equipped state-of-the-art facilities, and it did so without any Federal assistance. In recent years, the programs at Jones Academy School site have won numerous awards for being one of Oklahoma's highest achieving schools.  However, the Choctaw Nation is not able to implement control over the Jones Academy program or exercise self determination as other tribes do. They wish to do so, as a normal extension of Jones' recent success and the Choctaw Nation's desire to improve continuously. This can only be done if the tribe is allowed to actually operate Jones Academy academic program under its own policies and programs, reflecting its push for excellence.  Because of a moratorium enacted in 1995, which prevents any tribal school from receiving Federal academic program support for any program not operated at that school, the Jones Academy is prevented from reestablishing their programs and entering the Federal grant schools system. This moratorium was originally enacted as a ``temporary'' halt to changes to allow the BIA time to develop and institute a new construction and facilities system. However, the moratorium has been continued as a provision of the law.  My Oklahoma colleague in the House, Mr. Boren, has been working on this issue, and the House committee report accompanying the proposed fiscal year 2010 Interior appropriations bill contains language to address the issue in the form of a BIA study. I support the inclusion of this language and support the prompt completion of the study. I support the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and Chief Pyle on this issue.                          ____________________
