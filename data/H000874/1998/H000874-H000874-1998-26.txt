Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  I rise today opposed to this report and opposed to the way the Republican leadership has run roughshod over the will of the majority of the House, the majority of the Senate, and the American people.  We have discussed this issue many times before. The full House voted twice, the Senate voted once in support of contraceptive coverage for Federal employees. This is basic health care for women, health care that will help to reduce the number of abortions.  But to satisfy their right wing, for political reasons, the Republican leadership is once again extending the arm of government into the doctor's office. They claim to know better than doctors. It has been said many times before, but let me say it once again. This provision will not require plans to cover any form of abortion, including RU486.  We all know that the law forbids Federal health plans from covering any form of abortion. What was intended here was to ensure that women have access to the health care that they need and that they deserve. It enables couples to reduce the need for abortion.
