When I look at this, I look at this vote as being one of the most significant I will cast in the U.S. Senate. Would my colleague not agree, this is a bill that will punish Vermonters?  It will punish the Vermont economy for years to come. It imposes a radical agenda on the American people that will squeeze the middle class, hurt the poor, and reward the rich.  In my State, I would say, we want a balanced budget. I want a balanced budget. Most Vermonters--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--want a balanced budget. Vermonters want a balanced budget, but they do not want it under an agenda that wipes out most of them. They want an agenda that speaks to all of them.  But this balanced budget is Newt Gingrich's agenda. It is not Vermont's agenda.  Would the Senator from California agree with that?
