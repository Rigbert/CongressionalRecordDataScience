 I read from page 59 to get the significance?  Do you get the significance?  That was stated on 50 and 51 and 52. This is 59. After all is said and done, the question was asked: Do you believe with the safeguards you can rely upon the stockpile, the strategic stockpile, approach as opposed to nuclear testing?  They said yes.  It follows. Page 59 and 60, I am reading from. Maybe there is something after page 61 in the testimony that would undermine what I have just said. I respectfully suggest I am unaware of it if it is. I stand ready to hear it if it has been.  It is one of those deals, folks. You have to go to the end. It ``ain't over until the fat lady sings.'' It ain't over until you read the whole transcript. The last thing stated was: We have confidence.  Then, after the testimony, after the testimony and after the New YorkTimes article, the Department of Energy and in the name of the three scientists quoted--and I will read it again.  ``While there can be no guarantee''--the point he is making on page 50--``that the stockpile remains safe and reliable indefinitely without nuclear testing, we have stated that we are confident that a fully supported and sustained stockpile stewardship program will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.''  I yield the floor.
