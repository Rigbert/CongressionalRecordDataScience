 But I tell my learned friend and neighbor from New York something I just said to my dear friend from West Virginia, the senior Senator from West Virginia. A poll was taken very recently, in the last few days, in my State of Vermont, where a majority of Vermonters said, ``Yes, pass the balanced budget amendment.'' But then a very significant proportion said, ``But we don't expect it to do anything.''  I might say to my learned friend, because I listened to his discussions and I heard him lay out very much for the President of the United States at a small gathering a week ago that we should have a sense of history, probably the biggest sense of history we ought to have is that this country has amended the Constitution only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We have done it very carefully. Now we have 60 or 70 proposals made in the last few weeks to amend the Constitution, all of which would fit nicely on a bumper sticker, none of which, I would add, would do anything to improve the greatest democracy in the world and many of which I feel would damage greatly this wonderful country.  I thank the Senator for yielding.
