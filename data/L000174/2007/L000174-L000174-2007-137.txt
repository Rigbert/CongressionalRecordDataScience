President, we have nominations before us for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench of Jennifer Walker Elrod of the Fifth Circuit, Roslynn Renee Mauskopf for the Eastern District of New York, Richard Jones for the Western District of Washington, and Sharion Aycock for the Northern District of Mississippi.
