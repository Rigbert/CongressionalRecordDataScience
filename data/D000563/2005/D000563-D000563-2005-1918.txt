That is all it is doing. What I just described to the Senator is to say unequivocally, if someone files the initial documents currently required under chapter 7 and demonstrates to the court that their monthly income is below a median income, they do not have to fill out all of the additional paperwork required in the means test, which is substantial and expensive. If the Senator feels as I do, that that is what the law says or should say, I hope the Senator will look at my amendment. It is not a trick amendment. It is just trying to clarify that point.
