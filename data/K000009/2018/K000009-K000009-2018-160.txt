Speaker, on this Memorial Day weekend, I rise to remember the life of Sister M. Maurice Wodarski, a dedicated servant of the Franciscan Order of Sylvania, Ohio. Of proud Polish/American heritage, she left us for God's grace this past January. Throughout her blessed life, she tended souls so faithfully, generously, and jovially. The sparkle in her eyes revealed a loving heart. And her crisply ironed beige habit with veil alerted you: this was a woman of serious purpose. Sr. Maurice was on a mission and she had no time to waste.  Having entered the convent from Nativity Parish in Toledo, OH in 1951, Sister Maurice lived her vows of poverty, chastity and obedience as a dedicated woman of faith and service who ministered for over six decades indefatigably to the young, young at heart, the home bound, those in nursing homes, and veterans. For 35 years she taught the young minds of students in Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and Maryland. She took great pride in teaching math, even helping other teachers decorate their bulletin boards, and instructing altar boys on Mass.  Sister Maurice had a gift for helping the elderly. After teaching, she began working on the ministry of care for Rosary Hall at St. Vincent Medical Center in Cleveland, OH for the elder Sisters, and then later at the new Franciscan Nursing Care Center in Sylvania, Ohio. She had trained as a home health aide, and went on to care for the elderly individually in their homes for over two decades. She brought joy and compassion. And she worked very hard.  A fierce and devoted advocate for veterans, Sister Maurice sought to honor her Korean War Veteran brothers who served in the Marines through her own service. She volunteered at the Toledo Community Veterans Outpatient Clinic, served as Chaplain for the Przybylski Post 642, and was a State Officer of the Ohio Chaplains. She received accolades for her veterans' work and was awarded the Volunteer of the Month in the VA's 2014 newsletter and the St. Agnes Medal from the National Catholic War Veterans Auxiliary. The St. Agnes Medal is the highest national honor a CWVA member can attain.  On June 1, 2018, I will attend a tree planting in honor of our late Sister at the Veterans Clinic in Toledo. I could not think of a more appropriate setting, as her memory will live on inspiring and comforting the veterans she cared for and appreciated. Please allow me to share a favorite memory recalling the sunny day when ground was first broken to build the new clinic. Photos were being arranged for those present and we soon realized SisterMaurice was not to be found. Hurriedly, I rushed behind the stage and scaffolding to see if we could locate her and sure enough, I spotted Sister Maurice on her knees planting holy medals in the soil around the perimeter of what was to be the future new Veterans Clinic. That describes Sister Maurice. In her own words, ``I've always had a big heart for the veterans, watching them come home crippled and with health problems. I am happy that we are able to help them at the VA Clinic.'' I hope the tree will also serve as a reminder of the sacrifices our veterans give that fosters the altruistic support of such remarkable individuals as Sister Maurice.  Sister Maurice's work and spirit will live on through her chosen Order-the Sisters of Saint Francis of Sylvania whom she loved. She will be fondly remembered and dearly missed for her dedication to God, service, and fellow men and women. Our country surely owes her a debt of gratitude.  The hallmark of a public servant is to leave the world a better place for humanity after you leave it Sister Maurice Wodarski fulfilled her mission. May God bless her and keep her in celestial comfort and joy.                          ____________________
