Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I am very supportive of food labeling requirements, including labeling requirements for a genetically-modified food, and would support such legislation if it were coming as an amendment to the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. However, the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey is the wrong way to do it, and here is why.  If the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey passes and the bill is enacted into law with his amendment, then all someone needs to do to defeat the immunity that is given to the food industry under this bill is to simply allege that there was not the proper notice that was given. This allegation, at least in terms of the preliminary motions in court, is taken as true, and that sets up a question of fact. All of the expenses that are needed in terms of defending a lawsuit, such as depositions and the like, are going to have to be incurred in order to prove that there was the proper notice given or that there were no genetically-modified organisms that were supplied in the food that the plaintiff consumed.  So as a result, in the name of better labeling rather than attacking this issue as an amendment to the Pure Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is where I think it belongs, the gentleman attempts to have what is in the jurisdiction of another committee and which deals with another enactment on the statute books of the United States of America through this method.  I would support the gentleman from New Jersey if he was doing it the proper way through an amendment to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, but this is not the way to do it.  Now, secondly, there is nothing in the gentleman's amendment that says what constitutes an adequate notification. Does an adequate notification consist of the nutritional sign on the wall of a fast food restaurant that talks about ingredients and that nobody stands and stares at unless the line is so long that they have to do it? Does it require that there be this kind of a label on every package that is handed to the customer with the food contained in it? These are the types of things that really should not be left up to the courts to, in their infinite imagination, determine what is adequate and what is not; it should be done in the proper way by the proper committee, and that is why this amendment ought to be rejected.                              {time}  1415
