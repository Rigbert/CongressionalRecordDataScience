President, I understand there is a request for a rollcall on the Senator's amendment. I was not going to ask for one, as he knows. I wonder if he would have any problem with a unanimous consent agreement that when we come back on the bill in the morning, his amendment will be the pending amendment and there be 10 minutes a side, and we then proceed to a vote on it.  I am throwing this out as a suggestion, so my colleagues will hear it. For one thing, rather than spend several hours on the same amendment in the morning, or tonight, perhaps we will be able to do this: I say to the floor staff that this is a unanimous consent request that I will be making. I do not intend to make a unanimous consent request at this time. I will soon make this request.
