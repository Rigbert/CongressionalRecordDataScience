Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, again, I want to compliment the gentleman from Guam (Mr. Underwood) in working with him on this issue, and we will continue to revisit this issue as time goes by. We hope someday that we would like to see the commonwealth, or whatever Guam wants to be, become what they want to be. And with the people in Guam and the efforts they have had in the past and the future, I am sure that will occur.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.
