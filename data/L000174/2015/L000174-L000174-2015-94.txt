President, I thank the distinguished Senator from California. I am sure I won't take that long.                           Planned Parenthood  Mr. President, I will speak further on the efforts to defund health services for women later on, but I am concerned about those Senators who are attacking women's health with a renewed effort to eliminate health centers that thousands of Vermonters rely on every day. Across the country we have millions of low-income women who depend on Planned Parenthood health centers for lifesaving preventive treatments and care, including annual exams, cervical and breast cancer screenings, and HIV screenings and counseling. These clinics are the primary source of health services for many women. Eliminating Federal funding for Planned Parenthood health centers would deny women access to these critical services. They will force women to find medical care elsewhere or, more devastatingly--or more probable--to simply go without.  The partisan bill that was introduced yesterday in the Senate is the latest attempt to score political points. It is bumper sticker politics at its worst. Needlessly jeopardizing the health care of millions of Americans who depend on these preventive care services is a bid to rally a base that is as irresponsible as it is offensive to this Senator. I know women in Vermont who tell me they go for their health care, their cancer screening, to the Planned Parenthood centers because they feel they have people they feel comfortable with. They can bring their daughters, their children there. They know they are going to be cared for. They know people will care for them. They don't care whether they are Republicans or Democrats, they are women who need health care, and I will strongly oppose the effort that is going to be before us in this body to cut off health care for women.  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from California.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from California.
