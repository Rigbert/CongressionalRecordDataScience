President, we all recognize the need for qualified, well-trained and dedicated teachers to improve the education of students throughout the United States. Unfortunately, many students who are just returning from their summer vacations are entering classrooms where teachers have not been so prepared, who are not as qualified as they should be, and this, of course, impacts tremendously on the productivity and the excellence of American education.  Today I am introducing legislation which I believe will change fundamentally the way teachers are trained and, thus, improve the quality of teaching in America's classrooms. This is absolutely critical, since over the next decade, 2 million new teachers will need to be hired. This is the result of a combination of retirements of existing teachers, together with the increase in student population which is taking place throughout the United States.  Last year's report by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future entitled, ``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future'', shed light on the disheartening state of the teaching profession in the United States: more than 12 percent of all newly hired teachers have no training whatsoever in educational technique and pedagogy; more than 14 percent enter the teaching profession without meeting State standards; 23 percent of all secondary teachers do not have even a minor in the main teaching field which they have been hired to perform, including more than 30 percent of mathematics teachers; and, in schools with the highest minority enrollments, students have less than a 50-percent chance of getting a science or mathematics teacher who holds a license and degree in the field which they are teaching.  These findings were echoed also in ``Quality Counts: A Report Card on the Condition of Public Education in the 50 States,'' which was published this past January by Education Week. This report notes that on average, 4 out of 10 secondary teachers do not have a degree in the subjects they teach; there are too many unlicensed teachers in America's classrooms; and too few of our prospective teachers receive the high-quality education they need to be effective teachers.  Overall, this report rated the States, and the average was C. No State received an A, and there were only eight B's: California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Vermont. Three States received D's for their teaching: Arizona, Hawaii, and Idaho. And the rest, including my State of Rhode Island, received a gentleman's C, which in today's competitive world is unsatisfactory for the future of our country and the success of our children.  It must be noted that teacher quality varies tremendously; that in different classrooms in the same schools, you will see outstanding teachers in one and less qualified teachers in another. Many students are taught by a qualified teacher who understands their subject and how to teach students to excel. But not all students are so fortunate. These students are being deprived essentially of the quality education they need because their teacher is not well prepared and not qualified.  ``What teachers know and do is the most important reflection on what students learn'' is the first premise of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future.  Given the statistics I just recited about the current state of teaching in America, it is no wonder American students are failing to make the grade in a very competitive world. Indeed, a study which compared high- and low-achieving elementary schools with similar student characteristics found that more than 90 percent of the variation in achievement in math and reading was directly attributable to differences in the qualifications of the teachers in those schools.  It is also no wonder that American students don't fare well in international comparisons. The results of the eighth-grade Third International Mathematics and Science Study found that these students barely scored above the world average in science and below the world average in mathematics. And today, being mediocre is insufficient in order to face the challenges of a very complex world.  Even though much has been done to address teacher quality, the truth is that the current system of teacher preparation does not give teachers a fair chance at success. Prospective teachers, those in training in our Nation's teacher colleges, are not likely to be provided with the panoply of experiences which they need, such as actual classroom time, structured practice opportunities, a talented and experienced teacher as a mentor, and the skills to work with diverse student populations.  These are the tools they need to be adequately prepared and, sadly, many do not receive this help while they are in teacher preparation. Indeed, as the 1996 report by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future notes, traditional teacher education programs are failing because they are too short, too fragmented and they use textbooks rather than active hands-on teaching methods. They also neglect to develop some of the ideas and concepts that are critical to success, such as working in teams and using technology.  Sadly, I believe there is a real disconnect between the teacher colleges that prepare teachers and the elementary and secondary schools that hire them to teach the children of America. Consequently, beginning teachers are thrown into classrooms without the skills to succeed. As Linda Darling-Hammond, the Executive Director of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, writes, the message given to these teachers in the beginning of the school year is ``Figure it out yourself. We'll see you in June. . .if you make it that long!''  Due to this sink-or-swim method of teacher preparation, some teachers do not make it to June or survive past the first few years of teaching. As a USA Today article from earlier this year points out, 17 percent of new teachers leave the classroom after 1 year, and a 1987 study by Grissmer and Kirby estimated that 30 to 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within 3 to 5 years.  Add to this defection from the ranks of the profession the increased student enrollment due to the continuing Baby Boom Echo which will reach a record 52.2 million in 1997 and, indeed, increase each year through 2006, and impending retirements of many of our teachers. This situation creates a tremendous challenge and a need to prepare over 2 million new teachers to face the next century.  The time is ripe to face this challenge. We must do so now before public support for education wanes. By enacting needed reforms and changes in how we prepare and continue the development of teachers, we can guarantee the success of both students and teachers.  We must directly connect our teacher preparation and development system toour elementary and secondary schools. Our future teachers need and deserve the kind of hands-on training and ``real world'' experience they will get from more exposure and practice in today's classrooms, as well as the mentoring and assistance they will receive from our best and most experienced veteran teachers. My bill accomplishes this by fostering partnerships between the teacher colleges at our Nation's institutions of higher education and elementary and secondary schools.  These partners should work in concert to prepare teachers adequately and keep their skills updated by working jointly to develop enhanced curricula and mentoring activities, as well as to research and implement sound teaching and learning practices.  As Jerrald Shrive wrote in ``Lessons from Restructuring Experiences: Stories of Change in Professional Development Schools'':       . . . educational partnerships and collaborations [between      schools and universities] can be one significant piece of the      actions necessary to move all of education to more productive      levels.  These premises underlie the legislation I introduce today. The Teacher Excellence in America Challenge Act or the TEACH Act, aims to improve the continuum of professional development from preservice preparation to the induction of new teachers to the improvement of veteran teachers, all of this designed to increase the achievement of our students.  My legislation establishes a competitive 5-year grant program to provide grants to professional development partnerships consisting of institutions of higher education, public elementary and secondary schools, local educational agencies, and others, such as the State educational agency, teacher organizations, or nonprofit organizations. These partnerships must be based upon a mutual commitment to improve teaching and learning.  These partnerships would use grant funding to support, as well as create, professional development schools, a reform that has been employed across this country and other industrialized nations and has shown success in increasing student achievement, better preparing prospective and beginning teachers, and providing critical ongoing opportunities for the professional development of veteran teachers.  Professional development schools involve shared responsibility and cooperation between the institutions of higher education that prepare teachers and the public elementary and secondary schools that employ teachers, a system similar to teaching hospitals.  An example of a professional development school can be found at the Sullivan School in Newport, RI. It is in a partnership with Salve Regina University. At the Sullivan School, Salve Regina students are given opportunities to practice teaching in a real classroom. Sullivan teachers are involved in observing these Salve Regina students, and they can also utilize the resources of Salve Regina University for professional development opportunities. Sullivan students go on field trips to Salve Regina for both higher education and career awareness activities, and the parents of these Sullivan students are also involved and are also provided opportunities for education and training.  This is a model of one possible way to use professional development schools to enhance the preparation of teachers, the education of students, and the involvement of parents.  Additional components of the TEACH Act include forging links between a university's school of education and their schools of arts and sciences. We have found in our discussions and research that many times within the university itself there is no collaboration, connection and concentration. This legislation will foster such cooperation.  The TEACH Act also encourages the development of mentoring programs in which senior expert teachers would help younger teachers. It emphasizes technology training, which is a key piece now of higher education everywhere, and it recognizes that in order to be a good teacher, you have to have time to prepare to be a good teacher. It also would create a cadre of quality teachers that would act as a resource to enhance the professional development of all teachers and reestablishes principals as educational leaders.  This is not a giveaway grant program. The TEACH Act offers resources to partnerships but it demands results. Strong evaluation provisions in the TEACH Act require that partnerships demonstrate increased student achievement, improved teacher preparation, increased opportunities for professional development, and also it insists that well-qualified teachers be placed in the classroom in order to continue to receive this grant funding.  In addition, the legislation requires an independent national evaluation of the short-term and long-term impacts and outcomes of these professional development partnerships.  Mr. President, given the growing need to update and improve the teacher training in this country, I expect we will see other proposals to address this problem offered in this body. I would be concerned if such proposals fell short on what we must accomplish by block granting training programs or failing to approach the kind of rigor that is included in the legislation I submit today. We have to have a rigorous and demanding legislative agenda in order to inspire and act as a catalyst for better teacher training across the country. Better teacher training will lead to better teachers. And better teachers will lead to better education and a better future for our children.  My legislation puts us on track to answering the call of the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future to provide every student in America with access to competent, qualified, and dedicated teaching by the year 2006.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor and to support the TEACH Act and help reform our system of teacher training as well as update the skills of teachers already in the classroom.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1169       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
