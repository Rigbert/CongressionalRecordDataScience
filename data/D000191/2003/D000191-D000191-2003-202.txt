Chairman, it is very clear what we are saying here. Military actions except as authorized, none of the funds may be used to initiate a launch. This is beyond those already authorized. I had other language which went to that; the Parliamentarian stripped it out. But this is clearly saying we have already authorized the current actions, we authorized them under the 9/11 resolution, Afghanistan and other actions. Those are authorized. This would be future actions outside the scope of the Iraq war, outside the scope of the Afghanistan war and/or the war on terrorism, whatever those might be, and Secretary Rumsfeld has an active mind.
