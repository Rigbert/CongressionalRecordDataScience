Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to present H.R. 4073, the Microenterprise Enhancement Act of 2002, to the House. This important anti-poverty legislation reforms, enhances, and expands microenterprise programs throughout the world and authorizes $375 million over 2 years for this incredible initiative.  I would like to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) for his very strong and steadfast support of this legislation and commend him for the great leadership that he has shown on so many foreign policy and humanitarian issues, especially since September 11.  I would also like to thank my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Roemer), our leading Democratic cosponsor, whose tremendous efforts greatly influenced and helped shape this important piece of legislation. This has been a great team effort, and again I want to thank him for his extraordinary work and leadership.  The support of both the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), our committee's ranking member, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the chairman emeritus, have also been important. I would also like to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton), and the nearly 80 other cosponsors for their support of this endeavor.  Mr. Speaker, the impact of microenterprise on entrepreneurs and borrowers in the developing world cannot be estimated and overstated. Over 2 million clients are currently benefitting from AID-assisted programs, and since its inception, millions more have been empowered by microenterprise services.  Like many of my colleagues, and like I think Members of the other body, I have been at times critical of some of our Nation's foreign aid programs, because some of the money never really ends up reaching the people that that money is intended to reach. One of the reasons I am so enthusiastic about microenterprise programs is because they are fundamentally different than traditional foreign aid programs. They are based on a bottom-up, grass roots approach rather than a top-down model.  Microenterprise programs have demonstrated very impressive results. An estimated 97 percent of the loans are actually repaid. Contrast that to some of our own domestic lending programs, and the difference is rather stark.  Studies on the effects of microenterprise programs find they promote higher household income and increased family well-being, including improved nutrition and education among children.                              {time}  1415  In the past 2 fiscal years, we have spent $155 million, which has been authorized by Congress for microfinance. I am proud to say that this legislation we are considering today will expand that to $175 million for fiscal year 2003, and $200 million for fiscal year 2004. Our legislation will also ensure that more funds go to the poorest of the poor, or as we now define it, the very poor, including those living on less than $1 a day.  Although previous legislation has stipulated that 50 percent of the funds will go to the poorest of the poor, efforts to target funding to the neediest persons has been insufficient because AID essentially uses only a single measurement tool to evaluate its poverty outreach efforts, and that is to say, average loan size.  With currency values varying from country to country, and loan size dependent on the type of business a person is attempting to start, this has not been a sufficient measure, has not been an accurate barometer of poverty.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4073, as amended, would require AID to devise new, more meaningful poverty-assessment tools and give consideration to low-cost, easy-to-implement tools already in use by the microfinance institutions. Moreover, AID will have a deadline of October 1, 2004, to certify and utilize at least two additional poverty-assessment techniques that can better evaluate who the poorest actually are and ensure that they receive their fair share of the funds provided under this act.  A main reason for the success of the microenterprise programs is that the assistance goes directly to those who need our help. It provides vital capital for small business owners to strive and achieve their dreams. It helps build sound financial institutions on the grassroots level that foster self-sufficiency. A loan of several hundred dollars or less, which by our standards might be considered quite small, is often a substantial portion of a person's yearly earnings in the developing world. Such a loan can help an entrepreneur businessman or businesswoman increase their profits many-fold, making a better life for themselves and their families for many years to come.  Take the example of Baulia Parra Pruneda of Monterrey, Mexico, one of the many successful recipients of a microenterprise loan. When her husband lost his job in 1998, she was determined to support her six children. Even though she had never worked before and could not read or write, she taught herself to sew by following designs that she saw in magazines. A $150 loan from a lending institution supported by ACCION, one of the leading microfinance institutions in the Americas, provided capital for her to purchase the necessary supplies to launch her endeavor into self-sufficiency. After building her small business through a series of microloans, she now sells over 100 items per week. The money she earns and continues to make not only provides food for her children, but has also enabled her to install a toilet and a shower, as well as a second floor in her home.  As inspiring as Braulia's story is, it is not unique. When given the opportunity and the seed capital to produce, people can turn their economic situation around in a dramatic way. The goal now is to build on past successes that have reached tens of thousands of people and apply lessons learned to devising a better program.  Mr. Speaker, it is worth noting that approximately 70 percent of microenterprise beneficiaries are women, so this initiative is key to reversing the feminization of poverty. I would note that later today, probably by early tomorrow, the report on trafficking will be issued pursuant to the trafficking legislation that we passed last year. I was the prime sponsor of that bill. We worked very hard in a bipartisan way. The gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) worked on it, and so many others, to ensure that we crack down on this terrible scourge called trafficking. But one of the core reasons why women can be preyed upon and trafficked into prostitution and other involuntary servitude has been poverty. They have been exploited because they are vulnerable.  This legislation is part of the effort to give women the opportunity to take care of themselves, as well as their families.  Mr. Speaker, let me say finally, the greatest antipoverty program will always be a job. This is all about job creation, one village at a time, one community at a time, one family at a time. It is a very important piece of legislation, it is bipartisan at the outset; and I hope all Members will support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
