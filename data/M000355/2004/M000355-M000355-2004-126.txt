 President, I also understand that we are close to an agreement between the interested parties on the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services Committee on the important sequential referral issue that has been under discussion all day long with the principals of those two committees. We are hoping to be able to deal with that amendment shortly.  If anyone else has an amendment they want to offer, now is the time. The majority leader and the minority leader have indicated we are going to press into the evening and finish this proposal. If you have an amendment, we urge you to come over and offer it.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
