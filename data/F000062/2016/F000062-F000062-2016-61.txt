 President, I say to the body that I support this amendment. The Murray amendment would reinforce ``Buy American'' provisions that have been in place for decades. These provisions say that when American tax dollars are being spent, the preference should be to buy American products.  Despite current Federal regulations, there are concerns that the Corps of Engineers is circumventing these ``Buy American'' provisions and acquiring welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain manufactured by foreign sources. The Murray amendment simply reiterates current requirements to support American-made products, echoing language from our colleagues in the House and the 2016 appropriations bill.  The amendment is good for families and workers across the country, and I urge this body to support it.
