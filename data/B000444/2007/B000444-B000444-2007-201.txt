 President, I send to the desk two amendments. I am only going to speak to one, but I would like to send both to the desk so I have them offered. One is an amendment relating to funding of the homeland security effort, and the other is one relating tothe ability for cities and States to reroute hazardous waste around their major metropolitan areas.
