Speaker, I rise in support of the conference report on Interior appropriations.  Mr. Speaker, I am the chairman of the authorizing subcommittee with jurisdiction over mineral resources on the public lands. I believe the conference report language on mining claims solves a problem.  Mr. Speaker, we have an opportunity to fix an outdated law, not since 1866, whereby miners pay a fixed price of $5 an acre for resource-rich land. None of us believe that the existing price of $5 an acre is valid today, but there is every reason to support his conference report.  Mr. Speaker, let me make it clear that patent applicants will pay fair market value for the land, upon enactment of this conference report. The Committee on Resources has within its budget reconciliation title legislation a measure to levy a royalty on hardrock minerals produced from public lands for the first time in 150 years.  Mr. Speaker, why would any of us not support his opportunity to charge fair market value for mineral patents and receive royalty?  Mr. Speaker, I urge acceptance of this conference report.
