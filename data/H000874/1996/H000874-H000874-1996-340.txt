Speaker, Habitat II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements is now underway in Istanbul, Turkey. World leaders, international media, and thousands of NGO representatives from around the planet have assembled to address critical global issues related to sustainable development.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to Habitat II's global significance, the meeting offers an unprecedented opportunity to further develop civil society and democracy in Turkey and raise international awareness of the serious problems which prevent Turkey from realizing its great potential. The gathering affords Turkish NGO's--the building blocks of civil society--an unparalleled opportunity to network, organize coalitions, and develop advocacy strategies. Among NGO's attending the conference, there is a palpable sense that Habitat will catalyze efforts to advance civil society, democracy, and human rights in Turkey. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this important conference will also result in concerted international efforts to support human rights and democracy in Turkey and the NGO's which support these ideals.  Mr. Speaker, Istanbul is an appropriate venue to examine sustainable development. A former seat of empires and home to a multitude of cultures and people, Istanbul is a dynamic urban bridge between Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam, antiquity and the 21st century. From modern high rises and opulent Ottoman palaces to sprawling shanty towns and exploding garbage dumps, Istanbul encompasses all that is wonderful and frightening about today's urban environments.  Mr. Speaker, Istanbul's unforgettable character owes much to a great Ottoman hero, the 16th century soldier-turned-architect, Sinan. During a prolific career that spanned six decades, Sinan-designed many of Turkey's most well-known landmarks. Yet he also built structures throughout the Ottoman empire which were critical to daily lives, including: bridges, wells, warehouses, tombs, aqueducts, baths, residences, and caravan stops. In Istanbul alone, more than 300 Sinan-designed structures have been identified.  Yet while Sinan's heritage provides an impressive Habitat backdrop, the travails of a contemporary Turkish architect reveal a not-so-proud legacy, one that reminds us that Turkey faces severe strains which threaten democracy and the development of civil society.  Yavuz Onen is general secretary of the Turkish Architect's Association and president of the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey. The Foundation documents human rights abuses and operates four treatment centers for victims of torture in Turkey. In 1995, Mr. Onen accepted awards on behalf of the Foundation from the International Human Rights Law Group and the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Foundation leaders and doctors face constant prosecution and harassment. The Turkish Government's persecution of the Foundation and other NGO's reflect a larger effort to criminalize and silence groups and individuals critical of government human rights practices, military abuses of the Kurdish population, Turkey's founder Ataturk, or state institutions.  Mr. Speaker, a more immediate attempt to silence criticism during Habitat is evidenced by the police closure of a building used by 35 NGO's boycotting the conference to protest government human rights and Kurdish policies. These groups have organized an alternative Habitat to publicly protest the destruction of almost 3,000 Kurdish villages and creation of almost 3 million refugees. These groups rightly contend that such policies are incompatible with the goals of Habitat and reflect serious threats to democracy and development of civil society in Turkey. Yet instead of allowing open discussion of these serious issues, the Government of Turkey has once again chosen to respond with repression--in full view of the international community.  Mr. Speaker, Turkey has ratified numerous U.N. and European human rights conventions, committed itself to OSCE standards and principles, and is seeking closer ties with the West. Unfortunately, efforts by successive Turkish governments to strengthen democratic institutions and institute legal reforms have failed to resolve underlying sources of human rights problems.  Mr. Speaker, Turkey is an important strategic and economic ally. As a NATO member proximate to the Balkans, Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Middle East, Turkey figures prominently in regional efforts to address water, energy, arms control, terrorism, and environmental issues. Yet while Turkey's government and people are poised to reap political, economic, and strategic windfalls, the potential perils for Turkey, should it move back on the democratic path, loom equally large.  Mr. Speaker, these dangers are very real. As Habitat II convenes, Turkey's minority coalition government verges on collapse, incapacitated since its inception by bitter personal rivalries and corruption charges. The Constitutional Court recently invalidated the parliamentary vote which approved the centrist coalition, and a no-confidence vote this Thursday will likely bring down the government. Turkey's military leaders, who seized power on three occasions since 1960, increasingly express dissatisfaction with the status quo and rising popularity of the Muslim-based Refah Party. Coup rumors abound in the Turkish press. As confidence in the government ebbs, support for Muslim fundamentalist and nationalist parties has increased. Should moderate, secular parties lose power, Turkey could turn away from the West, undergo a military coup or face deepening instability and political violence. All these scenarios set back democracy and civil society, threaten regional stability, and pose obstacles to Turkey's moving closer to Europe and the United States.  Mr. Speaker, the Turkish Government's intolerance of NGO's protesting village evacuations and other Kurdish or human rights issues has already marred Habitat. While participants in the official and NGO forums will reportedly not be prosecuted for remarks that violate Turkish law, it is unclear whether individuals and groups speaking outside the meeting will face charges. Mr. Speaker, this leads me to ask what will happen after Habitat, when NGO's energized by the experience attempt to utilize newly established links and implement strategies developed during the conference? It will be very important for all Habitatparticipants, including U.S. delegation members led by Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, to maintain links and support for groups they worked with during Habitat II. As human rights issues and the further advancement of civil society in Turkey have important implications for bilateral relations, this Congress should continue to closely monitor developments in Turkey after Habitat II.                          ____________________
