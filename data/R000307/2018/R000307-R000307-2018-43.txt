I come to the floor to urge all of my colleagues, despite the previous remarks, to vote in favor of this uniquely qualified nominee in such a vital role in our administration's Cabinet.  The point I would like to make, as we go into the very important topics we have to discuss on an international basis, is that we need Mike Pompeo, and we need him now.  As our Nation's most senior diplomat, Mike, I know, will be forthright, will be forceful and thoughtful and, yes, he will be diplomatic. He will give the President and the Congress very candid counsel. He is a man of his word.  Now, I say all of this because I think I, at least, have the credentials to know Mike and to know who he is and what he is about because I have known him for more than a decade, first as a friend and a business leader, then as a congressional colleague, and most recently as a leader of our intelligence community. We had some long talks before he accepted that offer by the President, and I thought he was very well suited.  Mike will represent American ideals and values backed by the strength of leadership of the free world--yes, the free world and the allies that have been referred to by my colleagues across the aisle. The point is, whenever there is a void, the world pays a price. That is why we need Mike, and that is why we need him now.  I am going to again urge all of my colleagues--all of those who voted in support of his intelligence post last year and those who now have the opportunity to support this extremely qualified candidate--to vote yes and to send our senior diplomat to work on the many challenges that face our Nation.               Nominations and the Appropriations Process  Madam President, now, let me talk a little bit about bipartisanship and what I have stated with regard to my friend and colleague, the minority leader. I have encouraging news. We met yesterday in the Rules Committee and voted to reduce postcloture debate from 30 hours to 8 hours for certain nominations. I am not sure we have the 60 votes to pass that, but it is something at least we are moving toward with regard to the problem of having 86 cloture votes and delaying the time; that is, 3 months, by the way, with regard to time lost that we could have been working on other issues.  We still have to consider this change to the rules on the Senate floor, but in the course of our debate, the minority whip, Senator Durbin, who is an appropriator par excellence, has supported Chairman Shelby's commitment to do all 12 appropriations bills--how long, how long, how long has it been since we have done appropriations bills and voted on amendments on appropriations bills?  The leadership has apparently decided to recommend that we actually return to being a Senate voting on amendments. Many Senators, as I said earlier, do not even know what it is like to serve in a functioning Senate. They hardly know what it is like to operate under regular order, where bills are referred to committee, amended, brought to the floor, debated, amended, and then passed when appropriations bills were on time. Goodness knows we need to get back to that.  Members of the Appropriations Committee, without this agreement--prior to this agreement--were standing on the sidelines, wounded cardinals, if you will, with a shrinking slice of the discretionary pie. So thank you to the minority whip and thank you to the leadership on both sides for our efforts to get back to regular order.  Now you can take one step further and vote for Mike Pompeo, a qualified and honorable candidate to serve as Secretary of State. Most of the statements I have heard--I have not paid too much attention to the colloquy on the floor or the statements on the floor--but people who have reservations have a ``while I'' speech: while I understand his qualifications, while I understand he has a great background, first in his class at West Point, and while I, and while I, and while I.  Then, there is the catch: But then, on the other hand, I have some concerns. Most of the concerns are in regard to whether Mike Pompeo can be diplomatic. I know him. He can be forceful--sometimes he can be a little stubborn, but he can be forceful. He is well qualified for the job and, yes, he can be diplomatic.  So I hope we can take this step toward a bipartisan Senate and take one further vote and vote for Mike Pompeo, who is certainly qualified. I say that because the cloth of comity in this Senate is pretty threadbare. We have a situation where we need to return to a sense of comity and at least some bipartisanship. Certainly, it would be also to set aside personal and partisan concerns and vote for Mr. Pompeo.  As I said again, we have a void right now. We have a good man to be Secretary of State. I urge my colleagues to vote yes, and let's put a few threads back into the cloth of comity in the Senate and recommit to being the world's greatest deliberative body.  I yield the floor.
