 President, I rise in support of the amendment being offered by Senator Baucus, and my colleagues Senator Chafee and Domenici. Due to the error by the Treasury Department, my home State of Iowa stands to lose $2,182,000 from the highway trust fund. This amendment would correct the Treasury Department's error, restoring the money.  I understand that the Treasury Department did not correctly credit $1.6 billion to the highway trust fund in fiscal year 1994. The Treasury then corrected this error in fiscal year 1995. However, by not correctly attributing the funds to fiscal year 1994, the Treasury action is adversely affecting thedistribution of highway funds to 31 States in fiscal year 1997. This is unfair. These States are being unfairly penalized through no fault of their own. They are being penalized by an error by the Treasury Department.  I urge my fellow Senators to join the Senator from Montana, myself, and the other cosponsors of this amendment to correct this error. It is the right thing to do.
