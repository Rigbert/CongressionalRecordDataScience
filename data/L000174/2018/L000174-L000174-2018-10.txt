President, earlier this month, Marcelle and I, with Marcelle's brother, Claude Pomerleau, attended the Kennedy Center Honors Dinner at the State Department. We were moved by Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan's remarks, which touched on his deep admiration for foreign service and his great appreciation of American arts and culture. I wanted to share with the Senate his remarks, which were filled with historical references and bits of humor.  I ask unanimous consent that Deputy Secretary of State Sullivan's remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Center Deputy Secretary of State John J. Sullivan               Remarks at the 2018 Kennedy Center Honors                   December 2, 2018, Washington, D.C.       DEPUTY SECRETARY SULLIVAN: Good evening. It's an honor for      my wife, Grace Rodriguez, and me to welcome you to the      Department of State. Secretary Pompeo asked that I extend his      sincere regrets he's unable to be with us tonight because of      his travel to Buenos Aires for the G20 summit. It's a real      privilege to be asked to stand in for the Secretary of State      at a very special event like this. Deputy secretaries are      usually delegated humbler duties.       I'd like to begin by thanking Kennedy Center Chairman David      Rubenstein, Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter, Event      Chair Suzanne Niedland for their service and leadership. And      thanks to all of you in attendance tonight for coming to      honor the esteemed recipients of this year's Kennedy Center      Honor.       Gathered as we are in the Department of State, I must note      with a heavy heart the passing last night in Texas of      President George H.W. Bush, my former boss many years ago.      President Bush cherished this place and this institution. He      was, of course, the U.S. permanent representative in the      United Nations in the early 1970s, and later our first      representative to the People's Republic of China. And since      we're gathered in the Benjamin Franklin Room, I also note      that President Bush shares a distinction with Franklin: They      both served as our nation's representative to a vitally      important country but without holding the title of      ambassador. 1974, when President Bush was named the chief of      our liaison office in Beijing, the United States did not have      diplomatic relations with China. Two hundred years before,      when Franklin was sent on a commission to France and then      appointed our minister in Paris, the Court of Versailles      would not accept an ambassador from a self-declared republic      like ours. Only sovereign monarchs exchanged ambassadors      until well into the 19th century.       I've thought a lot about Franklin during my service as      deputy secretary of state. We host many special historic      events here in the Benjamin Franklin Room, including a      luncheon earlier this year for President Macron of France      during his state visit to the United States, and I'm often      asked to provide remarks. The speechwriters who prepared a      first draft appropriately note the venue, and refer to      Franklin as the first American diplomat, our minister to      France. But they also inevitably described him as, quote,      ``the father of the Foreign Service.'' And that's always      struck me as a stale, patriarchal language unsuited for the      21st century, and unlikely to inspire young Foreign Service      officers. But my effort to craft an alternative that would      motivate a new generation to careers in American diplomacy--     those efforts have failed recently. I spoke to a group of      eminent retired U.S. diplomats here in this room; they were      confused and appalled when I referred to Franklin as the      original gangster of the Foreign Service. (Laughter.)       So I've shifted my thinking to alternatives to enliven the      way we convey the remarkable life of Franklin. I had the idea      of bringing Franklin's story to life on the stage, perhaps      even a musical. (Laughter.) Who would want to see that?      Imagine, a musical about one of America's founding fathers.      (Laughter.) You laugh, but in fact, there was a Broadway      musical about Franklin, Ben Franklin in Paris, staged in      1964, and it faded quickly into obscurity. (Laughter.)       But I'm serious about promoting and honoring America's      diplomats past and present, whether it's Franklin, President      Bush, or our current friends and colleagues at this      department who are working to promote and protect America's      interests, America's values, and American citizens at      hundreds of posts, embassies, consulates, and missions around      the world, many in dangerous and difficult circumstances.      Their work is made easier by the worldwide popularity--     indeed, the pervasive influence--of the best of American arts      and culture, which is what we're here to celebrate tonight.       It is through the arts that we, the American people, tell      our story. We express the richness of our culture and      artistry when we export it to the rest of the world. And the      impact cannot be overstated. Music, theater, cinema--every      medium we celebrate tonight (inaudible) United States shows      to the world who we are. The work of the American artists      gathered here in this room is a powerful form of diplomacy.      Your influence is felt around the world.       The Kennedy Center Honors program recognizes these      exceptional artists who have contributed so much to our      culture and our world. The program is in its 41st year, and      its honorees include some of the most iconic figures in the      arts. This year's honorees certainly fall squarely into that      category.       Cher, our first honoree, needs no introduction. She's      commonly referred to as the, quote, ``goddess of pop,''      unquote, and I tested that assertion with a Google search,      whose results showed that to be true. (Laughter.) But I use      the word ``commonly'' with a purpose, because that is too      common a title for such an extraordinary talent and person.      She's achieved towering success in music, on television, on      stage, and in films. The accolades included here are too many      to name. Her voice and her music--``I Got You Babe,'' ``If I      Could Turn Back Time,'' ``Believe''--I could go on, to name      just a few--those songs are loved worldwide and have made her      a global superstar and a household name.       Composer and pianist Philip Glass is our second honoree.      He's no stranger to State Department programs and proudly      represented the United States as a Fulbright Scholar in Paris      in the 1960s. Since then, Mr. Glass has only gone on to      compose more than 25 operas, 10 symphonies, as well as      concertos, film soundtracks, and countless other works. Truly      in a league of his own, he's the recipient of the U.S.      National Medal of the Arts, and next month the Los Angeles      Philharmonic will present the world premiere of his 12th      symphony.       Our third honoree is another legend, Reba McEntire. And I      am not ashamed to say as a humble bureaucrat, I can't believe      I got to shake Reba McEntire's hand. (Laughter.) I'm telling      you, it's unbelievable. Thank you, Mike Pompeo. (Laughter.)      Her songs--``Fancy,'' ``Is There Life Out There,'' ``I'm a      Survivor''--have given her worldwide fame. She's recorded 25      number-one singles and sold over 56 million albums. But she's      achieved great success in other fields, including on      television and in movies. All you have to do is say her first      name, and the world knows exactly who you're talking about.       Wayne Shorter, the famous jazz saxophonist and composer is      next. He deservedly has been called--and again, I quote--a      genius, trailblazer, a visionary, and one of the world's      greatest composers. He's played with Miles Davis, Joni      Mitchell, Steely Dan, Carlos Santana--the list goes on. He's      won 11 Grammy Awards, including a lifetime achievement award,      but admirably, he does not rest on his laurels. He's now      working on his first album.       Finally, we honor the co-creators of Hamilton, and I hope      they will consider my suggestion of Franklin: An American      Musical. I'm just saying, Hamilton's secretary of treasury;      versus the secretary of state. (Laughter.) Just think about      that. These individuals--Lin-Manuel Miranda, Thomas Kail,      Andy Blankenbuehler, and Alex Lacamoire--together they wrote,      acted in, directed, choreographed, and arranged what has      become the best known, groundbreaking stage production of our      time. They are trailblazers who have created art that defies      categorization, breaks down barriers, and brings American      history to life.       My youngest son, Teddy, is a senior at Hamilton College and      among the show's biggest fans. He likes to wear his college      sweatshirt around Miami--excuse me, around Manhattan--and      engage the tourists who ask where do they paraphernalia like     that from the show. (Laughter.) He patiently explains to them      the merits of college, the musical, and being at the center      of both.       Now, I know I'm standing in the way of your dinner, so I      will conclude with an acknowledgement of a prior Kennedy      Center honoree--and I kind of slipped this before when I said      Miami instead of Manhattan--and that's because we're joined      tonight by Gloria Estefan. Welcome back. (Applause.) My wife      Grace and the Rodriguez family are delighted to see whom we      consider the first lady of Cuban Americans here tonight.       Thank you, again, on behalf of the Department of State, for      allowing us to be part of this celebration to pay tribute to      the lifetime contributions of the remarkable women and men we      honor tonight. Please enjoy your dinner. Thanks. (Applause.)                          ____________________
