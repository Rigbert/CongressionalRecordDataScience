President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  November 1, 1999:  Carlester Johnson, 17, Memphis, TN;  Rory Longs, 20, Chicago, IL;  Orlando Rangel, 23, Chicago, IL;  Patrice Thomas, 21, Houston, TX;  Donnell Tucker, Jr., 22, Baltimore, MD;  Adrian Miller, 43, Detroit, MI; and  John Ellis Wright, Jr., Fort Wayne, IN.  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.                          ____________________
