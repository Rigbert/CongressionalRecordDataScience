President, I am proud to once again join with Senator Cornyn to introduce the FOIA Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill that will make our Federal government more accountable to all Americans by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA.  Senator Cornyn and I introduced an almost identical bill last year, and despite it passing the Senate unanimously, the House failed to act. This was deeply disappointing, and was a missed opportunity for Congress. But Senator Cornyn and I have worked together for more than a decade to make our government more open, through Democratic and Republican administrations and Republican and Democratic-led Congresses. We have a strong partnership, and we will not quit. We are determined to make progress on creating a more open and transparent government for all Americans.  The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 codifies what President Obama laid out in his historic 2009 memorandum by requiring Federal agencies to adopt a ``Presumption of Openness'' when considering the release of government information under FOIA. Under this bill, when considering FOIA requests Federal agencies must find a reasonable foreseeable harm in order to invoke a discretionary exemption and withhold information from the public. The government should always err on the side of disclosure. Our legislation also provides additional independence to the Office of Government Information Services, OGIS, an office created by the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act in 2007 that helps mediate disputes between the Federal Government and FOIA requesters. Finally, our legislation will limit the use of Exemption 5 by placing a 25 year limitation on information covered by the exemption.  I have fought for years to make our government more open and transparent. Senator Cornyn has been an important partner in these efforts, and our collaboration has resulted in the enactment of several improvements to FOIA including the OPEN Government Act, the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade; the OPEN FOIA Act, which increased the transparency of legislative exemptions to FOIA; and the Faster FOIA Act, which responded to the concerns of FOIA requestors and addressed agency delays in processing requests.  After four decades in the Senate, I appreciate that legislating requires compromise. The FOIA Improvement Act of 2015 reflects the input of both sides of the aisle, the open government community, the administration, and many other stakeholders. It is the product of nearly a year of careful negotiations on behalf of Senator Cornyn and me. It is supported by more than 70 public interest groups that advocate for government transparency and it had the unanimous support of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate last year. Above all, it marks an historic step forward in our continued effort to open the government by codifying what President Obama set out to achieve in 2009 when he said ``In the face of doubt, openness prevails.'' This is common sense, and so I urge the Senate to quickly take up and pass this bill and for the House to follow suit so we can show the American people, in a bipartisan fashion, that we are committed to advancing their interestsabove special interests, no matter who holds control of Congress or the White House.                          ____________________
