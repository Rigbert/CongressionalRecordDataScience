President, I planned to offer an amendment to this bankruptcy bill to protect financial privacy and prevent identity theft in electronic bankruptcy court records. I thank Senators Sarbanes, Harkin, Schumer, and Rockefeller for agreeing to cosponsor this amendment.  This amendment addressed just a single area where the Federal Government, here, the Bankruptcy Courts, holds significant amounts of highly personal information, which is freely available for any person for any reason to access and use. The manner in which all three branches of the Federal Government, the Federal agencies, the Congress and the Judiciary, protect the privacy of personal information that Americans are required to divulge to the government, is an important area that needs our attention. I thank the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee for agreeing to work with me on addressing the problem in a more comprehensive manner.
