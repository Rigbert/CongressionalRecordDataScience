Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  The previous speaker, of course, talks about arrogance, he talks about posturing, he talks about politics. In 5 seconds we could preclude all of that happening by a simple continuing resolution that says the Republican leadership has not been able to do the job of passing appropriation bills. But we will pass a continuing resolution.  We did it very briefly when you decided it was time to do it. We did it very briefly the time before that when you decided to do it. This whole business of shutting down parks and anything else is political posturing. I called it terrorist tactics, as you may recall, previously. The fact of the matter is I rise in opposition to this legislation which would allow State employees to replace Federal employees during any future Government shutdowns.  While I hope the Republican leadership will not force us into another shutdown, I ask that they stop pretending that shutdowns affect only those programs you do not like. If we like them, well, we ought to fund them. If we do not like them, clearly the State officials in Arizona were concerned about the impact of the closure of the Grand Canyon. I think all of us would agree with that.  On a lesser scale, officials in my own State were concerned about the impact of closure of Green Belt National Park, Catoctin Mountain Park, Fort McHenry and the Smithsonian, which had an obvious impact on tourism in the Maryland suburbs. The Speaker and the leadership would like the American people to think that these national assets can keep going even while they close down the Government, the parts they do not like.  Last week in the Subcommittee on Civil Service, Social Security Commissioner Chater was questioned about why she did not retain more employees to keep critical services moving ahead. My Republican friends must learn you cannot have it both ways. You cannot deliberately shut down the Government and then use backdoor methods to keep open agencies in operation that happen to be especially popular.  In addition to raising a number of serious legal and management questions, this legislation is yet another attack on Federal workers. While many of our parks rely on volunteer help, it is outrageous to suggest that State workers with many other duties to fulfill can instantly qualify to manage our parks and national wildlife refuges.  The Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in my district is renowned for its work with endangered species. I do not believe any volunteer, frankly, without training could come in and operate it. If the leadership is serious about keeping our parks open, if the leadership is serious about keeping our parks open, they ought to do what they should have done by October 1, pass the appropriation bills that the President can accept. If the Republicans are serious about keeping Social Security functioning, they ought to pass a Labor-Health appropriations measure that the President can sign.  Today is December 12 and the leadership has not even brought a bill to the floor in the Senate on this issue. Some 50,000 employees, they are not national parks, but they are people who need programs to make sure that they have housing, make sure that they can eat, make sure their kids can get Head Start programs and other things that may not be as important as seeing the 7th Wonder of the World, but they are important to some.                              {time}  1645  I urge the House to reject this measure and keep the pressure on the Republican leadership to take their responsibilities seriously. Do not shut down Government.  Bob Dole said we ought not to do it, and he is right. And it will take 5 seconds. A unanimous consent to do a continuing resolution to continue the in-existence continuing resolution offered by the Republican leadership just days ago and say that it will go until January 26 or 30. Five seconds and this problem would be eliminated.  Why does it exist? Political posturing.
