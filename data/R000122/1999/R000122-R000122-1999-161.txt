They are provisions that are at the heart of the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. I think it is time to move. It is time to move forward on a debate about this critical issue, an issue that affects every family in this country. It is an issue that is critical to their well-being. It is an issue, frankly, that they sent us here to work on, to debate and to vote on. Difficult votes they may be, but they sent us here to take these votes.  So I urge my colleagues to join together to begin the debate, to reach a conclusion, and to do something the American people want us to do--give them the opportunity to protect their health and the health of their families.  I yield the remainder of my time.
