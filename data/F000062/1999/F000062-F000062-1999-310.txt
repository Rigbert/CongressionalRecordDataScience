 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will plug a gaping loophole in our gun laws and protect us all from the deadly, tragic violence of assault weapons.  This bill is not about gun control. This bill is not about politics. And this bill is not about partisanship. But this bill is about stopping foreign manufacturers from skirting the laws that already apply to companies within our borders.
