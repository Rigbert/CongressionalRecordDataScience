Speaker, I rise today in support of the National 9/11 Memorial at the World Trade Center Act.  The events of September 11 continue to stir emotions for Americans when we think about that day's tragic losses, remarkable acts of bravery, and the stark reminders that life is precious and evil is real.  As a Nation, we have pledged to ``Never Forget'' what happened on September 11, and today, by passing this legislation, we can put our actions behind that sentiment.  2016 marks the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and the 15th anniversary of 9/11. Just as the USS Arizona provides a place for future generations to understand where--and more importantly how and why--we were attacked in 1941, the National September 11 Memorial gives Americans a place to understand the tragedy of that day and ongoing sacrifices of the United States Armed Forces. Indeed, December 7 and September 11 are now two dates that will live in infamy.                              {time}  1700  I thank my colleague, Tom MacArthur, for introducing this legislation, and I thank everyone from the National September 11th Memorial and Museum for all of their hard work.  I have been to the Memorial and have felt the incredibly emotional effect it has had on each visitor. Unfortunately, many of our enemies see this symbol of our Nation's strength and resolve as a target, and, as such, the Memorial requires a high level of security in order to keep its over 6 million annual visitors safe. This legislation ensures the Memorial will receive the support it needs to provide a safe experience for every visitor who passes through, whether he be His Holiness, Pope Francis, or whether he be the young schoolchild who was not yet been born on September 11, 2001.  I would like to take a moment to recognize a very special person, Rob O'Neill, a former member of SEAL Team 6, who is best known for his actions in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The 9/11 Memorial has a special place in his heart, and he has been a strong advocate for this bill. He has told me and others that the site is important to him and to his fellow special operators. It helps signify the cause for which they were fighting. In fact, the shirt he wore on the mission is on display at the museum, along with other artifacts from 9/11 and from the many years since, chronicling how Americans have pulled together to support each other, to secure our Nation, and to re-dedicate ourselves to liberty and justice. So I thank Mr. O'Neill for his service and for his sacrifice.  Once again, I convey my support for this bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to pass the 9/11 Memorial Act.  I thank Tricia Evans and Ian Foley, who are on my staff, for their hard work on this bill.
