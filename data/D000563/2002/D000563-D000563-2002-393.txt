 The month of March has been designated as National Women's History month to celebrate the remarkable accomplishments of women throughout history. My distinguished colleagues, Senator Barbara Mikulski and Senator Orrin Hatch, cosponsored legislation over 20 years ago declaring National Women's History Week. I salute my colleagues for their leadership in establishing this now month-long celebration of the many contributions made by women.  This year's national theme, ``Women Sustaining the American Spirit,'' could not be more appropriate. Our Nation prides itself on the accomplishments of women and their ability to fully participate in our society. I have the distinct privilege of working with 13 women Senators who are powerful examples of the progress that our Nation has made. This spirit of democracy was tested on September 11, when we were reminded that our ideals continue to threaten those who fear the inevitability of progress.  As a consequence of these events, Americans were exposed to the disturbing plight of women in other parts of the world. We learned that under the oppressive Taliban regime, women could not work outside the home and were denied basic rights such as access to education and health care. Not only were women precluded from contributing to society, but they were denied equal protection under the law.  The attacks faced by our country were aimed at undermining the great strides we have made in our history. Yet the rest of the world watched as our Nation united and demonstrated that even a devastating attack could not crush our spirit--an American spirit that has been molded by the accomplishments of women throughout our history, including the legacy left by a well-known Illinois woman.  Jane Addams of Chicago, IL, was a socially conscious community leader who worked tirelessly to sustain the American spirit. Addams founded the famous Hull House settlement in Chicago in 1889, where she and other residents provided services for the surrounding neighborhood. These vital services included kindergarten and daycare facilities for children of working mothers, an employment bureau, medical care, legal aid, and vocational skills. After a few short years, the settlement was serving over 2,000 people a week.  Despite the enormous success of her charitable efforts, Addams realized that real gains could not be achieved without working to change laws for the better. To achieve this goal, Addams lobbied the State of Illinois to examine laws governing child labor, the factory inspection system, and the juvenile justice system.  As we celebrate the contributions that women have made, the legacy of Jane Addams reminds us of the continuing need for improvement in the areas of social reform that she worked so tirelessly on several years ago. Today, parents rely on childcare arrangements more than ever. The Children's Defense Fund reports that an estimated 13 million children under the age of 6 spend part of their day in the care of someone other than their parents. In Illinois, 61 percent of all children under the age of 6 have working parents. Yet working families at all income levels still struggle to find the high-quality care their children need at a cost that is affordable. Full day care can cost between $4,000 and $10,000 per year, frequently surpassing average tuition costs for public universities. At the same time, the Children's Defense Fund reports that more than one out of four families with young children earns less than $25,000 per year.  Today, parents also encounter a childcare system that is an uneven and inadequate patchwork of services. States and cities vary widely in the areas of provider education and training requirements, availability, and quality of programs. The gap between what we know is so important for children and what we put into practice is too large. As a nation, we have an interest in healthy, successful children who have the tools they need to learn in the classroom. We have an interest in improving child care so that morefamilies can move off welfare into a steady career. We have an interest in educating and training women so that they can get jobs with decent pay to support their families. As a nation, we should embrace the legacy that Jane Addams has left behind by working on these issues which are in desperate need of reform.  In this month of March, let us not only celebrate the accomplishments of the women who have shaped our Nation's rich history, but let us work to keep their vision alive by continuing to sustain the American spirit that these women helped define.                          ____________________
