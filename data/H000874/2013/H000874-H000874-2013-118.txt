 Madam Speaker, I was not going to speak. I was constrained to speak, to come to the floor, when we had this chart about 2 million employees.  But only adversely affecting just a small sliver. The premise seems to be you can undermine--as long as they're a small minority--the rights of people.  And those Capitol policemen of which the gentleman spoke, and the people at the desk of whom the gentleman spoke, people who serve in our committees of whom the gentleman spoke, people who serve as nurses--not necessarily in VA hospitals because they're exempt--zero COLA 4 years in a row. All 2 million have been affected.                              {time}  1700  Every new employee has been affected--everyone--not just that small, little sliver that apparently the SES is. They don't get rights. If it were 1.98 million, well, then, that's a different story, but as long as it's only a small sliver, undermine their rights.  I came to the floor to say that, if we undermine the rights of one, frankly, the rights of all are soon at risk. We have learned that throughout history. So I would hope that we would reject this bill, which was seven or eight bills to start out with, which were put up here in a way that you could not amend them--suspension--in this transparent, open, ``let the House work its will'' process, and we now come back with a closed rule, putting all the bills in one--a rule covering all seven bills--and the chairman shakes his head and shows pictures and believes those are facts.  My friends, we ought to reject these bills because they are about all employees. They may affect only a small few at this juncture, but they are about all employees; and it's about undermining their rights and the respect we ought to accord to them for the service they give to the people of the United States of America.
