President, let me correct my colleague from the State of Pennsylvania who has misstated a fact which I am sure has escaped his attention; that is, on February 2, this year,there was, in fact, a vote on this Medicare prescription Part D. The vote was propounded by the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson. It was under the debate on the budget and needed 60 votes, but 52 Senators voted in favor, including, obviously, Republican Senators. So his statement earlier that it has never passed in the Senate is not correct.  It is correct that he voted against giving relief to seniors who failed to sign up in time on May 15. That is reflected in the Record. I want to make sure that is clear for the record.  I also say when it comes to this issue, we have been told repeatedly regarding this wonderful program that the seniors would figure it out and all sign up. It turns out half of them have not. It is too complicated. It is too difficult. We have been trying to give the seniors some relief from the possible penalty they will face. I don't know whether it is because of the embarrassment that the program is so complicated, but for whatever reason the Republican majority has not allowed this.
