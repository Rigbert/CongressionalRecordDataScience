Speaker, I rise to press my argument that as the new round of WTO negotiations begin in Seattle later this month, we should support the administration's position not to negotiate away the antidumping and antisubsidy provisions of our trade laws.  I would also ask that this House vote to support this position by supporting H. Res. 298.  Seattle is the follow-on to the Uruguay Round which was completed on April 15, 1994, and signed by ministers from over 125 countries. Part of this agreement included changes to the antidumping laws which had been included in GATT since its original inception in 1947. In fact, article 6 of the 1947 GATT states very clearly that the contracting parties recognize that dumping is to be condemned.  The scope of negotiations at the Seattle round discussions of the World Trade Organization were specified during the Uruguay Round. However, some countries now are seeking to circumvent the agreed list of negotiating topics and reopen the debate over the WTO's antidumping and antisubsidy rules.  Antidumping duties are assessed on imported merchandise that is sold at less than fair market value. Countervailing duties are assessed to reverse the effects of foreign government subsidies to manufacturers. Today, over 290 products from 59 countries have been found to have been traded in violation of these international standards.  The ability to impose binding tariffs and apply them equitably to all trading partners is the key to a smooth and liberal flow of trade. Many of my colleagues think that this is a steel issue. That could not be further from the truth. The experience of the U.S. cement industry indicates that the antidumping law can be an effective remedy for unfairly priced imports.  U.S. consumption of cement increased substantially during the 1983 to 1989 economic expansion as construction boomed. U.S. cement producers, however, were prevented from benefiting in this growing demand by a surge of low-priced imports in that 6-year period of time.  U.S. production capacity declined by 10 percent and the number of U.S. plants decreased from 142 to only 109.  Beginning in 1989, southern cement producers successfully prosecuted antidumping petitions against imports from several countries. The Commerce Department found dumping margins for imports from 58 to 64 percent. As a result of these measures, cement producers began their recovery process in our country.  Another example often cited is that of the U.S. semiconductor industry in 1986. After foreign dynamic random-access memory chips, DRAMs, were dumped in the United States for 2 years, 7 out of 9 U.S. companies ceased making these chips.  After those foreign firms dominated the world market, they raised the price of DRAMs. The subsequent use of U.S. antidumping laws contributed finally to the revival of the U.S. semiconductor industry, which in 1993 again held the number one position in the world.  Given the fact again that there are 230 cosponsors of House Resolution 298, I would renew my request to the House leaders that this measure be brought to the floor for a vote.                          ____________________
