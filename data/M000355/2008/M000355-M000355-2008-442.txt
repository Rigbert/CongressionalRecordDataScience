 The leadership of these companies has indeed a Hobson's choice, two bad alternatives. They either continue to respond to the request of the American Government to protect the homeland and then run the risk of squandering all the assets of their companies and, thereby, generating a lot of shareholder lawsuits against the directors for violating their fiduciary responsibility. It is a terrible position to be put in. They are entitled to be able to cooperate with the request of our Government and not squander all the assets of their companies.
