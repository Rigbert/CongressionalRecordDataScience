Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  It is an appropriate and, at the same time, regrettable fact that I rise today in support of this resolution. It is appropriate because I am proud to join my colleagues in an attempt to recognize a terrible wrong, to shed light on a dark chapter in our Nation's history. Sad, because it is a shame that this resolution is even necessary. However, it is necessary; and I commend the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis) and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts), my colleagues, for their hard work in bringing this resolution to the floor.  This resolution, as the chairman has pointed out, will establish a task force to recommend an appropriate recognition of the slave laborers who built the United States Capitol. Not all of the workers were slaves. There were free men that worked by their side; but there were slaves who, as the chairman has pointed out, were not paid for their work; their owners were paid for their work. And their work helped build this Capitol.  That sentence should shock all of our sensibilities. Yes, this temple of liberty was built, in part, on the backs of slave laborers.                              {time}  1930  That is a tragedy, and was a denial of the statement we made to all the world that we believed that all men were created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights.  Notwithstanding the fact that we published that to the world, we continued slavery in America. Yes, we used slaves in part to build this Capitol. Those workers toiled in the hot D.C. summers to build this monument to freedom, the people's House, the freedom they did not have. Yet, they did not share in the promise of America. There was compensation, as has been pointed out: $5 a month to the owners.  This tragic piece of our Nation's history needs to be explored and exposed.We often forget the proud history of slaves in the United States. The government denied them their freedom, but nobody could take away their dignity. They fought bravely in the Revolutionary War to secure our Nation's freedom, yet they were not free. After that noble effort, they worked to build a tribute to this Nation's ideals, this Capitol building, but they were denied the very freedom it symbolized.  As a recent article in the Washington Post explains, little is known about the slaves. We know that for a time Phillip Reid, the only slave that we know the last name of, served as superintendent of the project, but the other slaves are known only by first names jotted in dusty ledgers.  I hope this task force is able to uncover more details about these men who did backbreaking work for a nation that denied them their fundamental rights. We need to know more about George, Thomas, Harry, and Jerry, and all the others who built this temple to democracy and freedom. Without knowing more about their history, Mr. Speaker, our collective history, our Nation's history, will be forever incomplete.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
