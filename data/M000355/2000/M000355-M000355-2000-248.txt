 I am sure some of the things I will say will be repetitious because he was right on the mark in his observations about the Hollings amendment.  It is important to note at the beginning of the debate, the last time we had a vote on the Hollings amendment was March 18, 1997. Only 38 Senators voted for the Hollings amendment, an effort to amend the first amendment for the first time in the 200-year history of our country, restricting avenues of political speech. Only 38 of the 100 Senators believe it necessary, no matter what our views on the various campaign finance proposals before the Senate, to carve a chunk out of the first amendment to give the Government this kind of truly draconian power to control everybody's speech.  I know Senator Feingold of McCain-Feingold fame is also going to oppose this amendment. I note that the Washington Post, with which I have essentially never been aligned with on a campaign finance issue, also opposes this amendment.  With due respect to the Senator from South Carolina, he has framed the issue correctly by pointing out that in order to do what many of the so-called reformers have tried to do, you do need to amend the first amendment. Of course, that is a terrible idea, I respectfully suggest.  The campaign finance debate is all about constitutional freedom. Soft money, hard money, issue advocacy, express advocacy, PACs, independent expenditures, bundling, and the other terms of art in the campaign finance debate are euphemisms for freedoms of speech and association protections under the first amendment to our Constitution, freedoms belonging to citizens groups, candidates, and parties. It is no more complicated than that.  The measure before the Senate, the Hollings constitutional amendment to empower the Federal and 50 State governments to restrict all contributions and expenditures ``by, in support of, or in opposition to Federal and State candidates,'' illustrates this simple fact beautifully and succinctly. The Hollings amendment is a blunt instrument. Where a statutory approach such as a Shays-Meehan or McCain-Feingold and their ilk slices and dices at this freedom--a cut here, an evisceration there--the Hollings amendment reaches out and rips the heart right out of the first amendment.  Before this week is out, we could be on our way to getting rid of the first amendment protection for everyone except pornographers. But I rather enjoy this debate. No pretense, no artifice, no question about it: If you believe that the Government, Federal and State, ought to have the unchecked power to restrict all contributions and spending ``by, in support of, or in opposition to Federal and State candidates,'' then, by all means, vote for the Hollings amendment. If you believe that the U.S. Supreme Court should be taken out of the campaign finance equation, then the Hollings constitutional amendment is for you.  If the Hollings amendment had been in place 25 years ago, there would have been no Buckley decision; Congress would have gotten its way. Independent expenditures would be capped at $1,000. Any issue advocacy that the FEC deemed capable of influencing elections would be capped at $1,000. Everyone would be under mandatory spending limits. There would be no taxpayer funding. It would not be necessary because spending limits would not have to be voluntary.  That is why the American Civil Liberties Union counsel, Joel Gora, who was part of the legal team in the Buckley case, has called the Hollings constitutional amendment a ``recipe for repression.''  The media, news and entertainment industries, ought to take note. There is no exemption for them in the Hollings constitutional amendment, no media loophole. Under the Hollings constitutional amendment, the Federal and State governments could regulate, restrict, even prohibit the media's own issue advocacy, independent expenditures, and contributions just as long as the restrictions were deemed reasonable.  What we have traditionally done in order to assert what the Congress might consider reasonable is look to the American people and their views. Let's look at their views with regard to the press.  Eighty percent of Americans want newspapers' political coverage regulated. You cannot do that under the first amendment; you could under the Hollings amendment.  Eighty-six percent want mandatory equal coverage of candidates by newspapers. You cannot do that under the first amendment; you could do it under the Hollings amendment.  Eighty percent want newspapers required to give equal space to candidates against whom they editorialize. You can't do that under the first amendment; you could under the Hollings amendment.  Seventy percent believe reporters' personal biases affect campaign and issue coverage.  They are right about that. Sixty-eight percent believe newspaper editorials are more important than a $10,000 contribution.  Sixty-one percent believe that a newspaper-preferred candidate trumps the better-funded candidate.  Forty-two percent of Americans believe editorial boards ought to be forced to have an equal number of Republicans and Democrats.  Finally, 45 percent of Americans think newspapers should be required to give candidates free ad space.  I mention this survey to make the point that if Congress is going to have the power to regulate all of this speech, presumably, it will refer to the opinions of the American people in trying to make these regulatory decisions, and all of those items I mentioned could be fair game in determining what is reasonable to be spent ``by and on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate.''  Again, I commend the Senator from South Carolina for offering this amendment insofar as he lays on the table just what the stakes are in the campaign finance debate. To do what the reformers say they want to do, limit ``special interest influence,'' requires limiting the U.S. Constitution which gives special interests--all Americans--the freedom to speak, the freedom to associate, and the freedom to petition the Government for redress of grievances. That is called lobbying.  We have to gut the first amendment and throw on the trash heap that freedom which the U.S. Supreme Court said six decades ago is the ``matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly every other form of freedom.''  Some would call that horror reform. A few dozen Senators may even vote for it. As I said, last time 38 voted for it. We can all agree to disagree on campaign finance. We can even agree to disagree on what is reform. But surely we can also agree that this business of amending the Constitution whenever the Supreme Court hands down a result we do not like is wrong and is dangerous. We trivialize that sacred document which so embodies the spirit of America, which guarantees the success of America, and we treat it as if it were a rough draft. To be seriously contemplating chopping off a huge chunk of the Bill of Rights must seem incomprehensible to the casual viewer of this discussion.  This debate, like the debate over Shays-Meehan and McCain-Feingold, is not only about politicians' first amendment freedoms. The ``in support of or in opposition to'' components of the Hollings constitutional amendment refer to the freedom of everyone else in America--private citizens and groups and, yes, as I pointed out, even the media, the entire universe of political speech.  What makes the Hollings amendment on many orders of magnitude so much more egregious than the statutory proposals is that the Supreme Court cannot intervene and save America from whatever folly we would engage in on the floor in defining what ``reasonable'' is.  As I said, I recoil in horror from the substance of the Hollings amendment while I embrace the clarity of the choice it presents us. It exposes the fallacy of McCain-Feingold and other such speech suppression schemes. If one believes that McCain-Feingold is constitutional, as its advocates claim it is, then we do not need the Hollings constitutional amendment. If my colleagues vote for the Hollings constitutional amendment, then they have affirmed what so many of us inside and outside the Senate have been saying: That to do what McCain-Feingold proponents want to do--restrict spending by, in support of, and in opposition to candidates--then we need to get rid of the first amendment. That is what the Hollings constitutional amendment does: No more first amendment protection of political speech for anyone, politician or not.  Fifteen years ago, when I first took the oath of this office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic, I had no idea how much time and energy I would expend doing just that--defending the Constitution, not from foreign enemies, mind you, but from the Congress itself. I certainly could not have imagined that the Senate would spend so much time seriously discussing whether we should wipe out core political freedoms. We need to stop this, and I am confident and hopeful that the Hollings amendment will be defeated overwhelmingly tomorrow, as it has been defeated overwhelmingly in the past.  I will mention a couple of recent letters in relation to this amendment. One is from Roger Pilon at the Cato Institute who says in pertinent part:       . . . I am heartened to learn that those who want to      ``reform'' our campaign finance law are admitting that a      constitutional amendment is necessary. But that very      admission speaks volumes about the present      unconstitutionality of most of the proposals now in the air.      It is not for nothing that the Founders of this nation      provided explicitly for unrestrained freedom of political      expression and association--which includes, the Court has      said, the right to make political contributions and      expenditures. They realized that governments and government      officials tend to serve their own interests, for which the      natural antidote is unfettered political opposition--in      speech and in the electoral process.       In the name of countering that tendency this amendment      would restrict its antidote. It is a ruse--an unvarnished,      transparent effort to restrict our political freedom and, by      implication, the further freedoms that freedom ensures. That      it is dressed in the gossamer clothing of ``reform'' only      compounds the evil--even as it exposes its true character.  I also have a letter from the ACLU, dated March 24, 2000, indicating its opposition to the Hollings constitutional amendment. In pertinent part, the ACLU says the constitutional amendment:       . . . would also give Congress and every state legislature      the power, heretofore denied by the first amendment, to      regulate the most protected function of the press--     editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and      magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable      operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of      editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered      editorial, as well as op-ed articles or commentary printed at      the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in      support of or in opposition to particular political      candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would      authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the      expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly      reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a      society that cherishes the free press.       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment,      what rational basis would it use to distinguish between      certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be      justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run      unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it      unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited      number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why      would it be permissible for a major weekly news magazine to      run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate,      but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to      raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the      same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that      is published by an advocacy group different from a daily      newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of candidates for      federal office? Should one type of media outlet be given      broader free expression privileges than the other? Should      national media outlets have to abide by fifty different state      and local standards for expenditures? These are questions      that Congress has not adequately addressed or answered.  All of which would be before the Congress if the Hollings amendment were to become law.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Cato Institute, the ACLU, and an editorial from the Washington Post, also opposing the Hollings amendment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Cato Institute,                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman McConnell: Your office has invited my brief      thoughts on S.J. RES. 6, offered by Senator Hollings for      himself and Senators Specter, McCain, and Bryan, which      proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United      States that would grant power to the Congress and the States      ``to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions      that may be accepted by, and the amount of expenditures that      may be made by, in support of, or in opposition to, a      candidate for nomination for election to, or for election      to,'' any federal, state, or local office.       It is my understanding that on Monday next, Senator      Hollings is planning to offer this resolution as an amendment      to the flag-burning amendment now before the Senate. For my      thoughts on the proposed flag-burning amendment, please see      the testimony I have given on the issue, as posted at the web      site of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the op-ed I      wrote for the Washington Post, copies of which are attached.       Regarding the proposed campaign finance amendment, I am      heartened to learn that those who want to ``reform'' our      campaign finance law are admitting that a constitutional      amendment is necessary. But that very admission speaks      volumes about the present unconstitutionality of most of the      proposal now in the air. It is not for nothing that the      Founders of this nation provided explicitly for unrestrained      freedom of political expression and association--which      includes, the Court has said, the right to make political      contributions and expenditures. They realized that      governments and government officials tend to serve their own      interests, for which the natural antidote is unfettered      political opposition--in speech and in the electoral process.       In the name of countering that tendency this amendment      would restrict its antidote. It is a ruse--an unvarnished,      transparent effort to restrict our political freedom and, by      implication, the further freedoms that freedom ensures. That      it is dressed in the gossamer clothing of ``reform'' only      compounds the evil--even as it exposes its true character. If      the true aim of this amendment is incumbency protection, then      let those who propose it come clean. Otherwise, they must be      challenged to show why the experience of previous ``reforms''      will not be repeated in this case too. Given the evidence,      that will not be an enviable task.       Fortunately, candor is still possible in this nation. This      is an occasion for it. I urge you to resist this amendment      with the focus that candor commands.           Yours truly,                                                      Roger Pilon,     Vice President for Legal Affairs.                                  ____                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                   Washington National Office,                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.       Dear Senator: The American Civil Liberties Union strongly      opposes S.J. Res. 6, the proposed constitutional amendment      that permits Congress and the states to enact laws regulating      federal campaign expenditures and contributions.       Whatever one's position may be on campaign finance reform      and how best to achieve it, a constitutional amendment of the      kind here proposed is not the solution. Amending the First      Amendment for the first time in our history in the way that      S.J. Res. 6 proposes would challenge all pre-existing First      Amendment jurisprudence and would give to Congress and the      states unprecedented, sweeping and undefined authority to      restrict speech protected by the First Amendment since 1791.       Because it is vague and over-broad, S.J. Res. 6 would give      Congress a virtual ``blank check'' to enact any legislation      that may abridge a vast array of free speech and free      association rights that we now enjoy. In addition, this      measure should be opposed because it provides no guarantee      that Congress or the states will have the political will,      after the amendment's adoption, to enact legislation that      will correct the problems in our current electoral system.      This amendment misleads the American people because it tells      them that only if they sacrifice their First Amendment      rights, will Congress correct the problems in our system. Not      only is this too high a price to demand in the name of      reform, it is unwise to promise the American people such an      unlikely outcome.       Rather than assuring that the electoral process will be      improved, a constitutional     amendment merely places new state and federal campaign      finance law beyond the reach of First Amendment      jurisprudence. All Congress and the states would have to      demonstrate is that its laws were ``reasonable.''      ``Reasonable'' laws do not necessarily solve the problems of      those who are harmed by or locked out of the electoral      process on the basis of their third party status, lack of      wealth or non-incumbency. The First Amendment properly      prevents the government from being arbitrary when making      these distinctions, but S.J. Res. 6 would enable the Congress      to set limitations on expenditures and contributions      notwithstanding current constitutional understandings.       Once S.J. Res. 6 is adopted, Congress and local governments      could easily further distort the political process in      numerous ways. Congress and state governments could pass new      laws that operate to the detriment of dark horse and third      party candidates. For example, with the intention of creating      a ``level playing field'' Congress could establish equal      contributions and expenditure limits that would ultimately      operate to the benefit of incumbents who generally have      higher name recognition, greater access to their party      apparatus and more funds than their opponents. Thus,      rather than assure fair and free elections, the proposal      would enable those in power to perpetuate their own power      and incumbency advantage to the disadvantage of those who      would challenge the status quo.       S.J. Res. 6 would also give Congress and every state      legislature the power, heretofore denied by the First      Amendment, to regulate the most protected function of the      press--editorializing. Print outlets such as newspapers and      magazines, broadcasters, Internet publishers and cable      operators would be vulnerable to severe regulation of      editorial content by the government. A candidate-centered      editorial, as well as op-ed article or commentary printed at      the publisher's expense are most certainly expenditures in      support of or in opposition to particular political      candidates. The amendment, as its words make apparent, would      authorize Congress to set reasonable limits on the      expenditures by the media during campaigns, when not strictly      reporting the news. Such a result would be intolerable in a      society that cherishes the free press.       Even if Congress exempted the press from the amendment,      what rational basis would it use to distinguish between      certain kinds of speech? For example, why would it be      justified for Congress to allow a newspaper publisher to run      unlimited editorials on behalf of a candidate, but to make it      unlawful for a wealthy individual to purchase an unlimited      number of billboards for the same candidate? Likewise, why      would it be permissible for a major weekly newsmagazine to      run an unlimited number of editorials opposing a candidate,      but impermissible for the candidate or his supporters to      raise or spend enough money to purchase advertisements in the      same publication? At what point is a journal or magazine that      is published by an advocacy group different from a major      daily newspaper, when it comes to the endorsement of      candidates for federal office? Should one type of media      outlet be given broader free expression privileges than the      other? Should national media outlets have to abide by fifty      different state and local standards for expenditures? These      are questions that Congress has not adequately addressed or      answered.       Moreover, the proposed amendment appears to reach not only      expenditures by candidates or their agents but also the truly      independent expenditures by individual citizens and groups--     the very kind of speech that the First Amendment was designed      to protect.       If Congress or the states want to change or campaign      finance system, then it need not throw out the First      Amendment in order to do so. Congress can adopt meaningful      federal campaign finance reform measures without abrogating      the First Amendment and without contravening the Supreme      Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. Some of these reform      measures include:       Public financing for all legally qualified candidates--     financing that serves as a floor, not a ceiling for campaign      expenditures,       Extending the franking privilege to all legally qualified      candidates,       Providing assistance to candidates for broadcast      advertising,       Improving the resources for the FEC so that it can provide      timely disclosure of contributions and expenditures,       Providing resources for candidate travel.       Rather than argue for these proposals, many members of      Congress continue to propose unconstitutional measures, such      as the McCain/Feingold bill that are limit-driven methods of      campaign finance reform that place campaign regulation on a      collision course with the First Amendment. Before Senators      vote to eliminate certain First Amendment rights, the ACLU      urges the Congress to consider other legislative options, and      to give these alternatives its considered review through the      hearing and mark-up processes.       The ACLU urges Senators to oppose S.J. Res. 6. As Joel      Gora, Professor of Law of the Brooklyn Law School recently      stated, ``This constitutional amendment is a recipe for      repression.''           Sincerely,                                                  Laura W. Murphy,     Director.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 2, 1996]                     Wrong Way on Campaign Finance       Campaign finance reform is hard in part because it so      quickly bumps up against the First Amendment. To keep offices      and officeholders from being bought, proponents seek to limit      what candidates for office can raise and spend. That's      reasonable enough, except that the Supreme Court has ruled--     we think correctly--that the giving and spending of campaign      funds is a form of political speech, and the Constitution is      pretty explicit about that sort of thing. ``Congress shall      make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech'' is the      majestic sentence. So however laudable the goal, you end up      having to regulate lightly and indirectly in this area, which      means you are almost bound to achieve an imperfect result.       As a way out of this dilemma, Senate Minority Leader Tom      Daschle added his name the other day to the list of those who      say the Constitution should be amended to permit the      regulation of campaign spending. He wasn't just trying to      duck the issue by raising it to a higher level as some would-     be amenders have in the past. Rather, his argument is that      you can't win the war without the weapons, which in the case      of campaign finance means the power not just to create      incentives to limit spending but to impose spending limits      directly.       But that's what everyone who wants to put an asterisk after      the First Amendment says: We have a war to fight that we can      win only if given the power to suppress. It's a terrible      precedent even if in a virtuous cause, and of course, it is      always in a virtuous cause. The people who want a flag-     burning amendment think of themselves as defenders of civic      virtue too. These amendments are always for the one cause      only. Just this once, the supporters say. But have punched      the one hole, you make it impossible to argue on principle      against punching the next. The question becomes not whether      you have exceptions to the free speech clause, but which      ones?       Nor is it clear that an amendment would solve the problem.      It would offer a means but not the will. The system we have      is a system that benefits incumbents. That's one of the      reasons we continue to have it, and future incumbents are no      more likely to want to junk it than is the current crop.       The campaign finance issued tends to wax and wane,      depending on how obscene the fund-raising was, or seemed, in      the last election. The last election being what it was,      Congress is under a fair amount of pressure to toughen the      law. The Democrats doubtless feel it most, thanks to the      revelations of suspect fund-raising on the part of the      president's campaign, though the Republicans have their own      sins to answer for--not least their long record of resistance      to reform. With all respect to Mr. Daschle, a constitutional      amendment will solve none of this.       The American political system is never going to be      sanitized, nor, given the civic cost of the regulations that      would be required (even assuming that a definition of the      sanitary state could be agreed upon), should that be anyone's      goal. Rather, the goal should be simply to moderate the role      of money in determining elections and of course the policies      to which the elections lead. The right approach remains the      same: Give candidates some of the money they need to run, but      exact in return a promise to limit their spending. And then      enforce the promise. Private money would still be spent, but      at a genuine and greater distance from the candidates      themselves. It wouldn't be a perfect world, and that would be      its virtue as well as a flaw.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?
