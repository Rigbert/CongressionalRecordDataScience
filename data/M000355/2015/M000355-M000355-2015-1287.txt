 President, I would say to my colleagues that it is clear there aren't 60 votes in the Senate for the House-passed bill, and there aren't 60 votes for a 60-day extension.  So I am going to propound a series of unanimous consent requests to see if we can avoid having the program expire roughly 1 week from now.                          ____________________
