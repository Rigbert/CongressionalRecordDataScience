Chairman, further on the point of order, Mr. Chairman, let me first of all say I believe the gentleman from Arizona is one of the Members of this body who has high integrity and good faith, and I understand that he offers this in good faith. However, the amendment that he originally offered on which the unanimous consent was given is subject to a point of order. He has attempted to correct that understandably by his amendment that he has now offered.  The problem, Mr. Chairman, in answer to the question, did it deal specifically, the gentleman said, honestly, as I would have expected him to answer, no, it does not; and in fact it does not. In fact he offered it, however, to deal with the White House and the Office of Administration. It does not in fact, I tell the gentleman, deal with the Office of Administration. It deals with the White House budget per se in the section that he affects in terms of the line that he affects. As a result, Mr. Chairman, I think it is clearly inconsistent with the unanimous-consent request and therefore is not in order under that consent agreement.
