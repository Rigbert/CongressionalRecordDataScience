 President, I thank my friend and colleague for her comments. I very much appreciate her solidarity and unity on this subject. It is extraordinarily important.  I also want to say there is a statement from the administration in support of this appropriation. We have the support of the Secretary of the Interior, as well as the administration, that this appropriation move forward. I am very hopeful that we will have unanimous support from our side of the aisle as well as support from the Republican side.  As my colleague has well stated, we are fighting for every dollar. The energy subcommittee listened. I think it is a fact that the money in this appropriations bill is extraordinarily important. I believe that unless we can move aggressively to build an environmentally sensitive water infrastructure in our State, there is no way we are going to be able to meet the challenges of the future.  This is a beginning.  I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman and my colleague.  I yield the floor.
