President, today I want to recognize and honor Postmaster Shauna D. Andrews, of Hereford, OR, for her exceptional service to her customers and dedication to her neighbors.  Located in eastern Oregon, Hereford is a highly rural, unincorporated community in Baker County. Although Hereford is unincorporated it has a post office that serves approximately 100 postal patrons. Like many rural postmasters, Shauna knows her customers well and connects with them on a regular basis; especially older folks who don't have access to the Internet, cell phones, and other conveniences that are driving down the traditional use of post offices. In Hereford, the post office is a place where people send and receive packages, including mail order prescriptions and vote by mail.  Over the years, Shauna, who is also a first responder, has demonstrated a strong commitment to the folks she considers customers and neighbors. During the week of September 19, 2011, she became concerned when an 85-year-old patron who lives alone on a rural route failed to collect her mail. After 2 days, she grew worried and decided to go to the patron's home. When Shauna and her 19-year-old son arrived at the patron's house, they discovered the woman lying incapacitated on the floor. Shauna immediately called Baker City for transport to the nearest hospital, located 38 miles from Hereford. As of last week, the patron remained in the hospital in Baker City. It is more than a possibility that by taking the time to check on her postal patron, Shauna saved this woman's life.  Shauna has displayed exceptional service and dedication to her customers and neighbors. The Hereford Post Office is on the national closure study list and as we address the future of the Postal Service, it is absolutely imperative that we examine the function of post offices in rural communities. As Shauna has demonstrated, many rural postmasters know their customers well and having a post office is central to a town's identity and vitality.  I recognize Shauna Andrews for her exceptional service to the community of Hereford. Her example is one from which we can all learn.                          ____________________
