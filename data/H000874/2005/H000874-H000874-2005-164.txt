 In light of the fact that the Speaker is arranging for the aircraft to get Members there, I presume that they will schedule votes consistent with the leaving and the returning of Members from the funeral. That is my presumption. I understand that is a little bit up in the air, but we certainly hope that can be done. As the gentleman observes, Members on both sides of the aisle I am sure will be attending. I yield to my friend.
