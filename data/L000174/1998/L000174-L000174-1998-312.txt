President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. Senator Domenici, I would like to thank you and Senator Reid for your willingness to boost funding for the Department of Energy's important solar and renewable programs. I am especially pleased to see an increase in funding for the biomass energy systems account. In Vermont, work is continuing at the McNeil Generation Plant in Burlington to demonstrate the effectiveness of biomass gasification. This is an important renewable technology which will help our country reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Earlier this year the Department of Energy agreed to a modification of the contract for the McNeil project which resulted in a $6 million increase in the Department's contribution to the South Burlington facility. These funds will be matched dollar for dollar by the partners who are participating with DoE in this important renewable program. Because the contract modification was not reached until after the President had submitted his Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposal, that increase was not reflected in the funding request for the biomass energy systems account. It is my understanding that the increase in funding for biomass energy systems includes the $6 million needed for the Department to meet its obligations under the contract for the McNeil facility.
