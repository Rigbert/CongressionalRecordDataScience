I think perhaps we may not need to have a vote on this, I would agree, but there are some number of speakers on our side who would like to speak. I don't know whether we will have 10, maybe 15 speakers cumulatively. If the gentleman might prevail on his side, maybe we wouldn't ask people to come back for a vote, but we do have Members on our side who want to speak.  Madam Speaker, I object.
