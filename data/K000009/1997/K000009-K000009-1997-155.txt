Speaker, I am pleased to be the first speaker this evening in a special order devoted to the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA. Tonight we are going to talk about, since the agreement was signed and passed over the objections of many, many of us here in the House, passed in January 1994, what have been the repercussions in our country and what have been the repercussions in the other two nations on the continent, Canada and Mexico, that are participating in this agreement with us?  This past week we saw our President travel to Mexico and to other nations of Latin America to promote additional nations being added to the NAFTA accord. And the question many of us have in the Congress today is, based on the results of the existing NAFTA, the flaws inherent in that agreement, why would anyone want toexpand NAFTA rather than fixing the agreement we have now?  Since NAFTA's passage, the United States has not exported more than it has imported from either Mexico or Canada. In fact, we have now racked up trade deficits annually with Mexico totaling $16 to $18 billion a year, and with Canada $20 billion a year. If each billion dollars translates into lost jobs in this country and we have racked up on average $40 billion in trade deficit every year since NAFTA's passage, how can the overall agreement be working to the advantage of our Nation and its workers?                              {time}  1945  If we think about it, with our economy on the rebound and holding its own, without NAFTA we would be growing even faster. Because, in fact, NAFTA acts not as a net positive but as a net negative in terms of job creation and wealth creation in the United States of America.  Tonight we want to talk a little bit about what is happening inside this agreement and the people across our country who are literally the casualties of NAFTA that are never talked about in the press, that are not heard from, but they number in the thousands in our country, and in Mexico they number in the millions.  But if we look at who the President talked to last week in Mexico, the audiences were self-selected. He was cordoned off. People were bussed into events. They were told when to cheer, even told when to wave flags.  But the real people of Mexico, the peasants who have been uprooted from their subsistence farms, the 28,000 businesses in that country that have gone belly up, the people whose wages have been cut by 70 percent, the President really did not hold state level meetings with them. Yet they live on this continent, too. And it is really tragic.  But in a way I am beginning to see a pattern here, because the President and the supporters of NAFTA will not meet with the casualties in our country either. And tonight I want to tell my friends about one casualty, but there are thousands. In fact, the Federal Government's Trade Adjustment Assistance Program for dislocated workers has already certified over 125,000 Americans who have managed to even find that this program exists. There are thousands and thousands more across our country who do not even know if they lose their job because the production has moved to Mexico or Canada, we will try to help them.  But I want to tell my colleagues about one of their stories, because it is very troubling to me that American citizens who have been hard-working, who have paid their taxes and then get hurt because of an action of their government, become nonentities. They become faceless people.  They remind me of the Vietnam war, when people were being killed in the countryside and the body bags came home and they tried to hide them in the hangars at the various bases around our Nation until it began to be reported on the evening news. Well, my friends there are NAFTA casualties and nobody wants to talk about it. But we are going to talk about it tonight.  One of the casualties is a woman that I have had the pleasure of only talking with on the telephone and corresponding with in the mail, and I want to use her as my example and I want to tell my colleagues her story because it is repeated from coast to coast. Her name is Wanda Napier. She is a resident of the State of Missouri. She lives in Marshfield, and I want to read into the Record a letter that she recently wrote me.  She wrote me after she became frustrated, and I will read those letters tonight, too, in writing to the President of our country, to her Senators, to her representatives at the State level in Missouri, to her Governor, to the Department of Labor. And to see the answers that this woman got from the Government officials of her State and our Nation is truly an embarrassment.  Here is what she writes me:  Dear Marcie: I am writing concerning the closure of my apparel plant in Seymour, MO. I called you with my concerns in January on the North American Free-Trade Agreement and its cost of American jobs like mine. This trade agreement has made it easier and more profitable for companies such as the Lee Apparel Co. to take American jobs to other countries like Mexico. It is my understanding that representatives want to extend that agreement to cover other countries as well. But let me tell you my story.  The Lee Apparel Co., a subsidiary of Vanity Fair Corp., was one of the two main employers in Seymour, MO. The employees were hard working people who had helped the Lee Co. through many hard times. In 1988, we accepted the Lee COMPETE plan which gave us an immediate cut in pay and tightened our incentive rates and made it harder to make a decent living. We took this cut to help make the jobs in Seymour more secure.  But we found out 8 years later on September 26, 1996, that our hard work and willingness to help the Lee Co. would be thrown back into our faces by the Lee Co. sending our jobs to Mexico and Costa Rica. By sending our jobs to Mexico, the Vanity Fair Corp., through low wages and corporate greed, have not even allowed the Mexican people to make a living.  With one stroke the Vanity Fair Corp., has weakened the American economy and depressed the Mexican people. I know that the people who worked in the Seymour, MO, plant deserve better. Many of the employees had devoted 5, 10, 20, even 25 or more years to the Lee Co., and this was their reward. We certainly were not making extremely high wages. The average for the last quarter we worked was only $7.84 per hour.  A total of almost 2,000 American jobs have been lost just since December of 1995--she says 2,000 jobs just in this one company, in the Lee Apparel Co.--including the closing of the St. Joseph, MO, plant; Fayetteville, TN; Seymour, MO; Dalton, GA; Bayou La Batre, AL; and the downsizing of jobs in the Winston-Salem, NC, plant. The other plants now working are in danger of losing their jobs to foreign countries and live in constant threat of plant closure. When will it stop?  I believe that the Government representatives of this country have allowed this to happen by passing the trade agreements such as NAFTA and GATT. Even though most will tell me that these trade agreements will be better in the long run, it does not help the 2,000 American workers who lost their jobs this year from the Lee Apparel Co., who need to support and feed their families.  I believe that when we combine the unconcern of the Government representatives of this country with the greed and coldness of the American corporations such as the Vanity Fair Corp., we will continue to have lost jobs and an increase of American work given to foreign governments.  The tax dollars generated in the city of Seymour, in Webster County, in the State of Missouri, and the United States, will be lost and services to those communities decreased due to lack of funds because of this closure. The same will be true in other communities that contained Lee apparel plants that were closed and the ones that will be closed in the future due to American work being sent out of the United States.  In a news bulletin dated October 18, 1995, the Vanity Fair Corp. stated, ``Clearly, though, Vanity Fair remains committed to a strong domestic manufacturing capability that provides quick response to our retail partners, flexibility to changing product trends and support to the local communities in which we operate.''  She says, I guess somewhere along the line the Vanity Fair Corp. forgot the American community and the American people to whom they sell their product.  Through the closing of these domestic plants, many American communities will suffer. Not only the employees of the closed Lee Apparel plants but also the businesses who rely on the money generated through wages spent. They will suffer too. That is some commitment on behalf of the Vanity Fair Corp.  We were told that if your plant must be closed, this is the best way because of the provision for job training provided by the NAFTA agreement. But in the case of Missouri, this is not proving to be the case. The employees of Seymour are having to fight to get the training entitlement under this plan. Many are having to fight many battles with the Employment Security Office that approves this training to get thehigh-technology training that is supposed to lessen the chance of our future jobs being given to foreign governments. Not only have we lost our jobs, but we now must fight our own Government to get good training.  I don't know, but doesn't it seem like there should be a better way of doing things? When will the American Government start requiring accountability for these trade agreements? When will the American people that they represent start requiring accountability for the bills passed by our Government?  I hope you will read this letter to your fellow Representatives on the floor of Congress. Somewhere the system has gone against the American people and we need help. Thank you for your time and concern, I appreciate all you have contributed to the American worker.  Now I want to put Wanda's letter in the Record:                                                 January 12, 1997.     Congresswoman Marcie Kaptur,     State of Ohio, Rayburn Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: I am writing concerning the      closure of my apparel plant in Seymour, Missouri. I called      your radio program on 1-12-97 with my concerns on the North      American Free Trade Agreement and its cost of American jobs      like mine. This Trade agreement has made it easier and more      profitable for companies such as the Lee Apparel Company to      take American jobs to other countries like Mexico.

Not only the employees of the closed Lee Apparel      plants, but also the businesses who rely on the money      generated through wages spent will suffer.

When will the American people that they represent start      requiring accountability for the bills passed by our      government?       I hope you will read this letter to your fellow      representatives on the floor. Somewhere the system has gone      against the American people and we need help! Thank you for      your time and concern. I appreciate all you have contributed      to the American worker.           Sincerely yours,                                                  Wanda J. Rapier.  But what is very interesting is she sent a similar letter to the President of the United States. I am going to read his answer and put that in the Record this evening as well, because it is an answer that goes to the hundreds of thousands of people in our country who have lost their jobs to NAFTA as well as to the people in Mexico who are getting the short end of the stick.  This is what he said to Wanda, the President of the United States, in a letter dated January of this year.       Dear Wanda: Thank you for sharing your views about the      North American Free Trade Agreement. America's continued      prosperity depends, as never before, on our ability to tap      growing markets around the world.       NAFTA represents a great opportunity to create new, high-     wage jobs here in America and to improve our ability to      compete with Asia and Europe. And, as a result of this      agreement, the Mexican and Canadian markets are beginning to      open for the first time on a fair and equal basis to U.S.      goods and services. More than 2 million American jobs are      supported by exports to Canada and Mexico, and that number is      growing in large part due to the NAFTA market-opening      provisions.       Congress passed NAFTA in a historic demonstration of      bipartisan support, and our country has chosen to compete,      not retreat, and to reassert our leadership in the global      economy. I hope you will continue to stay involved as we work      to move our country forward.       Sincerely, Bill Clinton, President of the United States.                                              The White House,                                     Washington, January 14, 1997.     Ms. Wanda J. Napier,     Marshfield, MO.

Now, Wanda also wrote her Senators, and I am going to read the answer that she got, and we wonder why the American people stop voting, because nobody is listening. And here is what one of the Senators said, and I will place this in the Record:       Dear Ms. Napier: Thank you very much for sharing your      thoughts. I am always happy to hear from Missourians and am      interested to know your thoughts on this issue.       Again, thank you for taking the time to inform me of your      views. If I can be of further assistance, please do not      hesitate to contact me.                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 1996.     Ms. Wanda J. Napier,     Route 4, Box 3810, Marshfield, MO       Dear Ms. Napier: Thank you very much for sharing your      thoughts on supporting the NAFTA Accountability Act. I am      always happy to hear from Missourians and am interested to      know your thoughts on this issue.       Again, thank you for taking the time to inform me of your      views. If I can be of further assistance, please do not      hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,                                              Christopher S. Bond,                                                     U.S. Senator.  Then she wrote a senator in her home State, and I will not read the entire letter here this evening, but I will read a portion of it and place the entire letter of reply in the Record. The gentleman, who is a senator in Jefferson City, says to Wanda:       The question was posed as to how we were allowing this to      happen. I do not know that anyone was allowing this to      happen. Competition in the sewing industry has been very      intense for several years, and now that we have a Mexican      labor market so open to us, there is even greater pressure      from competition.                                              Missouri Senate,                                 Jefferson City, October 16, 1996.     Ms. Wanda Napier,     Marshfield, MO.       Dear Ms. Napier: I have received four letters which were      identical so, therefore, I am taking the liberty of sending      each of you the same letter.       I am very sorry that the Lee Company found it necessary to      close the Seymour plant and I know it will be a burden and      hardship on 350 individuals as well as their families. The      economic impact on the county is also obvious.       The Department of Economic Development has assured me that      they will do all they can do to see that a new employer is      able to move into the Seymour community at the earliest date      possible.       The question was posed as to how we were allowing this to      happen. I don't know that anyone was allowing this to happen.      Competition in the sewing industry has been very intense for      several years and now that we have a Mexican labor market so      open to us there is even greater pressure from competition.       I doubt that any one of us wants to live in a state or      nation that would nationalize businesses (take the companies      over).       You may wish to correspond directly with Congressman      Skelton and Senators Bond and Ashcroft. Their addresses are      enclosed.       Be assured of my interest and willingness to help in any      way I can. I do believe that there will be job opportunities      for the work force in the Seymour area. The availability of      the plant facilities and trained work force has to be a real      asset for the city of Seymour to offer a prospective company.       I know it is a difficult time but by working together there      will be a brighter day.           Sincerely,                                                  John T. Russell.  At least he was honest. At least he was honest, and what he is really saying is that here in the United States what we are doing is, we are in a race to the bottom. Lowering our standards continually, wages not rising, benefits being cut, whether it is in health, whether it is in retirement, workplace standards deteriorating because we do not have proper rules of engagement with nations that are not at our level and standard of living.  Now, she also wrote the Secretary of Labor of the United States of America. I am going to place that response in the Record, as well, because essentially what they say to her is that the President and the Secretary of Labor have been raising the issue of corporate responsibility, and they are telling her that while change is inevitable, profit should not be the only factor considered when companies reorganize, merge, or downsize.  And, in fact, the Secretary of Labor informs her that the President of the United States recently hosted the White House Conference on Corporate Citizenship, gee, would that not make her feel good, to continue the national discussion, discussion of how the corporate sector can ensure growth and profitability while not denying people the opportunity to make the most of their lives.  They go on to say that more than 300 business leaders came to the White House, including a sizable number of those businesses that are leaders in one or more of the five critical aspects of corporate responsibility. And listen to what the White House thinks are the elements of corporate responsibility: family-friendly work practices, health care and retirement, safe and secure workplaces, education and training, and employer-employee partnerships.  But where is jobs in America? Where is the issue of holding these corporations responsible for productive, high-wage jobs in the United States of America? Not even discussed.         U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant            Secretary for Policy,                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1996.     Ms. Wanda Napier,     Marshfield, MO.       Dear Ms. Napier: Thank you for writing. The Secretary of      Labor has asked me to respond on his behalf.       The President and the Secretary are committed to doing all      they can to assist workers, such as those at the Lee Company      plants cited in your letters, who have lost or are in danger      of losing their positions as a result of downsizing. The      Administration is fighting to ensure that adequate funding is      provided for training programs for dislocated workers, to      help them land on their feet.       The President and the Secretary are also raising the issue      of corporate responsibility. While change is inevitable,      profits should not be the only factor considered when      companies reorganize, merge, or downsize. Corporate decisions      and actions must accommodate the interests of employees as      well.       The President recently hosted the White House Conference on      Corporate Citizenship to continue the national discussion of      how the corporate sector can ensure growth and profitability      while not denying people the opportunity to make the most of      their lives. More than 300 business leaders attended the      Conference, including a sizeable number of those businesses      that are leaders in one or more of five critical aspects of      corporate responsibility: family-friendly work practices,      health care and retirement, safe and secure workplaces,      education and training, and employer-employee partnerships.       Thank you for sharing your thoughts and concerns on these      important economic issues with the Administration.           Sincerely,                                                      Emil Parker,                     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy.  It was interesting, she wrote her Governor. I will not read the answer from the Governor of Missouri, but basically it is a letter saying, I want to hear the concerns of citizens and be of assistance, but because your problem of losing your job falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, he is bucking the letter to the Department of Industrial Relations, which basically tells her that they have a listing of computerized building and site information that they make available to potential companies that want to locate in Missouri.                                           Office of the Governor,                                            State of Missouri,                                Jefferson City, November 26, 1996.     Ms. Wanda Napier,     Marshfield, MO.       Dear Ms. Napier: Thank you for your letter. I want to hear      the concerns of citizens and to be of assistance when      possible.       Because the matter addressed in your letter falls under the      jurisdiction of the Department of Labor and Industrial      Relations, I have forwarded your letter to the department      director's office for review and response. You should receive      a reply in the near future. If you do not, please let me      know.           Very truly yours,                                                     Mel Carnahan.                              {time}  2000  I can tell my colleagues I spoke to Wanda on Sunday again. She has no job. Her fellow employees, if they have been able to scrape anything together in that part of the country, are earning half of what they used to earn, and they only earned about $7.85 an hour anyway.  This is what one citizen has tried to do to get anybody to listen to her story. This is someone who could be completely down and out, but she refuses to back down because she wants an answer. So what is she doing? She has rewritten the President of the United States another letter. She said, ``Mr. President, I do not think you read my letter because the answer I got could not have been to the letter that was addressed to you.''  She wrote that letter a few months ago and she finally got an answer dated May 5, again from the White House, exactly the same letter, word for word, except for the date, that she received in the first place. I am going to place that letter in the Record as well at this point.                                                  The White House,     Washington, May 5, 1997.     Mrs. Wanda J. Napier,     Marshfield, MO.       Dear Wanda: Thank you for sharing your views about the      North American Free Trade Agreement. America's continued      prosperity depends, as never before, on our ability to tap      growing markets around the world.       NAFTA represents a great opportunity to create new, high-     wage jobs here in America and to improve our ability to      compete with Asia and Europe. And, as a result of this      agreement, the Mexican and Canadian markets are beginning to      open for the first time on a fair and equal basis to U.S.      goods and services. More than two million American jobs are      supported by exports to Canada and Mexico, and that number is      growing in large part due to the NAFTA market-opening      provisions.       Congress passed NAFTA in a historic demonstration of      bipartisan support, and our country has chosen to compete--     not retreat--and to reassert our leadership in the global      economy. I hope you will continue to stay involved as we work      to move our country forward.           Sincerely,                                                     Bill Clinton.  She has been e-mailing the White House. This is a woman who will not give up. I give her so much credit. She has been e-mailing the White House almost every other day. It is interesting when she writes the e-mail to explain her problem, whoever is down in that office in the e-mail office, here is what they answer her:       Thank you for writing to President Clinton via electronic      mail. Since June 19, 1993, the White House has received over      1 million e-mail messages from people across the country and      around the world. We are excited about the progress of online      communication as a tool to bring government and the people      closer together. Your continued interest and participation      are very important to that goal. Sincerely, Stephen Horn,      Director, Presidential E-mail, the Office of Correspondence.  If you were Wanda sitting out there in Missouri, how would you feel? I promised her that I am going to keep repeating her story until she gets a decent answer from the highest officeholder in this land who is elected, not appointed, and who is the promoter, the chief promoter of this agreement, along with the Speaker of this institution. It seems to me that Wanda and the 125,000 citizens of this country who have completely lost their jobs, in California, in Missouri, in Florida, in Michigan, in Tennessee, in Kentucky, in Alabama, in Texas due to NAFTA, do they not have a right to more consideration than this?  Today in Ohio we had major news. In the Warren, OH area, 8,500 workers at a major General Motors plant have gone on strike. What are they striking about? Let me read from the AP wire service. They walked off the job at General Motors Corp. where they make electric wiring for 20 automakers worldwide. The walkout began at 12 o'clock today, the deadline set by their union representatives to reach a contract agreement on local pension and pay issues with Delphi-Packard systems. Talks broke off on the issue of job security. Specifically, the union's contention is that the company in recent years has shifted thousands of jobs to Mexico, which it has. It employs over 37,000 people in Mexico today. General Motors is the largest employer in the nation of Mexico after the Government of Mexico.       The company wanted to reserve the right to move any work      out of Ohio to Mexico at any time and that they did not have      to meet with us about it, and that's when the bargaining      committee said we can't live with that.       The concern is for our members working here to be able to      retire from here.  Their story, their strike is connected to Wanda. It is over the same issue: fair treatment of workers across this continent. It is very interesting that when Mexico got in trouble last year and they had to be bailed out with the peso bailout, the investors on Wall Street and the investors on the Mexico City stock exchange had such important seats at the table that our own Government became the insurance company for Mexico and our taxpayer dollars, through the U.S. Treasury, were used to prop Mexico up. But when the American people lose their jobs to another nation, or they are threatened with losing their shirts, they have no seat at the table. There is no place under NAFTA where the workers of our country, and, for that matter, the workers of Mexico and the farmers of both nations, where they get a break, where they get anybody to pay attention to their story. Do my colleagues think the Secretary of the Treasury even would sit down with Wanda? I would love to see that. The President of the United States will not even answer her repeated letters and repeated e-mails.  So here tonight we give voice to her, we give voice to the 8,500 General Motors workers in Warren, OH, who are standing firm. Their fight is a fight for every working family in America, because they are saying, we do not want our jobs outsourced. We do not want to have our wages reduced and our benefits cut and our health benefits plan gutted because we have to go in competition with a nation that will not even permit its own citizens to have their wages rise with rising productivity.  Let me mention that this Warren-based company of General Motors has 17 manufacturing plants and an engineering center in the Warren-Youngstown region in northeast Ohio, and they make wiring harnesses. Half their production goes into GM vehicles. As with Wanda's company, Vanity Fair, which had branches all over the United States, Delphi Packard has factories in Alabama, Arizona, California, and Mississippi. The workers who are standing the ground in Ohio tonight are standing in firm solidarity with workers across this Nation and, in fact, across this continent.  The striking workers have set up picket lines in Ohio. Production was stopped and no new talks were scheduled. One of the company spokesmen said today, ``One real key point for us is that Delphi Packard has worked long and hard to build a diverse customer base, a lot of non-GM customers. The difficulty of winning and growing non-GM business is so challenging that when you interrupt that supply line, the risk is you can damage that relationship.''  Union members have complained about retirement incentives for older workers and wages and benefits for newer employees who make up 55 percent of the most senior hourly workers.  What they are really fighting about are standard of living questions, living wage questions, questions of whether their contract, given their work, deserves a fair day's pay. With whom are they competing? People who do not have the ability to raise their standard of living in a nation like Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to place this story about what is happening in Ohio in the Record this evening at this point.       8,500 Delphi Workers Strike in Warren, Cite Mexico Threat       Warren, OH (AP).--A key auto industry supplier was struck      today by 8,500 hourly workers who walked off the job at a      General Motors Corp. subsidiary that makes electric wiring      for 20 automakers worldwide.       The walkout began at 12:01 a.m., the deadline set by the      International Union of Electronic Workers to reach a contract      agreement on local pension and pay issues with Delphi Packard      Electric Systems.       Talks broke off over the issue of job security,      specifically the union's contention that the company in      recent years has shifted thousands of jobs to Mexico, Mike      Kowach, Local 717 vice president, said today.       ``The company wanted to reserve the right to move any work      out of Ohio to Mexico at any time and that they did not have      to meet with us about it, and that's when the bargaining      committee said we can't live with that.       ``The concern is for our members working here to be able to      retire from here,'' Kowach said.       A message seeking the company's response on that issue was      not immediately returned.       Most pay and benefit issues were settled earlier in a      national agreement between GM and the union. The contract      governing local issues expired in September.       The Warren-based company has 17 manufacturing plants and an      engineering center in the Warren-Youngstown region in      northeast Ohio, and makes wiring harnesses. Half of its      production goes into GM vehicles.       Delphi Packard also has factories in Alabama, Arizona,      California and Mississippi that are not involved in the      strike.       Both sides have been negotiating on local issues since mid-     1996.       The striking workers set up picket lines, but other      employees reported to their jobs, leading to some minor      confrontations at the plant gates, according to police and      the union.       Production was stopped and no new talks were scheduled,      Delphi Packard spokesman Jim Kobus said today.       ``One real key point for us is that Delphi Packard has      worked long and hard to build a diverse customer base, a lot      of non-GM customers. The difficulty of winning and growing      non-GM business is so challenging that when you interrupt      that supply line, the risk is you can damage that      relationship,'' Kobus said.       He said it was too early to comment on when automakers      might feel the effects of the walkout.       Union members have complained about retirement incentives      for older workers and wages and benefits for newer employees      who make 55 percent of the most senior hourly workers.  Mr. Speaker, I see that we have been joined by the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Bonior], our very esteemed leader. I very much appreciate the opportunity to be able to tell the story of Wanda Napier this evening. I hope at some point we can bring her to Washington and let her tell her own story. I also appreciate being able to talk about the very brave workers in Ohio who run the risk of losing their jobs because they are standing firm at a time when they feel like pawns in a very powerful system of production globally. We just want them to know that we stand with them and our hearts are with them tonight.
