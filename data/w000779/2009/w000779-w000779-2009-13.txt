I don't want to make this a bouquet-tossing contest, but to have Senator Bayh and Senator Collins--they are as good of partners as it can possibly get.  At the end of the day, Americans are going to watch this bill, they are going to watch it next year during the open enrollment season when millions are signing up for their coverage, and they are going to be looking to see if we did everything possible to hold down their premiums. Holding down their premiums--there is a variety of ways to go about it, but there is no better tool than to bring the principles of the marketplace, the principles that are used in every other part of American life--choice and competition--for the challenge ahead.  With the help of Senator Collins and Senator Bayh, we are going to prosecute that case. We are going to do it in a bipartisan way.  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.
