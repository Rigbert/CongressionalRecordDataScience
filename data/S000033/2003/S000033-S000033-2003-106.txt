 Chairman, I am at a disadvantage. After hearing you and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) and I am sure the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson) soon after, there is not much that I can add to what you have said.  Let me reiterate a point that you made. I hope the viewers appreciate this.  You are a Republican, the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen) is a Democrat, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) is a Republican, I am independent, and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson) is a Democrat. Two Democrats, two Republicans and an Independent. And there are a lot more of us who are not here tonight.  What that should tell the American people is that there is widespread anger, frustration and disgust with what the pharmaceutical industry is doing to the people of this country.  Three years ago, I became the first Member of Congress to take a group of American citizens over the Canadian border in order to buy medicine. We went to Montreal. The reason that we did that is, I wanted not only to help hard-pressed Vermonters, mostly women, who are having a very difficult time paying for their prescription drugs, but I wanted to help show the country the absurdity of the situation, where the same exact medicine manufactured by the same exact company is sold in Canada for a fraction of the price that it is sold in the United States.                              {time}  2100  As we have discussed, it is not just Canada. It is Europe; it is Mexico. The American people pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. In that trip to Canada, one of the moments that I will not forget is that we had women with us who were struggling with breast cancer, something I know the gentleman from Indiana (Chairman Burton) has a personal interest in. Women fighting for their lives were able to pick up Tamoxifen, awidely prescribed breast cancer drug, for one-tenth of the price that is being charged in the United States of America. Of course, it is not just Tamoxifen; it is drug after drug after drug sold for a fraction of the price.  I think the gentleman said it well, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton), and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) made the point, too, and the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Allen), it seems to me we are looking at two separate things.  On the one hand, we are seeing researchers who are making enormous breakthroughs; and the result of that is that we are saving lives, we are easing pain, we are prolonging life. That is the good news. All of us here have a great deal of respect for those researchers in the drug companies and in the United States Government, in universities, foundations who are doing that work. I thank them so much for what they are doing.  But then there is another side of the pharmaceutical industry. Those are the people who sit at the heads of these corporations who are concerned about one thing alone, that is, making as much money as they possibly can. They do not lose a night's sleep if elderly people die because they cannot afford the medicine they need or if their health deteriorates.  Of the many outrages that we have talked about here, the huge amount, hundreds of millions of dollars, that floods Washington or State capitals in order to maintain high prices, there is another outrage that I do not think has been mentioned tonight. While elderly people cannot afford the high price of medicine, the CEOs and the top dogs of these companies receive huge compensation packages.  In 2001, C.A. Heimbold, Jr., former chairman and CEO of Bristol-Meyers-Squibb, ended up his compensation with $74,890,000. Not bad; but that is not all. Mr. Heimbold also received stock options that same year amounting to over $76 million. One year, one man, $150 million. Then they tell us they just cannot lower the cost of medicine so that seniors in Vermont or Indiana can ease their pain or protect their lives.  Year after year while we continue to pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, year after year the pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the country. More profitable than media, more profitable than banks. The pharmaceutical industry leads the list.  The issue here, and the gentleman has touched on this, I say to the chairman, the issue really here is will the United States Congress have the guts, and it is going to take some guts, to stand up to what I believe is the most powerful force in the United States of America.  I was interested, Mr. Speaker, to hear the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton) say they have already gone down to Indiana and tried to work against him because of his willingness to stand up on this issue. If I am not mistaken, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) told the same story, that they had gone to Minnesota, as well.  The gentleman and I know that when Members of Congress fight hard for consumers, lots of money comes into a campaign, mostly against Democrats; but I am sure they will go after Republicans, as well.  What we have to deal with now is to ask our colleagues in the Congress to have the guts to stand up to the campaign contributions, the advertising, the visiting of the editorial boards, the TV ads, all that we will see, the unlimited sums of money, hundreds of millions of dollars. Do we have the courage to say no to those people and protect the American consumer?  I believe that if tonight is an example of the potential of what we can do, standing together, regardless of philosophy or party, we can protect the American people and take on this industry. I thank the gentleman very much for calling this Special Order.
