Speaker, I want to commend the Department of the Treasury and Secretary Rubin for their efforts to support students of the District of Columbia Public Schools.  We have all read about the significant challenges the students in our Nation's Capital face daily, including substandard buildings and less than adequate education. I am pleased that, with the support of Treasury and it's employees, some students are benefiting.  In 1995, Treasury established a Partnership in Education program with two high schools in the District, Eastern and Woodrow Wilson. They initially offered internships for students after school, providing many of them their first exposure to a professional office setting. During the summer of 1996, they employed more than 100 students.  Based on that successful experience, they decided to institutionalize the program, and in addition to internships have added workshops in career planning, resume writing, college admissions standards, and related topics. These workshops are conducted by local university professionals from Georgetown, Howard, American, and George Washington University.  Treasury's mission is a commendable one--to fill those gaps in education that can help students acquire the necessary tools and skills to go on to college or a profession after high school graduation.  In addition to this work, Treasury also manages the Academy of Law, Justice and Security, a program with 200 students at Anacostia High School. I want to note that the Department of Justice and the Department of Defense also support this effort to prepare students for careers in law and law enforcement.  In addition, Treasury bureaus, like the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and the Secret Service are supporting D.C. students and teachers with activities including tutoring, mentoring, equipment, and employment.  Overall, 150 employee volunteers are involved in these activities. This is a great effort and I look forward to Treasury expanding it to include schools in Maryland and in my district.  I commend the work of Secretary Rubin and his staff and encourage other Federal agencies to become more involved in supporting their local school districts.                          ____________________
