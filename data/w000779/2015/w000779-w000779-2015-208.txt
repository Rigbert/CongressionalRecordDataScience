President, long ago, I decided the most complimentary statement one could make about an elected official boils down to four simple words: ``That person really cares.'' Those four words perfectly sum up Gretchen Kafoury's long record of public service in Portland and in Oregon.  From serving in the Peace Corps during the 1960s to teaching at Portland State University four decades later, Gretchen just cared--and then cared some more--about helping everyone have a better life.  Gretchen was the go-to leader in Portland and statewide in the fight to help women escape domestic violence. She was our conscience in the battle to help people of modest means have more affordable housing. And she was a pioneer for equal rights when she organized the campaign to force open the doors at the City Club of Portland for women.  Small in stature, Gretchen Kafoury had the biggest heart in Oregon. If you didn't have power or clout or a political action committee--and you were talking about justice, Gretchen brought her smarts, her energy, and her persistence to your cause.  I met Gretchen shortly after I graduated from law school at the University of Oregon and was starting the Oregon Gray Panthers with another admirer of Gretchen's--Ruth Haefner.  When you visited Ruth's house in Northeast Portland, you would see itfilled with literature from progressive seniors for good causes. And I clearly remember how those progressive seniors thought Gretchen was spot on, for example, in developing the first health clinic for teenagers at Roosevelt High School.  Gretchen was incredibly helpful to the Gray Panthers in those days when she served in the Oregon Legislature as our State passed a generic drug law, home care for seniors, and new rules to stop rip-off artists scamming health insurance to seniors.  Before Gretchen worked to crack down on those scamsters, it was common to see seniors with as many as 8 to 10 worthless health insurance policies that fast-talking salesmen had sold them. Those phony salesmen never stood a chance when Gretchen fought to stop business practices that fleeced the elderly.  When I ran for Congress in 1980, virtually no established elected officials were in my corner. Gretchen was one of those folks in a group so tiny it could have fit in a couple of phone booths. I had never run for public office but--with help and encouragement from Gretchen and seniors--I wanted to go to Washington to work on the very issues Gretchen championed. I was proud she was in my corner every step of the way.  Over the years when I would see Gretchen at a housing rally, a domestic violence conference, or an event to help nurses and other health care providers get better care for Oregonians at lower cost, I would always see Gretchen and start to smile. That is because her caring was so infectious and her passion to help people who needed help was so powerful.  She prompted so many others to become involved in public life, not the least of whom are her two daughters, one of whom is Multnomah County Chair Deborah Kafoury.  How lucky all Oregonians were to have Gretchen, and how lucky I was that she was my friend.                          ____________________
