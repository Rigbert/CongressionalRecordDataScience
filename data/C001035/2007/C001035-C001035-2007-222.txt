In addition, as the Presiding Officer so ably represents the State of New York, there was a Newsday editorial today also endorsing the amendment with its 2-year delay.  The National Governors Association has also issued a statement that says:       Senator Collins' bipartisan amendment recognizes the need      to give state officials and other interested parties the      right to review regulations and suggest modifications.  It goes on to say:       This proposal would provide states a more workable time      frame to comply with federal standards, ensure necessary      systems are operational and enhance the input states and      other stakeholders have in the implementation process.  We have also heard from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union that is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, which has written a letter as well. It says:       It is clear that the states do not have the capacity to      comply with the REAL ID Act by the 2008 deadline and that a      number of serious concerns related to privacy must be      addressed. The Collins amendment provides the opportunity to      address these matters.  Similarly, another group with whom we have worked closely is the National Conference of State Legislatures. In fact, it was a high-ranking official of the NCSL who sat next to me on a plane going to Maine some time ago and suggested that what States needed most was a delay in the compliance time. I worked very closely with the NCSL in drafting our amendment. I am very grateful for their advice.  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and editorials I have mentioned be printed in the Record so we may share them with our colleagues.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [From the National Governors Association, Feb. 28, 2007]         NGA Praises Congressional Movement To Correct REAL ID       Washington.--On behalf of the nation's governors, the      National Governors Association (NGA) issued the following      statement regarding the introduction of an amendment to delay      implementation of Real ID.       ``Governors praise Senator Susan Collins, ranking member of      the Senate Homeland Security Committee, for introducing an      amendment to address the issues raised by the Real ID Act of      2005. This proposal would provide states a more workable time      frame to comply with federal standards, ensure necessary      systems are operational and enhance the input states and      other stakeholders have in the implementation process.       ``Improving the security and integrity of their drivers'      license systems is vital; however, the substantial costs and      looming implementation deadline make Real ID unworkable and      unreasonable. NGA has called on the Department of Homeland      Security and Congress to fix the law by providing additional      time, resources and flexibility for states to enhance their      systems.       ``Senator Collins' bipartisan amendment recognizes the need      to give state officials and other interested parties the      right to review regulations and suggest modifications. This      allows governors and state legislators to help create      reasonable standards and ensure the act is implemented in a      cost-effective and feasible manner with maximum safety and      minimum inconvenience for all Americans.''                                  ____         American Federation of State, County and Municipal            employees, AFL-CIO,                                Washington, DC, February 27, 2007.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.4 million members of the      American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees      (AFSCME), I am writing with respect to the Senate debate over      S. 4, legislation to implement 9/11 Commission      recommendations.       We understand that an amendment may be offered, possibly by      Senator DeMint, to strike or weaken a provision in the bill      that gives Transportation Security Administration (TSA)      screeners collective bargaining and other civil service      protections. We strongly urge you to oppose this amendment.      In addition, we urge you to support an amendment to be      offered by Senator Collins that would delay implementation of      requirements under the REAL ID Act and to reopen negotiated      rulemaking of the Act.       With respect to the DeMint amendment, it is important to      highlight that civil service protections, backed up by      collective bargaining, ensure that federal employment is      efficient, fair, open to all, free from political      interference and staffed by honest, competent and dedicated      employees. Civil service protections and collective      bargaining rights ensure that federal employees are able to      fulfill their assignments with professional integrity and a      commitment to the public interest. The decision to take away      civil service protections and collective bargaining rights      has resulted in a demoralized workforce, with injury and      illness rates that are six times higher than the federal      average and an attrition rate that is more than ten times      higher than the federal employee average. Clearly, the      removal of civil service protections and collective      bargaining rights has jeopardized the public, not made it      safer.       With respect to the Collins amendment, we have previously      expressed our concern over the costs to the states to      implement the requirements under the REAL ID Act. It is clear      that states do not have the capacity to     comply with the Act by the 2008 deadline and that a number of      serious concerns related to privacy must be addressed. The      Collins amendment provides the opportunity to address these      matters.           Sincerely,                                              Charles M. Loveless,     Director of Legislation.                                  ____                    [From NCSL News, Feb. 20, 2007]     State Lawmakers Encouraged by REAL ID Activity in U.S. Senate Senator Collins' measure to provide extra time, state input into the                            regulatory process       Washington, DC.--The National Conference of State      Legislatures praises Maine Senator Susan Collins for      introducing legislation (S. 563) to address state concerns      over the Real ID Act, a measure which creates national      standards for state-issued drivers licenses and      identification cards.       S. 563 addresses some of the recommendations for change      called for by NCSL, governors and motor vehicle      administrators in a September 2006 report--The REAL ID:      National Impact Analysis. Legislators throughout the country      support REAL ID's goal of making drivers licenses more      secure, but are frustrated by the rigidity of the law's      approach, the high costs it imposes on states and the      inordinately long time it has taken the Department of      Homeland Security to issue the regulations needed to      implement REAL ID.       NCSL is encouraged that Senator Collins, ranking member of      the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs      Committee, and other members of Congress are taking steps to      correct the problems associated with the law. S. 563 provides      a longer time frame to comply with the federal standards and      to ensure that necessary systems are operational. Senator      Collins' legislation also establishes a committee of state      officials and other interested parties to. review the draft      DHS regulations and to submit recommendations for regulatory      and legislative changes.       NCSL's official policy statement calls for repeal of Real      10 if, by December 31 of this year, Congress fails to adopt      the necessary changes as outlined in the September 2006      report and if they fail to provide full funding for the law.      Senator Collins' legislation, therefore, is especially timely      and NCSL looks forward to working with her and her colleagues      to fix and fund the law.       NCSL is the bipartisan organization that serves the      legislators and staff of the states, commonwealths and      territories. It provides research, technical assistance and      opportunities for policymakers to exchange ideas on the most      pressing state issues and is an effective and respected      advocate for the interests of the states in the American      federal system.                                  ____                [From Kennebec Journal Morning Sentinel]                Addressing the Real Problems of REAL ID       The REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005. Part of a      suite of measures to beef up homeland security, the act      requires that by mid-2008, Americans must have a federally      approved ID card--most likely an enhanced driver's license--     to travel on airplanes, collect government payments or use      government services and open a bank account. The national ID      cards would have to be machine-readable.       As the deadline approaches for compliance with the act,      opposition to the mandate has grown. Late last month, the      Maine Legislature became the first in the nation to pass a      measure against the requirement, unequivocally refusing to      implement the act and urging Congress to repeal it. Too      expensive, too fast, too much of an invasion of privacy and      too burdensome to administer, said a bipartisan coalition of      Maine lawmakers. Estimate of the cost of compliance in Maine      alone is $185 million.       The Legislature's rejection made news around the nation.      What Maine started threatened to become a tidal wave of state      opposition. In an effort to stem the momentum and salvage      what she considers good about the requirement, U.S. Sen.      Susan Collins Friday announced she's introducing legislation      to delay implementation of the act and provide states with a      more reasonable time frame for complying with its new      standards for drivers' licenses. ``The costs of complying      with REAL ID are enormous and overly burdensome to states,      including Maine,'' said Collins.       We agree. Collins' legislation puts the brakes on a mandate      that raises significant concerns, as well as the broader      question of whether the REAL ID would ultimately be      effective.       Her bill would give the Department of Homeland Security the      ability to delay or waive REAL ID requirements if states      don't have the technical capability to comply with it, or the      money.       It furthermore calls to the discussion table the right      group of people to hammer out an alternative: federal and      state officials, privacy advocates and others with a stake in      the matter. We're encouraged that this senator, who has made      her name as an advocate of effective and real security      measures, has focused on finding a solution to the real      problems posed by REAL ID.                                  ____                      [From the Bangor Daily News]                            Needed ID Delay       By introducing a bill to slow the pace of new federal      identification rules, Sen. Susan Collins today is expected to      offer a way out of a growing confrontation between Washington      and the states. The bill would extend the deadline for REAL      ID by two years and recognize the cost burden currently      imposed on states. Additionally, it reopens the question of      how much information the federal government should      centralize.       This pause is needed. Last week, for instance, Georgia      looked at REAL ID's expected price tag of between $30 million      and $60 million and declined to fund it. That follows Maine's      resolution to reject the program and likely precedes work in      about a dozen states that have legislation against REAL ID      before their legislatures. The Collins bill would reconvene      the panel that made recommendations on this issue and review      problems raised by the states, the standards for protecting      constitutional rights and civil liberties and the security of      the electronic information, among other issues.       Under the current regulations, all Americans would have a      federally approved ID card by the end of next year. Usually      seen as a machine-readable driver's license, the card would      be needed not only for driving but all the standard uses--to      board airplanes, do business with the federal government,      open a bank account. One estimate put the cost to states for      transitioning to these new IDs at $11 billion.       Besides cost, opponents of the standardized identification      program fear that REAL ID will result in a national database,      which the federal government may not be equipped to protect.      In particular, one provision would require states to verify      all documents required for the issuance of a driver's license      or identification card. That would require each state to have      agreements with all other states or, more likely, have a      single national agreement.       Given the government's track record on securing private      information, states are reasonably worried. Not long ago, the      House Government Reform Committee looked at 19 agencies going      back to 2003 and found 788 separate cases of confidential      data being either lost or stolen. Most of the lost data, the      report concluded, was due to ``unauthorized use of data by      employees.''       The extended deadline proposed by the Collins legislation      would give officials an opportunity to improve security at      both federal and state levels. And it should find ways for      Washington to help pay for this expensive program.                                  ____                    [From the Portland Press Herald]  Real ID program Is a Real Mess; How Can States Standardize Driver's            Licenses by 2008 When Standards Haven't Been Set?       Maine's ``revolt'' against a federal mandate to create an      expensive, high-tech driver's license that meets new      standards set by the federal government is catching on.       Since state legislators overwhelmingly approved a      resolution objecting to the Real ID Act of 2005 in late      January, lawmakers in Vermont, Georgia, Wyoming, Montana, New      Mexico and Washington state have followed suit.       The Real ID Act was an effort to enhance and standardize      the information on state driver's licenses so they could      double as a national identification card.       Such a sensitive federal-state issue ought to have been the      subject of negotiations including the states. But the House      of Representatives forged ahead with the Real ID Act, which      simply ordered the Department of Homeland Security to write      its own requirements. The measure passed the Senate attached      to a supplemental spending bill.       A very real set of concerns revolve around the security of      the machine-readable personal information that will be      included in the high-tech card, as well as the security of      the linked national database that will house this      information. One recent study found more than 700 instances      of confidential data being stolen from the federal government      since 2003.       Also problematic is the notion that state transportation      workers will be essentially conscripted to the front line of      this federal program.       Across the country, states will begin working on their 2008      budgets this year. A 2006 study by the National Governors      Association tabbed the cost of compliance at $11 billion over      five years. Secretary of State Matt Dunlap estimates Maine's      share will be $185 million.       Yet despite Real ID's looming May 2008 deadline for      compliance, states still haven't seen the law's requirements.       On Monday, Sen. Susan Collins introduced a bill that would      delay the compliance date for two years to 2010 so the      federal government can get its act straightened out.       Her bill would convene a panel of federal and state      stakeholders to examine issues raised by the states around      cost, privacy and feasibility.       Rep. Tom Allen intends to offer a bill that would repeal      the law entirely.       If Congress feels homeland security requires that all      Americans carry an internal passport, then it ought to      administer the program.       It ought to pay for it as well.                                  ____                   [From Newsday (NY), Feb. 28, 2007]                    Go Slow on New Driver's Licenses                 u.s. should take time to get it right       It's a sad sign of the times, but a national identification      card, a new gold standard for     proof of identity, may be needed in the battle against      terrorism. The 9/11 Commission urged tighter security for      driver's licenses and Congress has asked the Department of      Homeland Security to develop rules for standardizing licenses      and other state issued identification into what would be,      essentially, a national ID card.       But establishing a system that will make it appreciably      harder for terrorists to operate without exacerbating the      problem of identity theft or compromising what's left of      privacy in the digital age won't be quick or easy. The      current May 2008 implementation date is unrealistic. And      there's the question state officials are already asking: Who      will pay?       Washington hasn't gotten off to a very promising start in      dealing with these concerns. In 2004, Congress established a      committee of state and federal officials and others to craft      regulations for making licenses more uniform and secure. It      preempted that process in 2005 when it tacked the Real ID Act      to a spending bill, giving the rule-making job to the      Department of Homeland Security. It's been almost two years      and no rules have been announced, although officials say they      may come as soon as this week.       But creating a secure, standardized national ID card      involves more than deciding on such things as digital      photographs and bar codes. Clerks everywhere would need ready      access to nationwide databases to verify vital records such      as birth certificates, immigration status and driver's      license records in all 50 states. Integrating that data,      securing it, controlling access and correcting errors will be      no small task.       Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) wants to give states more time      to comply. That's advisable and probably inevitable.
