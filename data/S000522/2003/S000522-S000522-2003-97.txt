Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) who is the vice chairman of the committee and has been, and as the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Brown) pointed out, seven times he has now tried to get the Gold Star Wives' compensation not lost if they were to remarry, and this time we have it in the bill. Last year when we sent it over to the Senate, we lost it, but this time I think the seventh time is the charm, and I thank him for his leadership.
