President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a notable development in the community of Moretown, VT. Moretown is located near the confluence of the Mad River and the Winooski River, just down the road from my home in Middlesex, and the community was hit particularly hard by the flooding caused by Tropical Storm Irene. Homes were flooded, the town offices were inundated, and the Moretown School was damaged. Bridges were washed away, cutting the town off from central Vermont's highway system, and leaving some residents stranded. But through this disaster, the town pulled together, in yet another of the many stories that can be told of the great resilience shown by Vermonters in the storm's terrible aftermath.  As flood waters rose, the postmaster in charge of the Moretown Post Office, Naomi Tilton, and the two carriers who work in the Moretown Post Office managed to save every piece of mail from the rising flood waters. Every single piece of mail in their charge. Water eventually filled the entire post office lobby, and as water damage left by the flooding in Moretown demonstrated, as much as 8 feet of water filled the first floors of structures surrounding the post office.  When my staff visited the Moretown Post Office a week later, workers had already begun renovating the building.They had shoveled out the mud and muck deposited by the river, and they had torn out the mold-prone sheetrock. Yet even in disrepair, the post office was not in disarray or disorder: The Moretown Post Office continued to operate. A sign made out of a plain sheet of white paper directed customers to the side of the erstwhile post office, up a set of crooked stairs and into an office on the second floor. In that makeshift temporary post office, customers could still buy stamps, pick up their mail, and share their stories of survival and community togetherness.  The postal employees of Moretown did all this on their own time, outside of normal business hours, and on their own initiative. I understand that Ms. Tilton's manager was stranded dozens of miles to the south in Rochester, VT, a town similarly cut off from the outside world. Professionalism and dedication to the community motivated the employees of the Moretown Post Office to keep the area's postal system working. Their efforts offered a glimmer of hope to their neighbors as the community realized the extent of the devastation caused by the flood and the tremendous effort it would take to rebuild Moretown. And what a powerful testament to the currency in modern times of the proud tradition of this Nation's venerable postal system and its dedicated public servants.  The Moretown Post Office is just one story of the hundreds of stories I would like to tell to remind everyone how determined we are to recover from Tropical Storm Irene. The determination of our Moretown postal workers reminds us all of what it means to be a Vermonter and an American.                          ____________________
