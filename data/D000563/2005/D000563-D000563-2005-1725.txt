President, reserving the right to object, I will not object, I say to my friend, the Republican whip, it is my intention to try to reduce the length of that debate depending on morning business. I understand many of our colleagues have a meeting at the White House. If we can expedite this debate time and bring the vote up before the Senator leaves, that is my intention.  Mr. McCONNELL. That would be very good. We would either finish it before that meeting or do it after. I think we can get the vote in before that meeting. It would be very good.
