The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.R. 2880       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped      Storage Hydropower Act''.     SEC. 2. CLOSED-LOOP PUMPED STORAGE PROJECTS.       Part I of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 792 et seq.) is      amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 34.
