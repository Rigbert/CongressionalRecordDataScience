President, I have a series of amendments that have been cleared on both sides. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be set aside provided, further, that the list of amendments I have sent to the desk, including modifications to some of those amendments, be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the amendments be printed in the Record.
