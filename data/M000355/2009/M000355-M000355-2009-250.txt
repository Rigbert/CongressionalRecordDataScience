 President, I rise today to recognize the remarkable accomplishments of the Logan County Little League All-Star team. While I remember fondly the years I played America's pastime in my youth, none of my experiences can compare to those of these 10 Little Leaguers as they competed in this year's Little League World Series.  Despite its small-town feel, Logan County has produced a number of notable individuals, from astronauts and governors to NBA players and Major League Baseball pitchers.  So it is not surprising that a community that has already produced such notable figures would rally behind a group of 11- and 12-year-old players who represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Great Lakes Region in this year's Little League World Series. As the first team from Kentucky to reach this level of competition in 4 years, Logan County's All-Stars demonstrated their talent in the games leading up to their World Series bid.  When four players homered in the regional final in Indianapolis, the Logan County All-Star team set its sights on Williamsport, PA. Thankfully, their vision found support in the community. In order to afford the sizable cost of travel and lodging, the Little Leaguers and their supporters raised funds in all manner of ways, from selling steak sandwiches and auctioning off signed baseballs to holding a telethon at a local radio station.  The team played its first two games of the double elimination tournament against the West Region champions from Chula Vista, CA. While the Western team proved to be overpowering, Logan County's team demonstrated remarkable sportsmanship. As the proud winning-bidder of an auctioned T-shirt put it, ``Their character is impeccable, and we know a lot of them . . . they behave themselves and they represent Logan County and Kentucky perfectly.''  Regardless of what the scoreboard read, Logan County's All-Stars are winners. Moreover, this experience stretches beyond moments played out between the chalk-marked lines of the field. These youngsters were able to meet and develop bonds with other players from countries all over the world. Several players described their trip with one word--``awesome.''  It is with great honor that I place the names of this year's Logan County Little League All-Stars into the Record. Under the leadership of manager Kevin Gettings, team members Caleb Bruner, Joe Holliday, Zack Denney, Tucker Baldwin, Daniel Beaty, Desmon Quarles, Matt Harper, Barrett Croslin, Ian Woodall, and Jacob Wood made their hometown, their State, and this Senator very proud.                          ____________________
