Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contribution to our national security has been exceptional. After eight years of active duty service in the U.S. Navy and decades of work dedicated to the development and assessment of U.S. Navy weapons delivery platforms as a civilian, Robert ``Bob'' Everly is retiring on June 30, 2017.  Between his active duty service and civilian work directly supporting the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Mr. Everly spent nearly fifty years supporting the U.S. Navy. That civilian employment includes thirty-three years managing projects and programs supporting weapons and combat systems performance assessment, Fleet exercise assessments, metrology systems engineering, RM&A assessment, range systems engineering, telecommunications engineering, information systems engineering, software development, Information Assurance/Accreditation, and classified network operations.  Mr. Everly has also dedicated a tremendous amount of time as an essential member of various community-based organizations. That includes his service as an Executive Board Member and Co-Chair of the Science and Technology Education Program (STEP). As the Honorary Chairman of STEP, I have been incredibly fortunate to work closely with Mr. Everly to develop a successful program that sparks students interest in math, science and engineering. Mr. Everly also served as Chairman of the Board, President and Vice-President of the Measurement Science Conference, as a member of the Corona and Riverside Chambers of Commerce, and participated as a member of state and local Naval Surface Warfare Center Corona Retention Committees during the Base Realignment and Closer (BRAC) process.  Mr. Everly has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and military and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and my friend. To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Everly for his service to our country and the Inland Empire--his dedication, insight and passion will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
