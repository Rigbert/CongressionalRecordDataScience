 The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), however, does express a view that a bill that can be very helpful to us that came out 65 to 5, overwhelming agreement, came out months ago. We do hope that this bill can be brought to the floor, certainly before, hopefully if not the end of next week, the week following. Because we believe it is the kind of legislation that people would be proud of. Democrats and Republicans came together, worked on it, came out with a bill, and it is a very good bill.
