President, today I am introducing the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act of 2013 to end the destructive cycle of underfunding wildfire prevention and then having to spend even greater amounts fighting wildfires than if our forests were properly managed.  For some time now, our country has witnessed tragic wildfire seasons that have put American lives and our treasured public lands in harm's way. Sadly, this year 19 firefighters lost their lives fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona. Due to climate change, drought, and other factors, the risks from these infernos are likely to increase in the future.  Federal fire suppression spending has increased substantially over the past 20 years. In the case of the Forest Service, the proportion of their budget devoted to wildland fire management has increased steadily from 13 percent of the total budget in 1991 to 41 percent of the budget in 2013. Most recent fire seasons have cost upwards of $1 billion, compared to $200 million in the 1990's. This leads to an unfortunate new reality: our Forest Service is turning into the Fire Service.  In 8 of the past 10 years, the Forest Service has exceeded its budget for wildfire suppression, requiring the agency to conduct what is known as ``fire borrowing'' to cover wildfire suppression costs. ``Fire robbery'' would be a more accurate term because in many cases, the borrowed funds are never repaid. These transfers are incredibly disruptive and are undermining the core mission of the Forest Service.  What is worse, in order to fund the costs of fighting these infernos, the agencies responsible for fighting fires are underfunding the very programs designed to prevent fires. The 2013 President's Budget Request included significant cuts to hazardous fuels treatments for both the Department of the Interior, 50 percent cut, and the Forest Service, 30 percent cut.  Studies confirm that hazardous fuels treatments are effective at reducing fire risk and lowering costs. For example, a recent study published by Northern Arizona University's Ecological Restoration Institute concluded that treatments ``. . . can reduce fire severity . . .'', and ``. . . successfully reduce fire risk to communities.''  It is clear that our Nation needs a new path forward on fire budgeting to make sure that there is adequate funding for fire prevention work. For much of 2013, I have been urging the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to help the Congress develop a new path forward through oversight hearings, letters, and numerous discussions.  Therefore, today I am introducing the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act to provide a better path forward on wildfire funding and fire prevention.  This bill will establish parity for wildfire funding to how the Federal Government funds other major natural disasters such as floods and hurricanes. Specifically, the bill would move any spending above 70 percent of the 10-year rolling average for fire suppression outside of the agencies' baseline budget by making these additional costs eligible to be funded under a separate disaster account.  Based on Department of the Interior and Department of Agriculture analysis, 1 percent of wildland fires represent 30 percent of costs, so in essence my legislation would be moving the true emergency fire events to be funded under disaster programs, and the routine wildland firefighting costs--would be funded through the normal budgeting and appropriations process.  Most importantly, this legislation would free up as much as $412 million in discretionary funding to fund hazardous fuels projects and make sure urgently needed work is done in the forests to prevent wildland fires.  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Crapo in introducing the bill today. This legislation also has the support of Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. I look forward to working towards enactment of the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act in the 113th Congress through any possible avenue. Together, the Congress and the Administration must work to guarantee thatour country has the necessary tools to both combat and prevent wildland fires.                          ____________________
