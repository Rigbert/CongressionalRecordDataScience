 Mr. Speaker, I was here in 1981 when we cut $749 billion in revenues. Those on this floor represented that this would be a great step forward. Howard Baker, the then majority leader of the United States Senate, said, no, that it was a riverboat gamble. It was, Mr. Speaker, a riverboat gamble that we lost. We quadrupled the national debt. Now, that is a nice phrase, but what does it mean? It means we plunged the children of America deeply into debt, because we did not provide for the spending that our generation votes for.  Let us not take this risky step again. Let us not put at risk the solvency of Social Security. Let us not put at risk the vitality of Medicare. Let us not put at risk the defense of this Nation. My Republican colleagues talk about just taking $1 trillion of $3 trillion. $2 trillion is in a lockbox for Social Security, they say. But the appropriation bills we have been passing belie that lockbox theory because we are about to spend that Social Security revenue.  My friends, reject this risky, riverboat gamble. Ensure that our children's security is safe. Do not again go on the path of quadrupling the national debt. Rather, let us be fiscally responsible, target tax cuts, give relief to Americans who are most in need, working Americans, Americans with children who need care, Americans who are sending children to school. Do not take this risky road to further debt and unsureness.
