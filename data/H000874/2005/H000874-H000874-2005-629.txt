Chairman, I thank my friend for that information. Again, I do not know the accuracy of the letter in terms of the numbers of people, but there seemed to be a fair number of people, there were over 40, on the letter which appeared to agree with the Senate's view, obviously a large number on this side who share that view as well.  Perhaps we might have some discussions about reaching agreement on that issue at some point in time.  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I am sure that the discussions will fly fast and furious over next week in trying to get this conference report done.
