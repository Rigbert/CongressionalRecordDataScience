 billion the President is proposing that the American people borrow and spend and invest in Iraq, and we spent and invested that money here in the United States of America, in the same things, in sewer, water, bridges, roads, airports, stable electricity, we would create a million jobs, a million jobs here in the United States of America. But instead we are going to create obscene profits for a few contractors, maybe do a little bit on the ground for the Iraqi people. But the bottom line is, we are borrowing money and ignoring the needs here.  Yes, I know more than anybody. My district, my State has the highest unemployment rate in the Union. My State has led the country for more than a year having the highest unemployment rate in the Union. We have a $4 billion highway bridge problem on the interstate highway system, and the President says there is no money to repair it. Well, there is $16 billion sitting in the highway trust fund. He would not even have to borrow it. He is borrowing money to invest in Iraq, but he will not even spend money we have paid in taxes here in the United States of America to invest in our highways.  He says we do not have money to invest in the airports. There is $4 billion in that fund. He says we do not have money for extended unemployment benefits. There is $16 billion in the unemployment trust fund paid by taxes of employers and workers, and the President will not draw it down.  We are paying hundreds of thousands of Iraqis for no-show jobs or for the fact that they used to be part of the military over there, but we do not have money to extend unemployment benefits in this country. There is something very wrong with the priorities of this picture.
