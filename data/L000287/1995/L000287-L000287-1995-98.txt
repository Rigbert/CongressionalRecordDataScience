Mr. Speaker, there is a new health care plan available to some members of the public, it is called Newtcare. Under this plan, you work for a Member of Congress for 1 month each year for just $100, in return you are entitled to the Government's generous health care benefits. Under Newtcare, you will likely save hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars on your health care costs.  But wait, this is not a dream or a fantasy, at least for a select few. Last week the Capitol Hill newspaper, Roll Call, reported that a fundraiser for Speaker Gingrich, Nancy Bocskor, has been put on the Government payroll for 1 month in 1991, 1992, and 1993, enabling her to participate in the Government employee health care plan.  Mr. Speaker, this practice may or may not violate the rules of the House. But it is wrong, just plain wrong. More importantly, this is but the latest example of the Speaker of this House pushing the rules to the limit and, perhaps, crossing the line.  There are many charges, serious charges, swirling around the Speaker of the House. Only an outside, independent counsel, can tell us for sure whether the Speaker has crossed the line. We need an outside counsel and we need one now.                          ____________________
