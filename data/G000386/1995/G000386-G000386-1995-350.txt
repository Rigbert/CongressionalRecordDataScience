 President, for the information, then, of all Senators, at 2 p.m. on Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of House Joint Resolution 1, and that is the balanced budget amendment. That is an amendment to the Constitution. For that day it will be debate only.  For the information of all of my colleagues, there will be no rollcall votes during Monday's session of the Senate.  I now ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that at the completion of the remarks of the distinguished minority leader, the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.
