She is an extraordinary public official. Too often the public does not see those who labor. They see the people at the front desk on the television from time to time, but there are so many others around this Chamber who are absolutely critical to the functioning of this organization, to the ensuring that we have the materials at our desks, the Congressional Record at our desks.  We recruit and appoint, from all over this country, young people to come here to learn about their democracy. I have, and others have, the opportunity to talk about our pages. But we put into the hands of a few people the stewardship of those pages and Lenny Donnelly is one of those people.  Mr. Speaker, you only need to talk to the pages to understand her vision for them, the affection with which she is held, and the respect with which she is held by so many of them.  We want to tell Lenny at this point in time, and there will be an opportunity over the next 24 hours to say some additional words, how very much all of us in this House appreciate the care and the commitment and contribution she has made to the functioning of this House.   Lenny has done an extraordinary service for her country and an extraordinary service for this House. She has befriended all of us who serve here with her and we thank her so much for that.
