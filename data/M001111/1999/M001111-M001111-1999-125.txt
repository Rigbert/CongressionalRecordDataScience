 President, I am very concerned about the provisions in this bill reorganizing the Department of Energy. In particular, I fear we are returning to the days of DOE ``self regulation'', which has historically translated into ``no regulation'' for environment, health and safety laws.  Senator Warner and I will enter into a colloquy later that I hope will clarify the intent of this legislation regarding provisions critical to the safety of our workers and communities. We are particularly concerned about the autonomy of the newly-created, largely independent ``National Nuclear Security Administration.'' We fear the creation of NNSA will recreate the institutional conditions that resulted in 50 years ofenvironmental, safety, and health mismanagement at DOE facilities--estimated to cost up to $200 billion to clean up. Hanford alone now receives appropriations of about $1 billion/year to clean up the legacy left from decades of the Atomic Energy Commission and/or Department of Energy self-regulation.  I am heartened by Senator Domenici's statements in the press that we have little to fear in this regard. He is quoted in USA Today (9/16/99) as saying: ``Nowhere does the legislation waive the application of environment or safety laws. What this legislation changes is not the statutory requirements, just the management structure responsible for complying with them.'' I will take him at his word that that is the intent. I ask unanimous consent to have the USA Today article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From USA Today, Sept. 16, 1999]Nuclear Security Scare Could Put Safety Second--Driven by Spy Scandal,   Legislation Would Take Weapons Sites Out of the Hands of Regulators                           [By Peter Eisler]       Washington.--U.S. nuclear weapons plants and labs,      notorious as toxic and radioactive polluters, could be left      outside the reach of environmental, health and safety      regulators under management changes Congress is pushing to      deal with security concerns.       Spurred by a spy scandal at the Los Alamos (N.M.) National      Laboratory that highlighted security problems at weapons      facilities nationwide, the House passed legislation Wednesday      to put eight of the Energy Department's plants and labs under      a new, semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security      Administration (NNSA). Senate approval is expected soon.       The plan aims to free the sites from a mammoth Energy      Department bureaucracy criticized for diluting protections      against spies, thieves and saboteurs.       But it also leaves the NNSA largely on its own to make sure      plants and labs meet environmental, health and worker safety      laws. Federal oversight programs set up in the late '80s to      address longtime contamination problems would lose virtually      all jurisdiction over the facilities. And the states, which      also have gained regulatory power over the weapons sites in      recent years, complain that they, too, could lose authority.       The plan is reviving debates that have burned since the      first atomic bombs rolled out of Los Alamos in 1945.       On one hand, recent reports that Chinese spies penetrated      key facilities to steal an array of U.S. nuclear secrets      highlight the program's need for secrecy and insularity. On      the other, the program has a record of poisoning workers and      communities with toxic and radioactive material when left on      its own.       ``For over four decades, (the nuclear weapons program)      operated with no external and little internal oversight of      environment, safety and health . . . (with) disastrous      consequences,'' says a recent letter to lawmakers from the      attorneys general of 45 states. ``We should not return to      (that) era.''       The National Governors' Association and former Energy      officials from the Clinton and Bush administrations also      oppose the reorganization plan. And Energy Secretary Bill      Richardson says he probably will urge a presidential veto.       But a veto would be politically and practically difficult,      in large part because the plan is folded into a bill      authorizing unrelated but popular defense programs, including      a military pay raise. President Clinton would have to reject      the entire bill, and aides concede that would be a tough      call.       ``The bottom line is we have a 20-year-old problem'' with      security at weapons plants and labs, says Rep. Mac      Thornberry, R-Texas, a chief backer of the reorganization      plan. Those problems, he says, lie in Energy Department      management that is ``cluttered up worrying about refrigerator      coolant standards'' and other missions--not about weapons      production and safeguarding secrets.       ``I don't think the Congress or the administration wants to      end this year without making some reforms,'' Thornberry says.                           changing missions       In the scramble to win the Cold War arms race, the U.S.      nuclear weapons program operated largely in secret, churning      out warheads with a doggedness that left little room for      environmental, health and safety concerns. With almost no      outside supervision, weapons facilities put workers in harm's      way without telling them and illegally dumped millions of      tons of toxic and radioactive waste on and around their      sites.       In communities from Richland, Wash., to Oak Ridge, Tenn.,      soil and groundwater contamination is widespread. Several      communities have sued the Energy Department, claiming health      problems.       Since the United States halted nuclear arms production in      1989, the focus at many sites has shifted to environmental      restoration. Even those facilities still doing weapons work--     refining the current nuclear arsenal and disassembling      weapons eliminated by global treaties--spend up to half their      money on cleanup. The work is expected to take decades and      cost up to $200 billion.       Beginning in the late '80s, environmental, health and      safety officials who oversee that work gained far more sway      over the plants and the labs. States, in particular, picked      up vast new powers in 1992, when Congress stripped weapons      sites' immunity from local regulation.       Now, the spy scandal that erupted this spring at Los Alamos      raises questions about whether weapons sites lost track of      security concerns amid their changing missions.       A congressional report in May suggested that China stole      information throughout the 1980s and perhaps into the early      '90s on every U.S. warhead. Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee      was pegged as a suspect and fired for alleged security      violations, though no criminal charges have been filed and he      denies wrongdoing.       The episode drew attention to security problems at weapons      facilities nationwide, leading to a damning investigation by      a presidential board.       ``Never before has this panel found such a cavalier      attitude toward one of the most serious responsibilities in      the federal government--control of the design information      related to nuclear weapons,'' the President's Foreign      Intelligence Advisory Board reported.       Throughout the '90s, senior management at the Energy      Department failed repeatedly to act on security officials'      reports that budget cuts and institutional inattention were      weakening safeguards at weapons sites.       Supporters of Congress' restructuring plan say the problem      is a lack of clear responsibility for facilities' security      and argue that the weapons sites must be put on their own,      for everything from security to environmental restoration, so      they're clearly accountable for all aspects of their      operation.       The plan puts the new weapons agency on its own with the      Energy Department, giving it autonomy in key areas:       All policy matters, including personnel, legal affairs and      budget decisions; security, intelligence and      counterintelligence operations; and environmental, health and      safety programs.       ``Nowhere does the legislation waive the application of      environment or safety laws,'' says Sen. Pete Domenici, R-NM.,      a chief sponsor. ``What this legislation changes is not the      statutory requirements, just the management structure      responsible for complying'' with them.                               bad omens       Opponents of the congressional plan note that weapons      plants and labs have been on their own before, and their      environmental, health and safety records were abysmal.       ``Production of nuclear weapons has always been their whole      role in life; everything else is secondary,'' says Leo Duffy,      assistant Energy secretary in the Bush administration.       ``All the environmental damage, the jeopardy to employees'      safety and health, almost none of this was identified until      1988,'' when outside regulators went in, says Duffy, who ran      those early oversight programs.       Duffy and other critics of Congress' plan suggest the      answer is to set up clearer responsibility for security      within the Energy Department. But they say oversight on      environmental, safety and health matters should remain      outside the purview of those running weapons programs. They      also want the legislation's language to more clearly retain      states' jurisdiction over the sites.       Proponents dismiss such concerns as unfounded. And they      note that many of the plants and labs with the worst records      on pollution and worker safety no longer do much weapons      work, so Congress' plans wouldn't necessarily change their      oversight.       Among them: the Hanford nuclear reservation in western      Washington, where poorly stored waste has fouled water      supplies; the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, where large      tracts of land suffer from radioactive contamination; and      uranium processing plants in Cincinnati and Paducah, Ky.,      where workers were unknowingly exposed to radioactivity.       But sites that would come under new management also have      their share of problems.       Just this month, for example, the Department of Energy's      office of environment, safety and health cited the Los Alamos      lab for two incidents in which workers were exposed to      radioactive material that wasn't stored or handled properly.      In 1998, the Lawrence Livermore lab was forced to shut down a      plutonium storage facility after repeated failures to follow      procedures meant to prevent an uncontrolled nuclear reaction.       Congress' plan to have those sites regulated by an agency      primarily devoted to weapons work ``would undermine over a      decade of progress to improve environment and safety      standards,'' Richardson says.       The reorganization would leave the Energy secretary with      power to fire the head of the weapons agency, but neither he      nor any other Energy officials would have direct control over      operations.       If the secretary suspected wrongdoing at a facility, he      could assign outside inspectors and order the agency director      to implement their recommendations. But if the director      refused, the secretary's only recourse would be to replace      him, a proposition that would require congressional consent      and could take months.       The Congressional Research Service, Congress' nonpartisan      research arm, reported     last week that such an arrangement ``may be problematic''      because it ``tends to make secretarial authority less      direct.''       Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who requested the study, wants      Congress to rework the plan.       Officials in the states also want changes, arguing that the      legislation's language could return weapons plants and labs      to the pre-1992 era when they were immune from state      environmental and safety laws.       The bill's proponents say it does no such thing, suggesting      that foes are nitpicking the plan simply because they don't      want to oppose it outright.       ``This is a chance to fix a serious (security) problem,''      says Thornberry, ``and I don't think turf disputes or      jurisdictional disputes should get in the way.''
