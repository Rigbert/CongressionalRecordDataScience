Speaker, on September 27, 1998, Cheltenham United Methodist Church will celebrate its 125th anniversary. This white-framed country church in Cheltenham, Maryland has been serving the religious and secular needs of its community since 1873 when its founders met under the chestnut trees that grew where the church now stands.  Although small in size, Cheltenham Church is very active and has a number of ministries that reach out to the local community and beyond. A few of their many activities include serving meals at the Hughesville Shelter for Battered Women, making 1000-plus sandwiches for the homeless for Martha's Table in Washington, D.C., contributing to the Upper Marlboro Food Bank, assisting patients at St. Elizabeth's Hospital at their Sunday church services, and sponsoring several needy families in the area.  Cheltenham Church is an excellent example of late 19th century rural church architecture. Among its other features, the original doorknob and chandeliers remain. The pulpit, still in use today, was made from a cherry tree that fell on church property before the church was built. The bricks for the foundation were hauled from nearby Nottingham by horse and wagon and had been used during the 18th century as ballast in English ships.  Although the church stands a short distance from a major highway, it retains much of its historic setting, buffered by its historic graveyard. It is a noticeable landmark in a still rural area of Prince George's County.  To the members of Cheltenham United Methodist Church, and to their members who have gone on before, we congratulate you on your 125 years of service to your church and to your community!                          ____________________
