 First of all, it is with great disappointment and regret that I note that Senate Republicans are willing to throw aside a 40-year tradition of honesty and openness in our Presidential elections by blocking the Presidential Tax Transparency Act.  With respect to their own proposal, I want to be clear on this point. The bill that I have authored, S. 2979, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act, affects all the candidates for President in an attempt to preserve the tradition of openness and accountability that is nolonger being honored. The proposal offered by my colleague from Texas, on behalf of Senate Republicans, responds with a bill targeted at one candidate, a proposal that all our true national security experts have said would harm America's security. The briefing of our Presidential candidates is not just for their benefit, it is for the benefit of the American people so we have a smooth, democratic transition of power without risk to our national security.  This attempt to hide the violation of a tradition of openness and accountability behind a political witch hunt ought to tell Americans all they need to know about Senate Republicans at this point. For that reason, I object.
