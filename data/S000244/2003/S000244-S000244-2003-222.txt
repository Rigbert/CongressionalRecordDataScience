Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, this is the amendment that has been the subject of much name-calling by the proponents of this bill. I ask the membership to look at the amendment. It strikes the carve-out that the authors of this bill put in to exempt horse racing, dog racing, State lotteries and other forms of gambling from the proposed regulations of this bill.  I believe that Internet gambling should be eliminated; but to have a carve-out for horses and dogs and lotteries and jai lai, and Lord knows what else, means that people will be able to use the Internet and use their credit cards to place bets and lose a lot of money.  No, if Internet gambling is addictive, we ought to close the loophole, because minors and others can lose just as much money on horses and dogs and lotteries and jai lai as they can lose on other forms of Internet gambling. I strongly urge support of this amendment. This is a loophole that is big enough to drive a truck through. By passing the amendment, we close the loophole.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
