President, I wish to honor P.J. Keeley, a great husband and father, a fine grandfather, and an outstanding golfer, on the eve of his 75th birthday.  It's appropriate that P.J. is turning 75 this year, having shot an impressive round of 75 on the links in March.  P.J. Keeley married Elizabeth L. Holten Keeley on February 3, 1951, and had 10 children by that union. In addition, P.J. has 24 grandchildren and one great grandchild.  After the death of his wife, Betty, P.J. married Virginia McKee Keeley on August 22, 1998.  P.J.'s passion is golf. In the course of his golfing career, P.J. Keeley won 16 championships at St. Clair Country Club in Belleville, IL. He won his first championship in 1958, at the age of 16, and his last championship in 1987 at the age of 58.  In addition to being an avid golfer, P.J. is an Army veteran who has honorably served his country.  P.J. Keeley served as president of Keeley & Sons, Inc., a well-known highway construction firm, for 23 years, from 1967 through 1989. Keeley & Sons was founded in 1947. In addition, P.J. was president of the Associated General Contractors of Illinois for two terms. Throughout my life, the name Keeley has been synonymous with construction in Southwestern Illinois.  I congratulate P.J. Keeley on the occasion of his 75th birthday and wish him many more years of happiness and accomplishment, both on and off the golf course.                          ____________________
