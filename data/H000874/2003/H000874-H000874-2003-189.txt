 Eve, I want to rise with my colleagues. I was here at 3 o'clock when David Dreier gave that short, but very heartfelt thanks to you. I did not join him at that point in time; I thought that at 3 a.m. you might want to go home. But I do want to rise at this point in time.  Mr. Speaker, the Members of the House, the House as an institution, and this country are all blessed by having some extraordinarily dedicated, extraordinarily able people serving this body. Other than our terrific reading clerks, few of them get on camera, at least in terms of being identified. But without them, this House would not run nearly as well as it does. And to the extent that it does not run well, it is not for any lack of ability or dedication on their part but because the Members sometimes get out of hand.  But the staff that serves this House of Representatives, the people's House, is an extraordinary one. Each time we lose one of them by retirement or for any other reason, we are a lesser place. We will be a lesser place for some period of time because one cannot replace the 20 years of experience that Eve takes with her. But she takes with her the thanks and gratitude of all of us who are Members of this body. Whether brought in by the majority or the minority, Democrats or Republicans, matters not to any of our desk personnel or our Parliamentarian or our timekeepers or whatever their particular designation. They serve us well and they serve this country well.  Eve, I wish you and Tom the very best. You are still a very young person and you will have many years to enjoy service to church, service to God, but I know that you will continue in many ways to serve your country. I know you will take with you the deep affection and respect for this institution that you have served so well. Godspeed.                          ____________________
