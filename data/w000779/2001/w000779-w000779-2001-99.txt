 First, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. If there is one change that the Democratic Party has tried to transmit over the last decade, it has been the question of emphasizing fiscal responsibility. I want to make it clear to the Senator from North Dakota how appreciative I am that he has pounded away again and again in the committee and on this floor how important it is to reduce the national debt.  In my view, that is the single most important message the Democrats have tried to communicate over the last decade. I am so pleased he has emphasized it again today.  I will speak briefly on this question of prescription drugs because in the last year I have come to the floor of this Senate more than 25 times to talk about the need for a bipartisan initiative in this area.
