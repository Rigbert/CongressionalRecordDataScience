Mr. Chairman, reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to object, but I would like to point out to the gentleman from Missouri, who is one of the House's leading experts in the field of national defense and our national security, that the subcommittee spent a lot of time reviewing this entire matter. I would like to call to the attention of our colleagues the fact that the bill before us has seven pages of restrictions and direction as to the proper relationship between the President and the Congress on the issue of deployments for peacekeeping or whatever other purpose.  I appreciate the gentleman withdrawing his amendment, because actually the language in this bill is really very good and has been very well thought out.  Mr. Chairman, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
