President, I assume one of the votes that we will have today will be the continuing resolution. The fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations conference report has been attached in its entirety to this continuing resolution. That means that foreign aid programs will be funded through the fiscal year at the levels agreed to by the House and Senate conferees.  The conference report represents a devastating assault on many foreign operations programs that are vital United States interests abroad. For that the House Republican leadership bears primary responsibility. But our alternative, a year long continuing resolution, would be far worse. It would cause irreparable harm to these programs and many of the Federal employees who implement them would have to be laid off. For that reason it is essential that this conference report be enacted into law.  The conference report funds a wide range of activities that are strongly supported by both Democrats and Republicans. Although I believe the funding provided for many programs falls far short of what is required to effectively combat global threats to the American people--whether it is environmental pollution, the spread of infectious disease, unchecked population growth, political and economic instability caused by enormous numbers of people living in abject poverty, the growing problem of international crime and terrorism, and the proliferation of nuclear and conventional weapons, it is better than no funds at all.  On a more positive note, it also contains a provision of special importance to me, which was passed by two-thirds of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, to impose a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines.  Since the NATO operation began in Bosnia just a little over a month ago, over 20 NATO soldiers have been injured or killed by landmines, including 1 American. That is in addition to the 225 UNPROFOR landmine casualties in Bosnia, and the thousands of civilian landmine victims, since the war began 4 years ago. Of the estimated 100 million unexploded landmines in the world, 6 million are in the former Yugoslavia. Landmines are killing and maiming an average of one person every 22 minutes, every day of the year.  My amendment aims to put the United States in the forefront of the effort against these inhumane weapons. It follows by just 1 week the announcement by the Canadian Government that it will unilaterally halt all production, use and export of antipersonnel landmines. In just the past year, Belgium, France, Austria, Switzerland and the Philippines have taken similar steps.  It follows by just 2 weeks the announcement in Geneva that 22 nations have called for an immediate total ban on these weapons.  Mr. President, this amendment represents a dramatic shift in the policy of the U.S. Government, from one which has lagged behind several of our NATO allies to one which aims to exert U.S. leadership to build international support for ridding the world of these inhumane weapons.  That is the goal President Clinton announced at the United Nations over a year ago. This amendment sets the stage for making that goal a reality. Once this provision is signed into law, the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon bureaucracy, the Secretary of State, and our U.N. Ambassador should all speak forcefully and with one voice. The message should be that antipersonnel landmines are unacceptable. They are indiscriminate, inhumane, impossible to control, and the United States is going to stop using them and do whatever we can to convince other governments to join with us in making their use a war crime.  Mr. President, the one amendment in disagreement in the Foreign Operations conference report which deals with international family planning has also been resolved, but I want to be sure Senators understand what the House has done. Essentially, the House has presented us with a fait accompli. The choice is either take their offer on the amendment in disagreement, with no opportunity to amend it, or the entire Foreign Operations budget, with none of the policy language, will be governed by a continuing resolution.  I know that the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Hatfield, is as frustrated about this as I am. I certainly intend to do whatever I can to resist these heavy handed tactics in the future. But given the choice, we have no alternative. A year long CR at either the House level or 75 percent of fiscal year 1995 levels would be far worse for many important programs.  Our conference report categorically prohibits the use of any funds for abortion. Yet the House, at the behest of the right-to-life lobby, would cut $88 million from programs that have only one purpose--to give couples the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies and reduce the incidence of abortion. Why anyone would want to do that is beyond me, but that is what the House has done. Anyone who wants to see fewer abortions, and fewer women die from botched abortions, should deplore this action.  The provision in this CR would prohibit the obligation of any family planning funds--funds to purchase and distribute contraceptives, to provide technical assistance for improving the quality and safety of contraceptives, to educate couples about birth spacing--none of these funds could be spent before July 1 unless they are specifically authorized.  If there is no authorization bill by that date, and I have yet to meet anyone who thinks there will be, only 65 percent of the fiscal year 1995 level for family planning could be obligated, and then only in monthly installments. The net effect of this will be an $88 million cut in family planning assistance.  That is the pound of flesh the right-to-life lobby will have won, if it does not succeed in its goal of reinstating the Mexico City policy--a policy that has been ridiculed around the world, repeatedly rejected by the Senate, is opposed by a majority of Americans, and which the President has said he would veto.  I am very pleased that we successfully resisted attempts to reinstate the discredited Mexico City policy. I will continue to oppose any effort to do that. But I will vote for this continuing resolution only with great reluctance, because of the harm it will do to family planning.  If I thought there was any way to amend this provision without jeopardizing the entire conference report, I would not hesitate because I know a majority of the Senate would support me. Indeed, a majority of the House would too--although perhaps not a majority of House Republicans--but the House Republican leadership would never have the courage to put it to a vote.  Mr. President, the United States has been a leader in the effort to stabilize the world's exploding rate of population growth. Tens of millions of people are born into abject poverty every year, but today we are cutting programs to give couples the means to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Anyone with an ounce of brains can see that the logical result will be more abortions, not less. That is what the right-to-life lobby, and their defenders in the House have accomplished.  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator McConnell, for his efforts to get this conference report enacted. I also want to pay special tribute to Senator Hatfield, who has been a strong supporter of funding for family planning assistance and who played a central role in the negotiations with the House over the past few days.
