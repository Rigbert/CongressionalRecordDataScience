But I am concerned we might be missing an integral component to this secure system. We have outlined parameters for information security, privacy and authentication. But, how can we truly ensure someone is who he/she says they are before we give them these high-tech credentials? We have gone to great lengths to ensure the security of these counterfeit-proof credentials, but we need to also account for the validity of the information used to establish identity in the first place. What happens if we give someone a secure document with a biometric under a false name?
