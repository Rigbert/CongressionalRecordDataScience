Speaker, it is truly my distinct honor to congratulate one of Northwest Indiana's hidden treasures: Carolyn Moore, of Munster, Indiana. The Owner and President of Laughing Cat Productions, Carol's work, ``Citizens Financial Services History,'' has been recognized with a Telly Finalist Award. Since 1986, when she founded Laughing Cat Productions, Carol has been serving businesses, schools, and individuals who wish to have a video produced. Winning a Telly Award is a significant honor, and raises Carol to the top of her field, not only in Northwest Indiana, but across the entire United States. The Telly Awards are a national competition for people and companies who create videos, commercials, and films; Carol earned a Finalist Award in the category of corporate image. The Telly Awards Organization was founded in 1980 to showcase and offer recognition to outstanding non-network and cable television commercials. Past winners include the Ford Motor Company, the American Medical Society, and Pepsi. Carol's Award and Recognition places her among the best in the advertising business.  When I think of Carol, however, the first image which comes to my mind is not her successful professional career, but her extraordinary community activism. Whenever a project has needed a leader or an issue has needed to be addressed, Carol has stepped forward to accept the challenge. I cannot emphasize how much her involvement in the community means to me, and to our region. Well before her career in advertising and production, Carol served our community as one of its most dedicated and successful activists. Beginning in 1978, she helped lead Northwest Indiana's endeavor to create a local television station. Her vision was realized in 1985, with a federal grant of one million dollars for a local television station from the Development of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Today, the residents of Northwest Indiana enjoy the fruit of Carol's labors: WYIN Channel 56, the region's only local broadcast station. Carol's community activism did not stop in 1985, however. For over a decade, she has worked with the Northwest Indiana Literacy Coalition, and today serves as a member of the Board of Directors. She is a member of both the Munster and Gary Chambers of Commerce, serves as the President of the Communicators of Northwest Indiana, and is currently the Vice President of Marketing for the Northwest Indiana World Trade Council.  Though Carol is dedicated to her career and community, she has never limited her time and love for her family. Longtime residents of Munster, Carol and her husband Dave have raised three children; Jillian, 27; Douglas, 23; and Owen, 21. Outside of her work and volunteer service, Carol enjoys spending her time reading, sailing, and golfing. She plans to continue her work as President of Laughing Cat Productions, and hopes to slowly expand the company. In addition, she intends to maintain her high levels of community service and involvement in the local media.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Carolyn Moore for her truly well-earned honor, and, though often unrecognized, for her exemplary efforts to improve our region. Carol's community activism and desire to improve our community is commendable and praiseworthy. Whether through advancing the public's literacy awareness, championing the cause of local and public television in Northwest Indiana, or pursuing the economic re-vitalization of Northwest Indiana, Carol's actions have left an indelible mark on Indiana's First Congressional District. We are indeed fortunate to have such a dedicated and self-sacrificing citizen.                          ____________________
