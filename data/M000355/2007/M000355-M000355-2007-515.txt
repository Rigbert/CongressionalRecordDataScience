 President, let me say to my good friend, the majority leader, that I will be checking at noon to see if we can avoid the motion to proceed to the budget, but I have not been able to get that cleared yet. I hope that I will be able to.  I would also remind everyone, as the majority leader and I indicated yesterday, budget week is always challenging, with lots of votes and evening sessions. So I would encourage Members on our side, if they have amendments, to offer them early in the week to avoid having them caught up in the vote-arama which will occur, regretfully, at the end of the process.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
