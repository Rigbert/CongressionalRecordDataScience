 President, not to continue to debate much further, but I would point out that there are demands for amendments on both sides here. We are very close to getting an agreement. I think a ``no'' vote on cloture is not the end of this bill but the beginning. It gives us an opportunity to go on and wrap up discussions that have been going on entirely too long, it seems to me, and I know the majority leader has been frustrated by it, and so have I. But we are very close to getting agreement on a list of amendments, and we should be able to finish this bill by the end of the week.
