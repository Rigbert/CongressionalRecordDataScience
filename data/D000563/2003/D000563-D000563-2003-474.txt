KENNEDY. If I may just add, as the Senator remembers--I hope the American people do--we had weeks of debate on the floor on the Patients' Bill of Rights. As the Senator remembers, what underlined that whole debate was that we ought to put the well-being and the health care interests of the patients of this country ahead of the bottom line of the HMOs. This was a debate in which the American people really participated. It was sidetracked because the administration refused to allow States to make the ultimate decision about compensation for individuals. That was in the final compromise which this administration refused.  So for all those who want to talk about States rights issues on this and the States know best--all those who make that argument--they somehow miss the importance of the real protections for people.
