 President, if I may respond, I will try to truncate my remarks to the distinguished Senator.  This is a major interest of mine. I believe I have some things to say about the resolution, the situation in general, which have some merit. There is no time agreement at the present time, and I have been waiting.  I would like to make my remarks in their entirety.               Division I Of amendment 2737, as modified
