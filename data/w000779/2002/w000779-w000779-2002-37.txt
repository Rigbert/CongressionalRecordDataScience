President, today I am introducing the 21st Century Nanotechnology Act. This bill would authorize a coordinated interagency program that will support long-term nanoscale research and development leading to potential breakthroughs in areas such as materials and manufacturing, nanoelectronics, medicine and healthcare, environment, energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, information technology, and national and homeland security. Building on the National Nanotechnology Initiative, the bill would authorize appropriations for research throughout the government while providing tools for better cross-agency management and coordination  Nanotechnology is the science and technology of building electronic circuits and devices from single atoms and molecules on a scale of one one-billionth of a meter. It will one day change the way Americans live.  I am convinced that this so-called ``small science'' is the next big thing'' in technology. The world is on the cusp of a nanotechnology revolution that will change our lives on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer revolution. The United States could miss that revolution if our nanotechnology work remains uncoordinated and scattered across a half-dozen Federal agencies. That would be tragic on several levels, from scientific to social to economic.  I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology. To do this, I want America to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader in this burgeoning field. And I believe Federal support is essential to achieving that goal.  The legislation I am pleased to be introducing today with Senator Lieberman will provide a smart, accelerated, and coordinated approach to nanotechnology research, development, and education. In my view, there are three major steps America must take to ensure the highest success for its nanotechnology efforts.  First, a National Nanotechnology Research Program should be established to coordinate long-term fundamental nanoscience and engineering research. The program's goals will be to ensure America's leadership and economic competitiveness in nanotechnology, and to make sure ethical and social concerns are taken into account alongside the development of this discipline.  Second, the Federal Government should support nanoscience through a program of research grants, and also through the establishment of nanotechnology research centers. These centers would serve as key components of a national research infrastructure, bringing together experts from the various disciplines that must intersect for nanoscale projects to succeed. As these research efforts take shape, educational opportunities will be the key to their long-term success. As chairman of the Commerce Committee's Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee, I have already laid out a challenge to triple the number of people graduating with math, science and technology degrees. Today, I commit to helping students who would enter the field of nanotechnology. This discipline requires multiple areas of expertise. Students with the drive and the talent to tackle physics, chemistry, and the material sciences simultaneously deserve all the support we can offer.  Third, the government should create connections across its agencies to aid in the coordination of nanotechnology efforts. These could include a national coordination office, and a Presidential Nanotechnology Advisory Committee, modeled on the President's Information Technology Advisory Committee.  I also believe that at these organizational support structures are put into place, rigorous evaluation must take place to ensure the maximum efficiency of our efforts. The bill would call for an annual review of America's nanotechnology efforts from the Presidential Advisory Committee, and a periodic review from the National Academy of Sciences. In addition to monitoring our own progress, the U.S. should keep abreast of the world's nanotechnology efforts through a series of benchmarking studies.  If the Federal Government fails to get behind nanotechnology now with organized, goal-oriented support, this nation runs the risk of falling behind others in the world who recognize thepotential of this discipline. Nanotechnology is already making pants more stain-resistant, making windows self-washing and making car parts stronger with tiny particles of clay. What America risks missing is the next generation of nanotechnology. In the next wave, nanoparticles and nanodevices will become the building blocks of our health care, agriculture, manufacturing, environmental cleanup, and even national security.  America risks missing a revolution in electronics, where a device the size of a sugar cube could hold all of the information in the Library of Congress. Today's silicon-based technologies can only shrink so small. Eventually, nanotechnologies will grow devices from the molecular level up. Small though they may be, their capabilities and their impact will be enormous. Spacecraft could be the size of mere molecules.  America risks missing a revolution in health care. In my home State, Oregon State University researchers are working on the microscale to create lapel-pin-sized biosensors that use the color-changing cells of the Siamese fighting fish to provide instant visual warnings when a biotoxin is present. An antimicrobial dressing for battlefield wounds is already available today, containing silver nanocrystals that prevent infection and reduce inflammation. The health care possibilities for nanotechnology are limitless. Eventually, nanoscale particles will travel through human bodies to detect and cure disease. Chemotherapy could attack individual cancer cells and leave healthy cells intact. Tiny bulldozers could unclog blocked arteries. Human disease will be fought cell by cell, molecule by molecule, and nanotechnology will provide victories over disease that we can't even conceive today.  America risks missing a host of beneficial breakthroughs. American scientists could be the first to create nanomaterials for manufacturing and design that are stronger, lighter, harder, self-repairing, and safest. Nanoscale devices could scrub automobile pollution out of the air as it is produced. Nanoparticles could cover armor to make American soldiers almost invisible to enemies and even tend their wounds. Nanotechnology could grow steel stronger than what's made today, with little or no waste to pollute the environment.  Moreover--and this is key--America risks missing an economic revolution based on nanotechnology. With much of nanotechnology existing in a research milieu, venture capitalists are already investing $1 billion in American nanotech interests this year alone. It's estimated that nanotechnology will become a trillion-dollar industry over the next ten years. As nanotechnology grows, the ranks of skilled workers needed to discover and apply its capabilities must grow too. In the nanotechnology revolution, areas of high unemployment could become magnets for domestic production, engineering and research for nanotechnology applications--but only if government doesn't miss the boat.  The Federal Government is already making some efforts with regard to nanotechnology. The U.S. does have a National Nanotechnology Initiative. This nation has already committed substantial funds to nanotechnology research and development in the coming years. But here's my bottom line. It is essential to build on this foundation of funding with a framework for sound science over the long term. That is the reason for the legislation I am issuing today. On the framework it provides, of national coordination and strategic planning, scientists will be able to meet the grand challenges of nanotechnology. Over the long term, with Federal support, they will be able to plumb the depths of its capability, and scale the heights of its potential.  In 1944 the visionary President Franklin Delano Roosevelt requested a leading American scientist's opinion on advancing the United States' scientific efforts to benefit the world. Dr. Vannevar Bush offered his reply to President Harry S Truman the next year, following FDR's death. In his report to the President, Dr. Bush wrote, ``The Government should accept new responsibilities for promoting the flow of new scientific knowledge and the development of scientific talent in our youth. These responsibilities are the proper concern of the Government, for they vitally affect our health, our jobs, and our national security. It is in keeping also with basic United States policy that the Government should foster the opening of new frontiers and this is the modern way to do it.''  Those principles, so true nearly sixty years ago, are truer still today. With the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, I propose that the government now accept new responsibilities in promoting and developing nanotechnology. I hope that the Senate can act swiftly on this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2945       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Nanotechnology      Research and Development Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering      (collectively, ``nanotechnology''), in which matter is      manipulated at the atomic level (i.e., atom-by- atom or      molecule-by-molecule) in order to build materials, machines,      and devices with novel properties or functions, are leading      to unprecedented scientific and technological opportunities      that will benefit society by changing the way many things are      designed and made.       (2) Long-term nanoscale research and development leading to      potential breakthroughs in areas such as materials and      manufacturing, electronics, medicine and healthcare,      environment, energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture,      information technology, and national security could be as      significant as the combined influences of microelectronics,      biotechnology, and information technology on the 20th      century. Nanotechnology could lead to things such as--       (A) new generations of electronics where the entire      collection of the Library of Congress is stored on devices      the size of a sugar cube;       (B) manufacturing that requires less material, pollutes      less, and is embedded with sophisticated sensors that will      internally detect signs of weakness and automatically respond      by releasing chemicals that will prevent damage;       (C) prosthetic and medical implants whose surfaces are      molecularly designed to interact with the cells of the body;       (D) materials with an unprecedented combination of      strength, toughness, and lightness that will enable land,      sea, air, and space vehicles to become lighter and more fuel      efficient;       (E) selective membranes that can fish out specific toxic or      valuable particles from industrial waste or that can      inexpensively desalinate sea water; and       (F) tiny robotic spacecraft that will cost less, consume      very little power, adapt to unexpected environments, change      its capabilities as needed, and be completely autonomous.       (3) Long-term, high-risk research is necessary to create      breakthroughs in technology. Such research requires      government funding since the benefits are too distant or      uncertain for industry alone to support. Current Federal      investments in nanotechnology research and development are      not grounded in any specifically authorized statutory      foundation. As a result, there is a risk that future funding      for long-term, innovative research will be tentative and      subject to instability which could threaten to hinder future      Untied States technological and economic growth.       (4) The Federal government can play an important role in      the development of nanotechnology, as this science is still      in its infancy, and it will take many years of sustained      investment for this field to achieve maturity.       (5) Many foreign countries, companies and scientists      believe that nanotechnology will be the leading technology of      the 21st century and are investing heavily into its research.      According to a study of international nanotechnology research      efforts sponsored by the National Science and Technology      Council, the United States is at risk of falling behind its      international competitors, including Japan, South Korea, and      Europe if it fails to sustain broad based funding in      nanotechnology. The United States cannot afford to fall      behind our competitors if we want to maintain our economic      strength.       (6) Advances in nanotechnology stemming from Federal      investments in fundamental research and subsequent private      sector development likely will create technologies that      support the work and improve the efficiency of the Federal      government, and contribute significantly to the efforts of      the government's mission agencies.       (7) According to various estimates, including those of the      National Science Foundation, the market for nanotech products      and services in the United States alone could reach over $1      trillion later this century.       (8) Nanotechnology will evolve from modern advances in      chemical, physical, biological, engineering, medical, and      materials research, and will contribute to cross-disciplinary      training of the 21st century science and technology      workforce.       (9) Mastering nanotechnology will require a unique skill      set for scientists and engineers that combine chemistry,      physics, material science, and information science. Funding      in these critical areas has been flat for many years and as a      result fewer young people are electing to go into these areas      in graduate schools throughout the United States. This will      have to reverse if we hope to develop the next generation of      skilled workers with multi-disciplinary perspectives      necessary for the development of nanotechnology.       (10) Research on nanotechnology creates unprecedented      capabilities to alter ourselves and our environment and will      give rise to a host of novel social, ethical, philosophical,      and legal issues. To appropriately address these issues will      require wide reflection and guidance that are responsive to      the realities of the science, as well as additional research      to predict, understand, and alleviate anticipated problems.       (11) Nanotechnology will provide structures to enable the      revolutionary concept of quantum computing, which uses      quantum mechanical properties to do calculation. Quantum      computing permits a small number of atoms to potentially      store and process enormous amounts of information. Just 300      interacting atoms in a quantum computer could store as much      information as a classical electronic computer that uses all      the particles in the universe, and today's complex encryption      algorithms, which would take today's best super computer 20      billion years, could be cracked in 30 minutes.       (12) The Executive Branch has previously established a      National Nanotechnology Initiative to coordinate Federal      nanotechnology research and development programs. This      initiative has contributed significantly to the development      of nanotechnology. Authorizing legislation can serve to      establish new technology goals and research directions,      improve agency coordination and oversight mechanisms, help      ensure optimal returns to investment, and simplify reporting,      budgeting, and planning processes for the Executive Branch      and the Congress.       (13) The the private sector technology innovations that      grow from fundamental nanotechnology research are dependent      on a haphazard, expensive, and generally inefficient      technology transition path. Strategies for accelerating the      transition of fundamental knowledge and innovations in      commercial products or to support mission agencies should be      explored, developed, and when appropriate, executed.       (14) Existing data on the societal, ethical, educational,      legal, and workforce implications and issues related to      nanotechnology are lacking. To help decision-makers and      affected parties better anticipate issues likely to arise      with the onset and maturation of nanotechnology, research and      studies on these issues must be conducted and disseminated.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       It is the purpose of this Act to authorize a coordinated      inter-agency program that will support long-term nanoscale      research and development leading to potential breakthroughs      in areas such as materials and manufacturing,      nanoelectronics, medicine and healthcare, environment,      energy, chemicals, biotechnology, agriculture, information      technology, and national and homeland security.
