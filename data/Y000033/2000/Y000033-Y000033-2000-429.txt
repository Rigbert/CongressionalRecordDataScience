Mr. Chairman, that is my interpretation. I believe that is the way it was presented. And, again, I would like to suggest that this is the only bill that this amendment would apply to. And, of course, this is the only bill before us today.  But if we were going to do as the gentleman wishes to do, then we should apply that to everything. I happen to think, by the way, and I happen to think very frankly one thing we have to keep in mind, if we were to take a poll of all of our senior citizens, I think that we will find that they support this overwhelmingly. They are the ones that use the parks. They are the ones that go to the refuges. They are the ones that are worried about the redwoods, and they are the ones, frankly, worried about the endangered species.  So keep in mind, although the gentleman says that we are going to spend the money away from Social Security or divert it away, remember the intention of the original act, the Land and Water Conservation Act. The Congress owes the American people $13 billion which we have not used correctly, that the law said we should use. That is my concern.
