 President, this week our friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Tennessee, will mark a major milestone in his State's history.  As of tomorrow, Lamar Alexander will have served as Tennessee's Governor or U.S. Senator for 24 years, 8 months, and 15 days--more combined years and offices than any other Tennessean.  Of course, Senator Alexander also remains the only Tennessee Governor ever popularly elected to the Senate. He is the only Tennessee Republican to be undefeated in six statewide primary elections. And his 2008 general election vote total of 1,579,477 votes is still the largest ever recorded by a Tennessee statewide candidate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the Tennessee secretary of state, Tre Hargett, who has calculated each of these political accomplishments, be printed in the Record following my remarks.  As impressive as these statistics are, all of Lamar Alexander's colleagues know that political record-setting is not what makes him tick. Here is something he likes to say about serving in the Senate:       It's hard to get here. It's hard to stay here. So while      you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something.  Well, he certainly lived out his own advice. During Senator Alexander's very first term, he got 70 Senators to support his bipartisan America COMPETES Act to help our country stay competitive with the rest of the world. He even persuaded the Democratic and Republican leaders to join forces as the principal sponsors. When it was enacted in 2007, everyone knew who the chief engineer had been.  Senator Dan Inouye said at the time:       I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Alexander, for his      broad and very intricate history of bipartisanship. If all of      us in this body follow this process in all major legislation,      this would be a historic session. . . . I thank the Senator      from Tennessee very much.  That was Senator Dan Inouye from Hawaii.  Then in 2012, after being elected three times by his peers as chairman of the Republican conference, Lamar did something that is not often done around here: He gave up that power and his future ambitions for elected Senate leadership in order to ``spend more time working to achieve results on the issues I care the most about.''  Since then, not coincidentally, there have been a steady stream of important new laws dealing with those very issues. Time after time, Lamar has taken the lead, often as the principal sponsor or chief engineer. He has worked behind the scenes. He has collaborated across the aisle to get things done. He hasn't often stepped into the spotlight himself, but he has almost always been the key driving force.  As chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, he worked with Senator Patty Murray to fix No Child Left Behind. President Obama called it ``a Christmas miracle,'' and the Wall Street Journal said it was the greatest devolution of power to States in a quarter-century. The Nation's Governors and the National Education Association recognized Lamar with awards. We are dealing with a rare public servant who can literally win plaudits from the Wall Street Journal editorial board and the Nation's largest teachers union at the same time.  In 2013, Senator Alexander was one of a group of Senators who revamped Federal student loans with a new market-based interest rate to save hundreds of millions of dollars for students attending college.  In 2016, he and Senator Murray sponsored the 21st Century Cures Act. It is landmark legislation that I was proud to be involved with and view as the most significant law of that entire Congress.  In 2018, again with Senator Murray, he offered the landmark Opioid Crisis Response Act. President Trump called it ``the single largest bill to combat a drug crisis in the history of our country.''  Last year, working with Senator Hatch, he was the chief engineer of once-in-a-generation legislation to ensure America's songwriters are paid fair-market value for their work.  For the last 5 years, as chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, he has worked with Ranking Member Feinstein to deliver record funding for our National Laboratories, funding to keep America No. 1 in supercomputing, and 6 years of full funding for inland waterway infrastructure.  This is quite a distinguished record, and this is far from all of it.  I have heard that Senator Alexander explains to Tennesseans that they can think of Congress like a split-screen television show. On one side are the dramatic public fights, the partisan showdowns, but on the other side, he explains, you see huge bipartisan majorities working diligently on issues that directly affect the daily lives of millions of Americans. Well, that side of the screen is where you will find Senator Alexander. In fact, he is a star player.  Senator Alexander has announced he won't seek a fourth term in 2020. While the end of his time here may be in sight, I am confident the catalog of his hard work and leadership is nowhere near complete just yet. As chairman of HELP, he and Senator Murray have reported the Lower Healthcare Costs Act to the full Senate. They are working together to reauthorize and update the Higher Education Act. He and Senator Feinstein have produced an appropriations bill--passed by the Appropriations Committee--that would provide a fifth year of record funding for the National Laboratories, a sixth year of full funding for our inland waterway infrastructure, and the resources to keep America No. 1 in supercomputing. And there is almost certainly more to come over the next year and a half. Lamar's service reminds us that there are many ways to be a transformational leader in this body.  As a young man, I was an intern for Senator John Sherman Cooper of Kentucky. He was never an elected leader but was always regarded by his colleagues as a leader because of his willingness to do what he thought ought to be done. Senator Cooper once said to me:       I not only represent Kentucky, I represent the Nation, and      there are times you follow, and times when you lead.  In fact, two of the three Senate office buildings are named for Senators who were never elected the leader of their party's caucus. Lamar Alexander is just that kind of leader.  We are proud to celebrate this milestone as Senator Alexander notches more combined years as Senator and Governor than anyone else from his State, but even more, we recognize the example the Senator has set for all the rest of us. It is just like he says:       It's hard to get here. It's hard to stay here. So while      you're here, you might as well try to accomplish something.  Congratulations, my friend.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 17, 2019.     Hon. Lamar Alexander,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Alexander: I am writing to congratulate you on      your record years of     service to Tennessee. On September 19, 2019, you will have      served more combined years as either Governor or United      States Senator from Tennessee than any other Tennessean. This      is a milestone that illustrates your dedication to public      service and to Tennesseans.       September 19, 2019, marks your 9,024th day in office as      either Tennessee Governor or U.S. Senator from Tennessee.      Your 24 years, 8 months, and 15 days of service will then      surpass the previous longest serving Governor and United      State Senator from Tennessee, Isham Harris.       This is just one of your many elections records in the      state. You are the only Tennessee Governor ever popularly      elected to the United States Senate. You have won more      Tennessee Republican statewide primary elections--six--than      any other Tennessean. And your 2008 general election vote      total--1,579,477 votes--is the largest vote total ever      recorded by a Tennessee statewide candidate.       I congratulate you on this, and your many other, great      accomplishments and I thank you for your service to our great      state.           Sincerely,                                                      Tre Hargett,                                               Secretary of State.
