Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon for yielding me this time. I want to thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen) for bringing this legislation along with the gentleman from Oregon before us.  It is fitting and appropriate that a plaque be placed near the statue of Lincoln near the Lincoln Memorial in honor of the speech ``I Have A Dream'' by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That speech was delivered on August 28, 1963, on a very hot summer day.  On that day, Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke from his soul. He spoke from his heart. He said, ``I have a dream that is deeply rooted in an American dream.'' I was there that day, 23 years old. When Martin Luther King, Jr., stood to speak, he was not just speaking for himself, he was speaking for all Americans, not just for those of us 36 years ago now, but he was speaking for ongoing generations.  So this plaque, ``I Have A Dream'' plaque, would inspire generations yet unborn, inspire young children, would help make us one Nation, one people, one family, the American family, the American community.  It is my hope that all of our colleagues would join in together and support this little piece of legislation, that it would serve as a footnote, but more than a footnote, it would serve as a page in the history of our long struggle toward creating a sense of community, the beloved community.  Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank these two wonderful men for bringing this legislation before us today.
