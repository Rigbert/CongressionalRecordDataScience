The way we have worked together is remarkable. The Senator has brought in Bonnie to do the work she has done. I know she wanted to be here as we are voting on this bill, but it got down to do we want to get it done tonight or do we want to take a chance for later.  Dimitri Karakitsos, all these were working. Jonathan Black with Senator Udall's office has been great, and Andrew Wallace so ably represented Senator Udall in those negotiations. I thank Michal Freedhoff in Senator Markey's office for the hours of work he poured into this bill. I also thank Adrian Deveny with Senator Merkley for his work in these negotiations and Adam Zipkin representing SenatorBooker. A special thanks goes to Bill Ghent and Emily Spain with Senator Carper. Senator Carper has not been mentioned much tonight, but he has been very active in getting this done. Emily Enderle with Senator Whitehouse. Senators Carper, Whitehouse, Merkley, and Booker have been partners in getting this completed. Finally, I appreciate, as I have said many times before, Senator Boxer and her team, Bettina Poirier and Jason Albritton, for working with us in support of this bill. We have done not just this bill but a lot of bills in the committee, and these same characters keep coming up. So it is the staff who has driven this thing. I have to say, my chief of staff, the one most prominent on the committee, obviously did so much of the work on this. So, Ryan Jackson, you did a great job.  With that, I yield the floor.
