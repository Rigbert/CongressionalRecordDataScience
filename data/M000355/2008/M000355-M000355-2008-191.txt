 President, the Senate came back into session 4 days ago and we have yet to address the No. 1 issue in the country; that is, high gas prices. There were 44 Senate Republicans who introduced legislation over 2 weeks ago which would have an immediate impact on the price at the pump.  The Gas Price Reduction Act can be summed up in four simple words: Find more, use less. The Gas Price Reduction Act focuses on simple solutions which already have support from many of our friends on the other side of the aisle.  Many of our colleagues, Democratic colleagues, have now acknowledged the merits of allowing States to open the Outer Continental Shelf for deep sea oil and gas exploration. Our bill was limited to only those States that want to do that. It gives a State option for the opportunity to go onto the Outer Continental Shelf for deep sea oil and gas exploration. We all agree we can do more in encouraging the development of alternative energy sources, which is why the Gas Price Reduction Act contains incentives to develop plug-in electric cars and trucks and new battery technology.  In addition, we included measures to strengthen the U.S. futures markets by increasing funding and staff for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and examining foreign markets. These ideas also have support from many on the other side of the aisle.  By focusing on the areas where we agree, instead of the ones where we differ, we can achieve results for the American people. I ask my good friends on the other side of the aisle to join us in finding energy policies we can agree on. Believe me, the American people are demanding it. We can pass meaningful legislation which would develop more American energy while encouraging conservation, and we need to do that very soon.                          ____________________
