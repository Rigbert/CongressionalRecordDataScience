  The amendment is similar to a bill that passed out of the Finance Committee last July. The bill providing health care to low-income pregnant women was never enacted in the 107th Congress. I support caring for low-income mothers and their unborn children. It is sound health policy.  It is a new Congress, and unfortunately, I can't support this amendment. This policy has not been properly debated in the 108th Congress.  Policies that alter our Nation's safety net programs deserve the Senate's proper attention. We must address policy changes to the safety net through regular order. By accepting this amendment, we are not allowing for this process to work.  Earlier this year, I worked with Senator Nickles, Senator Snowe and others to setup a process to address the need to redistribute unspent S-CHIP funds. Together we have set up a solid process to address S-CHIP redistribution through regular order.  I assure my colleagues that, as Chairman of the Finance Committee, I am willing to address pertinent S-CHIP issues in the near future and discuss the possibility of extending S-CHIP coverage to pregnant women.
