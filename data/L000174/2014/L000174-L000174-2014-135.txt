. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Many Senators will remember Judge White from 15 years ago, when the Senate denied his confirmation by a partyline vote after an ugly campaign by Republican Senators to caricature him as a jurist who was soft on crime. Today, the Senate has an opportunity to reject that unjust characterization and confirm a well-qualified and principled man who has demonstrated his ability to be a fair judge and who is faithful to the law.  Throughout his exceptional career, Judge White has been a trail blazer in the legal community. In 1995, he became the first African American to serve on the Missouri Supreme Court and later became the first African American to serve as its Chief Justice. He previously served for 2 years as a judge on the Missouri Court of Appeals. Outside of his distinguished judicial service, Judge White has broad experience in the law, working in private practice as a partner in Missouri-based law firms both before and after his time on the bench, serving as City Counselor and Public Defender for St.Louis, MO and serving as a State representative in the Missouri General Assembly. He has been honored for his achievements and commitment to public service by organizations such as the Federal Defense Bar of the Eastern District of Missouri and the St. Louis branch of the NAACP.  I supported Judge White when he was first nominated to the U.S. District Court and I support him now. In 1999, by the time the Senate voted on his nomination, Judge White had upheld the implementation of the death penalty 41 times as a state Supreme Court justice. Yet, then-Senator Ashcroft of Missouri claimed Judge White was ``soft on crime'' and was ``the most anti-death penalty judge on the Missouri Supreme Court.''
