  Mr. DeFAZIO. This is a little different than the Reid bill we voted onon Saturday. It actually increases military spending $78 billion over the bill that we voted on on Saturday, and it decreases domestic spending by $80 billion. And it doesn't end the wars, unlike the Reid bill we voted on on Saturday.  It has one specified cut--student financial aid. That's the only cut specified. What kind of world do you people live in?  And, of course, it doesn't ask a single thing of millionaires, billionaires, corporations that avoid taxes. It doesn't close a single loophole. It doesn't ask one millionaire or billionaire just to go back to Clinton-era taxes. And it does nothing about our most serious deficit in this country, and that is the jobs deficit.  Unless you really believe that tax loopholes, tax cuts, and cutting investment in aviation and surface transportation creates jobs on your planet, this bill creates none here today.                          ____________________
