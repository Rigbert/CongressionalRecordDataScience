 The bill is a technical correction for language      that was intended to be in the original Family Medical Leave      Act, but for some reason or another was left out. Flight      crews were specifically mentioned in the FLMA's legislative      history. Thus, I believe that the correction is clearly      appropriate for flight crews. If other groups were to attempt      an adjustment in their FMLA eligibility requirements, I      suggest that their situation and the ramifications of such an      adjustment would need to be examined on a case by case basis.
