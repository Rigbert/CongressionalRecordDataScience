President, I rise today to add my support to promoting electronic commerce and keeping it free from new Federal, State or local taxes. I am pleased to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. 442, as it was reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee.  In ways that are becoming increasingly apparent, the Internet is changing the way we do business. More than 30 million people around the world surf the Net. And more and more of these users turn to the World Wide Web and Internet to place orders with suppliers, sell products and services to customers, communicate with clients and market products.  This Internet market is growing at a tremendous pace. Over the past two years, sales generated through the Web grew over 5,000%. And according to one Internet research firm, Net merchants are expected to sell $6.6 billion worth of goods by the year 2000.  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home state of Vermont. On my home page on the Web, I have put together a section called ``Cyber Selling In Vermont,'' which is a step-by-step resource guide for exploring on line commerce and other business uses of the Internet. It includes links to businesses in Vermont that are already cyber selling. As of today, this site includes links to Web sites of more than 100 Vermont businesses that are doing business on the Internet, ranging from the Quill Bookstore in Manchester Center to Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse in Newport.  As electronic commerce continues to grow, I am hopeful that we in Congress will be leaders in developing tax policy to nurture this exciting new market. That is why I have closely followed the Internet Tax Freedom Act since Senator Wyden introduced it last summer. I want to commend the senior Senator from Oregon for his leadership on cyber tax policy.  During my time in the Senate, I always tried to protect the rights of Vermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free from interference from Washington. Thus, the broad, open-ended moratorium on state and local taxes relating to the Internet in the original bill gave me pause. I certainly agreed with the goal of no new state and local taxation of online commerce, but the means were questionable.  I believe those questions have been fully answered by the changes made to this legislation during its consideration in the Senate Commerce Committee. I want to commend Senators McCain, Wyden, Burns and Kerry for crafting a substitute bill that protects the free flow of online commerce while accommodating the rights of state and local governments. In particular, I am pleased that the revised legislation adds an end date of January 1, 2004 to the moratorium and clarifies the list of state and local taxes that are grand fathered under it. The addition of state tax organizations to the Presidential task force to develop long-term Internet tax policy also makes good sense.  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act to foster the growth of online commerce and will work hard for its swift passage into law.                          ____________________
