 President, I rise today to honor the work of my friend, Dr. Meredith Evans. A native of Little Clear Creek in Bell County, Ky., Meredith knew what career path he wanted to follow at a very young age. Influenced by his family members who were in the medical field, he decided by age six that he wanted to be a doctor.  Through diligence and perseverance he graduated high school early and went on to earn degrees from the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville Medical School. After 6 years in surgical residency, he became a certified general surgeon, and throughout his career he has heavily valued the doctor-patient relationship.  Not only was my good friend a great doctor, but he also gave back to his community and our Commonwealth through his involvement in the Chamber of Commerce and in ROHO, a charitable organization aimed to further the success of young people, which he founded. His compassion worked toward building new schools, immunizing citizens against polio, and raising money to give Christmas presents to underprivileged children. His community and our Commonwealth have benefited greatly because of his work. The Middlesboro Daily News recently published a story about Dr. Evans and his involvement in the community. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                    Local Folks: Dr. Meredith Evans       Middlesboro.--``I decided I was going to be a doctor when I      was six years old,'' recalled longtime Middlesboro doctor      Meredith Evans.       One of his brothers, 18 years his senior, went to medical      school, inspiring Meredith to do the same. His first cousin      also owned Evans Hospital in Middlesboro and his uncle was a      physician in Pineville and Straight Creek.       Evans was born and raised in the Bell County community of      Little Clear Creek with his parents, Rose-Ota Fuson Evans and      father Marion F. Evans, a hillside farmer, and his three      sisters and two brothers.       The family lived off of the land, growing and hunting all      their own food. Evans remembers hunting and eating game like      squirrels and rabbits.       All six children went to college; the three girls became      school teachers and the boys went into the medical field.       Walking was the primary means of transportation in Little      Clear Creek at the time, and was supplemented by horses and      mules.       ``My dad never owned a car,'' he said.       Meredith walked to elementary school, where he was taught      mostly by his school-teaching sister, and later, by his      brother who was putting himself through dental school.       He walked four and a half miles to a bus stop to go to Bell      County High School, from which he graduated at the age of 16.       ``I doubled-up on a couple of subjects when I was under my      sister,'' he explained.       Meredith went to the University of Kentucky to get his      Bachelor's degree and the University of Louisville Medical      School. Going from Little Clear Creek to the city required      some adjustment.       ``It was quite a change. But I adapted rather quickly,''      Evans said. ``I was spending most of my time going to school,      going to classes.''       Evans was in college during World War II, and was set to      head overseas when the war ended.       ``I had already had my physical examination, and was ready      to go in the war. And they dropped the atomic bomb and that      ended the war,'' Meredith remembered.       Evans was told by his college roommate, Wendell Demarcus,      that the war was nearly over. Demarcus, it turned out, had      some inside information. The physics major had been working      on the development of the atomic bomb.       ``He kept telling me, he said Something will happen that's      going to end the war,' but he never would tell me what and I      didn't push him for it. But when they dropped the bomb, he      said That's what I've been telling you about.'''       When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Evans joined the      service, to avoid being drafted. He spent eight months in      Fort Campbell learning about reconstructive plastic surgery.       ``We did a lot of reconstructive surgeries on soldiers that      were returning home. I learned a lot about plastic surgery      there,'' Evans said.       After training at Fort Campbell, Evans and his three      friends shipped out. Evans ended up in Europe, thanks to the      luck of the draw.       ``They put our names in a hat and they said the first one      drawn out of the hat would go to Europe and the other two to      Korea. So     my two friends went to Korea,'' Evans explained.       He was stationed in England, but was able to travel around      Europe during his service. Italy, where he toured ancient      churches and saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa, was his favorite      destination.       ``I enjoyed their food and enjoyed the people,'' he      remarked.       After medical school, Evans spent six years in surgical      residency at three locations--Florida, West Virginia, and      Pennsylvania. He emerged a certified general surgeon with the      American Board of Surgery, with whom he later became a      diplomat.       The first operation Evans completed was an appendectomy at      a hospital in West Virginia, and he recalls the butterflies      that filled his stomach that day.       ``I was doing an appendectomy. The main reason I was      nervous, was that my wife was in the operating room as a      nurse,'' he recalled.       His wife, Helen, continued to work as a nurse, helping      support the couple while Meredith completed his residency.      After finishing his training, he set up shop in Middlesboro,      and felt fortunate to be able to return home.       ``I really enjoy being with country people. I think we have      the cream of the crop in the mountains,'' Evans declared.       Helen worked as a nurse in the practice until the couple      started a family. They had five children, Marilyn, Deborah,      Carobeth, Michelle, and Meredith II. Evans enjoyed      fatherhood.       ``I had four cheerleaders and a football player,'' he said.      ``I loved athletics. Of course, I was always interested in      their scholastics. My children always did well in school,      which made us happy.''       The couple now has ten grandchildren and the family is      always together for the holidays.       During his medical career, Meredith Evans witnessed      tremendous changes in medicine. Post-graduate education was a      consistent part of his career as technology and diagnostics      advanced.       Evans says that diagnostic advancements changed the face of      medicine, and that the invention of ultrasound machines, and      laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery made it possible for      doctors to save more lives than ever before.       Acquiring the ability to control circulation during      surgery, he says, may be the biggest advantage in medicine.       ``You have machines that breathe and act as a heart,      pumping blood through the system while you're working on      it,'' said Evans. ``That's one of the biggest advances . . .      ''       For Evans though, who has always had an intense interest in      medical ethics, spending time with patients to offer full      explanations of procedures and conditions was also a vital      part of the occupation.       "The doctor-patient relationship is the most important part      of medicine,'' he asserted.       In addition to working as a doctor, Evans took on many      roles in Middlesboro. He is the director of Community Trust      Bank, previously Commercial Bank, a post he has held since      1962.       Evans served as the president of the Junior Chamber of      Commerce and later the Senior Chamber of Commerce.       The Junior Chamber, under Evans, passed a bond issue to      provide the funding to build new schools in Middlesboro.       ``It was a very difficult thing to do,'' Evans said.      ``People opposed the taxes that were necessary to do it.''       In the early 1960s, the group confronted other city issues,      including immunizing the town against polio and defeating a      resolution to eliminate the citizen-elected City Council in      favor of an appointed commission.       Evans is a founding member of ROHO, an organization that      worked toward improving the community, and is named after the      song ``The Cockfight'' recorded by Archie Campbell in 1966.       The organization provides Christmas gifts for      underprivileged children in Bell, Lee and Claiborne counties.      Last year, the group spent around $30,000 on the program.       Additionally, Evans served for 12 years on the Middlesboro      School Board, was a city councilman for 20 years and served      as vice mayor.       Although Evans has retired from medicine, he continues to      keep up with advancements in the field. He stays healthy and      sharp with regular exercise and fresh produce from his      garden.       He still hunts and fishes as he did as a child, but no      longer brings home squirrel. He is enjoying retirement.                          ____________________
