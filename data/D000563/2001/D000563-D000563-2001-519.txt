These people are not entering bankruptcy in order to abuse the system. They are filing bankruptcy because the reprehensible tactics of unscrupulous lenders have driven them into insolvency and threatens their homes, cars, and other necessities; frankly, everything they own on Earth.  My amendment prohibits a high-cost mortgage lender that extended credit in violation of the provisions of the Truth-In-Lending Act from collecting its claim in bankruptcy.  I repeat this because the credit industry which opposes this amendment, opposes the following: A suggestion by me that if you have made a high-cost mortgage loan and in doing so violated the provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, you cannot go into bankruptcy court and be protected by the laws of the United States. If you violated the law to create this mortgage, then the bankruptcy court law will not protect you. It is that simple. You wonder why these major credit companies and financial institutions oppose this amendment. They say: If you get your nose under the tent, Durbin, we don't know where you are going next.  I suggest to them that they ought to look outside their tent for a moment at some of the scummy practices of people who say they are also their brothers and sisters in the mortgage credit industry. They should not make excuses for them and expect the American people to trust the mortgage credit industry when they tell us they have the best interest of consumers in America in their hearts.  The result of my amendment will be that when individuals like Genie McNab, Helen Ferguson, Goldie Johnson, or the Masons, goes to the bankruptcy court--seeking last-resort help for the financial distress an unscrupulous lender has caused her--the claim of the predatory home lender will not be allowed.  If the lender has failed to comply with the requirements of the Truth in Lending Act--a law created by Congress and signed by the President--for high-cost second mortgages, the lender will have absolutely no claim against the bankruptcy estate.  My amendment is not aimed at all subprime lenders or all second mortgages. Indeed, it is only aimed at the worst, most predatory scum-sucking bottom feeders in this industry. My provision is aimed only at practices that are already illegal under the law. It does not deal with technical or immaterial violations of the Truth in Lending Act. Disallowing the claims of predatory lenders in bankruptcy cases will not end these predatory practices always. But for goodness sake', why should we come to this floor and pass a law to protect these people? It is one step we can take to curb credit abuse in a situation where the lender bears primary responsibility for the deterioration of a consumer's financial situation.                            Amendment No. 17  Mr. President I send my amendment to the desk.
