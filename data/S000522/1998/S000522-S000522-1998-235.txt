Mr. Speaker, on October 11, presidential elections will take place in Azerbaijan. At the moment, the leading opposition parties are boycotting the election, largely because of continuing disagreements with the government over the composition of the Central Election Commission. They have embarked on a series of rallies and demonstrations, and the atmosphere in Baku has become quite tense. In fact, Reuters has reported from the opposition that about 100 people were hurt on Saturday during a long rally in the capital's city center.  The National Democratic Institute (NDI) has observers in Azerbaijan in preparation for the October election. According to NDI's statement, ``NDI representatives witnessed the attempts of political parties to conduct a publicly-announced rally. The rally was obstructed by police and others who used violence against the demonstrators to prevent a public gathering and disperse them . . . NDI condemns the use of violence by police and others against demonstrators. Such actions violate the Azerbaijani Constitution's guarantees of the rights of free assembly and expression. They raise substantial doubts about whether the official respect for law and dissent that are indispensable for democratic elections exist in Azerbaijan.''  Against this background, five Members of the Helsinki Commission, of which I am Co-Chairman, recently sent a letter to President Aliev, urging him to continue talks with the opposition and find a formula that would permit broad participation in the election. I would like to enter the full text of that letter into the Record.                                        Commission on Security and                                        Cooperation in Europe,                                  Washington, DC, August 25, 1998.     His Excellency Heydar Aliev     President, Republic of Azerbaijan, Baku, Azerbaijan       Dear Mr. President: The Helsinki Commission has been      closely monitoring the preparations for the October 11      presidential election in Azerbaijan. This election is      particularly significant and will have major ramifications      both on your country's democratization and on the prospects      for peace in the Caucasus region.       After years of mutual suspicion and recriminations between      the government and the opposition, the upcoming election      offers a chance for reconciliation and the establishment of      much-needed consensus within Azerbaijani society. An election      deemed free and fair by Azerbaijanis and international      observers will endow the government with unquestioned      legitimacy and help to undo the consequences of the flawed      parliamentary election of November 1995.       Moreover, a process of government-opposition reconciliation      in Azerbaijan is essential to facilitate a resolution of the      Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Though the 1994 cease fire remains      in effect, the peace process, unfortunately, has bogged down.      In order to restart the negotiations, the parties to the      conflict will have to make difficult choices, which will not      be politically feasible without strong backing from their      electorates.       It is therefore all the more regrettable that major      Azerbaijani opposition parties have not found it possible to      take part in the election. We recognize that the election law      originally passed by parliament, which the opposition found      unacceptable, has been substantially modified over the last      few months, with input from experts at the OSCE/ODIHR and the      National Democratic Institute. Various demands put forward by      the opposition have been met. Particularly important was the      recent announcement of the abolition of censorship, which, we      hope, will be consistently implemented, and will, in fact,      signal the end of all political censorship in Azerbaijan.       We commend your willingness to make these changes in the      law, and your pledge to hold free and fair elections, in      accord with OSCE commitments. Nevertheless, the opposition      boycott remains in effect, primarily because of continued      differences over the composition of the Central Election      Commission. A presidential election without the leading      opposition parties--no matter how many other candidates take      part--will not promote stability to resolve the most pressing      issues facing Azerbaijan at this historic juncture. With the      election now less than two months away, very little time      remains to reach agreement. We urge you to redouble your      efforts and continue the negotiations which your      representatives have already begun with opposition leaders to      find a mutually acceptable formula that will permit broad      participation in the election.           Sincerely,     Christopher H. Smith, M.C.,       Co-Chairman.     Frank R. Wolf, M.C.,       Commissioner.     Benjamin L. Cardin, M.C.,       Commissioner.     Alfonse D'Amato, U.S.S.,       Chairman.     Steny H. Hoyer, M.C.,       Ranking Member.                                 ____________________
