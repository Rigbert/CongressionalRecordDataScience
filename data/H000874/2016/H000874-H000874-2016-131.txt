 First of all, let me thank the gentleman. We are confronting a crisis, as the gentleman so well knows, in Puerto Rico. On May 1, they will be unable to pay their debts.  I want to thank the majority leader who has been leading to reach a bipartisan solution. Unfortunately, as the majority leader and I both know, there was a failure in committee this week to move the bill forward. But I want to reiterate my appreciation to the gentleman from California, the majority leader, for his efforts to make sure that we do, in fact, address this issue before May 1. I want to thank him for that.  It is critical that we do so, it is critical that we do so in a bipartisan fashion, and it is critical to have a bill that both sides can support. I have told the majority leader, and I reiterate, we hope that on both restructuring and the composition and the authority of a board of review, an oversight board, that we can come to an agreement so that we can have such a vote and have it in the near future.  Secondly, can the majority leader tell me where we are? I know the budget has been reported out of committee. The gentleman talks about Tax Day. Obviously, we are now at the point when a budget was expected to be brought to the floor. Can the majority leader tell me where we stand on the budget process and the budget coming to the floor of the House of Representatives?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I will first touch on Puerto Rico. I thank the gentleman for his work on that. Let me start by saying that any proposal that the House considers cannot be a bailout of Puerto Rico.  I know the committee had a markup and they postponed the vote on it simply because Treasury was still negotiating. We had heard from those on your side of the aisle that they did not want to pursue or continue until Treasury was done negotiating. So we look forward to continue solving this problem in a bipartisan manner.  I also understand the gentleman asking about the budget. I do believe the budget process is an important one, and we are continuing to work through it. It is out of the committee, and I look forward to getting it onto the floor.
