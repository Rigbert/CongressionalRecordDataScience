 President, I rise with sadness to remark on the passing of an old friend, Kentucky's former U.S. Senator, Marlow W. Cook. Senator Cook served in this Chamber for only a single term, but his political impact in the Commonwealth of Kentucky was substantial. So was his impact on my life.  Marlow Cook gave me my first real opportunity in politics. He gave me a chance to be a State youth chairman in his successful campaign for the U.S. Senate back in 1968. He also gave me an important opportunity in government. He won his election. I came to Washington with him, and I was what they called in those days chief legislative assistant. I think the term we use now is legislative director. I worked for him for 2 years. I recall that time very, very fondly. I can tell you that over the years I remained extremely grateful for the opportunity he gave me to get started.  Marlow Cook was someone who proved that Republican success was possible in a Commonwealth at that time completely dominated by Democrats. That was no easy task when he ran for office, but he succeeded anyway. You might even say he sketched out a political blueprint for victory: launch an improbable campaign forJefferson County judge executive in your thirties and win, secure reelection, and then launch a bid for U.S. Senator. That is the political path Marlow Cook took, and that is the exact political path I took as well.  Some might say the similarities end there or note that we haven't agreed on every issue in the years since, but what two people ever do? It doesn't change my enduring gratitude for the opportunities Marlow Cook brought to me. It certainly doesn't change my respect for him. This is a man who enlisted in the Navy when his country called and when he was still a teenager.  Marlow Cook served his country honorably in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters in World War II. He served his country honorably in the U.S. Senate.  I should note that Marlow Cook was the first Roman Catholic elected to statewide office in Kentucky. Believe it or not, that was something of an issue back then. It is hard to imagine today.  One more thing. Marlow Webster Cook's impact was felt in the course of the Commonwealth's history in the shape of the riverfront in Louisville. He bought the Belle of Louisville, the sternwheeler that is still going up and down the Ohio River today and is a particularly big thing during the Kentucky Derby week every year.  He had a huge impact on a lot of young Kentuckians, such as myself. I knew his family well. Nancy, his now widow, and his five kids were all running around during that campaign way back then.  I want to say to Nancy and all of Marlow and Nancy's kids how much we admire him. Elaine and I are truly saddened by his loss. We are going to continue to remember this veteran, this extraordinary county official, and our United States Senator fondly. I am sure colleagues will join me in that sentiment. I ask them also to join me in sending our best to all of Marlow's family and friends.                          ____________________
