Speaker, can anybody look at a 1,754-page bill that finally brings fiscal responsibility to Washington, DC and say, there is only one way to write that bill? Well, that is what the Republican majority is telling us. No Democratic alternative will be allowed.  I have a plan to balance the budget in 7 years. I just happen to have very different priorities than the majority. I do not want to give more tax breaks to large corporations and repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax; and I do not think most Americans think that is the way to balance the budget.  I do not believe we have done so well at the top that we should give them tax breaks. I do not believe we should continue agriculture subsidies. I do not believe that we should continue to give away Federal minerals for free.  I believe we should begin to assess royalties. There are responsible ways to get us to a balanced budget in 7 years without cutting student loans, without cutting Medicare, without cutting veterans' benefits.  I have produced such a plan. I voted on a similar plan when we brought the budget to the floor, but that vote will not be allowed today. They are saying there is only one way, their way, which is business as usual, serving the same powerful interests that have run this country for 25 years.
