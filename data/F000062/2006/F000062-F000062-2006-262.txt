 With an $8.4 trillion national debt, a budget deficit that will exceed $300 billion this year, a looming entitlement crisis, and a mounting alternative minimum tax problem, full repeal of the estate tax at this time is simply not responsible.  We have until 2010 to make decisions about the estate tax. In doing so, time will afford us the opportunity to make more informed choices, with a more complete picture of our Nation's fiscal health.  We are talking about eliminating nearly $1 trillion in Federal revenues here, during a time of war.  Now is not the time to place the interests of a small number of millionaires ahead of millions of working families.  The estate tax is already being gradually phased down under current law. By 2009, only estates valued at more than $7 million per couple--$3.5 million per individual--will owe any estate tax at all. This means that only 3 of every 1,000 people who die would have an estate large enough to owe any Federal estate taxes.  Permanently eliminating the estate tax would cost $402 billion over thenext 10 years, 2007 to 2016, though it is important to note that this figure only captures the cost of 5 years of full repeal, from 2011 to 2016.  When all costs are included, nearly a trillion dollars will be lost in the first decade following repeal, from 2012 to 2021. Included in this staggering figure is $213 billion in increased interest payments on the national debt.  Federal revenues are already insufficient to fund our Nation's most critical domestic priorities.  I wish things were different, allowing a vote in support of reforming the estate tax to be cast today in good conscience.  Let me be clear. I am no fan of the estate tax. I understand how hard families work to provide opportunities and a better future for their children. Transferring assets from generation to generation motivates families to work even harder. It is unfair to place unreasonable burdens on small businesses and families seeking to provide for future generations.  I am deeply concerned about California's families who own farms and small businesses. Like many of my colleagues, I worry that they may be forced to sell a primary residence just to pay the estate tax. Our laws should not create even more hardship at a time when someone has lost a loved one.  Yet, as we consider estate tax repeal today, our Nation's fiscal outlook and the potential impact of this administration's policies are uncertain. This President has broken with his predecessors by submitting only 5-year budgets.  Why, you might ask? Especially after we were presented with the traditional 10-year numbers during this President's first year in office. The answer is that these tax cuts explode the debt and deficit in the outyears--the end of the 10-year window.  The President's tax cuts have already cost more than $1 trillion, and those enacted will be more than $3 trillion over the next decade.  Republicans just passed another round, with the lion's share once again going to the very wealthy--$50 billion to extend capital gains and dividends tax breaks over 10 years.  The Federal budget deficit will be at least $300 billion this year. The national debt is soaring. And we are at war. Never before have such expansive tax cuts been enacted or continued during a time of war.  Over the next 10 years, the debt is projected to reach nearly $12 trillion. In this year alone, our national debt is slated to increase by $654 billion. More startling is the fact that the national debt is currently more than 66 percent of our gross domestic product, GDP. The total debt equates to roughly $30,000 owed by every American citizen.  When you combine the cost of the tax cuts with spending for the war in Iraq--currently totaling $370 billion--the inevitable result is that the domestic programs that matter most are squeezed.  For example, the President's fiscal year 2007 budget makes significant cuts to programs such as food stamps, cut by $272 million; food assistance for seniors and children, cut by $111 million; COPS, which put over 118,000 police on the streets nationwide, is being cut by more than $407 million, or 15,000 officers nationwide; first responders--within Department of Homeland Security--by $573 million or 25 percent; firefighters--firefighter grant program, within Department of Homeland Security--by $355 million; Job Corps--an education and job training program for youth--by $55 million, resulting in 1,000 fewer at-risk youth being served; mass transit, by $100 million; safe and drug-free schools State grants, by $346 million; and education--the President's signature education program, No Child Left Behind, would be underfunded this year by more than $15 billion and $55.7 billion since it was enacted.  Let me explain. Most of the money the Federal Government outlays in a given year is currently not controllable. It is spent on what are called entitlements--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits. If you are entitled to these benefits, you get them.  And if you add interest on the debt--nearly $400 billion in 2006--that is about 60 percent of everything spent in a given year. So that leaves 40 percent, half of which is the defense budget and half is everything else.  There is a war going on, so it is very difficult to cut defense spending.  So while a select few are benefiting from massive tax breaks, budget cuts must be made--to the programs many Americans rely upon--to prevent uncontainable deficits.  There is a fundamental shift taking place. Republicans have become the profligate spenders, while Democrats have become the deficit hawks.  Americans deserve more responsible leadership. Leadership is about planning for the future and making the difficult decisions that ensure economic stability for our children and their grandchildren.  With the threatening fiscal demands of baby boomers retiring and the pending insolvency of Medicare in less than two decades, repealing the estate tax today would be inconceivably shortsighted.  I urge my colleagues to employ sensible leadership and understand the responsibilities we have to uphold. We have a responsibility to working families, veterans, senior citizens, children, and low-income communities.  No one will deny that this issue needs to be revisited in the coming years. We must adopt a balanced estate tax compromise, while holding the line on spending in order to restore a program of fiscal sanity. I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect small businesses and family farms, without unreasonably jeopardizing our Nation's financial well-being and our ability to help those who need Congress most.  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to do what they know is right: encourage a more responsible fiscal course and stand in opposition to full repeal of the estate tax at this time. This is the wrong policy at the wrong time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, nothing could place more stress on a family than the loss of a loved one. Yet at such a difficult time, too many families in America today must make decisions about selling a business or a farm that has been in the family for generations in order to pay estate taxes, or, as they are more commonly called, death taxes.  That is wrong. That is why I support the repeal of the death tax--immediately, completely, and permanently. No American family should be forced to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the same day.  We have made important progress towards eliminating this onerous tax under President Bush's leadership. In 2001, Congress began phasing out the death tax, and will phase it out completely in 2010. Yet because of our budget rules, the death tax will return in full force in 2011.  Starting in 2011, many small-business owners and their families may be unfairly penalized if we do not eliminate the death tax. We can change that by repealing one of the most destructive, unfair taxes ever conceived by government. Let's kill the death tax forever.  We ought to kill it especially on behalf of America's small businesses, the lifeblood of our growing economy. From their successes come the new jobs of today and the economic growth of tomorrow. Yet the death tax often hits small businesses the hardest.  Today, we see a dogged minority working again to keep death and taxes not just inevitable, but inseparable. But death and taxes are a destructive tag team for our economy, because the death tax destroys small businesses.  My colleague the Democratic leader said recently that during a trip home to his native Nevada, not a single one of his constituents spoke to him about the repeal of the death tax. I think he took this as some kind of proof that we should not address this issue.  Well, I want to bring to my colleagues' attention a Kentuckian who did approach me about this issue last week, when I was at the Perry County Civic Night at Hazard Community College in Hazard, KY, on May 31.  I spoke with a constituent named Bill Fields. He is the co-owner of Perry Distributors Inc., a beer distributor. Without permanent relief from the death tax, he is unable to plan for the future of his business and his family.  Bill is the third generation of his family to be active in the business, and his parents are still active in it as well. Right now, the Fields family has to pay between $15,000 and $25,000 a yearfor an insurance policy, just in the event that Bill's parents pass on and the family is hit with this massive death tax.  And even at such a high cost, that policy will not cover the full tax burden. Bill estimates it will only cover about 20 percent. He would have to borrow to pay the rest.  Bill says: ``The way things are now, nobody knows what to do with estate planning.'' It's a shame, but it is true.  Now, Bill is still a young man--he is 43--with plenty of working years left in him. But one day, he will want to pass on his business to his heirs.  Unless we act, after Bill passes away, his family may have to sell the business he worked so hard to build during his lifetime just to pay these burdensome taxes. Bill's family faces the same dilemma as too many other Kentucky families who own small businesses.  Before I conclude my remarks, I want to bring to my colleagues' attention an excellent column in this Monday's Washington Post by the Senator from Alabama, Jeff Sessions, titled ``. . . Or Unfair Burden on Families?''  The Senator from Alabama rightly says, ``The death tax is almost dead. Let's put the stake in its heart.''  I commend my colleague Senator Sessions for writing so cogently and persuasively on the pernicious effects of the death tax. I ask that his column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 2006]                ``. . . or Unfair Burden on Families?''                           (By Jeff Sessions)       This week the Senate is expected to vote on permanent      repeal of the estate tax. With this vote, Congress will have      an opportunity to finish the job it started five years ago.       The estate tax--or, as many of us prefer to call it, the      death tax--is a tax imposed on the transfer of assets or      property from a deceased person to his or her heirs. This is      one of the IRS's most painful taxes, as it hits families at      the worst possible time, when they are dealing with the death      of a loved one.       Congress passed a gradual phaseout of this tax at the      urging of President Bush in 2001, and it was scheduled to      disappear in 2010. But because of the peculiarities of the      lawmaking process, the death tax will return in 2011--at the      same high rates that existed before--unless Congress enacts      new legislation. In April 2005 the House passed a permanent      repeal of the death tax by a vote of 272 to 162. Over a year      has passed since; it is time for the Senate to act:       The list of reasons for eliminating the death tax is long.      To begin with, this tax punishes thrift and saving. It tells      people that it's better to spend freely during their      lifetimes than to leave assets for their children and      grandchildren, which will be taxed heavily by the federal      government.       The death tax hits hardest at heirs of small-business      owners and family farmers. In many cases, the heirs cannot      afford to pay the tax and are forced to downsize, layoff      employees or even sell their business or farm.       There can be no doubt that closely held family businesses      that are growing and beginning to compete with the big guys      are often devastated by the tax. I believe the death tax is a      major factor in business consolidation and loss of      competition.       This tax hurts the growth of minority-owned businesses. As      the first generation of African American millionaires begins      to die, many of the companies they founded will have to be      sold to pay the estate taxes. For example, the tax almost      forced the oldest African American-owned newspaper--the      Chicago Daily Defender--out of business.       According to Heritage Foundation economists, the death tax      also costs the American economy 170,000 to 250,000 potential      jobs each year. These jobs are never created because the      investments that would have financed them are not made, as      these resources are diverted to pay for complex trusts and      insurance policies to avoid the tax.       The death tax is double taxation. Most of the assets taxed      at death have already been taxed throughout an individual's      lifetime.       The death tax accounts for a small portion of federal      government revenue, an expected $28 billion in 2006, or only      1.2 percent of federal receipts.       Many argue that repealing the death tax would decrease      charitable giving, as this tax allows individuals to deduct      gifts to charitable organizations. Yet, even though the      phasing out of the death tax began in 2001, charitable      contributions in the United States reached a record high in      2004.       The death tax even has a negative effect on the      environment, as heirs are often forced to develop      environmentally sensitive land to pay the tax. According to a      study by researchers from Mississippi State University and      the U.S. Forest Service, about 2.5 million acres of forest      land were harvested and 1.3 million acres were sold each year      from 1987 through 1997 to pay the estate tax.       Finally, the American people already understand the      unfairness of the death tax and support its repeal. Sixty-     eight percent of those surveyed in a recent poll commissioned      by the Tax Foundation supported repeal of the estate tax.      Moreover, the death tax was rated by Americans in the same      survey as the least fair tax.       As a vote approaches, it is essential that constituents let      their representatives hear now how unfair they believe this      tax is. The death tax is almost dead. Let's put the stake in      its heart.
