 Ladies and gentlemen of this House, over a quarter of a century ago as president of the Maryland Senate, I led an effort to revise extensively the sexual offense statutes of the State of Maryland. Those statutes were premised on the perception of women as chattel, as somehow less than subject to full protection of the law, particularly from their spouses and intimate partners.  We amended those statutes very substantially. We passed violence against women. Millions and millions of women this day throughout the world will be subjected to violent acts because of their gender. They are perceived by their societies to be subject by their male counterparts to such treatment.  It is critically important that we pass overwhelmingly this statute and make a very strong statement to everybody in America and everybody around the world that we respect individuals for their individuality. Pass this bill.
