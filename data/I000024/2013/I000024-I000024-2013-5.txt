President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, the chair of the Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support, for her question. I am a strong supporter of energy performance contracts that provide maximum savings for the Federal Government. It is my understanding that the components of the Department of Defense have identified additional opportunities for energy conservation and energy demand management that could benefit from performance contracting, However, in order to maximize taxpayer savings, it is vital that DoD contract for those projects that provide the greatest return on investment as opposed to directing the use of certain mandated energy sources without an assessment of relative costs over the life cycle of the project. I join with the Senator from New Hampshire to strongly encourage the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments to increase the use and streamline the administration of energy savings performance and utility energy savings contracting vehicles that will incorporate the most efficient and effective energy systems in order to maximize the reduction of operational costs, to conserve energy resources, and to improve the efficiency of building systems. I hope my colleague will join with me as part of our oversight responsibilities for the committee that we ensure energy performance contracts carried out by the Department of Defense meet the intent of the President's executive order of December 2011 to maximize cost reductions for the Federal Government by promoting projects to offer the greatest return on investment.
