We know today 90 percent of the adults who are smoking started when they were children. We know, if current trends continue, 5 million kids today under 18 years old will die because of smoking related diseases. We know all this, yet we are doing nothing effective to stop the use of tobacco products by children under 18 years of age.  The Harkin amendment would actually provide resources to ensure that the FDA regulations are enforced. That, to me, is the most critical test. I believe we should support this amendment wholeheartedly.  I yield the floor.
