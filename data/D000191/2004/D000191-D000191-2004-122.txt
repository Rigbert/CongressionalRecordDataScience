Speaker, oil hit a new high yesterday. Prices over 2 bucks a gallon in places in the western United States; $30 billion will be extorted from American consumers this year because OPEC is fixing prices and driving up the cost.  Now, what is the response of the oil men at the Bush White House? A collective yawn and silence from the Bush administration. I guess their buddies in the oil industry are doing pretty well because they are adding on a little margin to these increases in prices.  Now OPEC is violating the rules of the World Trade Organization. We have an administration that is a big fan of the World Trade Organization and rules-based trade. Will they file a complaint on behalf of American consumers because OPEC is breaking the rules? They have told me they will not do that.  They are going to unilaterally disarm Americans in face of this attack against our economy by OPEC because some of their buddies in the oil industry are adding a little margin on and doing okay.                          ____________________
