Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I want to join her in her expressions of concern about the process.  The gentleman from California, myself, and others as well as the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) throughout the process of consideration of legislation, the history of which Mr. Rohrabacher gave a little earlier, have raised very significant concerns. Those concerns were raised not for those who can lobby this House very effectively, but for those small inventors whose lifeblood relies on the integrity of their patent application.  Because of that concern we have raised repeatedly the reservations, I do not even want to say opposition, but reservations to this bill that were expressed to us by hundreds of small inventors, perhaps thousands of small inventors, represented by them around this country.  My concern tonight is that the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), for whom I have a great deal of respect, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo), for whom I have a great deal of respect, who signed a letter with me, with the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) with reference to the bill in its previous form, we did not want it to move quickly.  We have now had changes in the bill which the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) has referred to which, frankly, I have not had the opportunity to review fully, and I have a sense that maybe I am with the 430 people in this House. There perhaps have been four or five who have reviewed this legislation. But I am very concerned that we are moving this tonight on suspension. We are not going to vote until tomorrow, I understand that, without having the opportunity to fully review, debate, the provisions of this bill.  The gentleman from California made a very good statement, I thought, going through various provisions in the bill about which we had concerns. I regret I do not have more time to speak.
