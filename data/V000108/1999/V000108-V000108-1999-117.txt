Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Mr. Calvin Bellamy, of Munster, Indiana. On May 23, 1999, Mr. Bellamy will be honored for his exemplary and dedicated service to Northwest Indiana. His praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at Purdue University Calumet's Commencement Exercise as he will be receiving an honorary doctor of humane letters degree.  Calvin Bellamy, a longtime resident of Northwest Indiana, has dedicated his life topublic service. In 1964, Mr. Bellamy graduated from Indiana University and continued his education at the University of Michigan where he received his Juris Doctor cum laude and Order of the Coif in 1967. He has continued his scholarly work in law and has been nationally recognized for his writing on constitutional questions. Mr. Bellamy currently serves as the chairman and chief executive office of Bank Calumet, with which he began his affiliation in 1975.  While Calvin Bellamy has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work at the bank, he has always made an extra effort to give to the community. Some of the organizations for which he serves as the director of include: the Lake County Community Development Committee, the Northwest Indiana World Trade Council, and the Northwest Indiana Local Initiatives Support Corporation. Additionally, he has served as president and director of the Hammond Public Library, Lake Area United Way, and the Legal Aid Society of Greater Hammond. He has also been active with the Hammond Historical Society, the Lake County Bar Association, Northern Indiana Arts Association, and the Indiana Bankers Association.  Although his work and community service put extraordinary demands on his time, Calvin Bellamy has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family, especially his lovely wife, Cathy.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Calvin Bellamy for his lifetime of dedication, service, and leadership in Northwest Indiana. His large circle of family and friends can be proud of the significant contributions this prominent individual has made. Our community has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising dedication displayed by Mr. Calvin Bellamy.                          ____________________
