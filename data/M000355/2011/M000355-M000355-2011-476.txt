 Senator Hutchison has been a trusted adviser of mine, a leader in the Senate, and a dear friend. Senator Conrad has been a leader on the budget. He has done a lot to alert the country to the fiscal problems we face as a Nation. Senator Lieberman has been a consistent and courageous leader on defense and national security issues. We will be sorry to see them go. They have all been a great credit to this body.                          ____________________
