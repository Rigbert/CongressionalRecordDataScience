 I think this deserves analysis and serious look.  What we are talking about is some of the largest corporations in America, owned by the wealthiest people in America, making huge profits and paying less in taxes, zero, than the average working stiff who makes $20,000 or $30,000 a year.  You mentioned AT&T. What other corporations were involved?  Mr. DeFAZIO. Let me list a couple of others.   This is serious. And we do not want to be facetious. I will jump down to, say, the middle of the list. Xerox Corporation, over that three-year period, $670,300,000 in profits. And they received a tax credit of $42.8 million. So their tax rate was minus 6.5 percent.
