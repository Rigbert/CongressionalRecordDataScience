Speaker, today, we are here to honor Colonel Guy T. Shields on his induction into the Army Public Affairs Hall of Fame, an honor deserving of a man who has dedicated his life to serving our country. Colonel Shields' accomplishments are many, and his time in the Army has been a story of passion, leadership, and innovation.   For nearly twenty years he served in the Army as a Public Affairs Officer, and he established himself as a media relations expert. He was respected and trusted by all he worked with: internal and external media, his military superiors, his peers, and his subordinates. At the NATO Nuclear Planning Conference in 1987, he successfully established an international press center, and under his guidance a team was able to handle more than 200 members of the international media for four days. His success continued as he covered stories and events such as the 50th Anniversary of the Normandy Landings, Exercise Double Eagle, Operations Support Hope, Just Cause, Golden Pheasant, and Iraqi Freedom. While working in Bosnia he coordinated the construction and operation of a radio tower and taught a team who had never worked with the equipment before how to broadcast messages to the Bosnian people. He truly has done it all.   Colonel Shields' time spent as an Army Public Affairs Officer set the standards for contingency public affairs operations for the Army and Joint Operations. Through his service, he set an example for contingency deployments worldwide in both peacetime and war. Every day I am grateful for the sacrifices and work that our service men and women do and Colonel Shields exemplifies both a dedication to our country as well as a model soldier with exceptional public affairs skills. I would like to join in congratulating him on this much deserved award.                          ____________________
