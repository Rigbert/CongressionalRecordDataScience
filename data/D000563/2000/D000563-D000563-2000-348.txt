I think it is particularly timely that he would raise this on the floor of the Senate. In a trip to Africa just a few months ago, I discovered the ravages of the AIDS epidemic. There are some 10 million AIDS orphans. These children are likely to become the soldiers in these armies the Senator from Minnesota has just described. The young girls are likely to become either victimized or prostitutes themselves, who are going to really, in a way, continue this cycle of disease and dependency and death.  I commend my colleague from the State of Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, for calling this important moral issue to the attention of the Senate. I rise in strong support. I ask him if he has considered the impact of the AIDS epidemic and similar health problems that have created so many orphans in Africa, and now we have the fastest growth of HIV infection in the world in India, and the impact this could have on the issue he has raised.
