President, the textile mills and tanneries of Maine helped fuel our country's economic growth. But as these industries closed, brownfields replaced once vibrant factories. In many communities across Maine these sites remain a legacy of our industrial history.  Left undeveloped, brownfields pose threats to the public health, environmental quality and economic strength of our communities. But redeveloped, these sites offer opportunities for new industries, job growth and economic development. I am pleased to join Senators Levin and Jeffords in introducing the Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act. This legislation will provide communities with economic development resources to redevelop brownfields and return them to productive uses.  The legislation we are introducing today would provide EDA with increased funding flexibility to help States, local communities, Indian tribes and nonprofit organizations return brownfield sites to productive use. The bill authorizes $60 million each year for five years for brownfields redevelopment. This funding authorized by this bill will result in hundreds of millions of dollars worth of economic benefits for States and local communities through the leveraging of local and State funds and private investments.  The bill gives EDA the authority to provide grants for brownfield redevelopment projects, including: development of public facilities and public services; business development; activities to help communities diversify their economies; and collaborative economic development planning. This will help States and communities facilitate effective economic development planning for brownfield reuse; develop infrastructure necessary to prepare sites for re-entry into the market; and, provide the capital necessary to support new business development.  The decline of the New England textile industry led to the closure of many textile mills throughout the region, including the Bates Mill in the City of Lewiston, ME. The Bates Mill was once the State's largest employer providing more than 5,000 jobs. Economic decline and layoffs left the residents of Lewiston with large abandoned mill buildings that have been a challenge to redevelop. As a small city of 36,000 people, continued support for redeveloping brownfields located in the heart of downtown is critical to the city's future economic vitality. In 1998, the city received a $200,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help facilitate the cleanup and redevelopment of the one million square foot mill complex. Today, the City has redeveloped about one-third of the mill and created 1,000 new jobs. The City estimates that it will require $54 million to develop the remaining buildings in the Bates Mill Complex. The economic development resources provided in the Brownfields Redevelopment Assistance Act will help Lewiston and other communities across the nation rebuild their communities and create new economic opportunity.  Brownfields redevelopment is a fiscally responsible strategy for strengthening local economies and reusing existing infrastructure while protecting open space. We recycle cans, bottles and newspapers now we must try harder to recycle our land. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the bill to aid in this effort.                                 ______                                       By CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski,         Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Sarbanes):  S. 646. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to expand and improve coverage of mental health services under the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.
