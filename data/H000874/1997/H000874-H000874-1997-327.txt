Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today with my colleague from Texas, Ms. Jackson-Lee, to honor a lifelong crusader for civil rights, Arnold Aronson, as he celebrates his 87th birthday. His distinguished career in civil rights began nearly 60 years ago and he has been at the center of nearly every major civil rights fight since the New Deal.  Most notably, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Aronson was one of the founders of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in 1950. The single-most important event forming this conference was a historic gathering of over 4,000 delegates from 33 States in Washington, DC, to protest racial injustices throughout the Nation. Arnold Aronson and Roy Wilkins organized this, the national emergency civil rightsmobilization, and many of the civil rights' accomplishments which we herald today resulted from this gathering.  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights not only played a crucial role in organizing and mobilizing African-Americans throughout the Nation, it also framed the civil rights issue in a way that all Americans could relate to and understand. In fact, it is important to note, that most of Mr. Aronson's work on behalf of the civil rights movement was performed while he was the program director for the National Jewish Community Relations Council. He thus serves as a living symbol of the historic alliance between the Jewish and Black communities.  Many of the successes that we point to today in the area of civil rights is as a result of Arnold Aronson's hard work and dedication. He was directly involved in the development of President Roosevelt's Executive order barring discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or national origin, and in the drafting of the report issued by President Truman's Citizens Committee on Civil Rights in 1947, which became the basis for the 1957 Civil Rights Act.  Mr. Aronson once said, ``the struggle for civil rights cannot be won by any one group acting by or for itself alone but only through a coalition of groups that share a common commitment to equal justice and equal opportunity for every American.'' One of the most impressive aspects of the work of Arnold Aronson has always been his commitment to peaceful demonstration, civility, and coalition building.  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to join with my colleagues to recognize the lifelong achievements of Arnold Aronson and to honor him today on his 87th birthday. This is a man who represents what is right in America, and while there is much work which remains in the area of civil rights, we must never forget the commitment and dedication of individuals like Arnold Aronson who were responsible for the historic progress of the civil rights movement in our lifetime.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to close with a quote from the late civil rights leader Clarence Mitchell, Jr., the former Washington director for the NAACP, who once referred to Arnold Aronson as ``one of the giants who labored longer and earlier than many * * * none of our great achievements would have been possible without him.'' Our Nation is forever indebted to Arnold Aronson for his life's work and I am pleased to have been able to honor him today on the floor with my colleagues.                          ____________________
