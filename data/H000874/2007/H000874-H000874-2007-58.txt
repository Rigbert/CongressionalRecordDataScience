Speaker, I know this will come as an extraordinary disappointment to all of the Members in the House, but in consultation with my friend the minority whip, and in consultation with Mr. Levin, the chairman of the subcommittee, and Mr. Rangel, and I have not talked to Mr. McCrery and I apologize for that, but I think that the way we will proceed, we will proceed to debate tonight, I'm trying to elongate this announcement because so many times people are so angry at me for scheduling. I think it's one of the few opportunities I get to make people a little bit happy. But we will save 20 minutes of debate. We will do all but 20 minutes of the allocated debate. There are four sides to this. Five, five, five and five, we will save for tomorrow, and we will commence that at the conclusion of the 1-minutes. There are 10 a side. So that will take about 20, 25 minutes, and we will commence the closing of debate, and then we will have the vote on this bill immediately following that debate.
