Mr. Speaker, in 1973, Congress passed the Church Amendment to protect the conscience rights of hospitals and health care providers from being forced into involvement with abortion. The amendment provides that the receipt of Federal funds in various health programs will not require hospitals or individuals to participate in abortions if they object based on moral or religious convictions. It also forbade hospitals in these programs to make, willingness or unwillingness to perform abortions a condition of employment.  Since 1973, and I think many Members know this, various conscience protections, many of which deal specifically with abortion, have been enacted into law. Unfortunately, over the years, gaps in the protection of existing law have been exploited by pro-abortion organizations which have now undertaken a nationwide campaign to require all health care providers to participate in abortion. That campaign has met with some success, and there are a number of those which I will put into the Record, including trying to compel Catholic hospitals as a condition of a merger and acquisition to provide abortions. In one case in my own State, they compelled a $2 million settlement that had to go into a trust that paid for abortions. That's outrageous. To counteract this extreme campaign--to force health care providers to participate in abortion--Federal conscience law when signed by President Bush, will now be strengthened.  The principle of the Hyde amendment was that no one should be forced to participate in abortions in any way, and that needs to be affirmed. That is what this Weldon-Hyde amendment will do. The addition of conscience protection to the Hyde amendment remedies current gaps in Federal law and promotes the right of conscientious objection by forbidding federally funded government bodies to coerce the consciences of health care providers who respect fundamentally the right to life and basic human rights for the unborn.          The Campaign To Force Hospitals to Provide Abortion       Forty-five States and the Federal Government protect the      right of health care providers to decline involvement in      abortion. Pro-abortion groups seek to abolish these legal      protections:                        abortion access project       Operating in 24 States, the project's goal is ``increasing      access to abortion services by expanding . . . the number of      hospitals offering abortion services.'' The project admits      that its tactics include ``pressuring hospitals'' and it does      so through both political and legal pressure.

The ACLU has published a report and advocacy kit aimed at      requiring all hospitals, including Catholic hospitals, to      provide abortions. The report argues: ``When . . .      religiously affiliated organizations move into secular      pursuits--such as providing medical care or social services      to the public or running a business--they should no longer be      insulated from secular laws. In the public world, they should      play by public rules.''

In one session at the national meeting, the group analyzed      a same conscience protection which ``allowed hospitals, their      staffs, or `any other person' to opt out of providing      abortions, sterilizations, and contraception if they objected      to such services.'' The participants decided ``the measure      couldn't be fixed and should be opposed at all costs.'' Id.      at page 11.

That campaign has met      with some success. Novel legal and administrative strategies      have resulted in:       Forcing a private community hospital to open its doors for      late-term abortions,       Denying a certificate of need to an outpatient surgical      center that declined involvement in abortion, after an      abortion rights coalition intervened in the proceedings,       Forcing a private non-sectarian hospital to leave a cost-     saving consortium, because the consortium abided by a pro-     life policy in its member hospitals,       Dismantling a hospital merger, after abortion advocates      approached a State attorney general to challenge the merger,       Pressuring a hospital to place $2 million in trust for      abortions and sterilizations before allowing the hospital to      consolidate,       Attempting to require a Catholic hospital to build an      abortion clinic and pay for abortions,       Threatening a Catholic-operated HMO with loss of State      contracts because it declines to provide abortions,       Prohibiting hospitals from ensuring that the property they      sell is not used for abortions.
