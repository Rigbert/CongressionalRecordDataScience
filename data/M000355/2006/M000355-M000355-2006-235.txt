 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a distinguished Kentuckian, Mr. Morton J. Holbrook, Jr., for his dedicated service to the Commonwealth and his commitment to the practice of law and higher education.  Last month, Mr. Holbrook, a resident of Owensboro, passed away. He was a pre-eminent attorney in Kentucky and will be remembered for the permanent impression he left on Kentucky's legal system. He helped modernize the courts' rules of procedure and was instrumental in pushing for sweeping changes to the State's judicial system.  On August 30, 2006, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer published an editorial highlighting Mr. Holbrook's legal brilliance, his contributions to the judicial system, and his duty to public service. I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial be printed in the Congressional Record and that the entire Senate join me in paying respect to this beloved Kentuckian.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, Aug. 30, 2006]                 State Better Place Because of Holbrook       Because Morton Holbrook Jr.'s accomplishments were so many,      his love for his community so strong, his quest for knowledge      so persistent and his zest for life so complete, penning a      tribute to his life invites inadequacy.       Holbrook, who died Friday at the age of 91, was a Daviess      County icon who mixed a legal career as a Harvard-trained      lawyer with a lifetime of public service, gaining fame in      both arenas. Twice his leadership helped completely change      the face of Kentucky's legal system. Closer to home, there      might not be an Owensboro Community & Technical College      without his point work in the 1980s.       Whenever and wherever Holbrook decided to take a stand, he      usually became an irresistible force for progress and change.      Slight of build and not tall, Holbrook was nevertheless      formidable, thanks to his agile mind, gifted and eloquent      speaking ability and compelling personality.       For 56 years Holbrook practiced law and would have been      admired for his legal abilities alone. One colleague called      him the greatest attorney he ever knew. But Holbrook strayed      far beyond private practice, to Kentucky's lasting benefit.      In 1948 he was appointed to a state judicial committee that      totally revised the state courts' rules of procedure. Two and      a half decades later he helped push through an in-toto reform      of Kentucky's judicial system, which required changing the      state Constitution.       Holbrook's other passion was higher education. He was a      member of the Kentucky Council on Higher Education for 10      years. OCTC can trace its origins to his involvement in the      early 1980s.       Holbrook received many awards and recognitions through the      years. Perhaps the most fitting came on his 90th birthday in      September 2004 when Daviess Fiscal Court named the county's      judicial center in his honor--the Morton J. Holbrook Jr.      Judicial Center.       Morton Holbrook--a delight and truly one of a kind--will be      deeply missed.                          ____________________[Page S9354]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov][Page S9354]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov][DOCID:cr12se06-170]                                           TRIBUTE TO MR.
