Mr. Chairman, I ask you to join me and my colleague from Hawaii (Ms. Hanabusa) in continued oversight of Federal agency implementation of section 811 and in requesting the Comptroller General provide us a full report with respect to any inconsistencies in the ways agencies are implementing section 811, the negative impacts such section is having on Native American contractors, and provide recommendations on how the provision should be better implemented. Such a report will aid Congress in ensuring that section 811 is implemented so as to make clear that the provision does not impose a cap or limit on awards covered by the provision, so long as the justifications and approval are obtained pursuant to provision, and that the provision is intended to provide a level of oversight and approval, not act as a prohibition or limit on awards.  Mr. McKEON. I will be happy to work with the gentleman and with our colleague from Hawaii to send a joint letter to the Comptroller General in the manner he suggests and to continue oversight on this issue.  I reserve the balance of my time.
