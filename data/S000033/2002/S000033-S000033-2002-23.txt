 Chairman, this tripartisan amendment is being cosponsored by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Leach), the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Mark Udall), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), and the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Baldwin). To the best of my knowledge, it has been agreed to by the majority, and I thank them very much for that.  The legislative intent of this amendment is to increase funding for the highly successful Energy Star program by $3 million, bringing the total funding for this program up to the President's request of $6.2 million. This increase in funding will be offset by a $3 million reduction in salaries and expenses at the Department of Energy that I hope will be restored in conference.  Mr. Chairman, the Energy Star program has a cost-effective proven track record of saving energy and saving money. In fact, for every dollar spent on program costs, the Energy Star program produces average energy bill savings of $75 and sparks $15 in investment and new technology. This voluntary partnership program helps businesses, State and local governments, homeowners, and consumers save money by investing in energy efficiency.  The bottom line is that if this amendment is passed, we will increase energy efficiency, save consumers money, protect the environment and enhance our energy security.  According to the Alliance to Save Energy, in 2001 alone, Americans, with the help of Energy Star, saved $5 billion on their energy bills, reduced carbon dioxide emissions by the equivalent of taking 10 million cars off the road, and prevented 140,000 tons of nitrogen oxide emissions.  To date, more than 55,000 Energy Star homes have been built, locking in financial savings for homeowners of more than $15 million every single year.                              {time}  1545  Through the Energy Star Building Program, more than $25 billion kilowatt hours of energy have been saved. However, as successful as the Energy Star program has been, much more could be accomplished with increased funding. For example, it is estimated that if all consumers chose only Energy Star-labeled products over the next decade or so, the Nation's energy bill would be reduced by about $100 billion while avoiding 300 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions.  If all commercial building owners took advantage of the Energy Star program, they could achieve another $130 billion in energy savings and reduce 350 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 10 years.  Mr. Chairman, rising energy costs and consumer demands make today's investments in energy efficiency ever more vital to America's energy security.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp) for accepting this amendment. I think it is an excellent amendment, and we appreciate their support as well as the support of the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks) and the minority.
