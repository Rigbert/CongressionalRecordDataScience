Mr. Speaker, this is the people's House. This is what democracy is all about.  According to Timothy Mescon, dean of Kennesaw State College, political and academic resources were commingled in the preparation of the course he cotaught with Speaker Gingrich. This led Dean Mescon to admit to the Los Angeles Times this week that ``In hindsight, we would never do this again. There's no question about that * * * I feel horrendous about this thing, and it's embarrassing.''  Lois Kubal, a graduate student involved in the design of Speaker Gingrich.

There's no question about that * * * I feel horrendous about this thing, and it's embarrassing.''  Lois Kubal, a graduate student involved in the design of Speaker Gingrich's so-called course, says that ``the class at KSC was intended to be partisan and very political.''  Even more disturbing, course content was sold to corporate sponsors. According to a request for funding, potential donors were promised they could participate or work directly with the leadership of the project in the course development process in exchange for their $25,000 or $50,000 check. This is how the course is taught, the game is played, at Newt University.  Mr. Speaker, the charges keep piling up. We need an outside, independent, counsel to investigate the serious ethical charges hanging over the head of the Speaker of the House, and we need one now.                          ____________________
