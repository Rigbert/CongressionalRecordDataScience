Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, what we are talking about here is plain and simple. A $10 million subsidy to private western ranching interests, some in my own district, so I am not cutting something in someone else's district. And to the gentleman from Texas, this is a 30 percent cut in the overall budget and it is only the funds identified by Animal Damage Control Wildlife Services as being used for the ineffective, subsidized, government-agent-run lethal predator control program in the western United States which has given us more coyotes today than when they started spending the money 60 years ago.
