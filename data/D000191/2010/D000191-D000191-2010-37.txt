  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, you've got to give it to my friends on the Republican side of the aisle. They are incredibly consistent. They have sided with the big pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry. Sadly, they lost that debate, but they want to revisit it with the changes we made in health care and some of the outrageous health insurance practices we outlawed, like preexisting condition exclusions, rescissions of your policy when you get sick, and nonrenewal when you get sick.  But they're also fighting to change the subject here, because they're also trying to stop the reform on Wall Street. Their biggest patrons are the pharmaceutical industry, the insurance industry, and Wall Street. And they just want to protect the status quo for those folks.  Over on the other side of the Hill, the Republicans in the Senate are blocking financial reform--reform of Wall Street, doing away with the abuses that crashed our economy and put millions out of work. And every single House Republican voted against reforming Wall Street here on the floor of the House. Well, two were absent but all those who voted, voted against it. Now they want to change the subject back to health care, except they lost that debate, too.                          ____________________
