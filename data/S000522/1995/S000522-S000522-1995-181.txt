Mr. Speaker, I do not relish being put in the position of opposing the rule on welfare reform, but, in conscious and sincere disagreement with leadership, I must.  First, Mr. Speaker, let me note that I am grateful that my amendment to reform the so-called family cap by permitting welfare moms to get vouchers in lieu of cash to better provide for the necessities for their babies was made in order. So I say, ``Thank you for that.'' But I am deeply concerned that in an otherwise laudable drive to reduce illegitimacy and dependency we are poised to enact legislation that is likely to reward States that increase the number of abortions performed in that State while also making children more impoverished.  Both of these scenarios are unacceptable and are largely preventable.  [[Page H3441]] To mitigate these two possibilities, Mr. Speaker, four amendments were crafted. Only two were made in order--well, perhaps two and a half. It is my hope that a new rule would give us the opportunity to consider all four amendments, including the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. Bunn] and the Stark-Volkmer amendment.  Mr. Speaker, this so-called illegitimacy ratio provision in the bill is well meaning, but it is fatally flawed, and the Stark-Volkmer amendment would strike it. The illegitimacy ratio was not part of the Contract With America in its original form. The ratio might well have provided incentives to States to decrease their abortion rates to qualify for the monetary bonus stipulated in the bill. But the version contained in the bill today is likely to reward States that increase the number of abortions from the benchmark year, the year of enactment.  Mr. Speaker, the flaw is contained in the formula itself, again, which started out OK but was rewritten when objections were raised by certain proabortion Members. The formula is designed to curb illegitimacy; no problem there. But the means to that end uses the wrong numerator to calculate what is progress.  The original language, which I support, said: ``Add the number of out-of-wedlock births and abortions. Then divide the number by the total of births in that State. States that lowered the ratio by 1 percent would get a 5-percent extra block grant. Lower the ratio by 2 percent, and the State gets 10 percent extra.''  This is no perfect formula, but the ratio that would have promoted a decline of both abortion rates and illegitimacy.  The new formula, however, steers a far different course. The new formula says: ``Add the number of out-of-wedlock births to the number of additional abortions performed over those performed in the year the bill was enacted, and divide by the total births in that State. As some births in the State are legitimized by adoption or marriage, the numerator, as it relates to illegitimacy, will automatically decrease, leaving ample room for corresponding increases in abortion rates.'' In other words, that State can then achieve a, quote, good mark and get a big reward from Uncle Sam, even though the abortion rates have skyrocketed in that State.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a no vote on this rule, however unintended the consequences of the ratio will be to reward States that push abortions for welfare moms, and pay for them under their Medicaid provisions, and then declare victory by showing a good score on a flawed scorecard. Illegitimacy Ratio Test Would Reward States Even if Abortions Increase                      (By David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.)       An ``illegitimacy ratio bonus'' plan for states was added      to welfare reform legislation (H.R. 1214--known as the      personal Responsibility Act) by the full House Ways and Means      Committee. The plan would reward states financially for      reducing their ``illegitimacy ratio'' even in circumstances      where abortion increased. For this reason, NRLC is opposing      the ``illegitimacy ratio bonus'' plan as passed by the House      Ways and Means Committee and supports the Stark-Volkmer      Amendment to remove the bonus provision.                 The ``Illegitimacy Ratio Bonus'' Plan       The bill provides that federal welfare funds received by a      state be increased by 5% in any year in which the states      ``illegitimacy ratio'` (as defined below) is one percentage      point lower than in the year prior to enactment of the      legislation. The state's federal grant would be increased 10%      if the ratio was two percentage points lower than the year      prior to enactment.       The ``illegitimacy ratio'' in the year prior to enactment      is defined as the percentage obtained by dividing the number      of out-of-wedlock births by the total number of births. In      subsequent years it is defined as the percentage obtained by      dividing the number of out-of-wedlock births plus any      increase in abortion by the total number of births.                      Incentives for State Action       The ``illegitimacy ratio bonus'' plan is intended to be an      incentive for a state to adopt programs to discourage out-of-     wedlock childbearing. Such a campaign could consist of many      components including the denial of state aid to such      children, similar to the ``teen mother's child exclusion''      provision of the bill.       Whatever programs the state implements, however, there are      five possible changes in behavior people could utilize to      attempt to avoid an out-of-wedlock birth. They could: (1) Use      contraception, (2) abstain from sexual relations, (3) marry      before the birth of the child, (4) place the child for      adoption (for purposes of the bill's ratio test both marriage      and placing the child for adoption is considered to      ``legitimize'' the child), or (5) abort the child.       Under a comprehensive out-of-wedlock ``anti-childbearing''      campaign, it can be expected that a combination of all five      of the above changes in behavior would occur.       It is the fifth--aborting children conceived out of      wedlock--that NRLC must oppose. Unfortunately, as explained      below, the ratio test passed by the House Ways and Means      Committee allows abortions to increase significantly and the      state to still reap the financial reward of increased federal      funds.             how the ratio test allows increased abortions       For purposes of the ``illegitimacy ratio'' test, changes in      behavior in the second or subsequent years are treated      mathematically in the following manner. Those who avoid      pregnancy (and thus an out-of-wedlock birth) through either      contraception or abstention are treated the same: those      missing births disappear from both the numerator and the      denominator of the new ratio. Those who ``legitimize'' the      child either through marriage or adoption are also treated      the same: those births disappear from the numerator but      remain in the denominator.       Changes in behavior that result in increased abortions      rather than out-of-wedlock births do not actually affect the      numerator since these abortions would reduce the number of      births in the numerator but would also be added back in.      However, they do reduce the births in the denominator. While      this means that an abortion in lieu of an out-of-wedlock      birth does actually hurt the state's ratio, this is not      sufficient to prevent the state from receiving the bonus      while experiencing a substantial increase in abortions,      because the effect of the increase in abortions on the ratio      can easily be more than offset by the other changes in      behavior.       The following examples show how a state can receive the      bonus while increasing abortion:       Example 1: Suppose in the initial year a hypothetical state      has 100,000 births, 30,000 of them out-of-wedlock for an      ``illegitimacy ratio'' of .30. Then suppose the state      implements a rigorous anti out-of-wedlock child bearing      program that results in a 10 percent (i.e. 3,000) reduction      in out-of-wedlock births. (This is not an unreasonable      assumption since the New Jersey ``family cap'' has reportedly      resulted in a 13 percent decrease in births among AFDC      recipients.) Further, suppose this reduction of 3,000 out-of-     wedlock births was the result of 900 who successfully used      contraception or abstained, 900 more married or placed the      baby for adoption and 1,200 who had abortions.       Then, assuming other births and abortions remained      constant, the state's new ``illegitimacy ratio'' would be      28,200 (27,000 out-of-wedlock births plus 1,200 abortions)      divided by 97,900 reflecting the 900 non-conceptions and      1,200 abortions) which equals .288.       Thus, the state would qualify for the 5 percent federal      bonus even though abortions accounted for 40 percent of the      reduction in out-of-wedlock births.       Example 2: In the above example, again assume a 10 percent      change in behavior, but spouse the reduction of 3,000 out-of-     wedlock births is the result of 1,200 who successfully used      contraception or abstained, 1,300 who married or placed for      adoption and 500 who had abortions. In this case the new      ``illegitimacy ratio'' would equal 27,500 (27,000 out-of-     wedlock births plus 500 abortions) divided by 98,300      (reflecting the 1,200 non-conceptions and 500 abortions)      which equals .2798 or less than .28.       In this case, the state would qualify for the 10 percent      bonus in the federal funds, even though abortions accounted      for one-sixth of the reduction in out-of-wedlock births.       Example 3: As a generalization of Example 1, it can be      shown that if out-of-wedlock births initially account for 30      percent of all births and there is a 10 percent reduction in      out-of-wedlock births in the second year, with other births      and abortions remaining constant, and the reduction is due to      equal numbers of non-conceptions and ``legitimized'' babies      due to marriage or adoption, then the increase in abortions      can be as much as 1.3 percent of all births and the state      will still get the federal ``bonus.'' In this case, abortions      could equal up to 43% of the reduction in out-of-wedlock      births!       Example 4: In Example 3, the number of out-of-wedlock      births that were avoided through marriage or adoption      exceeded those that were avoided by reducing conceptions. For      an example where a greater number of out-of-wedlock births      are avoided by reducing conceptions, assume again that in the      initial year there were 100,000 births with 3,000 of them      out-of-wedlock for an ``illegitimacy ratio'' of .3.       In the second year, suppose there are 5,000 fewer out of      wedlock births due to 2,000 non-conceptions, 1,000 adoptions      or marriages and 2,000 abortions, and that other factors      remain constant. The new ``illegitimacy'' ratio would be      27,000 divided by 96,000 or about .28. The state would again      get the financial bonus despite the increase in abortions.
