 President, today, I am joining my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, in introducing the School Construction Financing Improvement Act of 1999.  The single most important source of funding for investment in public school construction and rehabilitation is the tax-exempt bond market. Tax-exempt bonds finance approximately 90 percent of the nation's investment in public schools. In my home state of Iowa over $625 million in tax-exempt bonds were issued to school districts in 1998 alone.  There is a well-recongized need throughout the country for billions of additional new dollars in school construction and rehabilitation. A report from the General Accounting Office says urban schools alone need $112 billion in repairs over three years to bring their buildings back into working order. That same study says about 14 million children attend U.S. schools in need of extensive repairs, and about 7 million attend schools with life threatening safety code violations.  American schoolchildren attending schools with leaky roofs, inadequate bathrooms, poor air quality, and unreliable fire protection equipment is an unacceptable state of affairs. We need to step up to the plate and address this issue, not only promptly, but also properly. The administration's proposed use of tax credit bonds is inherently unworkable and inefficient. The school districts in states all across this land need greater flexibility not more federal regulations and controls.  Tax-exempt bonds have proven to be an effective financial instrument to fund school rehabilitation and construction. Therefore, it is appropriate and necessary to examine tax code limitations on the use of tax-exempt bonds for schools and to consider ways to amend the code to give school districts even greater access to the capital they earnestly need and deserve. Let's expand on something that works.  The administration has proposed policy initiatives to enhance and expand the use of tax credit bonds called ``Qualified Zone Academy Bonds'' or QZABs. However the QZAB program has proven incapable of attracting investors due to inherent flaws in tax credit bonds that make them extremely illiquid and unpredictable investments, and specific limitations on the use of these bonds imposed by the federal government on the states. These significant and crippling limitations include the exclusion of individual investors from purchasing QZABs,the requirement that school districts secure hard to come by ``private business contributions'', and prohibitions on the use of QZABs to fund new school construction projects.  Experience and study has shown that tax exempt bonds are a more workable, more efficient, and more popular alternative to QZABs. This bill reflects my belief that the wisest course to achieving the goal of providing schools with necessary capital to build and rehabilitate our nation's schools is to continue refining tax code limitations on the use of tax-exempt bonds.  The legislation Senator Graham and I are introducing today is designed to narrowly target the use of tax-exempt bonds to school construction alone and do not change any tax code provisions designed to prevent abuse of bond issuance authority.  The first provision would allow school districts to make use of public-private partnerships in issuing tax-exempt bonds for public school construction or rehabilitation. The bonds would be exempt from the annual state volume caps. This will allow schools to leverage private investment in school facilities and would encourage school districts to partner with private investors in new and creative ways.  The second provision addresses the current two year construction spend-down exemption in arbitrage rebate regulations. This policy allows the exemption of bonds from arbitrage rebate if the issuer spends virtually all its bond proceeds within two years of the time these bonds for construction projects are issued. We recommend an extension of this exemption from two years to four years for school bonds. Often the two year limit is insufficient to cover major construction projects, especially when multiple projects are funded from a single bond issue. The extension of time limit on the exemption provision will also improve the flexibility of school districts that use bonds and relive the school bond issuer from superfluous and burdensome tax compliance costs.  The second provision would also raise from $10 million to $15 million the volume of school construction bonds a small school district could issue each year and still qualify for the small-issuer arbitrage rebate exemption. This provision expands the benefits of the small-issuer rebate exemption to a much broader universe of small school bond issuers.  The third provision of the bill would permit banks to invest in certain qualified tax-exempt school construction bonds without penalty. Before the Tax Reform Act of 1986 that imposed a tax penalty on banks that earn tax-exempt interest, commercial banks were one of the most active groups of investors in the municipal bond market. This provision would directly reduce the cost of borrowing for new school construction and would result in more investment in public schools.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Graham and myself in trying to help schools receive the crucial funds necessary to build and repair America's schools.                                 ______                                       By
