 President, today it is my privilege to congratulate Albert Hale, of Laurel County, KY, on his recent retirement after more than four decades of public service to his community. Hale left his position as emergency management director for the county earlier this year, and I would like to take this opportunity to join with the men and women of Laurel County in thanking him for his diligent service.  After graduating from high school, Hale began working for the Kentucky Department of Transportation as a heavy equipment operator. Then in 1994, he added second career working on a part-time basis for the county's sheriff's department. Since he took on that new responsibility more than 20 years ago, Hale had been ready to answer any call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Almost a decade later, Hale retired from the transportation department and began working full time for the sheriff's department. In that role, Hale coordinated with the U.S. Forest Service to assist in its efforts to patrol the area surrounding the Laurel Lake. In 2008, Hale left the sheriff's department for a position in the Laurel County jail's work-release program where he worked with inmates to help them find employment opportunities.  Two years later, Hale heard about a vacancy at the Laurel County Emergency Management Department. He applied and joined the department in 2010 as its director. In this role, Hale leads the support organization to help his community prepare for, respond to, and recover from a wide range of emergency situations. In this position, Hale had the opportunity to collaborate with emergency management professionals from across Kentucky.  As director, Hale remembered one particular event with great satisfaction. After a powerful tornado in Laurel County, a number of organizations and individuals came together to protect the community and to help it rebuild. In the face of a disaster, the citizens of Laurel County worked collaboratively to help their neighbors in need.  Throughout his long career, Hale has dedicated himself time and again to the service of his community. As he fondly looks back on his career, he also remembers the many family holidaysand occasions that he missed because of that service. So now, in his retirement, Hale looks forward to spending time with his wife, son, and grandchildren. However, if an unfortunate disaster were to strike the Laurel County community, Albert is ready to volunteer to serve the public once again.  I would like to join with Albert Hale's family and community in thanking him for his lifetime of service, and I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me.                          ____________________
