 We have heard on the Republican side this is just about the little guys. They only want to help the little guys. Except that the loopholes that they would create with the Lungren provisions could be used by the big guys. So if you like the status quo, if you like the fact that some of the largest insurance companies in America saw their profits go up by 56 percent last year, if you like the fact that in many States we are seeing huge, double-digit increases, over 50 percent in Michigan, 40 percent in California, 20 percent in my State, if you think the system's working today, then you should support Mr. Lungren's idea, preserve the status quo. That is what they are saying. Keep the loopholes. Allow them to continue to collude and price fix.  Now, there are a few other people who disagree with them. In fact, we had a bipartisan commission created by the Republican Congress when they controlled the House and the Senate and signed into law by President George Bush. The members were appointed by George Bush, the Republican heads of the House and the Senate. And their conclusions considered Mr. Lungren's arguments and they rejected them.  A bipartisan, professional commission created by the Republicans and George Bush said, after saying, yes, there are these arguments being made, but they say, ``Like all potentially beneficial competitor collaboration generally, however, such data sharing would be assessed by antitrust enforcers and the courts under a rule of reason analysis that would fully consider the potential procompetitive effects of such conduct and condemn it only if, on balance, it was anticompetitive.'' They don't want the Justice Department to have that capability. Theydon't want any additional levels of review.
