 President, today I rise to introduce the Social Security Advisory Board Sunshine Act. This legislation will apply the public meeting and disclosure requirements ofthe Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Social Security advisory board.  The Social Security Advisory Board was created in 1994 when the Social Security Administration became an independent agency. Its purpose is to serve as an advisor to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, the President and the Congress. The 1994 law requires the Board to make recommendations on some of the most critical issues facing the Social Security Administration and the country, including: How to ensure economic security for Government retirement and disability programs; how to ensure the solvency of Social Security programs; how to improve the quality of service and the policies and regulations that influence that service; and how to increase the public's understanding of Social Security.  With such a significant mandate, the question we should be asking is not why have open meetings, but why not have open meetings? This Board has been entrusted with the responsibility of making policy recommendations regarding the largest domestic Government program in this country. Virtually every American is affected by Social Security. Every American has a stake in Social Security. They have the right to know what recommendations are being made and why. The Federal Advisory Committee Act, which became public law in 1972 is intended to promote good Government values, such as openness, accountability, and balance of viewpoints. At the heart of the matter is a desire to keep the channels open between Government and the interested public.  Yesterday, during the confirmation hearing for Ken Apfel for the position of Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, I asked him if bringing the Advisory Board under the Sunshine laws was a good idea. He said, ``I think sunshine is almost always a good idea.''  My legislation would require the Advisory Board to provide notice of all meetings, make available for public inspection all Advisory Board documents, provide opportunities for nonmembers to participate in Board meetings, keep minutes of those meetings, and make transcripts of Advisory Board meetings available. In addition, the Social Security Administration will be required to disclose the disbursement of money to, and the disposal of money by, the advisory Board.  My legislation would also provide for compensation of the board members. Board members are paid per diem travel expenses, but they receive no compensation for the time they take off work to attend the meetings, which are held once a month. Because they have been given charge of such an important task, and because of the homework that must be done in order for them to be prepared and participate in meetings, compensation commensurate with that of similar boards and committees is only fair.  I want to commend the Board on the work it has done so far, particularly to highlight the need to expand the Social Security Administration's policy analysis capabilities. Those capabilities will be very important as we jump start discussions about Social Security reform.  The Advisory Board will be undergoing some changes in membership in the near future. I intend to work at getting this legislation enacted as soon as possible so the change in membership will occur with a change in the philosophy that Government is best done in the open and not behind closed doors.                                 ______                                       By
