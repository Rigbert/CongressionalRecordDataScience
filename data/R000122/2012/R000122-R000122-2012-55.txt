President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, Tim Johnson, Whitehouse, and Blumenthal in the introduction of the Immunization Improvements Act. This legislation builds on my longstanding work, including several provisions I authored in the Affordable Care Act, to improve vaccination rates and population-based immunity.  Our introduction of this legislation is particularly timely given a recent report cited in yesterday's Wall Street Journal revealing the number of deaths globally as a result of the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 and 2010. The analysis found that the number of deaths from H1N1 to be 15 times the original reports, up from 18,500 to 280,000 cases. In the United States, the estimates are more than triple the original cases, from 8,500 to nearly 30,000.  Two provisions of the legislation we are introducing today are based on efforts underway in Rhode Island to improve vaccination rates against seasonal influenza and pneumonia. Specifically, it would authorize a five-state demonstration project that allows the state to purchase certain vaccines and distribute them free of charge to physicians for administration in seniors, who are at the highest risk of death from these preventable diseases. In addition to increasing vaccination rates, this model has limited the cost and administrative burden for providers and reduced the cost of vaccines to the Federal government.  The legislation would also require hospitals and long-term care facilities to report on influenza vaccination rates of health care workers with direct patient contact, the population most likely to spread the flu to ill patients that may be too weak to fight it. In Rhode Island, simply requiring health care facilities to report on health care worker influenza vaccinations has resulted in improved rates.  The Immunization Improvements Act would also update the allowable vaccine administration fees to providerswho vaccinate uninsured and underinsured children, as well as include a recommendation made by both the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the Government Accountability Office to shift vaccine coverage in Medicare from Part D to Part B.  While there are many diseases and conditions that we have yet to prevent, there are those for which we already have vaccines. We must do more to ensure that these vaccines are available and accessed to protect the health of Americans.  This legislation has been endorsed by Every Child By Two, the Immunization Action Coalition, Partnership for Prevention, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, and Trust for America's Health. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see these provisions enacted.                                 ______                                       By
