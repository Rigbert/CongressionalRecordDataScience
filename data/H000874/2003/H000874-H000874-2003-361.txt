Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Rules for that assurance, and again would reiterate that I am presuming that those assurances go to the two particular items, as well as other items that clearly are in this bill. I thank the gentleman for his assurance.  Mr. Leader, you mentioned the tax bill, the jobs opportunity bill, that passed this House and which Senate is now considering, as I understand it. Assuming the Senate passes that piece of legislation today or tomorrow--I see the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means on the floor--when is it your expectation that they will go to conference on this bill?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do believe that the other body expects to complete consideration of the economic growth package later on this afternoon, or, if not this afternoon, sometime tomorrow. The final product that passes the other body will likely be dramatically different, if not dramatically less desirable, than what passed this body.  At this point I cannot give the gentleman a good sense of how or when this important legislation will be resolved. What I can say is that our hope is that we get the best, most robust growth bill to the President as soon as possible. As a tentative goal, we would like to get the bill to the President before we break for the Memorial Day recess.
