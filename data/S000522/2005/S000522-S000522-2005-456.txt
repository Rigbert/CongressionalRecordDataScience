Mr. Speaker, for about a year now a myth has been promoted that abortions have increased since President Bush was elected in 2000. This myth was launched publicly when Glen Stassen and Gary Krane published a piece in October of 2004, called ``Why abortion rate is up in Bush years'' that attempted to make the case that President Bush's pro-life policies have not been effective in decreasing abortion.  This mantra was picked up and repeated by many public figures and organizations who do not hold pro-life positions, but the facts simply do not support their claims. In fact, abortion has continued to decrease while President Bush has been in office, as demonstrated by an Annenberg Political Fact Check piece posted yesterday at www.factcheck.org and called ``Abortions rising under Bush? Not true. How that false claim came to be and lives on.''  To debunk the myth that the number of abortions have increased over the last 5 years, I am submitting the Annenberg Political Fact Check analysis to the Congressional Record:         [From the Annenberg Political Fact Check, May 25, 2005]  The Biography of a Bad Statistic--Abortions Rising Under Bush? Not           True. How That False Claim Came to be -and Lives On                                Summary       Politicians from Hillary Clinton and John Kerry to Howard      Dean have recently contended that abortions have increased      since George W. Bush took office in 2001.       This claim is false. It's based on an an opinion piece that      used data from only 16 States. A study by the Alan Guttmacher      Institute of 43 States found that abortions have actually      decreased.                                Analysis       A number of politicians and organizations have been      circulating an interesting and surprising idea: that      abortions have gone up under George W. Bush's watch. The      claim is repeated by supporters of abortion rights as      evidence that Bush's anti-abortion policies have backfired,      or at least been ineffective.       But the claim is untrue. In fact, according to the      respected Alan Guttmacher Institute, a 20-year decline in      abortion rates continued after Bush took office, as shown in      this graph: Source: Alan Guttmacher Institute, ``Trends in      Abortion in the United States''       Here's the story of how a false idea took hold.                      The Birth of a Bad Statistic       The claim that abortions are rising again can be traced      back to an opinion piece by Glen Harold Stassen, an ethics      professor at Fuller Theological Seminary. His article      originally appeared in a web and e-mail publication of      Sojourners, a Christian magazine, in October 2004. Several      other outlets, including the Houston Chronicle, also ran a      similar piece co-authored by Stassen and journalist Gary      Krane. The articles generated a good deal of discussion on a      number of both liberal and conservative blogs.       Describing himself as ``consistently pro-life,'' Stassen      reported that he ``analyzed the data on abortion during the      Bush presidency'' and reached some ``disturbing''      conclusions. ``Under President Bush, the decade-long trend of      declining abortion rates appears to have reversed,'' he said.      ``Given the trends of the 1990s, 52,000 more abortions      occurred in the United States in 2002 than would have been      expected before this change of direction.''       Stassen's broad conclusion wasn't justified by the sketchy      information he cited, however. Furthermore, a primary      organization he cited specifically as a source for historical      data now contradicts him, saying abortions have continued to      decline since Bush took office. More about that later.                        Hillary Clinton Uses It       Stassen offered his article as evidence that Bush's      economic policies were driving pregnant women to abortion.      And although he opposes abortion, his claim was soon picked      up and repeated uncritically by the other side--supporters of      abortion rights. In a speech to family-planning providers in      New York on January 24, 2005, Sen. Hillary Clinton recounted      decreases in the abortion rate that occurred in her husband's      administration, then lamented that the situation had changed.      She repeated exactly some of the figures that Stassen had      given in his Houston Chronicle article.       Clinton: But unfortunately, in the last few years, while we      are engaged in an ideological debate instead of one that uses      facts and evidence and common sense, the rate of abortion is      on the rise in some states. In the three years since      President Bush took office, 8 states saw an increase in      abortion rates (14.6 percent average increase), and four saw      a decrease (4.3 percent average), so we have a lot of work      still ahead of us.       Clinton was careful not to state flatly that abortions were      increasing nationally. She spoke only of ``some States'' in      which the rate had increased. However, she omitted any      mention of other States where abortions were going down,      inviting her listeners to conclude that the national trend      to fewer abortions had reversed itself since Bush took      office.       And in fact a few days later, in an interview on NBC's Meet      the Press on January 30, 2005, Senator John Kerry claimed      that abortions were up, period:       Kerry: And do you know that in fact abortion has gone up in      these last few years with the draconian policies that      Republicans have. . . .       A Kerry spokesman confirmed at the time to FactCheck.org      that Kerry was relying on the Stassen article for his      information.       Finally, as recently as May 24, 2005, Democratic National      Committee chairman Howard Dean also asserted on NBC News'      Meet the Press:       Dean: You know that abortions have gone up 25 percent since      George Bush was President?       Dean's ``statistic'' went unchallenged by moderator Tim      Russert, so millions of viewers probably got the impression      that Dean's very specific 25 percent figure was correct. But      Dean was wrong--and by a wide margin.       We asked the Democratic National Committee repeatedly where      Dean got his 25 percent figure, but we got no response. Even      if Stassen's estimate of 52,000 additional abortions were      correct, that would figure to an increase of less than 4      percent. And in any case the rate is going down, not up,      according to the most authoritative figures available.                           Cherrypicking Data       A close reading of Stassen's article makes clear that he      didn't even pretend to have comprehensive national data on      abortion rates. He said he looked at data from 16 States      only--and didn't even name most of them.       Stassen said that in the four States that had already      posted statistics for three full years of Bush's first term,      he found that abortion was up. Twelve more States had posted      statistics for 2 years of Bush's term--2001 and 2002--and      here the picture was mixed. According to Stassen, ``Eight      states saw an increase in abortion rates (14.6 percent      average increase), and five saw a decrease (4.3 percent      average).'' A version of the piece in the Houston Chronicle      reported instead that four saw a decrease with a 4.3 percent      average.       So Stassen was projecting findings onto the entire country      from 12 States that he said had showed an increase and 5 (or      maybe 4) that he said had shown a decrease. That leaves a      total of 34 other States for which Stassen had no data      whatsoever.       Furthermore, Stassen is contradicted by one of the very      organizations whose data he cites. The only primary source of      data that Stassen cites specifically in the article is the      Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization that      conducts a periodic survey of all known abortion providers,      which numbered nearly 2,000 at last count. Guttmacher's      statistics are widely used and respected by all sides in the      abortion debate. It is the only organization to compile      and publish national abortion-rate data other than the      federal Center for Disease Control. CDC's official      statistics, however, run only through 2001, so they shed      no light on what has happened since Bush took office.       And Guttmacher--as we shall see--now says abortion rates      have decreased since     Bush took office. And that's based on data from 43 States,      not just 16.                        De-bunking the statistic       Stassen's numbers, and the widespread acceptance they      seemed to be getting, prompted the Guttmacher Institute to      conduct a special analysis to update its comprehensive census      of abortion providers for the year 2000. The increases that      Stassen reported ``would be a significant change in a long-     standing trend in the U.S.,'' Leila Darabi of the institute      explained to Factcheck.       Besides the fact that Stassen claimed to have data only      from 16 States, the Guttmacher Institute said it is likely      that many of the States Stassen picked have higher abortion      rates historically, have a higher concentration of population      subgroups that tend to have more abortions, and see abortion      rates rise more quickly when they do go up. Stassen himself      named only Kentucky, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Colorado      among the 16 States he says he studied, but his co-author on      the Houston Chronicle article listed each State in a separate      article posted on the Internet.       The Guttmacher Institute found that two of the States      Stassen used had unreliable reporting systems. In Colorado,      for instance, where Stassen claimed that rates ``skyrocketed      111 percent,'' the reporting procedure had been recently      changed in order to compensate for historic underreporting.      Guttmacher also found Arizona had an inconsistent reporting      system.                               The Facts       The Guttmacher Institute announced its findings May 19.      Guttmacher analyzed available government data ``as an interim      measure until another provider census can be conducted''      according to a news release. The interim study analyzed data      from 43 States determined to have reliable State reporting      systems.       What it found was that the number of abortions decreased      nationwide--by 0.8 percent in 2001 and by another 0.8 percent      in 2002. The abortion rate, which is the number of women      having abortions relative to the total population, also      decreased 1 percent in 2001 and 0.9 percent in 2002. That's      not as rapid a decrease as had been seen in earlier years,      but it is a decrease nonetheless.       We give much weight to Guttmacher's analysis. Their figures      are widely used and accepted by both anti-abortion groups and      abortion-rights advocates. Their surveys of abortion      providers go back to 1973, and Stassen cites them himself as      the source for the number of abortions in 2000.       Guttmacher has little motive to make Bush and his anti-     abortion policies look good. The institute was founded in      1968 in honor of a former president of the Planned Parenthood      Federation of America, and describes its mission as being      ``to protect the reproductive choice of all women and men in      the United States and throughout the world.'' Had Stassen's      numbers proven accurate, the Institute ``would have reported      and widely publicized a rise in abortion rates,'' said      Darabi. But facts are facts.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1121-E1122]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]  FACTS SHOW CLAIMS OF INCREASED ABORTIONS OVER LAST FOUR YEARS DON'T                                 HOLD UP                                 ______                                                        HON.
