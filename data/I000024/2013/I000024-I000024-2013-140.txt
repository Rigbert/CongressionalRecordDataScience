President, we are looking at a lot of amendments right now, and I just want to call attention to one that I think is significant. It is one where, when people find out about it, they are just outraged that something like this could happen, and it is something that could be corrected with a very simple amendment.  My amendment addresses the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision of Zavidas.
