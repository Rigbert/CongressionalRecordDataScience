President, I come to the floor today to talk about an extraordinary Vermonter, Dr. Samuel B. Hand. Many people argue about what makes you a true Vermonter. Some say it is if you were born there; some say it is if you plan to die there. Until the debate is concluded, the person who could settle the matter is Dr. Hand.  While originally from Long Island, in 1961, Dr. Hand became a professor of European history at the University of Vermont, UVM. As a scholar with a passion for history, Dr. Hand quickly became one who added to Vermont's achievements and glories. He emphasized to his students the importance and the excitement of the history of Vermont, resulting in a number of his former students becoming teachers and archivists in Vermont.  Last month, the University of Vermont's Center for Research on Vermont honored Dr. Hand as the recipient of a lifetime achievement award for his expertise in Vermont history and his generous mentoring skills.  In addition to being the ``heart'' of the history department, as his colleagues called him, Dr. Hand coauthored a number of books, including ``Vermont Voices, A Documentary History of the Green Mountain State'' and ``A Vermont Encyclopedia'', and directed a National Endowment for the Humanities-funded series, ``Lake Champlain: Reflections on Our Past.'' He was also one of the founding members of the University of Vermont's Center for Research on Vermont and served as president of the Vermont Historical Society and as president of the Oral History Society. Today's editorial in the Burlington Free Press praises Dr. hand for ``extend[ing] his base beyond the walls of UVM and reinforced the important collaboration between the state's flagship university and Vermont.''  Both the University of Vermont and the State of Vermont are truly fortunate to have benefited from the dedication and intelligence of Dr. Hand. Vermonters likes him make me proud to represent such a great State. Mr. President, I would ask that this statement and the Burlington Free Press editorial be placed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, June 11, 2003]                           A Vermont Scholar       Samuel B. Hand still has a trace of Long Island in his      voice, but the retired University of Vermont history      professor knows more about Vermont than many of the state's      residents.       Hand was recognized for his contributions to the study of      his adopted state last month when he received a lifetime      achievement award from the University of Vermont's Center for      Research on Vermont, of which he was a founding member.       Although he started out teaching European history when he      arrived at UVM in 1961, Hand quickly saw the merit of      specializing in Vermont history.       His graduate students had a greater opportunity to have      their work published than if they had chosen a broader and      more heavily researched topic, and many of the students had a      personal connection to the state's history.       ``I might have a student from California who was a sixth-     generation UVMer with a grandfather who was once a state      senator,'' Hand said in an interview. ``Vermont history is      very personal.''       Beyond his mentoring of students--for which he was named      UVM graduate faculty teacher of the year in 1994, the year he      retired--Hand has been a prolific researcher and writer.       The professor of history emeritus has written many articles      about Vermont, and co-authored ``Vermont Voices, A      Documentary History of the Green Mountain State'' in 1998 and      ``A Vermont Encyclopedia,'' which will be out in August.       His book, ``The Star That Set, The Vermont Republican      Party, 1854-1974,'' was published last year.       Hand, 72, has brought together organizations and university      disciplines that share a common interest in Vermont. As a      former president of the Vermont Historical Society and last      year's recipient of the Founders Circle Award from the Ethan      Allen Homestead, Hand has extended his base beyond the walls      of UVM and reinforced the important collaboration between the      state's flagship university and Vermont.       Along the way, he has influenced students and aspiring      historians to see Vermont history--not as dry and distant--     but as alive and brimming with dramatic stories and      interesting characters, such as Ethan Allen, Samuel de      Champlain and former Gov. George Aiken, described by Hand as      ``the quintessential Vermonter against whom other Vermonters      measured themselves.''       Hand has played a major role in bringing Vermont stories to      life and encouraging people to know their roots and      appreciate their home. It is work well worth a lifetime      achievement award.                          ____________________
