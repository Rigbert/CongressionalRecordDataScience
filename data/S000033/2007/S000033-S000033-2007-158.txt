 President, I rise in strong opposition to the Cochran amendment. We should be very clear. For anybody who is interested in prescription drug reimportation, for anybody who is interested in lowering the cost of prescription drugs in this country from 25 to 50 percent, for anybody who is interested in standing up for the working families of this country who are getting ripped off every day by outrageously high prescription drug costs, the Cochran amendment is a poison pill. To vote for the Cochran amendment is to vote against prescription drug reimportation; it is to kill the Dorgan amendment.  The idea of asking permission from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, from the Bush administration, who have already gone on record rather firmly and decisively in opposition to reimportation, is to simply mask your vote. The Bush administration represents the pharmaceutical industry. They will kill prescription drug reimportation. To ask their permission to go forward is simply to kill prescription drug reimportation. So anyone who is serious about lowering the cost of prescription drugs will not be supporting the Cochran amendment.  The unfortunate reality is, in the United States of America we continue to pay, by far--it is not even close--the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Because of the escalating cost of medicines, many of our fellow Americans, many working people, many people with chronic health problems, simply do not get their prescriptions filled. I am sure in Montana the experience is the same as it is in Vermont. People tell me they walk into the drugstore and cannot believethe prices they are being charged. They can't afford those prices. I have talked to pharmacists, as I suspect the Chair has as well, who have been embarrassed. They have seen tears coming out of people's eyes when they have told them the cost of their medicine.  Meanwhile, as a result of the power of the pharmaceutical industry, we have the highest prices in the world, and those prices are rising every single day. In fact, tomorrow, if an American walks into a pharmacy and the pharmacist says to that person: I am sorry to have to tell you this, but the cost of your medicine went up 50 percent, or 75 percent, we can do nothing about it. Unlike the rest of the industrialized world--Canada, Europe--where they understand prescription drugs are an integral part of a whole strategy regarding health care, we let the drug companies do anything they want to do.  As the first Member of Congress to take constituents across the Canadian border to enable them to pay substantially lower prices than they were paying in the United States, I have seen firsthand what it means to people's lives when they get the drugs they need at a price they can afford. I will never forget--never forget--when in 1999 I brought a busload of Vermonters over the Canadian border. Many of the women there were struggling with breast cancer, fighting for their lives, and they didn't have a whole lot of money. They went to Montreal and purchased Tamoxifen, a widely prescribed breast cancer drug, which at that time--at that time--was one-tenth the price they were paying in the United States. Imagine that. Fighting for your life, not having a lot of money, and needing a drug. Suddenly, they looked at the price they were paying and they literally could not believe it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart which compares prices in the year 2005--so the prices may be different today, but as of April 2005, a price comparison between United States prices and Canadian prices, and United States prices and German prices.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 SOME PRICE COMPARISONS AS OF 4/06/2005------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                Canadian        Drug  (in US $)          Illness/condition   US price    price------------------------------------------------------------------------Actos (15mg, 90)...............  diabetes.........     296.89     257.97Cardizem CD (240mg, 90)........  heart............     215.89      88.03Celexa (20mg, 30)..............  depression.......      81.99      52.05Clarinex (5mg, 30).............  allergies........      74.99      37.31Fosamax (10mg, 100)............  osteoporosis.....     242.89     178.62Imitrex (50mg, 27).............  migraines........     503.89     365.08Nexium (20mg, 30)..............  heartburn........     144.99      87.77Norvasc (5mg, 90)..............  blood pressure...     127.59     135.32Prevacid (15mg, 30)............  ulcers...........     129.99      74.40Prilosec (20mg, 30)............  ulcer............     128.99      74.50Procardia XL (30mg, 30)........  heart............      53.99      33.84Relafen (500mg, 200)...........  arthritis........     340.19     183.86Tamoxifen (20mg, 30)*..........  breast cancer....      68.59      40.21Ticlid (250mg, 60).............  stroke...........     171.99     101.36Vasotec (10mg, 60).............  heart............      70.99      63.30Zocor (20mg, 30)...............  cholesterol......     131.99      74.65Zoloft (50mg, 100).............  depression.......     227.49     182.04Zyrtec (10mg, 30)..............  allergies........      69.99      41.87------------------------------------------------------------------------Drug                             Illness/condition   US Price    German(in US $)                                                        price------------------------------------------------------------------------Actos (15mg, 30)...............  diabetes.........     116.64      50.62Celexa (20mg, 30)..............  depression.......      85.46      35.72Clarinex (5mg, 30).............  allergies........      77.06      38.64Imitrex (50mg, 9)..............  migraines........     166.40     102.67Nexium (20mg, 30)..............  heartburn........     145.33      60.25Norvasc (5mg, 30)..............  blood pressure...      54.83      35.72Prevacid (15mg, 30)............  ulcers...........     146.47      35.22Zocor (50mg, 30)...............  cholesterol......      85.39      23.83Zoloft (50mg, 30)..............  depression.......      89.44      54.98Zyrtec (10mg, 30)..............  allergies........      73.02      34.33------------------------------------------------------------------------All prices found via www.walgreens.com and www.canadadrugs.com.*Price found at www.cvs.com.
