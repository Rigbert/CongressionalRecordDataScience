Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, listening to the gentleman from New York the last hour and a half, he seems to be making two points. One is that this bill requires that the parental involvement laws of a minor's State of residence carry along with the minor if they are brought across the State line into a jurisdiction that does not have a parental involvement law, and that this is some new notion in American jurisprudence and in our history of Federalism.  Well, the gentleman from New York, he and I carry the burden of our respective State income taxes with us to the work that we do here; and as most people know, New York and Wisconsin's State income taxes are quite high, and we have to pay those State income taxes as residents and as representatives of the States for the work that we do at our Nation's Capital.  The other thing is that it is somehow cruel and unconstitutional to force the involvement of parents where the parental involvement acts have been held constitutional by the Federal courts.  Now, a constitutional parental involvement act is not cruel; it is loving. It is not unconstitutional, because the courts have already said it is not unconstitutional. So to merely cross the State line for the purpose of evading a constitutional parental involvement act is not unconstitutional in and of itself, because Congress has got the exclusive right to regulate interstate commerce under the United States Constitution.  For all these reasons, this is a good bill. The House should pass this bill today, like it has done in the two previous Congresses.
