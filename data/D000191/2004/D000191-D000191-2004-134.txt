  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, well, congratulations to the Bush economic team. Yet another record under their belt. Last Friday, it was the announcement that no private sector jobs had been created in America and that they are presiding over the largest job loss since Herbert Hoover in the 1920s, but today, they are touting their record on trade, a new record, a $43 billion one month trade deficit, and they say this shows the U.S. economy is recovering.  Why? We are running a large and growing trade deficit. This is recovery at the Bush White House, a jobless recovery because they are engaging in trade practices that are exporting themanufacturing base of this country, now the intellectual technology base of this country. They say it is good to outsource jobs, although they are trying to change the word there, that is, U.S. jobs sent overseas are good for American consumers. The problem is Americans need jobs to be able to consume, and under this administration, those jobs are not available here because they are being shipped to China, but this is good news, says the Bush administration.                          ____________________
