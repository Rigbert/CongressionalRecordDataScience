Speaker, I would just note, if the gentleman will yield, that a number of States, Michigan being one, have just embarked on a program that in fact will help how many HMO seniors, those as high as 150 percent of poverty. But again, it is not a very high dollar figure, as the gentleman suggested.  But what do we do with those States that already have something in place? We have to be very careful not to undo what they have done, and yet try to encourage other States to follow the same lead that States like Michigan have already taken.
