 President, I want to particularly commend the five Democrats who voted not to shut the government down. The new Senator from Alabama, during his campaign, said it was important to fund the S-CHIP program before it ran out of money, and he listened to the seven Democratic Governors who said: This is an emergency; we need help.  There were five courageous Democrats on the other side who stood up to this ridiculous argument that it made sense somehow to shut down the government over an illegal immigration issue that the vast majority of this body would like to do something about anyway.  I want to particularly commend the five Democrats who had the courage to stand up to this ridiculous strategy that put their whole party in an incredible predicament because, as the White House just indicated, the President is not going to talk about the issue at all while the government is shut down. He made it quite clear. He said: ``When Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform.''  So this particular strategy has eliminated the possibility of getting a signature on the thing they shut the government down over. Can anybody explain to me this strategy? I am perplexed. I wasn't first in my class, but I wasn't last either. How does this get them what they are looking for?  We will continue to talk because when all the games stop, the issues are still there--every single one of them are still there. The American people expect us to act like adults, to get together and solve the problems.  Now I will be offering an amendment to change the date to February 8. We will, unfortunately, not be able to get that vote tonight, but I will be subsequently asking for consent, but at some point here, we will be voting on February 8. That is the date the senior Senator from South Carolina and I have been talking about, and the Democratic leader and I have been talking about--which begins to move a little bit closer to where our friends on the other side said they wanted to be--but a reasonable period of time that takes into account the State of the Union, our party conferences, and the amount of time it takes to actually write a bill once you have an agreement. You can't just reach an agreement, snap your fingers, and everything falls into place and you are ready to go. It is a reasonable period to first agree, and then write, get ready to negotiate a settlement that we have been working on for months. February 8 is a very reasonable time. I hear there is sentiment for that on both sides of the aisle. I hope so.  At some point, we will vote on that option. I can't get that vote tonight, but I am going to ask consent to have that vote tonight.            Vote on Motion to Refer with Amendment No. 1905  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to table the motion to refer.
