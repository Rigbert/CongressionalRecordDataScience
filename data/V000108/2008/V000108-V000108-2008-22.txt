 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5472, a measure to name a post office in honor of our departed colleague and dear friend, Representative Julia Carson.  I would like to thank the 46 Members of the House who agreed to support and cosponsor this measure, as well as Senator Bayh for introducing S. 2534, the Senate companion legislation.  I would also like to acknowledge that Representative Meek and Representative David Scott have expressed their support, though they were unable to become official cosponsors of the measure due to its rapid movement out of committee. I would also be remiss if I did not thank the Chair and the ranking member of the full committee, as well as the ranking member and Chair of the subcommittee for considering the bill and reporting it out.  Julia Carson was a tremendous human being. She passed away on December 15 after a life devoted to service. And as I pointed out last December, with the solstice upon us, the darkest day of the year, that Julia Carson was a light to everyone she came into contact with and certainly was a beacon in this House.                              {time}  1115  She could be tough, she could be gentle, but she was always effective.  It is a tribute to her life and to her service to name this Federal facility after her. And I only speak for myself when I would say, however, that Julia is probably looking in on this, is honored, but asking, why aren't we out helping someone else right now, because that was her life. And I would hope that we all take this moment and this honor to rededicate ourselves to helping others along life's path as this great and wonderful and kind and gentle woman has done.  Again, I thank the Chair and ranking member for their courtesy.
