President, last Friday I introduced S. 940, the Landmine Use Moratorium Act of 1995, which seeks to spark international cooperation to stop the maiming and killing of tens of thousands of people each year by landmines.  I further ask to have printed in the Record a portion of a statement issued on June 16, 1995, by the U.S. Catholic Bishops at their semi-annual meeting in Chicago, entitled ``Sowing Weapons of War: A Pastoral Reflection on the Arms Trade and Landmines.'' In that statement the Bishops call on the United States to lead an international effort to ban the use of antipersonnel landmines. That is the goal announced by President Clinton at the United Nations last December, and my legislation aims to move us toward that goal.  The statement follows: Excerpt From Sowing Weapons of War: A Pastoral Reflection on the Arms                           Trade and Landmines       Banning Landmines: An Urgent Task. Finally, we would like      to add our voice to appeals of Pope John Paul II and the      growing movement to control and eventually ban anti-personnel      landmines. The Holy Father has issued ``a vigorous appeal for      the definitive cessation of the manufacture and use of those      arms called `anti-personnel mines' . . . In fact, they      continue to kill and to cause irreparable damage well after      the end of hostilities, giving rise to severe mutilations in      adults and above all, in children.'' Some 100 million of      these hidden killers are strewn around the world, killing an      estimated 500 people per week, most of whom are civilians. In      Cambodia, one of every 236 people is an amputee because of      mine blasts. While landmines can be used responsibly for      legitimate defense, they are often indiscriminate in use,      especially in the intra-state conflicts which are so      prevalent today. Moreover, landmines are indiscriminate in      time because, as the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace      has pointed out, they cause ``unacceptable damage to civilian      populations long after the cessation of hostilities.'' From      Cambodia to Angola, large areas have been rendered      uninhabitable, preventing refugees from returning to their      homes, inhibiting post-war reconstruction, and producing an      ongoing threat to innocent life.       The United States should lead an international effort to      reduce and ultimately ban the use of anti-personnel      landmines, just as was done with chemical and biological      weapons. The current moratorium on U.S. exports of landmines      is commendable; it should be made permanent and should be      extended globally. The United States should also take steps,      such as those called for in legislation now before Congress,      to further restrict its own use of landmines, while it      pursues with urgency and persistence international agreements      to restrict use globally. The decision to ratify the      Conventional Weapons Convention and to seek to strengthen it      during its review this year is welcome. Finally, our      government should continue to take a leadership role in      developing an international effort on the costly and time-     consuming process of demining, so important to the protection      of innocent life and reconstruction in so many war-torn      countries.                               ____________________
