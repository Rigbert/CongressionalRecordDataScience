President, I rise in support of the Voinovich amendment on diesel emissions reductions. I am an original cosponsor of the legislation which is the same as this amendment. I agree with the intent of this amendment, I believe it is helpful to provide a voluntary national and state-level grant and loan program to promote the reduction of diesel emissions. However, I am concerned that this proposal is being rushed through the process without the benefit of consideration by the committee of jurisdiction, the Environment and Public Works Committee, which I chair.  I would prefer, prior to Senate action, that the Environment and Public Works Committee conduct legislative hearings on the issue, and ensure that the program design meets its goals in a cost-effective manner. I am concerned about the $1 billion cost of the program and I believe the goals might be accomplished with a smaller sum. I also believe that if this amendment is adopted, it needs to be reconciled with section 723 of this bill. I hope these issues will be given consideration as this legislation is reconciled with the House of Representatives.
