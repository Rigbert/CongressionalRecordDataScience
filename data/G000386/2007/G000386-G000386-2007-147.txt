 All the amendments that needed to come up--and there was kind of a convoluted way of putting it together with the tax bill that opened up a lot of other avenues and amendments that were brought up. But it really worked out well, and it is in the tradition of the Senate, and I thank you very much for your leniency in regard to letting everything that needed to be discussed, be discussed. I appreciate that.                          ____________________
