Our country has always stood with, not against, refugees. I have heard Members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans, Senators and Congressmen, step forward and talk about religious persecution in other countries. I have heard people on both sides of the aisle lamenting some of these human rights abuses in other countries where people who are simply expressing their points of view are imprisoned.  We have said, and I believe, that the United States is in favor of freedom around the world. So the victims of oppression, the victims of tyranny, the victims of dictatorships, when they escape, come to the shores of the United States and ask us if we will give them refuge until their country changes. And we have done it. It is one thing to say you stand for freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom of the press; it is another to prove it by accepting these refugees.  This bill, the so-called REAL ID Act, will make it much more difficult for those refugees to come to our shores. If this becomes law, it will become very difficult for individuals fleeing persecution and torture to receive asylum in the United States. If we shut the door to the most vulnerable, how can we continue to preach to the rest of the world about our commitment to democracy?  Remember President Reagan's vision of our Nation. He called it ``a shining city on a hill.'' Here is what he said:       If there have to be city walls, the walls have doors and      the doors are open to anyone with the will and heart to get      here. . . . The city is a beacon . . . a magnet for all who      must have freedom, for all pilgrims from all the lost places      who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.  Like me, President Reagan was the son of an immigrant. We had very different political philosophies, but President Reagan understood that our great country has always been a sanctuary for those fleeing persecution and oppression.  Even the conservative Wall Street Journal is opposed to the REAL ID Act. In an editorial they called the driver's license provisions ``costly and intrusive.'' They said:       It's not hard to imagine these de facto national ID cards--  Which they believe this bill would create--     turning into the kind of domestic passport that U.S. citizens      would be asked to produce for everyday commercial and      financial tasks.  They also called the asylum provisions ``dubious.'' That is the Wall Street Journal. Listen to what they said:       The last thing a terrorist would want to do is apply for      asylum. Not only would he be bringing himself to the      attention of the U.S. government--the first step is being      fingerprinted--but the screening process for applicants is      more rigorous than for just about anyone else trying to enter      the country. . . . Raising the barrier for asylum seekers at      this point would only increase the likelihood of turning away      the truly persecuted.  That is the Wall Street Journal, not known as a bleeding-heart publication. They think the REAL ID Act makes no sense in fighting terrorism.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the editorial printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 17, 2005]                           National ID Party       Republicans swept to power in Congress 10 years ago      championing State prerogatives, and one of their first acts      was to repeal Federal speed-limit requirements. Another was      aimed at ending unfunded State mandates. So last week's House      vote to require costly and intrusive Federal standards for      State drivers' licenses is a measure of how far the party has      strayed from these federalist principles.       More important, it reveals a mindset among some that more      enforcement alone will bring better border security and      reduce illegal immigration. The bill that passed the House      last week and now goes to the Senate is known as the Real ID      Act, and the driver's license requirements may not even be      the worst part of the legislation. Also included are      unnecessary provisions that would make it much more difficult      for foreigners to seek asylum in the U.S.       House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, who authored      the bill, insists that his goal is to reduce the terrorist      threat, not immigration. But it just so happens that the      bill's provisions have long occupied the wish list of anti-     immigration lawmakers and activists. Mr. Sensenbrenner      produced a photo of Mohammed Atta during the floor debate      last week, arguing that the 9/11 hijackers' ability to obtain      drivers' licenses and use them to board airplanes represents      a security loophole.       His solution is to force States to issue federally approved      drivers' licenses with digital photographs and ``machine-     readable technology.'' In theory, states can opt out, but if      they do their drivers' licenses will no longer be accepted as      identification to board planes, purchase guns, enter Federal      buildings and so forth. It's not hard to imagine these de      facto national ID cards turning into a kind of domestic      passport that U.S. citizens would be asked to produce for      everyday commercial and financial tasks.       Aside from the privacy implications of this show-us-your-     papers Sensenbrenner approach, and the fact that governors,      State legislatures and motor vehicle departments have      denounced the bill as expensive and burdensome, there's      another reality: Even if the Real ID Act had been in place      prior to 9/11, it's unlikely that the license provisions      would have prevented the attacks.       That's because all of the hijackers entered the U.S.      legally, which means they qualified for drivers' licenses.      The Real ID Act wouldn't change that. Moreover, you don't      need a driver's license to fly. Other forms of      identification--such as a passport--are acceptable and also      were available to the hijackers. Nothing in the Sensenbrenner      bill would change that, either.       The biggest impact will be on undocumented workers in the      U.S., which is why the immigration restrictionists are      pushing for the legislation. But denying drivers' licenses to      illegal aliens won't result in fewer immigrants. It will      result in more immigrants driving illegally and without      insurance.       Mr. Sensenbrenner's claims that tougher asylum provisions      will make us safer are also dubious. The last thing a      terrorist would want to do is apply for asylum. Not only      would he be bringing himself to the attention of the U.S.      government--the first step is being fingerprinted--but the      screening process for applicants is more rigorous than for      just about anyone else trying to enter the country. In the      past decade, perhaps a half-dozen individuals with some kind      of terrorists ties have applied for asylum. All were      rejected.       The Real ID Act would raise the bar substantially for      granting asylum to people fleeing persecution. But this is a      solution in search of a problem. A decade ago the U.S. asylum      laws were in fact being abused by foreigners with weak claims      who knew they would receive work permits while their cases      were pending.       But in 1994, the Clinton Administration issued regulations      to curb this abuse. The law now says that asylum seekers      cannot receive work permits until they have won their case.      Applications per year subsequently have fallen to about      30,000 today from 140,000 in the early 1990s. This was the      biggest abuse of the system, and it's been fixed. Raising the      barrier for asylum seekers at this point would only increase      the likelihood of turning away the truly persecuted.       But the bigger problem with Mr. Sensenbrenner's bill is      that is takes our eye off the ball. Homeland security is      about taking useful steps to prevent another attack. It's not      about keeping gainfully employed Mexican illegals from      driving to work, or cracking down on the imagined hordes      gaming our asylum system.       President Bush realizes this and is pushing for a guest-     worker program that would help separate people in search of      employment from potential terrorists. If the Republican      Congress doesn't realize that, perhaps a Presidential veto of      the Real ID Act would focus its attention.
