Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me time, especially since he knows that I disagree with his package. But he also is a fair player, because he understands that the Committee on Rules did not give the Committee on Appropriations any time under this rule. That is strange, inasmuch as the Committee on Appropriations will be affected more than any other committee in the House based on what happens here today. Even so, we were given no time under the rule. But I voted for the rule, just to keep the process going.  I want to say again, as I did earlier this morning, we need a budget. We need budget caps. And I have said that in defense of resolutions presented by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) on numerous occasions. As chairman, I need the budget caps to have the discipline in committee to keep spending from running wild. As a matter of fact, last year the Committee on Appropriations denied $18 billion worth of amendments that would have increased spending.  But I do not appreciate his package. I think we do need budget process reform, and I cannot describe everything that I think needs to be done in the 2 minutes I have left. What I suggest is in an amendment I offered but was not made in order by the Committee on Rules. What we need is a commission or committee, bipartisan and bicameral, of this Congress, to sit down and thoroughly study the problems and make a recommendation, without regard to politics, without regard to this person or that person or somebody else. This Committee would make a recommendation to the Congress as to what budget process will work.  Now, the one main reason that I am opposed to the budget process bill offered by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle) is, first of all, it has multiyear caps. When it was first reported, it had 5-year multiyear caps with no numbers. No numbers. We were going to set 5-year caps, but with no numbers.  Well, as of last night, a decision was made to change that bill and make it 2-year caps with numbers. At one point I was promised that my committee could have some input into what those numbers would be. I did not hear what the numbers were until I read it in Congress Daily yesterday morning. I think that we deserved a little more consideration than that.  But the big concern is statutory caps, which is what this package presents. Statutory caps are different than caps set by a concurrent resolution. Statutory caps would bring the executive branch into the mix of setting a budget. That is not the role of the executive branch of government.
