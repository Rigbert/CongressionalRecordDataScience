Speaker, I would like to provide a more detailed explanation--including a section-by-section analysis--of the Biomass Research and Development (R) Act of 2000 included as Title III of H.R. 2559, the Agricultural Risk Reduction Act.  The Biomass R Act of 2000 combines features of three separate bills that were referred to the Committee on Science: Title I of S. 935 and H.R. 2827, the National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals Act of 1999; and H.R. 2819, the Biomass Research and Development Act of 1999. This important piece of legislation would help fund the research, development, and demonstration (RD) necessary to bring to market affordable biobased industrial products, including fuels, chemicals, building materials, or electric power or heat produced from biomass.  I want to express my appreciation to many Members of the House and Senate for all of their hard work in crafting the Biomass R Act of 2000. This includes: the Ranking Minority Member (Mr. Hall of Texas) and Mr. Udall of Colorado of the House Committee on Science; the Chairman (Mr. Combest) and Ranking Minority Member (Mr. Stenholm) of the House Committee on Agriculture; the Chairman (Mr. Ewing) and Ranking Minority Member (Mr. Condit) of the House Committee on Agriculture's Subcommittee on Risk Management, Research and Specialty Crops; the Chairman (Mr. Lugar) and Ranking Minority Member (Mr. Harkin) of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and the Chairman (Mr. Murkowski) and Ranking Minority Member (Mr. Bingaman) of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.Section-by-Section Analysis--Biomass Research and Development (R) Act  of 2000--(Title IV of H.R. 2559, the Agricultural Risk Reduction Act)                       Section 401. Short Title.       Section 401 cites Title III as the ``Biomass Research and      Development Act of 2000'' (hereafter, ``Act'').                         Section 402. Findings.       Section 2 lists 13 findings.                       Section 403. Definitions.       Section 403 defines ten terms: (1) ``Advisory Committee,''      (2) ``Biobased Industrial Product,'' (3) ``Biomass,'' (4)      ``Board,'' (5) ``Initiative,'' (6) ``Institution of Higher      Education,'' (7) ``National Laboratory,'' (8) ``Point of      Contact,'' (9) ``Processing,'' and (10) ``Research and      Development.''       The term ``biomass'' means ``any organic matter that is      available on a renewable or recurring basis, including      agricultural crops and trees, wood and wood wastes and      residues, plants (including aquatic plants), grasses,      residues, fibers, and animal wastes, municipal wastes, and      other waste materials.'' The conferees gave specific      consideration to a proposal to exclude old-growth timber and      unsegregated municipal solid waste (garbage) from the      definition of biomass, and rejected the proposal as being      scientifically unsound.       Also, the term ``research and development'' means      ``research, development, and demonstration.'' Department of      Energy (DOE) activities conducted under this Act are subject      to the cost-sharing provisions of section 3002 of the Energy      Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486).   Section 404. Cooperation and Coordination in Biomass Research and                               Development       Section 404 mandates cooperation and coordination between      the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy with      respect to policies and procedures that promote R leading      to the production of biobased industrial products. In order      to facilitate this cooperation and coordination, a senior      official in each of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)      and DOE is to be designated as a ``point of contact.'' The      points of contact are to assist in arranging interlaboratory      and site-specific supplemental agreements for research,      development, and demonstration projects relating to biobased      industrial products; serve as cochairpersons of the Board;      administer the Initiative; and respond in writing to each      recommendation of the Advisory Committee.          Section 405. Biomass Research and Development Board.       Section 405 requires the Secretaries of Energy and      Agriculture to jointly establish the Biomass Research and      Development Board to coordinate programs within and among      departments and agencies of the Federal Government for the      purpose of promoting the use of biobased industrial products.      This Board is to supercede the Interagency Council on      Biobased Products and Bioenergy established by Executive      Order 13134. This section also specifies the Board's: (b)      membership, (c) duties, (d) funding, and (e) frequency of      meetings.   Section 406. Biomass Research and Development Technical Advisory                                Committee.       Section 406 establishes the Biomass Research and      Development Technical Advisory Committee, which is to      supercede the Advisory Committee on Biobased Products and      Bioenergy established by Executive Order 13134. This section      also specifies: (b) the Advisory Committee's membership and      appointment process; (c) duties; (d) coordination; (e)      frequency of meetings; and (f) terms. With respect to terms,      section 406(f) specifies that members of the Advisory      Committee shall be appointed for a term of 3 years, except      that--(1) \1/3\ of the members initially appointed shall be      appointed for a term of 1 year; and (2) \1/3\ of the members      initially appointed shall be appointed for a term of 2 years.       Section 407. Biomass Research and Development Initiative.       Section 407(a) requires the Secretary of Agriculture and      the Secretary of Energy, acting through their respective      points of contact and in consultation with the Biomass      Research and Development Board, to establish and carry out a      Biomass Research and Development Initiative under which      competitively awarded grants, contracts, and other financial      assistance are provided to, or entered into with, eligible      entities to carry out research, development, and      demonstration on biobased industrial products.       Other provisions of Section 407 address: (b) the purposes      of grants, contracts, and other financial assistance under      this section; (c) eligible entities; (d) uses of grants,      contract, and assistance; (e) technology and information      transfer to agricultural users; and (f) authorization of      appropriations.       Section 407(c)(2)(D) requires that preference be given to      applications for grants, contract, and assistance under this      section that: (i) involve a consortia of experts from      multiple institutions; and (ii) encourage the integration of      disciplines and application of the best technical resources.      However, this ``preference'' is not meant to negate the      requirements of Section 407(c)(2)(D) requiring that ``grants,      contracts, and assistance under this section be awarded      competitively, on the basis of merit, after the establishment      of procedures that provide for scientific peer review by an      independent panel of scientific and technical peers''.       Section 407(f) provides that in addition to funds      appropriated for biomass R under the general authority of      the Secretary of Energy (which may also be used to carry out      this Act), there are authorized to be appropriated to the      Department of Agriculture to carry out this Act $49.0 million      for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2005.             Section 408. Administrative Support and Funds.       To the extent administrative support and funds are not      provided by other agencies under section 408(b), section      408(a) authorizes the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary      of Agriculture to provide such administrative support and      funds of DOE and USDA to the Board and the Advisory Committee      as are necessary to enable the Board and the Advisory      Committee to carry out this Act. Section 408(c) provides that      not more than 4 percent of the amount appropriated for each      fiscal year under section 407(f) may be used to pay the      administrative costs of carrying out this Act.                         Section 409. Reports.       Section 409 specifies the Act's reporting requirements,      which include: (a) an initial report and (b) annual reports.                 Section 410. Termination of Authority.       Section 410 terminates the authority under this Act on      December 3 1, 2005.                               ____________________
