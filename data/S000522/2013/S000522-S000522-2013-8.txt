Mr. Pascrell, I want to thank you for your eloquent, very eloquent remembrances of Senator Frank Lautenberg and for your wonderful insights, especially as the former mayor and someone who has known him so intimately and so well for so many years. Thank you very much for that.  I'd like to now yield to my friend and colleague, Mr. Payne.
