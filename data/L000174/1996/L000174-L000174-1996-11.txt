President, the continuing resolution is a massive piece of legislation. I want to comment on some of the provisions in this bill that may not be big-ticket items but are of particular significance in addressing the crime problems facing our Nation and ensuring that our citizens are able to obtain FBI records to which they are entitled under our public access laws.            fbi processing of foia and privacy act requests  The legislation appropriates $3,327,000 to the FBI to address backlogs in the processing of requests for agency records under the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA] and Privacy Act. By letter, dated July 8, 1996, to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies, Senator Specter and I urged this amount be appropriated. While the FOIA requires that agencies respond to requests for agency records within 10 business days, most agencies do not meet this legal requirement, resulting in huge backlogs of FOIA requests. The FBI's backlog is among the largest. On May 31, 1996, the FBI had a backlog of 15,259 requests, with some requests dating back to 1992. Long delays in access--particularly delays of almost 4 years--really means no access at all for many requesters.  A cornerstone of our democracy is the people's right to know about the actions of their Government. The FOIA represents Congress' implementation of this basic principle. The FOIA sets out the procedures by which people may request information from the Federal Government. Federal agencies must provide the information in a timely manner, unless it falls within enumerated exemptions from the FOIA.  The funds earmarked for FOIA and Privacy Act request processing represents an important effort to address this huge backlog. In addition, the electronic FOIA amendments, which I sponsored with Senators Brown and Kerry, provides a number of steps to make the process of requesting agency records easier and faster. These Electronic FOIA amendments unanimously passed the Congress on September 18. Even as the size of the Federal Government shrinks, we must keep it responsive to the people.          fbi computer investigations threat assessment center  This legislation appropriates to the FBI $5,013,000 and 17 agents to establish a Computer Investigations Threat Assessment Center [CITAC] at FBI headquarters to identify, investigate, and counter illegal intrusion into Government computer networks. This is an important development.  As our Federal agencies increasingly depend on computers to perform their mission, the risk of computer crime has become a more significant threat to our public safety and national security. For example, the Department of Defense relies on computers to deploy, feed, supply, and communicate with troops. Yet, the GAO recently reported that 250,000 computer attacks were occurring each year at DOD. We know that in 1994, a computer hacker based in the United Kingdom was able to break into the Rome Laboratory at Griffess Air Force base in New York. Just last week, computer hackers forced the CIA to take down an agency Web site because obscenities and unauthorized text and photograph changes had been made to the site and unauthorized links had been established between the CIA Web site and other sites.  Undoubtedly, the increased reliance by Government agencies on computer systems and networks presents special vulnerabilities to computer hackers and spies. I have long been concerned about this vulnerability. That is why I worked with the Department of Justice, and my colleagues, Senators Kyl and Grassley, on the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act, which passed the Senate unanimously, as S. 982, on September 18 and also passed the House of Representatives, as part of H.R. 3723, on September 18. This bill will increase protection for computers, both Government and private, and the information on those computers, from the growing threat of computer crime.  This establishment of CITAC will bring vital focus and attention on how to prevent computer crime and, when it does occur, how to find the perpetrators. The work of the FBI at CITAC, though focused on Government computer networks, will also have important applications for the private sector.                             CALEA FUNDING  The conference agreement provides $60,000,000 to be deposited into a newly established telecommunications carrier compliance fund to fund the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act [CALEA]. I was the author of CALEA, sometimes called the digital telephony law, in the Senate and applauded its passage as a necessary step to protect our public safety and national security. This law is also intended to bring much-needed sunshine and public scrutiny to the process of how wiretaps are conducted.  CALEA authorized $500,000,000 to pay for any necessary retrofitting of existing systems to come into compliance with law enforcement capability and capacity requirements to maintain its ability to implement court-ordered wiretaps. I am glad that funds are finally being appropriated for this new law.  I had serious concerns with the House proposed implementation plan, which was set out as a condition for funding in both the House passed CJS appropriations bill, and House terrorism legislation. The modified implementation plan in the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for 1997 makes sense to ensure accountability on the part of the FBI.  For example, CALEA already requires that the Attorney General publish certain information in the Federal Register for public comment, including information about law enforcement's capacity needs and cost control regulations. The conditions in the omnibus appropriations legislation would require that this information be provided on a country-by-county basis.  We should fund the digtigal telephone law. At the same time, the conditions in the modified plan for use of the appropriated funds will help ensure that the FBI complies fully with the letter and spirit of disclosure that is a hallmark of that legislation.                     Law Enforcement Support Center  I am delighted that Congress recognizes the contribution that is being made to immigration law enforcement by the Law Enforcement Support Center [LESC] in South Burlington, VT. This is among the most significant capacities being developed to assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement deal more effectively with criminal aliens. Improving the identification and expediting the decoration of criminal aliens responsible for violent crimes are goals on which there is universal agreement.  The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorized the Law Enforcement Support Center. Last year, I had a colloquy on the Senate floor with the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee chairman clarifying that the Senate-passed appropriations bill allowed the LESC to continue to receive its authorized funding.  This is only online national database available to identify criminal aliens. It is a valuable and essential asset for improving our national immigration enforcement effort. The LESC provides local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies with 24-hour access to data on criminal aliens. By assisting in the identification of these aliens, the LESC allows law enforcement agencies to expedite deportation proceedings against them.  In its first year of operation, the LESC identified over 10,000 criminal aliens as aggravated felons. After starting up with a link to law enforcement agencies in one county in Arizona, the LESC expanded its coverage to that entire State. The LESC is expected to be online with California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas and Washington, as well as Arizona this year.  The Law Enforcement Support Center deserves our full support. The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for 1997 increases the support by adopting the increased authorization that Senator Hutchison and I offered to the Senate immigration bill when it was considered last May. By increasing to $5 million a year the authorization of the LESC we demonstrate our commitment to effective assistance to State and local law enforcement.                 carryover funds for COPS more program  The conference agreement includes $1,400,000,000 for the Community Oriented Policing Services [COPS] and $20,000,000 for the Police Corps Program. This funding is to be used to maintain the commitment to hire 100,000 new police officers. This is a commitment the Congress and the President made in the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, and I am pleased that we are keeping our promise. Importantly, funds available for prior year carryover may be used for innovative community policing programs, solong as reprogramming requirements are satisfied. This ensures that our State and local law enforcement have the flexibility they need to spend this money they are granted when and how they need to, within the broad parameters set by Congress.
