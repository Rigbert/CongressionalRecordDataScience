 Mr. President, I send a modification to amendment 3777 to the desk.  The amendment (No. 3777), as modified, is as follows:       Beginning on page 10, strike line 18 and all that follows      through line 13 on page 11 and insert the following:     SEC. 108. CONSTRUCTION OF PHYSICAL BARRIERS, DEPLOYMENT OF                    TECHNOLOGY AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ROADS IN THE                    BORDER AREA NEAR SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA.       There are authorized to be appropriated funds of $12      million for the construction, expansion, improvement or      deployment of triple-fencing in addition to that currently      under construction, where such triple-fencing is determined      by the Immigration & Naturalization Service (INS) to be safe      and effective, and in addition, bollard style concrete      columns, all weather roads, low light television systems,      lighting, sensors and other technologies along the      international land border between the United States and      Mexico south of San Diego, California, for the purpose of      detecting and deterring unlawful entry across the border.      Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to      remain available until expended. The INS, while constructing      the additional fencing, shall incorporate the necessary      safety features into the design of the fence system to insure      the well-being of Border Patrol agents deployed within or in      near proximity to these additional barriers.
