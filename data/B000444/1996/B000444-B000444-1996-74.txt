 President, I rise to offer a bill that I believe represents an important step forward in the fight against child abuse and crime.  This legislation will make healthy families programs eligible for funding under the local crime prevention block grant, in the 1994 crime law. Essentially, this bill would add the healthy families program to the list of prevention programs eligible for funding under the block grant.  The link between child abuse and later involvement in violence and crime is becoming ever more clear. According to a 1992 Justice Department report, 68 percent of youths arrested had a prior history of abuse and neglect, and abused girls were 77 percent more likely than nonabused girls to be arrested as juveniles.  The healthy families initiative has proven to be very successful in combating this cycle of violence. The program was pioneered in Hawaii in the 1980's. According to the Hawaii Department of Health, 2,254 at-risk families received healthy families services over a 5-year period. Out of that total, abuse was reported in only 16 families. This success shows that the program was able to prevent abuse in 99.3 percent of at-risk families in Hawaii.  The success of this program is based on the voluntary, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate home visitor systems. These systems provide parenting education that focuses on parenting skills, child development, child health, and support services for new parents, in order to prevent or decrease the risk of child abuse.  As a result of this success, the program has now spread to other communities throughout the United States. The money which would be provided under the block grant, would help other communities create these greatly needed healthy families programs.  Spending money on child-abuse prevention is a sound investment. Not only will it create future savings in the judiciary system and other social services, but even more importantly it's an investment in the lives of our children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation I am introducing today appear in the Record.  The being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1996       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PARENT EDUCATION SYSTEM.       Section 30201(a)(2) of the Violent Crime Control and Law      Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(O) Voluntary, comprehensive, and culturally-appropriate      home visitor systems that provide parenting education that      focuses on parenting skills, child development, child health,      and support services for new parents to prevent or decrease      the risk of child abuse. To avoid duplication of services, a      system developed pursuant to this paragraph shall be      coordinated with other organizations that provide services to      children, particularly infants.''.
