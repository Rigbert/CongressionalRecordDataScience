President, I rise to discuss an issue that is very important to Americans, especially during this holiday season: the safety of consumer products.  The string of recalls of toys and other children's products we have all read about in the news over the past 6 months has created uncertainty and anxiety among parents shopping for their children for the holidays.  Parents now come to toy stores armed with shopping lists, as well as lists of toy recalls from the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Web site.  Their concern is understandable. This year has seen an unprecedented number of unsafe toys recalled this year--more than 25 million so far, and counting.  They include some of the most popular children's characters: Thomas the Tank Engine, Elmo, Dora the Explorer, Polly Pockets--even Curious George and SpongeBob SquarePants.  The list of dangers range from high lead content and toxic chemicals to choking hazards and dangerously powerful magnets that can rip open a child's intestines if they are swallowed.  What is going on with all these recalls?  The Consumer Product Safety Commission is responsible for overseeing the safety of more than 15,000 consumer products--everything from toys to power tools.  That agency has suffered deeper staffing and budget cuts than any other Federal health and safety regulator.  Here are some numbers that ought to worry every American:  In 1974, its first year of operation, the CPSC had a budget of $146 million in today's dollars. Today, its budget is less than half that amount: just over $62 million.  In the last 3 years, the CPSC has suffered its deepest staff cuts since the Reagan administration--from 471 full-time employees down to just 401.  Today, with imports at an all-time high, the CPSC employs 15 port inspectors for the entire country.  In addition, CPSC does not have the authority or tools it needs to protect American consumers.  The CPSC cannot require premarket testing, cannot order a recall when it knows a product poses a hazard to consumers, and can't quickly notify the public of product hazards.  In some instances, the combination of lack of funding and lack of tools has led to unnecessary, preventable injuries and fatalities suffered by children.  It is hard to imagine that our lead product safety agency does not have these tools.  Fortunately, there is a set of proposals pending in the Senate that will aid consumer safety by restoring the CPSC to a functioning agency and requiring manufacturers of children's products to test and certify the safety of their products.  The Senate Commerce Committee has reported a bill by voice vote, authored by Senator Pryor, that would fix many of these problems.  Commerce Committee Chairman Inouye and Senator Pryor, chairman of the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee, deserve credit for a balanced, responsible plan.  The bill would more than double CPSC's current budget, to $141 million, and increase the agency's staff by 20 percent over the next 7 years.  It would also eliminate the use of dangerous lead in toys; require independent, third-party safety tests of toys before they can be sold in this country; give the CPSC new powers to regulate the marketplace, including more authority to force the recall of dangerous products more quickly; give State prosecutors the authority to enforce Federal consumer safety laws;and increase the maximum fines for willful violation of consumer safety laws from $1.8 million to $100 million.  I expect the Senate to move important legislation in this area before the holiday. The House, led by Congressman Bobby Rush, is engaged in a similar effort on the House side.  If we are going to pass stronger consumer product safety legislation, it is vital that we have bipartisan cooperation and pursue this legislation in a bipartisan fashion. I support the effort led by Senators Inouye and Pryor to reach out to Senators Stevens and Sununu of the Commerce Committee to do just that.  I encourage these efforts to continue in order to produce a robust bill that will improve consumer safety and the functioning of the CPSC.  It is a noncontroversial, bipartisan idea that the American public expects.                          ____________________
