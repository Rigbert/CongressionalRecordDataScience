 President, I have been examining several doctors at universities across the country to see if they are complying with the financial disclosure policies of the National Institutes of Health. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record my latest letter to Emory University regarding Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff and the Emory-GlaxoSmithKline-National Institute of Mental Health Initiative.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2008.     Hon. James W. Wagner, Ph.D.,     President, Emory University, Dowman Drive, Atlanta, GA.       Dear Dr. Wagner: The United States Senate Committee on      Finance (Committee) has jurisdiction over the Medicare and      Medicaid programs and, accordingly, a responsibility to the      more than 80 million Americans who receive healthcare      coverage under these programs. As Ranking Member of the      Committee, I have a duty to protect the health of Medicare      and Medicaid beneficiaries and safeguard taxpayer dollars      appropriated for these programs. The actions taken by thought      leaders, like those at Emory University (Emory), often have      profound impact upon the decisions made by taxpayer funded      programs like Medicare and Medicaid and the way that patients      are treated and funds expended.       I would like to expand on concerns I brought to your      attention regarding problems with the disclosures of outside      income filed with Emory by Dr. Charles Nemeroff, Chair of the      Department of Psychiatry. I have previously cited      discrepancies pertaining to Dr. Nemeroff's disclosures filed      with Emory and reports that I received by several companies      regarding payments made to Dr. Nemeroff. I also raised      concerns about Dr. Nemeroff's conflicts of interest relating      to several National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants.       Federal regulations place numerous requirements on a      university or hospital when its researchers apply for NIH      grants. These regulations are intended to ensure a level of      objectivity in publicly funded research, and state in      pertinent part that NIH investigators must disclose to their      institution any ``significant financial interest'' that may      appear to affect the results of a study. NIH interprets      ``significant financial interest'' to mean at least $10,000      in value or five percent ownership in a single entity.       From the summer of 2003 until the summer of 2008, Dr.      Nemeroff was the primary investigator on a collaborative      grant between Emory, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the National      Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)--the Emory-GSK-NIMH      Collaborative Mood Disorders Initiative (Initiative). This      Initiative examined five novel GSK antidepressant candidates.      The NIH budgeted approximately $3.95 million over this      grant's five year period with about $1.35 million paid      directly to Emory for overhead costs. Apparently, Dr.      Nemeroff also received some payment for his salary from this      grant, although the exact amount has not yet been made      available to the Committee.       On several occasions during the life of this grant, it      appears that Dr. Nemeroff failed to report to Emory that he      was participating actively on the speaker's bureau for GSK.      For instance, in an email regarding his outside activities      dated October 1, 2003, Dr. Nemeroff wrote: . . . I have to      dig up the agreement and send it to you, GSK no standing      contract, I chair their ad board 2-3 times per year and I am      paid per board meeting at a standard rate of $5K per weekend.       However, and based upon information in our possession, in      2003 GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff about $119,000 in speaking fees      and expenses. Based upon information provided from Emory, Dr.      Nemeroff did not report that he was giving promotional talks      for GSK on Paxil and Lamictal.       On March 19, 2004, Dr. Nemeroff again addressed his      relationship with GSK in response to questions from Emory's      Conflicts of Interest (COI) Committee. Again, it appears that      Dr. Nemeroff did not mention the fees he was receiving for      promotional speaking on behalf of GSK. In a letter to the      Assistant Dean for Administration, Dr. Nemeroff wrote: Apart      from speaking at national symposia, such as the American      Psychiatric Association, for which GSK might serve as a      sponsor, my consultation to the company is limited to      chairing their Paroxetine Advisory board and for that, I am      remunerated $15,000 per year.       However, on March 16, 2004, three days prior to signing      this letter, GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff $3,500 for a talk he gave      on Paxil at the Citrus Club, a members only business      establishment in Orlando, Florida. On March 17, 2004, he gave      another $3,500 talk about Paxil in Kissimmee, Florida. The      week after he signed this letter, Dr. Nemeroff gave three      talks on Paxil, for $3,500 each, at various venues in New      York State.       In June 2004, Emory's COI Committee released a report on      Dr. Nemeroff's company sponsored grants and outside      activities. Dr. Nemeroff was provided a copy of the report      which stated in pertinent part:       The Committee concluded that you did not follow procedures      and policies regarding the review of your consulting      agreements and that you failed to disclose your potential      conflicts of interest in research in your Annual Disclosure      Form for 2002-2003, your Sponsored Projects Approval Forms,      and your IRB and IACUC forms.       In response to this report, Dr. Nemeroff wrote a memorandum      to the executive associate dean on July 6, 2004, explaining      how he would manage his conflicts in the future. He included      the last page of the COI Committee's report with his      signature to indicate ``that I will follow the management      plans for my conflicts of interest.'' As part of this      management plan, Dr. Nemeroff wrote, ``In view of the NIMH/     Emory/GSK grant, I shall limit my consulting to GSK to under      $10,000/year and I have informed GSK of this policy.''       Barely a week after this promise, on July 12, 2004, GSK      paid Dr. Nemeroff $3,500 in fees and $505.40 in expenses for      a talk he gave regarding Paxil at the Larkspur Restaurant and      Grill in Las Vegas, Nevada. The following day, Dr. Nemeroff      gave two more talks in exchange for $7,000 from GSK ($3,500      per talk).       On July 19, 2004, Dr. Nemeroff received an invitation from      the marketing team of Lamictal to attend their national      advisory board meeting on November 15-16. Dr. Nemeroff      responded by email: I cannot attend this meeting,      unfortunately for two reasons. First I have a prior      commitment presenting grand rounds at St. Louis University on      the 16th and a chairs meeting at Emory on the 15th. Secondly      because I serve as the Principal Investigator of the Emory/     GSK/NIMH grant from NIH on Antidepressant Drug Discovery, I      am very limited in my ability to consult with GSK as this is      viewed as a conflict of interest.       Records supplied from GSK show that Dr. Nemeroff was most      likely in St. Louis on the 16th of November. On November      17th, GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff $7,000 for two clinical      roundtables at two physicians' offices in St. Louis, and      $3,500 for a lecture he gave at Kemoll's Italian Restaurant.       On July 15, 2004, Emory's Office of the Dean sent Dr.      Nemeroff a letter regarding the Emory-GSK-NIMH Collaborative      Moods Disorders Initiative grant. The letter concerned the      COI Committee's review of his relationship with GSK. The      letter stated: The [COI] Committee understands that you serve      on the GlaxoSmithKline Paroxetine Advisory Board and provide      advice to GSK on their products that are already on the      market. For these services, you receive approximately $15,000      annually. You do not have any stock options or equity      interests in GSK.     Please correct the record if this is not correct. . . . The      [COI] Committee found that you have a significant financial      interest in GSK because your consulting fees are more than      the de minimis amount established by Emory's University      Policy, the AAMC guidelines, and PHS regulations, which is      currently $10,000 annually. . . . In order to manage this      conflict of interest, the [COI] Committee requires that you      keep your consulting fees from GSK to an amount equal to or      less than $10,000 on an annual basis throughout the grant      period, its renewals, and final collection of data.       In response, Dr. Nemeroff sent a letter to the executive      associate dean on August 4, 2004. Dr. Nemeroff wrote:      However, to reiterate, I have already taken the necessary      steps to be in compliance with the recommendations of the COI      Committee, namely my consulting fees from GSK will be less      than $10,000 per year throughout the period of this NIH      grant, its renewals and final collections of data. GSK has      been informed of this change and certainly understand the      reasons for this decision and is supportive of my compliance      with the university recommendations.       According to GSK reports, Dr. Nemeroff exceeded the $10,000      limit within that very same month. On August 23, 2004, Dr.      Nemeroff was paid $3,500 for a teleconference with the      Louisiana State University Psychiatry Department. GSK reports      that this was a ``non product'' talk. However, Dr. Nemeroff      gave talks on the 25th and 26th at two restaurants in New      York regarding Paxil--one at Passion Fish Restaurant in      Woodbury and the second at Burton and Doyles in Great Neck.      For each talk, GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff a $3,500 speaking      honorarium. On August 31, 2004, Dr. Nemeroff held a ``non      product'' teleconference for an additional $3,500.       On October 29, 2004, the assistant dean for administration      sent Dr. Nemeroff a letter concerning his grants. Relying on      Dr. Nemeroff's promise to maintain his consulting fees from      GSK below $10,000, Emory informed him that he did not have a      conflict with the Emory-GSK-NIH Collaborative Mood Disorders      Institute.       However, GSK reports that Dr. Nemeroff's final lecture on      Paxil was given on January 26, 2006. That day he gave two      talks in Springfield, Missouri. He gave one lecture at the      Burrel Behavioral Health and the second at Mille's Turn of      the Century Cafe. GSK paid Dr. Nemeroff $7,000 for the      lectures along with $174.98 in expenses.       Based upon information provided to me, it appears that Dr.      Nemeroff denied giving these lectures. For instance in a      letter on November 20, 2006, Dr. Nemeroff wrote the following      to the Emory dean about his outside activities:       ``I was somewhat surprised by the suggestion that I serve      as [primary investigator] or co-PI in any research protocols      funded by a company with which I have a financial      relationship. This is absolutely untrue. Quite some time ago,      I made that decision based on the 2004 letter from Dr.      Adkison and have stuck to it. Thus, this is not an issue.''       However, during the years that Dr. Nemeroff served as the      primary investigator of the Emory/GSK/NIMH Initiative it      seems he failed to report approximately half a million      dollars in fees and expenses from GSK. These fees covered      dozens of talks given to promote drugs sold by the company.       Accordingly, I request that your institution respond to the      following questions and requests for information. For each      response, please repeat the enumerated request and follow      with the appropriate answer.       (1) For each year that the Emory/GSK/NIMH grant was active,      please provide the following:       a. Total amount of grant;       b. Amount provided to Emory for overhead; and       c. Amount of grant provided as salary to Dr. Nemeroff.       (2) Please provide all communications regarding this      investigation and/or Dr. Nemeroff's outside consulting. This      information may be held by Dr. Nemeroff and/or his assistant      and/or supervisors to Dr. Nemeroff. The time span of this      request covers November 2007 to the present.       (3) According to documents provided to us by Emory, Dr.      Nemeroff wrote a memo to himself on the letterhead of the      journal Depression and Anxiety, stating that he was paying      himself $3,000 to write a supplement for that journal. Dr.      Nemeroff then filled out an Emory form for payment, with the      money being withdrawn from Emory account 9-30410-2170. Please      provide documents and explanation for the source of funds      that were placed in this account.       Thank you again for your continued cooperation and      assistance in this matter. As you know, in cooperating with      the Committee's review, no documents, records, data or      information related to these matters shall be destroyed,      modified, removed or otherwise made inaccessible to the      Committee.       I look forward to hearing from you by no later than October      16, 2008. All documents responsive to this request should be      sent electronically in PDF format to [email protected]rep.senate.gov. If you have any questions, please do not      hesitate to contact Paul Thacker at (202) 224-4515.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.       Attachment.          DR.
