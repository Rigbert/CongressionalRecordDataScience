  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is 10 years since the Contract on America, the Republican takeover. If people think the country is going in the right direction, then I guess they are doing a great job.  They talk about fiscal responsibility; $600 billion deficit this year. Every penny of the Social Security surplus and trust fund borrowed and spent and replaced with IOUs. We have lower wages, outsourced jobs, unemployed Americans, economic insecurity, and record numbers of uninsured. And they brag about their record on health care, a prescription drug benefit written by and for the pharmaceutical industry at tremendous tax to the taxpayer, subsidies to that industry.  It is time for a new partnership for the majority of Americans, not more government by and for an elite few.                          ____________________
