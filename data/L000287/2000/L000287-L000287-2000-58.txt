Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Owens), my colleague and associate, so much for his leadership. I thank him for all he did as head of CORE in Brooklyn and for being here tonight to participate in this special order.  It is appropriate for him to mention the theme song of the movement ``We Shall Overcome.'' After the 1960 effort, 5 years later, the President of the United States, President Lyndon Johnson, came and spoke to a joint session of the Congress when he introduced the Voting Rights Act and he said, ``We Shall Overcome'' several times. He said it to the Congress, but he said it to the nation, ``We Shall Overcome.''  So we have come a distance, we have made a lot of progress since February 1, 1960.  It is now, Mr. Speaker, my pleasure and delight to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my good friend from the city of Newark.
