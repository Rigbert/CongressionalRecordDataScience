President, this year marks the 90th anniversary of historian and scholar Dr. Carter G. Woodson's launch of Negro History Week--and is the 40th anniversary of the inaugural Black History Month. This year, as Black History Month is coming to a close, I want to celebrate by paying tribute to a Chicago neighborhood that has played a significant part in our country's African-American and labor history--the Pullman Historical District.  One year ago this month, President Obama designated the South Side Chicago's Pullman Historic District as the Nation's 406th national park. The Pullman National Historical Park has a special place in our Nation's history. It has been the site of some major historical events. The men and women of the Pullman community--the birthplace of the Nation's first Black labor union--the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters--helped shape our country as we know it today. By fighting for fair labor conditions in the 19th century, the Pullman workers advanced America's civil rights movement.  In the 1890s, the Pullman community was the catalyst for the first industrywide strike during one of the worst economic depressions our Nation ever faced--and led to the creation of Labor Day as a national holiday. These railroad workers aren't always mentioned in the history books or picked to join the parades during Black History Month--but they made history and deserve to be honored. One hundred and one years ago, fearing that the history of African Americans was fading into obscurity, Dr. Carter G. Woodson founded the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. His goal was to raise awareness of African Americans' contributions to civilization. He believed that truth could not be denied--and realized that past contributions by African Americans needed to be documented and taught. He once said, ``if a race had no recorded history, its achievements would be forgotten and, in time, claimed by other groups.'' I agree with Dr. Woodson--and so does the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum in Chicago.  Earlier this month, with the help of DePaul University, the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum launched a new online registry that gives voice to the stories of Black railroad workers. By capturing stories from scholars and the relatives of these workers, we will preserve oral histories that otherwise might be lost to history. If you listen to the oral histories, you will hear stories from people like Theodore Berrien, who worked as a Pullman porter from 1940 to 1969. Berrien worked on President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's funeral train from Georgia to Washington, DC. On the registry, Berrien's grandson says: ``He spoke of how kind Mrs. Roosevelt was and thanked him for his services during the trip.''  Or take Blaine McKinley Fitzgerald, who worked as a Pullman porter on the Illinois Central and Louisville and Nashville railroads from 1920 to 1946--his relatives wrote: ``Blaine's major route was from Birmingham to New York. He also worked the Rose Bowl trips to California when Alabama was a major contingent.'' You will hear how Blaine raised a family of six children on his salary as a Pullman porter--all college educated--who became teachers, lawyers, and engineers. Blaine's story is just one of many examples of how the Pullman porters helped build the African-American middle class in Chicago.  But even as the African-American middle class expanded in Chicago and across the country, the struggle for justice, equality, and equal opportunities for African Americans in this country has continued.  And the State of Illinois has played a significant role in that struggle. Springfield, IL native President Abraham Lincoln led our Nation through a war to save the Union, abolished slavery, and began the work we continue today to end discrimination. In 1909, the centennial of Lincoln's birth, 2,000 people gathered at a dazzling gala to honor the centennial of Lincoln's birth. Even though this was an event celebrating the centennial of the President that helped abolish slavery--like most in America at that time, it was segregated.  The Chicago Tribune reported, that it ``is to be a lily white affair from start to finish.'' But across town, the Black community organized its own Lincoln centennial at the AfricanMethodist Episcopal Church. The Reverend L.H. Magee spoke at that gathering and noted the widespread feeling of hurt over the exclusion of people of color from the main Lincoln banquet. Reverend Magee made a prediction about the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth in 2009--100 years in the future: ``prejudice shall have been banished as a myth and relegated to the dark days of Salem witchcraft.''  In many ways, his prediction was correct. We have come a long way to banish discrimination in our communities--our legal system recognizes that all men and women are created equal and should be free from discrimination in schools, housing, and employment. And in 2009, President Barack Obama, a former Illinois Senator, was sworn in as the first African-American President of the United States of America.  Pastor Magee had a vision of a new America, but he may not have imagined that bricks laid by the hands of slaves would make a home in our White House for a family of color. But, while progress has been made, we cannot ignore that we still have more to do. When one in three African-American men will go to prison in their lifetime, we have more to do. When the unemployment rate for African Americans are more than double the rate for Whites, we have more to do. And when efforts exist across the country to make it harder to vote, rather than easier, we have more to do. But it is when the climb is the steepest that we can come together as Americans, to take the mountaintop once and for all.  This month, let's celebrate these achievements and honor Dr. Carter G. Woodson's legacy by remembering all the contributions of the extraordinary men and women of the civil rights movement--including the Pullman porters. We have come a long way, but we still have work to do to fulfill the promise to make our Nation fairer and more equal and to do what Lincoln called on us to do: ``nobly save . . . the last best hope of earth.''
