President, I want to recognize the 2015 United States Women's National Soccer Team. Sunday night, our athletes brought home their third World Cup championship and continued the excellence that we have come to know from the team. Four of the woman's national team players--Shannon Boxx, Julie Johnston, Lori Chalupny, and Christen Press--are also on Chicago's National Women's Soccer League team, the Red Stars.  More than 22 million Americans watched Team USA--including a crowd of thousands gathering in Lincoln Park in Chicago to watch the match on the big screens and cheer the U.S. women to victory. This was not an easy road for the United States team. Their mettle was tested against the best teams in the world, including No. 1 ranked Germany in the semifinal.  These 23 athletes displayed the best qualities of champions: depth, confidence, selflessness, athleticism, and unconquerable spirit. With a decisive 5-2 victory over Japan, the U.S. Women's National Team showed the world that this is what legacy looks like.  We will forever remember when this team of athletes brought the Nation to its feet, yelling, ``I believe, I believe that we will win.'' And they did.  Mr. President, I congratulate all the players, coaches, and staff of the 2015 U.S. women's national soccer team.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
