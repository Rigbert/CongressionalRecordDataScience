President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment because I feel very strongly about the long-term implications of turning our backs on the environment. This Congress triedto repeal environmental laws and they tried to tie up the system with procedural gimmicks. They tried to cut funding for the EPA, and they tried to pass riders on the appropriations bills for temporary suspensions of environmental laws.  While we were able to hold back some of this political pandering to special interests, the environment did suffer setbacks with the Republican initiatives that either slipped through the cracks or were forced through Congress as parts of larger compromises. But now we are talking about systematically reducing funding over the next 7 years. We simply cannot do that without having negative consequences.  The Congressional Budget Office may conclude that the bill saves money, but that is only because they are counting dollars, not inches of acid rain, kilograms of toxic waste and concentrations of airborne particulates. When it comes time to pay the health bills of 7-year-old children who grew up around dirty Superfund sites, the cost will be high. The cost of neglect for our streams and rivers, the cost of apathy for safe drinking water, the cost of maintenance lapses in the National Park Service, and the cost of data gaps in basic environmental science will be high. The environment will not take care of itself. We have to step up and be responsible about the future we pass to our children.  This budget is not responsible when it comes to basic protections for our air, water, streams, and natural resources. That is why we are working to restore environmental funding by using bipartisan offsets identified by the Republicans. Environmental protection is supposed to be a bipartisan issue. Presidents Bush, Reagan, and Nixon signed some of our most important environmental laws. We offer this amendment to bring the budget back into line with the bipartisan commitments made in the past 25 years.  The people of the United States never voted to gut environmental spending. They voted for honest efforts to control wasteful spending, close wasteful loopholes, and refocus government on the priorities that government can do best. This amendment will make sure government provides basic safeguards for a clean environment. This is a job that government can do and needs to do. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                           Amendment No. 3991(Purpose: This amendment increases the Function 500 totals to maintain    levels of education and training funding that will keep pace with      rising school enrollments and the demand for a better-trained  workforce. This increase is fully offset by the extension of expired          tax provisions or corporate and business tax reforms)
