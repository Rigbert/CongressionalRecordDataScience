Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise reluctantly, trying to be calm.  This is an outrage. The gentleman from New York has never been to Alaska, never been to Chugach, and now he is telling the American native people of Alaska that they are wrong; they have no rights. The Forest Service is correct and the Wilderness Society is correct.
