Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the sportsmen's bill of rights. When this bill becomes law, it will encourage Federal land managing agencies to allow hunting and fishing on the lands they manage. It requires these agencies to take into consideration the impact that their policies and management practices will have on hunting and fishing. Another important feature of this bill clarifies that State government holds the primary management authority over wildlife resources unless the Federal managing agency can show specific statutory authority that requires otherwise.  This legislation is needed to ensure that Americans who enjoy the outdoors can utilize our public lands. There have been too many instances where Federal agencies have closed lands to hunting and fishing with little tono explanation to the sportsmen's community. The sportsmen's bill of rights will help keep these lands open as long as sportsman's use does not interfere with the primary use of the land.  This bill is very important to the people of the State of Alaska. The Federal Government controls over 242 million acres in our State, which makes up 66 percent of Alaska's total land area. To put it into perspective, the Federal lands in Alaska add up to over twice the total area of the entire State of California. This bill helps the Federal agencies keep these public lands open to use of our sportsmen and I urge its swift passage.                          ____________________
