  Gains in quality, productivity, and efficiency year after year, in department after department, would not have been possible without the reasonable and sound use of collective bargaining and worker representation. This amendment is just another in a long line of attempts to kill public-sector unions--unions that represent and ensure quality public service.  I strongly recommend that my colleagues oppose this amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
