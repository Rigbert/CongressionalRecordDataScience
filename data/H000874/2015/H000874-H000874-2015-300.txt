Speaker, I rise to thank Andrew Straughan from Maryland's Fifth District who will be retiring in June after more than thirty-three years of outstanding service to this House in a number of administrative and support roles. I am proud to represent him in Congress.  Andrew began his career with the House in 1982 as a laborer, delivering furniture to Members' offices and Committee rooms for the Office of the Clerk. By the following year, he was appointed as an inventory control clerk, conducting inventory of office furnishings, assisting in storeroom management, and helping to create a report for the General Services Administration.  When the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer was created, Mr. Straughan was named Assistant Supervisor of the Asset Management Division, requiring him to act as a liaison between the Department of Office Furnishings and the House Information Systems. His abilities caught the attention of management, and in 1994 he was named Manager of Logistics and Central Receiving and Warehousing, where he oversaw the Office Supply Warehouse.  From 2008 to 2010, Andrew was detailed as the manager of the Logistics Department, where he developed policies and oversaw a staff of more than forty employees. He then returned to his role as Manager of Central Receiving and Warehousing, the position he currently holds.  Among his proudest accomplishments are being a member of the Source Selection Team for FAIMS, a governmental computer program, and choosing the vendors for purchasing. He was named the Contracting Office Representative for both the Warehousing Contract and the Temporary Labor Contract for temporary staff hired during Congressional transitions.  Andrew's father, Walter Straughan, also spent his career with the House as an electrician, and his brother, Danny Straughan, currently works for the Senate's Electrical Department.  I congratulate Andrew, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for his distinguished service to the House and to our country. I wish him and his family all the best as Andrew begins a new chapter in his life.                          ____________________
