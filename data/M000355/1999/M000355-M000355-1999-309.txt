 President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is both important and timely--the security of our nation's secrets and classified material.  Two days ago a bipartisan committee released a report detailing a level of espionage that few Americans expected. American's most vital nuclear information was stolen from the very places that were supposed to be the most secure. I am not here to cast blame but, rather, wish to discuss a program designed to help reduce the risk of this type of travesty.  The Department of Defense has in place a Federal Specification, FF-L-2740, which sets the minimum requirements for locks to be used on any container storing classified materials. The Department, to its credit, is near completion of a program to retro-fit all containers which do not currently meet that specification.  However, there remains an area where our classified materials are vulnerable. As Senator Stevens knows, contractors also store classified documents throughout the country. Unfortunately, they often do so in containers bearing locks which do not meet Federal Specification FF-L-2740. So, I would ask my colleague, Senator Stevens, does he believe that our nation's classified documents should be properly stored, whether housed at a governmental agency or contractor's office?
