President, today I am introducing the Puppy Uniform Protection and Safety Act, or PUPS Act.  In recent years, media reports have highlighted the cruel treatment of dogs raised by irresponsible breeders in large-scale commercial operations. The facilities operated by the most negligent owners are often referred to as puppy mills, because they churn out dogs the way a factory would--with little or no respect for the animals' quality of life.  Let me be clear, there are many responsible dog breeders across the country who care about and take great pains to properly look after the animals in their care. Those breeders are not the target of this legislation.  Unfortunately, the less scrupulous ``puppy mills'' threaten the reputation of the entire industry. The dogs bred or raised in puppy mills are often housed in cramped, dirty, wire cages. To maximize profit, a breeder may stack cages on top of each other or keep the cages outdoors where dogs are exposed to the elements. The dogs may never be given a chance to exercise or even walk on solid ground. Some animals rescued from puppy mills show signs of malnutrition and dehydration, having been denied a sufficient supply of food andwater. Puppies raised in these settings don't always have regular veterinary, and the breeding females are made to have litter after litter of puppies.  Not surprisingly, this treatment has an effect on the physical and mental health of the animals raised in these facilities.  Veterinarians in Illinois have shared with me heartbreaking tales of families who unknowingly purchased dogs that had been raised in puppy mills. Those dogs turn out to have serious health and behavioral problems. By the time these conditions are diagnosed, the families have welcomed the new puppy into the family and developed a strong emotional attachment. In some cases, the puppies could be treated, but often at great expense to their new owners. These families face very difficult decisions.  Today, people can go on-line and research puppies available for purchase with the simple click of a mouse. You can't blame people for using the convenience of shopping online, but some puppy mill operators advertise on the internet so that they can bypass the pet store. That way, the breeder can avoid the Federal licensing requirements of the Animal Welfare Act, which apply only to wholesale breeders. That means that finding your puppy on-line may well increase the chance that you'll be buying from a puppy mill.  The PUPS Act I am introducing today, along with Senators Feinstein, McCaskill, and Wyden, would amend the Animal Welfare Act to require that breeders obtain a license from the USDA if they raise more than 50 dogs in a 12-month period and sell directly to the public.  These licenses are inexpensive and the application process is simple. But USDA licensing would allow the agency to ensure that large and mid-level breeders comply with minimum Federal standards. The PUPS Act also requires all commercial breeders to give dogs in their care at least two daily exercise breaks, allowing the dogs to enjoy at least 60 minutes outside of their crates or enclosures.  The good news is that the public is growing more aware of the existence of puppy mills. Recent investigations of the deplorable conditions at several large puppy mills along with the interest shown by celebrities, including Chicago resident Oprah Winfrey, have brought new attention to the cause. As a result, many Americans seeking companion animals are doing their homework. They are choosing to adopt from local shelters or finding and visiting responsible breeders. It is my hope that extending and improving oversight of this industry through the PUPS Act will help Americans feel confident about the health and well-being of the dog that they welcome into their family.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3519       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
