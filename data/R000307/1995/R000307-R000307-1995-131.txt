Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his comments. There is sound policy for all of these reforms. It is time to stop building straw men and support the reform.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I join the gentleman from Kansas in opposition to this amendment. There was a novel and innovative block grant program called revenue sharing. It did not work. Besides, if you give 50 States the money, you will have 50 different programs. Is that streamlining?  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm].
