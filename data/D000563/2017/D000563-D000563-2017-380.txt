It is slightly different.  Justice Antonin Scalia passed away in February of last year. President Barack Obama, the President of the United States of America, had a constitutional responsibility under article II, section 2 to nominate a person to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, as every other President had. And he did.  He came up with the name Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, a man who is widely respected, judged unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association. President Obama submitted his name to this Congress, to the Senate, a Senate that has a Republican majority, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.  Senator McConnell and the Republican Senators did something that had never happened in the history of this Chamber--not once.
