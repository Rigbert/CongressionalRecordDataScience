 President, I thank my friends from Tennessee and New Hampshire. I was going to make some opening comments, but I would also add that my opening comments are somewhat related to the colloquy my colleagues were just having about the bill we will be voting on shortly.  We also heard an expression from the voters of Missouri yesterday who voted on a referendum on the issue of whether it is a good idea for the Federal Government to require individuals to retain health insurance, and 70 percent in Missouri, just yesterday, expressed their opposition to the notion. I know that is in court being litigated right now, as to whether it is appropriate for the Federal Government or constitutional for the Federal Government to require everyone to have a government-prescribed health care policy, but we had an expression of the people from Missouri yesterday as well on that aspect of what the Federal Government has been doing in the last year and a half. I thank my colleagues for their enlightened comments.  As I was just indicating, this morning's paper carried an important message for us in Washington--a message that many of us have been trying to get across for more than a year. If there was any doubt that Americans are tired of being told their views are irrelevant by the people they elected to represent them in Washington, last night's vote in Missouri should dispel it.  All throughout the health care debate, Democratic leaders in Washington told themselves they could do what they wanted and then persuade Americans after the fact that it was OK. Last night, the voters in Missouri overwhelmingly rejected that notion.
