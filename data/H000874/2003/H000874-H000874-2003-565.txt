Speaker, in Southern Maryland we are blessed to have so many exemplary citizens who invest their time, energy and talent in making it a special place to live. One such citizen who has gone above and beyond and exemplifies the true spirit of American entrepreneurship is Harry Shasho. Harry believes in the community and has worked hard to improve the lives of Charles County residents now and in the future.  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to acknowledge the deeds and fortunes of this outstanding citizen, Harry Shasho. Harry got an early start in business and in fact, says he has been a businessman since he was 12 years old. In 1976 when Harry moved to Charles County, he owned a small chain of camera and electronics stores on F St. in Washington, D.C. In 1985, he sold his portion of the business and began selling real estate; first residential, then commercial. In 1989, Harry went to work for Baldus Real Estate and started their Commercial Division. Now, Baldus is the best known Commercial Company in Southern Maryland.  As a businessman, Harry recognized the need to train future leaders and became involved in helping young men through Boy Scouts. Over the years, he has not only guided boys into becoming more effective and productive citizens, but has also trained adults to become better leaders. During his tenure as Scoutmaster, his scout troop has produced 12 Eagles Scouts, yet another tribute to his compassion. Mr. Shasho continues to serve on fundraising committees for the Boy Scouts of America.  Mr. Shasho has been a leader in the Charles County Chamber of Commerce for over 10 years, holding positions as Board of Director, Secretary, Treasurer, Vice President, President Elect, and is currently serving as the 2003 President. Under his direction as President, he has increased membership and built a strong alliance between the Chamber and County and State government officials. They have worked together on many issues which impact the business community.  In addition to serving with the Charles County Chamber of Commerce, Harry is Chairman of the Southern Maryland advisory board for BB Bank, a committee member of the Charles County Economic Development Commission, Member of the National and State Association of Realtors and has received a National Leadership award from the National Republican Congressional Committee.  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor Mr. Harry Shasho, as he retires as President of the Charles County Chamber of Commerce on January 12, 2004. We are all so proud of the work he has done to improve the lives of everyone in Charles County and I am very proud to call him my friend.                          ____________________
