President, I came to this floor more than 2 months ago to decry the Senate's failure to respond to a crisis, caused by Federal policy, that has disrupted the operations of small and large businesses throughout the United States. This crisis has continued unabated since then, but the requests for help from these businesses have continued to fall on deaf ears.  In March, the Department of Homeland Security announced that for the first time ever, the annual cap for H-2B visas had been met. These visas are used by a wide range of industries throughout the Nation to fill temporary labor needs. In my home State of Vermont, they are used primarily by the tourist industry.  The Department of Defense appropriations conference report, before us today, includes a very narrow solution to this problem, benefiting a single industry that uses H-2B visas. The conference report exempts aliens seeking jobs in the ``fish roe'' industry from counting against the H-2B cap. The provision does nothing to help the broad categories of employers who use H-2B visas.  Across the country, businesses in a wide range of industries have been scrambling this summer, having been forced to discard business plans that relied on the foreign employees who had always before been available to them. For years, these employers had applied in the spring for the employees they needed for the summer, filling positions for which they were unable to find American workers. The cap had never been reached, and they had no reason to believe this year would be different. I know that the March announcement came as a shock to many employers in my State, and dozens of them contacted my office to see what could be done. This setback fell equally hard on employers in other States.  In response to these requests, I joined with a substantial bipartisan coalition in introducing S. 2252, the Save Summer Act of 2004. Senator Kennedy is the lead sponsor of the bill, which has 18 cosponsors, including 8 Republicans.Our bill would add 40,000 visas for the current fiscal year, providing relief to those summer-oriented businesses that had never even had the opportunity to apply for visas. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership has refused to move this bipartisan bill. The leadership has refused even to move a bill that Senator Hatch introduced, and which was supported only by Republicans. Instead, a tiny minority of Senators has been given a veto over doing anything to address this problem for the current fiscal year or years to come.  The Senate must act in a comprehensive way to solve this problem. I urge the majority leader to bring H-2B legislation to the floor as soon as possible, so we can assure that the summer of 2005 will not be a replay of the summer of 2004.                          ____________________
