President, I rise to speak about a very troubling case of rendition and alleged torture that became public last fall. This is the case of Maher Arar, a Canadian and Syrian citizen, who was deported from the United States to Syria last year, who was held and interrogated for months by the Syrians at the Bush administration's request, and who claims to have suffered torture while in custody there.  Mr. Arar was stopped by immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport in September 2002 as he attempted to change planes on his way home to Canada from Tunisia. He claims that he was interrogated by an FBI agent and a New York City police officer, and that he was denied access to a lawyer. He further claims that he repeatedly told U.S. officials that he feared he would be tortured if deported to Syria. After being held for nearly two weeks in a federal detention center in New York, Mr. Arar was transferred by U.S. authorities to Syria. Arar claims that he was physically tortured during the first two weeks of his detention in Syria, and that he was subjected to severe psychological abuse over the following ten months, including being held in a grave-like cell and being forced to undergo interrogation while hearing the screams of other prisoners.  Syria has a well-documented history of state-sponsored torture. In fact, President Bush stated on November 7, 2003, that Syria has left ``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and ruin'' to its people. Stories like Mr. Arar's are appalling and, if true, seriouslydamage our credibility as a responsible member of the international community.  When unrelated allegations of rendition and possible breaches of the Convention Against Torture (``Torture Convention'') surfaced in the summer of 2003, I wrote to administration officials asking for guarantees that the United States is complying with its obligations under this Convention. I received a response from the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, William J. Haynes. His letter contained a welcome commitment by the administration that it is the policy of the United States to comply with all of its legal obligations under the Torture Convention. I wrote to Mr. Haynes again for clarification on a number of points, such as how the administration reconciled this statement of policy with reported acts of rendition and accusations of the use of interrogation techniques rising to or near the level of torture. After 2 months with no response, another letter, this one not from Haynes himself but from a subordinate, was delivered late at night on the eve of Mr. Haynes' November 19, 2003 confirmation hearing for a seat on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. That letter was totally unresponsive to my questions.  Because Mr. Arar claims that he was interrogated by an FBI agent, I wrote to FBI Director Mueller on November 17, 2003 for more information on the case. Later that week, when press accounts indicated that the deportation of Mr. Arar was approved by the Department of Justice (``DOJ''), I wrote to Attorney General Ashcroft to ask a number of additional questions. Neither of these letters has been answered.  Administration officials claim that the CIA received assurances from Syria that it would not torture Mr. Arar, and yet, spokesmen for DOJ have not explained why they believed the Syrian assurances to be credible. Nor have they explained inconsistencies in statements coming from officials at different agencies. Although the administration has officially welcomed statements by the Syrian government that Mr. Arar was not tortured, other unnamed officials have been quoted in the press as saying that, while in captivity in Syria, Mr. Arar confessed under torture that he had gone to Afghanistan for terrorist training. I have asked DOJ to address that shocking contradiction and also to explain whether the United States has investigated Syria's alleged non-compliance with any assurances it provided to the U.S. government.  Whether or not Mr. Arar had ties to terrorist organizations, as is alleged by U.S. officials, or whether his confession was a false one produced by coercion, as he claims, he was subject to the legal protections provided by the Torture Convention, which the United States has ratified.  Recently, the Canadian government announced a full inquiry into the deportation of Mr. Arar to Syria and his alleged torture there. This inquiry will also examine the role played by Canadian officials in the case to determine whether the Canadian government was complicit in the rendition of Mr. Arar. And just weeks ago, a non-profit organization, the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a constitutional and human rights case on behalf of Mr. Arar with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York challenging the decision by federal officials to deport him to Syria. As the Washington Post editorialized on February 2, 2004, ``The government should be obliged to spell out how this decision came to be made and why.''  I urge my colleagues to follow this Federal court case the Canadian inquiry closely. If the allegations by Mr. Arar are true, then our government has much to answer for. The case has already damaged our standing with foreign governments, many of which we have criticized in the past for relying on torture in interrogations. If the U.S. is ``subcontracting'' interrogation of terrorism suspects to nations that bend the rules on torture, it undermines our reputation as a Nation of laws, it hurts our credibility in seeking to uphold human rights, and it invites others to use the same tactics.  I ask unanimous consent to print the letters I mentioned and the Washington Post editorial in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Washington Post, February 2, 2004]                           Mr. Arar's Lawsuit       The Federal lawsuit filed last week by Maher Arar--the      Syrian-born Canadian whom the federal government deported to      Syria--offers a good opportunity to shed some light on one of      the more peculiar civil liberties cases to arise during the      war on terrorism. Mr. Arar and the U.S. government agree on      the barest outlines of his story: He was flying home from      Tunisia to Canada in the fall of 2002 on a path that took him      through New York. He had, however, been placed on the      terrorist watch list. When he presented his Canadian      passport, he was detained for more than a week and--despite      his pleas to be sent to Canada--was sent to Syria. There he      was held for 10 months until intervention by the Canadian      government secured his release.       That is where agreement ends. Mr. Arar denies any      connection to al Qaeda. He claims to have been savagely      tortured in his country of birth. And he alleges that he was      sent to Syria, rather than to Canada, precisely so that he      would be tortured--to be precise, ``so that Syrian      authorities would interrogate him in ways that [American      officials] believed themselves unable to do directly.'' All      of which, if true, would violate this country's international      treaty obligations, which prohibit turning someone over to a      government likely to mistreat that person. In Canada, Mr.      Arar's case has become a cause, cited as an example of      American arrogance and contempt for Canada's interests and      citizens.       The American government firmly--if vaguely--denies any      wrongdoing. It still claims that its information on Mr. Arar      was solid, though it refuses to release any of what it terms      ``sensitive national security information.'' Mr. Arar is a      member of al Qaeda, the Justice Department alleged in a      recent statement. Anonymous officials have been quoted in      press accounts saying that he was carrying a list of al Qaeda      operatives and that then-Deputy Attorney General Larry D.      Thompson signed an order certifying that returning Mr. Arar      to Canada would be ``prejudicial to the interests of the      United States.'' The department says that Mr. Arar's      deportation to Syria was ``fully within the law and      applicable international treaties and conventions.'' Far from      intending that Syria would torture him, in fact, the      department claims that it was ``provided with reliable      assurances that Mr. Arar would be treated humanely.''       There are two questions that we hope this litigation would      shed light upon. The first is whether Mr. Arar was, in fact,      a would-be-terrorist. The second is why he was sent to a      country known for abusing human rights, instead of being sent      to Canada or detained here as an enemy combatant. What was      the goal, if not to delegate to the Syrians torture that      American authorities cannot engage in? At the least, the      government should be obliged to spell out how this decision      came to be made and why.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2003.     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,     National Security Adviser, The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Dr. Rice: Over the past several months, unnamed      Administration officials have suggested in several press      accounts that detainees held by the United States in the war      on terrorism have been subjected to ``stress and duress''      interrogation techniques, including beatings, lengthy sleep      and food deprivation, and being shackled in painful positions      for extended periods of time. Our understanding is that these      statements pertain in particular to interrogations conducted      by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan and other      locations outside the United States. Officials have also      stated that detainees have been transferred for interrogation      to governments that routinely torture prisoners.       These assertions have been reported extensively in the      international media in ways that could undermine the      credibility of American efforts to combat torture and promote      the rule of law, particularly in the Islamic world.       I appreciate President Bush's statement, during his recent      meeting with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio      De Mello, that the United States does not, as a matter of      policy, practice torture. I also commend the Administration      for its willingness to meet with and respond to the concerns      of leading human rights organizations about reports of      mistreatment of detainees. At the same time, I believe the      Administration's response thus far, including in a recent      letter to Human Rights Watch from Department of Defense      General Counsel William Haynes, while helpful, leaves      important questions unanswered.       The Administration understandably does not wish to      catalogue the interrogation techniques used by U.S. personnel      in fighting international terrorism. But it should affirm      with clarity that America upholds in practice the laws that      prohibit the specific forms of mistreatment reported in      recent months. The need for a clear and thorough response      from the Administration is all the greater because reports of      mistreatment initially arose not from outside complaints, but      from statements made by administration officials themselves.       With that in mind, I would appreciate your answers to the      following questions:       First, Mr. Haynes' letter states that when questioning      enemy combatants, U.S. personnel are required to follow      ``applicable laws prohibiting torture.'' What are those laws?      Given that the United States has ratified the Convention      Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or      Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), is this Convention      one of those laws, and does it bind U.S. personnel both      inside and outside the United States?       Second, does the Administration accept that the United      States has a specific obligation under the CAT not to engage      in cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment?       Third, when the United States ratified the CAT, it entered      a reservation regarding its prohibition on cruel, inhuman and      degrading treatment, stating that it interprets this term to      mean ``the cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment or      punishment prohibited by the 5th, 8th, and/or 14th amendments      to the Constitution.'' Are all U.S. interrogations of enemy      combatants conducted in a manner consistent with this      reservation?       Fourth, in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights      Practices, the State Department has repeatedly condemned many      of the same ``stress and duress'' interrogation techniques      that U.S. personnel are alleged to have used in Afghanistan.      Can you confirm that the United States is not employing the      specific methods of interrogation that the State Department      has condemned in countries such as Egypt, Iran, Eritrea,      Libya, Jordan and Burma?       Fifth, the Defense Department acknowledged in March that it      was investigating the deaths from blunt force injury of two      detainees who were held at a Bagram air base in Afghanistan.      What is the status of that investigation and when do you      expect it to be completed? Has the Defense Department or the      CIA investigated any other allegations of torture or      mistreatment of detainees, and if so, with what result? What      steps would be taken if any U.S. personnel were found to have      engaged in unlawful conduct?       Finally, Mr. Haynes' letter offers a welcome clarification      that when detainees are transferred to other countries,      ``U.S. Government instructions are to seek and obtain      appropriate assurances that such enemy combatants are not      tortured.'' How does the administration follow up to      determine if these pledges of humane treatment are honored in      practice, particularly when the governments in question are      known to practice torture?       I believe these questions can be answered without revealing      sensitive information or in any way undermining the fight      against international terrorism. Defeating terrorism is a      national security priority, and no one questions the      imperative of subjecting captured terrorists to thorough and      aggressive interrogations consistent with the law.       The challenge is to carry on this fight while upholding the      values and laws that distinguish us from the enemy we are      fighting. As President Bush has said, America is not merely      struggling to defeat a terrible evil, but to uphold ``the      permanent rights and the hopes of mankind.'' I hope you agree      that clarity on this fundamental question of human rights and      human dignity is vital to that larger struggle.       Thank you for your assistance.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                            General Counsel of the                                        Department of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2003.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing in response to your June      2, 2003, letter to Dr. Rice raising a number of legal      questions regarding the treatment of detainees held by the      United States in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks      on the United States and in this Nation's war on terrorists      of global reach. We appreciate and fully share your concern      for ensuring that in the conduct of this war against a      ruthless and unprincipled foe, the United States does not      compromise its commitment to human rights in accordance with      the law.       In response to your specific inquiries, we can assure you      that it is the policy of the United States to comply with all      of its legal obligations in its treatment of detainees, and      in particular with legal obligations prohibiting torture. Its      obligations include conducting interrogations in a manner      that is consistent with the Convention Against Torture and      Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment      (``CAT'') as ratified by the United States in 1994. And it      includes compliance with the Federal anti-torture statute, 18      U.S.C.. Sec. Sec. 2340-2340A, which Congress enacted to      fulfill U.S. obligations under the CAT. The United States      does not permit, tolerate or condone any such torture by its      employees under any circumstances.       Under Article 16 of the CAT, the United States also has an      obligation to ``undertake . . . to prevent other acts of      cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment which do      not amount to torture.'' As you noted, because the terms in      Article 16 are not defined, the United States ratified the      CAT with a reservation to this provision. This reservation      supplies an important definition for the term ``cruel,      inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.''      Specifically, this reservation provides that ``the United      States considers itself bound by the obligation under article      16 to prevent, `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or      punishment' only in so far as the term `cruel, inhuman or      degrading treatment or punishment' means the cruel, unusual      and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth,      Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of      the United States.'' United States policy is to treat all      detainees and conduct all interrogations, wherever they may      occur, in a manner consistent with this commitment.       As your letter stated, it would not be appropriate to      catalogue the interrogation techniques used by U.S. personnel      in fighting international terrorism, and thus we cannot      comment on specific cases or practices. We can assure you,      however, that credible allegations of illegal conduct by U.S.      personnel will be investigated and, as appropriate, reported      to proper authorities. In this connection, the Department of      Defense investigation into the deaths at Bagram, Afghanistan,      is still in progress. Should any investigation indicate that      illegal conduct has occurred, the appropriate authorities      would have a duty to take action to ensure that any      individuals responsible are held accountable in accordance      with the law.       With respect to Article 3 of the CAT, the United States      does not ``expel, return (`refouler') or extradite''      individuals to other countries where the U.S. believes it is      ``more likely than not'' that they will be tortured. Should      an individual be transferred to another country to be held on      behalf of the United States, or should we otherwise deem it      appropriate, United States policy is to obtain specific      assurances from the receiving country that it will not      torture the individual being transferred to that country. We      can assure you that the United States would take steps to      investigate credible allegations of torture and take      appropriate action if there were reason to believe that those      assurances were not being honored.       In closing, I want to express my appreciation for your      thoughtful questions. We are committed to protecting the      people of this Nation as well as to upholding its fundamental      values under the law.           Sincerely,     William J. Haynes II.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2003.     William J. Haynes II,     General Counsel, Department of Defense,     Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Haynes: Thank you for your June 25, 2003, letter      concerning U.S. policy with regard to the treatment of      detainees held by the United States.        I very much appreciate your clear statement that it is the      policy of the United States to comply with all of its legal      obligations under the Convention Against Torture and Other      Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). I      also welcome your statement that it is United States policy      to treat all detainees and conduct all interrogations,      wherever they may occur, in a manner consistent with our      government's obligation, under Article 16 of the CAT, ``to      prevent other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment      or punishment'' as prohibited under the Fifth, Eighth, and      Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.        This statement of policy rules out the use of many of the      ``stress and duress'' interrogation techniques that have been      alleged in press reports over the last several months,      including beatings, lengthy sleep and food deprivation, and      shackling detainees in painful positions for extended periods      of time. It should also go a long way towards answering      concerns that have been expressed by our friends overseas      about the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. It should      strengthen our nation's ability to lead by example in the      protection of human rights around the world, and our ability      to protect Americans, including our service members, should      they be detained abroad.        At the same time, the ultimate credibility of this policy      will depend on its implementation by U.S. personnel around      the world. In that spirit, I would appreciate it if you could      clarify how the administration's policy to comply with the      CAT is communicated to those personnel directly involved in      detention and interrogation? As you note in your letter, the      U.S. obligation under Article 16 of the CAT is to ``undertake      . . . to prevent'' cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or      punishment. What is the administration doing to prevent      violations? Have any recent directives regulations or general      orders been issued to implement the policy your June 25      letter describes? If so, I would appreciate receiving a copy.       I understand that interrogations conducted by the U.S.      military are governed at least in part by Field Manual 34-52,      which prohibits ``the use of force, mental torture, threats,      insults, or exposure to unpleasant and inhumane treatment of      any kind.'' This field manual rightly stresses that ``the use      of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable      results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can      induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator      wants to hear.'' Are there further guidelines that in any way      add to, define, or limit the prohibitions contained in this      field manual? What mechanisms exist for ensuring compliance      with these guidelines?        Most important, I hope you can assure me that      interrogators working for other agencies, including the CIA,      operate from the same guidelines as the Department of      Defense. If CIA or other interrogation guidelines in use by      any person working for or on behalf of the U.S. government      differ, could you clarify how, and why?        I am pleased that before handing over detainees for      interrogation to third countries, the United States obtains      specific assurances that they will not be tortured. I remain      concerned, however, that mere assurances from countries that      are known to practice torture systematically are not      sufficient. While you state that the United States would      follow up on any credible information that such detainees      have been mistreated, how would such information emerge if no      outsiders have access to these detainees? Has the      administration considered seeking assurances that an      organization such as the International Committee for the Red      Cross have access to detainees after they have been turned      over? If not, I urge you to do so.        Finally, has the administration followed up on specific      allegations reported in the press that such detainees may      have been tortured, including claims regarding a German      citizen sent to Syria in 2001, and statements by former CIA      official Vincent Cannistrano concerning an al-Qaeda detainee      sent from Guantanamo to Egypt (see enclosed articles)?        Thank you again for your response to my last letter.           With best regards,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                            Department of Defense,                                    Office of General Counsel,                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2003.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am responding to your September 9,      2003 letter, which follows up on the June 25, 2003 letter      from Mr. Haynes concerning U.S. policy on the treatment of      detainees held by the United States in the war on terrorism.      The earlier letter to you and an April 2, 2003 letter to the      Executive Director of Human Rights Watch (enclosed) contain      precise statements of U.S. policy. As statements of U.S.      policy, they reflect the policy applicable to the Executive      Branch.       Your letter inquired about Department of Defense (DoD)      implementation of the policy described in the June 25 letter.      The Department takes its compliance with U.S. obligations      very seriously. For that reason, the Department has a Law of      War Program, which is governed by DoD directive 5100.77      (December 9, 1998), a copy of which is enclosed. That      Directive, among other things, provides that it is DoD policy      to ensure that DoD components observe the law of war      obligations of the United States, and that those components      implement an effective program to prevent violations of the      law of war. Through the Law of War Program, the Department      seeks to prevent law of war violations through training and      by instructing DoD personnel about U.S. obligations, and      ensuring that qualified legal advisers are available at all      levels of command to provide advice on compliance with the      law of war.       Moreover, DoD personnel are instructed to report      allegations of mistreatment of or injuries to detained enemy      combatants through normal command channels for ultimate      transmission to appropriate authorities. Individual military      personnel bear a responsibility to ensure their compliance.      Commanding officers carry the additional responsibility to be      aware of and to direct the conduct of the men and women under      their command in order to, among other things, ensure their      compliance with U.S. obligations in matters such as the      treatment of those detained in an armed conflict. Although      our principal institutional focus is, as it should be, on      compliance with the law of war and avoiding and preventing      violations of it, DoD also has an effective military criminal      justice system for detecting, investigating, prosecuting, and      punishing misconduct by military personnel should it occur.       Your letter also asked whether follow-up had occurred      regarding allegations appearing in stories in the Washington      Post on January 31, 2003, in Newsday on February 6, 2003, and      in the Los Angeles Times on March 3, 2003. With respect to      the first story, it does not allege unlawful activity by any      U.S. official because participation in questioning abroad and      knowledge of transfers to third countries, without more, do      not contravene the law. With respect to the second story, the      allegations of improper treatment it contains are by an      individual who has not been a Central Intelligence Agency      employee since well before 2001. With respect to the final      story, the unnamed sources are quoted as saying that they did      not know details, but they nevertheless then speculated about      what was happening. To the extent that it might be possible      to construe the latter two stories as containing allegations      about the treatment of individuals while outside military      control, I understand that the Office of the Director of      Central Intelligence (DCI) has copies of these articles and      is responsible for appropriate action.       Please allow me to emphasize that press stories often      contain allegations that are untrue, and that my mention of      the office of the DCI indicates nothing concerning the merits      of those allegations and it does not express a view      concerning what action might be appropriate.       I appreciate very much the opportunity to address your      concerns. The Administration is committed to carrying out the      law as we continue our dedicated efforts to protect Americans      from terrorism.           Sincerely,                                              Daniel J. Dell'Orto,     Principal Deputy General Counsel.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2003.     Hon. Robert S. Mueller,     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,     Washington, DC.       Dear Director Mueller: I am writing to inquire about the      role the FBI may have played in the extraordinary rendition      of Maher Arar, a Canadian and Syrian citizen, from the United      States to Syria last year.       Press reports indicate that Mr. Arar was stopped by      immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport      as he attempted to change planes on his way home to Canada      from Tunisia. Mr. Arar claims that he was then interrogated      by an FBI agent and a New York City police officer. He      further claims that, ``They told me I had no right to a      lawyer because I was not an American citizen,'' and that he      repeatedly told U.S. officials that he feared he would be      tortured if returned to Syria. ``Deported Terror Suspect      Details Torture in Syria,'' Washington Post, November 5,      2003. After being held for nearly two weeks in a federal      detention center, Mr. Arar alleges that he was then handed      over to U.S. intelligence officials who flew him to Jordan      and turned him over to Jordanian authorities, who beat him.      He was then taken to Syria, where he was detained and      allegedly tortured over a period of ten months.       While the Bush administration officially denies engaging in      extraordinary renditions of this sort, numerous unnamed      intelligence officials have admitted to the press that      renditions have occurred, purportedly under a ``secret      rendition policy.'' Id. This policy was described as ``a      secret presidential `finding' authorizing the CIA to place      suspects in foreign hands without due process.'' Id.       I find Mr. Arar's claims and the underlying rendition      policy deeply troubling and would like information on the      role of the FBI, if any, in this case.       1. Under what specific authority was Mr. Arar detained,      first at the airport and then at the federal detention center      in Brooklyn?       2. Is it true that one or more FBI agents interrogated Mr.      Arar after he was detained by immigration officers at JFK      airport?       3. If so, is it true that Mr. Arar was denied access to      counsel?       4. Did the FBI participate in any manner in the transfer of      Mr. Arar to Washington, D.C., Jordan, Syria, or to any other      location?       5. An intelligence official is quoted in the Washington      Post story as saying, ``The Justice Department did not have      enough evidence to detain him when he landed in the United      States.'' If this is true and if, as has also been reported      in the press, U.S. officials were in contact with Canadian      authorities, why did the FBI and/or other officials choose      not to turn Arar over to Canadian authorities?       6. In a June 25, 2003, letter to me on the subject of      rendition and other matters, the U.S. Defense Department      General Counsel, William Haynes, stated that the ``United      States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the      receiving country that it will not torture the individual      being transferred to that country.'' Did the United States      seek assurances from Jordan and/or Syria that Mr. Arar would      not be subject to torture, or to cruel, or inhuman, or      degrading treatment or punishment while in the custody of      either nation? If so, what steps did the United States take      after his rendition to assess compliance with such assurances      in this case? Were the assurances provided in writing? If so,      please provide a copy to the Committee. If such a document is      classified, please arrange for cleared staff to view it. If      no assurances were obtained, please explain why not.       7. Under U.S. law, non-citizens who express concerns about      torture if removed are entitled to an evaluation of their      claim before being removed. Under the specific regulations      that were likely applied to Mr. Arar's removal, there is an      explicit prohibition against returning someone to a country      where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be      subjected to torture. What process was used, if any, to      evaluate the likelihood that Mr. Arar would be subjected to      torture before removing him to Syria?       8. Are you aware of a ``secret presidential 'finding'      authorizing the CIA to place suspects in foreign hands      without due process''? If so, please provide a copy to the      Committee. If such a document is classified, please arrange      for cleared staff to view it.       9. Has the FBI participated in any other alleged      renditions, including interviewing and then handing suspects      over to intelligence officers for transfer to another      country?       Thank you for your prompt answers to these questions.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator.                                  ____                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, November 21, 2003.     Hon. John Ashcroft,     Attorney General, Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: I am writing to inquire      about the rendition of Maher Arar, a Canadian and Syrian      citizen, from the United States to Syria last year.       I wrote to FBI Director Robert Mueller about this case on      Monday, November 17. (See attached). Since that time,      additional     information on this case has been provided to the press,      mainly in statements by unnamed administration officials, but      also by Department of Justice (DOJ) spokespersons.       Washington Post articles indicate that the deportation of      Mr. Arar was approved on October 7, 2002, by then-Deputy      Attorney General Larry Thompson, who signed the order in his      capacity as Acting Attorney General. ``Man Was Deported After      Syrian Assurances,'' Washington Post, November 20, 2003      [hereinafter Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2003]; ``Top Justice      Aide Approved Sending Suspect to Syria,'' Washington Post,      November 19, 2003. The same story states that U.S. officials      ``decided to send [Arar] to Syria last year only after the      CIA received assurances from Syria that it would not torture      the man.'' Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2003. And yet,      ``spokesmen at the Department of Justice declined to comment      on why they believed the Syrian assurances to be credible.''      Id.       Mr. Arar claims that he was, in fact, tortured while in      Syrian custody. The Syrian government has denied that Arar      was subjected to torture, but statements from U.S. officials      contradict that assertion. In a November 15 New York Times      article, ``American officials who spoke on condition of      anonymity,'' were quoted as saying that Arar ``confessed      under torture in Syria that he had gone to Afghanistan for      terrorist training, named his instructors and gave other      intimate details.'' ``Qaeda Pawn, U.S. Calls Him. Victim, He      Calls Himself,'' New York Times, November 15, 2003 (emphasis      added). I find this statement to be shocking in light of the      administration's assertions that it acted within the scope of      its international treaty obligations.       Mr. Arar claims to have stated repeatedly to his U.S.      interrogators that he feared torture at the hands of the      Syrian government. Whether or not Mr. Arar had ties to      terrorist organizations, as is alleged by U.S. officials, or      whether his confession was a false one produced by coercion,      as he claims, he was subject to the legal protections      provided by the Convention Against Torture, which the United      States has ratified.       The statements by Mr. Arar and the unnamed sources in the      New York Times article cited above beg the question of      whether the United States has investigated Syria's alleged      non-compliance with any assurances it provided to the U.S.      government. This question is especially critical in light of      President Bush's statement on November 7, 2003, that Syria      has left ``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and      ruin'' to its people.       In light of the above facts and assertions, I request that      you provide detailed answers to the following questions:       1. Under what specific authority was Mr. Arar detained,      first at John F. Kennedy Airport and then at the federal      detention center in Brooklyn, New York?       2. Is it true that Mr. Arar was denied access to counsel,      as he claims?       3. An intelligence official is quoted in a November 5      Washington Post story as saying, ``The Justice Department did      not have enough evidence to detain him when he landed in the      United States.'' ``Deported Terror Suspect Details Torture in      Syria,'' Washington Post, November 5, 2003. It has also been      reported that U.S. officials were in contact with Canadian      authorities regarding this case. Given that Mr. Arar, a      Canadian citizen, resides in Canada and was traveling home to      Canada when he was detained at the airport, why did the      officials choose not to turn Arar over to Canadian      authorities?       4. Did you become aware of Mr. Arar's case at any point      between his detention on September 26, 2002, and October 7,      2002, the date the deportation order was signed by Mr.      Thompson? Did Mr. Thompson, who was serving as Acting      Attorney General when he signed the order, consult with you      before signing the order? Did you approve this action?       5. In a June 25, 2003, letter to me on the subject of      rendition and other matters, the U.S. Defense Department      General Counsel, William Haynes, stated that the ``United      States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the      receiving country that it will not torture the individual      being transferred to that country.'' The November 20      Washington Post article cited above confirms that assurances      were obtained from Syria. What was the scope of such      assurances? Were they provided to the U.S. government in      writing? If so, please provide a copy to the Committee. If      such a document is classified, please arrange for cleared      staff to view it. If the assurances were not provided in      writing, please explain why written assurances were not      sought or provided.       6. What steps did the United States after Arar's rendition      to assess compliance with the assurances provided by Syria in      this case?       7. Is the statement of an unnamed official above that Arar      ``confessed under torture'' accurate? If so, then Syria's      actions violated the assurances provided to the U.S. before      Arar's rendition. What has the U.S. done (a) to investigate      such non-compliance and (b) to hold Syria accountable for      such violations.       8. Under U.S. law, non-citizens who express concerns about      torture if removed are entitled to an evaluation of their      claim before being removed. Under the specific regulations      that were likely applied to Mr. Arar's removal, there is an      explicit prohibition against returning someone to a country      where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be      subject to torture. What process was used, if any, to      evaluate the likelihood that Mr. Arar would be subjected to      torture before removing him to Syria?       9. According to the November 5 Washington Post article      cited in question 3, numerous unnamed intelligence officials      have admitted to the press that renditions have occurred,      purportedly under a ``secret rendition policy.'' This policy      was described as ``a secret presidential `finding'      authorizing the CIA to place suspects in foreign hands      without due process.'' Are you aware of a ``secret      presidential `finding' authorizing the CIA to place suspects      in foreign hands without due process''? If so, please provide      a copy to the Committee. If such a document is classified,      please arrange for cleared staff to view it.       10. Has the FBI or DOJ authorized or participated in any      other alleged renditions, including interviewing and then      handing suspects over to intelligence officers for transfer      to another country?       11. In its effort to fight terrorism, the administration      has focused on individuals who have connections to Al Qaeda      that need to be further explored, and has argued that it has      the right to detain and interrogate prisoners in Guantanamo      Bay, perhaps as unlawful combatants or enemy combatants, as      long ``as it is necessary to help win the war against the Al      Qaeda network and its allies.'' Washington Post, ```High      Court Will Hear Appeals From Guantanamo Prisoners,'' November      11, 2003. Notwithstanding my concerns about the legal status      of those detained at Guantanamo, and the administration's      treatment of enemy combatants in general, it would seem that      Mr. Arar fit the classic administration profile for someone      who should be detained in Guantanamo. Presumably, Mr. Arar      would have been safer in detention at Guantanamo Bay than in      Syria.       a. Was the option to detain Arar as an enemy combatant in      Guantanamo Bay considered and rejected in favor of rendition      to Syria? If so, on what basis was the decision made to send      him to Syria?       b. Where there is more than one destination country to      which detainees may be rendered, do you believe there should      be a policy to render detainees to the country where torture      is least likely (e.g., a country that does not have a history      of documented humanitarian abuses)?       c. What is the standard applied by the administration in      determining whether to deport an individual, transfer the      individual to custody at Guantanamo Bay, or to charge the      individual with a crime?       Thank you for your prompt answers to these questions.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senator.                          ____________________
