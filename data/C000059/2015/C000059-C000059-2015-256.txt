Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Temecula, California are exceptional. Temecula has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated people who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dan Atwood is one of these individuals. On February 21, 2015, Dan will be honored at the Temecula Chamber of Commerce Annual Awards Gala where he will receive the Lifetime Achievement Award.  After moving to California in the 1970s, Dan quickly immersed himself into the automotive industry, eventually purchasing his first dealership in 1987. Launching forward from there, Dan opened a second dealership, Temecula Toyota. Dan's business has been a staple of the community which continually keeps pace with the ever-expanding region. In the twenty-five year span that the dealership has been operating, it has always been under the watchful eyes of the Atwood family, even as the dealership has grown to employ over two hundred employees.  Dan has given his time to the community not only as a businessman, but as a dedicated citizen committed to improving and strengthening the Temecula region. He has continually served numerous organizations in order to give back to the community that has always supported his endeavors. The groups that Dan is involved in span from nationally recognized non-profits, such as Habitat for Humanity, to locally started organizations such as the Balloon and Wine Festival. For over ten years,Dan has also opened his doors to Safe Alternative for Everyone and their highly successful Denim and Diamonds fundraiser, bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars to benefit victims of domestic abuse. Additionally, the gates of the Atwood Estate Winery, another Atwood venture, are often opened on multiple occasions during the year to host fundraisers benefiting the community. As a firm believer in the future of tomorrow, Dan has worked to never miss a chance to participate in events that benefit the youth of the community. From sponsoring events to providing full-ride college scholarships, to serving as a mentor at the Boys & Girls Club, Dan has invested himself in the future generations of community leaders.  In light of all Dan Atwood has done for the community of Temecula, the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce announced Dan to be their Lifetime Achievement Award recipient. Dan's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Temecula, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many local citizens are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
