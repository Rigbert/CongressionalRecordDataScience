 I think the energy revolution is wonderful and we ought to embrace it. As I was saying earlier, what has happened in my State as a result of the war on coal, 90 percent of our electricity in Kentucky comes from coal-fired generation. We have been among the top five of the lowest utility rates in the country in any given year for as long as anyone can remember.  The war on coal is not only a war on coal miners. It is a war on all of Kentucky because our utility rates are beginning to go up, which is going to make the energy less affordable for people on fixed incomes in my State and make us less able to compete for other industries.  I repeat. I am thrilled at what is going on in North Dakota and what is going on in Texas. We would like to have some of that job growth ourselves and calling off this Environmental Protection Agency which seems to be just hell-bent to take coal out of the equation.  It is a heavy price to pay for this ideological crusade which the President seeks to lead on a worldwide basis and says to the Chinese they don't have to do anything for 16 years while we take away our own jobs and opportunity.
