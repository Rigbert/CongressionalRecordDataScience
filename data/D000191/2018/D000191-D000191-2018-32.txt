 Again, I want to particularly congratulate the chairman on his accomplishment of resuscitating regular WRDA reauthorizations, and this, of course, will be the last time in which he will be on the floor on this particular issue.  I would also like to thank the staff, Ryan Seiger, Mike Brain; from Representative Napolitano's office, Joe Sheehy; and a special thanks to legislative counsel, whose staff tells me was absolutely fabulous on this, Kakuti Lin. And then, of course, I believe the chairman will thank his staff, but I would also extend thanks to them but not name them individually if he is going to do that.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
