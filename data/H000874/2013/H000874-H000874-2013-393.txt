Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate an extraordinary team of young men from Maryland's Fifth Congressional District. The Bowie State University Bulldogs won the CIAA Men's Basketball Championship on March 2, 2013. This is their second conference championship in team history and second NCAA Tournament berth in three seasons. This incredible achievement was made all the more significant given the caliber of their competition.  Once in tournament play, the Bulldogs emerged victorious over Chowan University, Lincoln University, and Winston Salem State University to ultimately meet Livingston College in the conference championship game at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Bulldogs prevailed, overcoming the Livingston Blue Bears with a final score of 85-74.  This victory demonstrates that with determination, willpower, and discipline we can work to overcome any obstacle in the path of achieving success. After entering the tournament as a fourth seed, the Bowie StateMen's Basketball team has gone above and beyond expectations. The Bulldogs end their 2013 season not only with a conference championship, but also a berth into the NCAA Division II Tournament.  Fifteen student-athletes contributed to this triumphant season, remaining focused and determined to continue the success of Bowie State Men's Basketball.  Mr. Speaker, I offer my heartiest congratulations to the members of the championship team--Julian Williams, Ray Gatling, Trawn Rogers, Cameron Knox, Dameatric Scott, Najee White, Tyrone Lawson, Jr., Carlos Smith, Byron Westmorland, Justin Beck, Bryan Wilson, Julian Harrell, David Golladay, Joel Clemmons, and Branden Doughty--on their victory. And, I also want to applaud Head Coach Darrell Brooks and his coaching staff--Larry Stewart, Sedric Baker, Darius Wilson, and Delmar Carey--for their dedication and commitment while guiding these talented student-athletes.  Like all Marylanders, I am very proud of these young men and I congratulate all of those involved in bringing home a conference title. I ask that my colleagues join me in applauding this great accomplishment.                          ____________________
