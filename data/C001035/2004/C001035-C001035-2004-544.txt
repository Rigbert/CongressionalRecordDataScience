President, Our Nation's manufacturers can compete against the best in the world, but they cannot compete against nations that provide huge subsidies and other unfair advantages to their producers. I hear from manufacturers in my State time and time again whose efforts to compete successfully in the global economy simply cannot overcome the practices of illegal pricing and subsidies of nations such as China. The results of these unfair practices are lost jobs, shuttered factories, and decimated communities.  Our Nation's trade remedy laws are intended to give American industries and their employees relief from the effects of illegal trade practices. Yet, while U.S. anti-dumping laws can be currently applied to non-market economies, countervailing duty laws cannot. It is time that this was changed.  This is why I am introducing the ``Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act.'' This bill revises current trade remedy laws to ensure that U.S. countervailing duty laws apply to imports from non-market economies. It is simply not fair to prevent U.S. industries from seeking redress from these unfair trade practices because our trade remedy laws are outdated.  Over the past two decades, there have been significant economic changes in many of the countries classified as non-market economies. This is particularly true in China, one of our largest trading partners and the country with which the United States currently runs its largest trade deficit.  At the time our Nation's countervailing duty laws were approved in 1979, it was impracticable to apply these laws to China. In 1979, China's economy was still centrally planned, and most of its economic output was directed and controlled by the state, which set production goals, controlled prices, and allocated the country's resources. When an entire economy is controlled by the government, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine what defines a government subsidy that causes harm to U.S. industries.  But beginning in the early 1980's and continuing today, China has undertaken major economic reforms. Today, China's economy is a far cry from being completely state-controlled. Government price controls on a wide range of products have been eliminated. Many enterprises and even entire industries have been allowed to operate and compete in an economic system that has elements of a free market. Many coastal regions and coastal cities in China have been designated as so-called ``open'' cities and development zones, where there is a free market and tax and trade incentives are offered to attract foreign investment. And, of course, china has taken steps toward fully integrating into the global trading system by joining to the World Trade Organization and by working toward the establishment of a modern commercial, financial, legal, and regulatory infrastructure.  The problem is not China's economic liberalization and modernization. The problem is this: now that China has the capacity to be a key international economic player, the country has repeatedly refused to comply with standard international trading rules and practices. And these violations include the use of subsidies and other economic incentives that are designed to give its producers an unfair competitive advantage.  The most glaringly obvious subsidy comes in the form of currency manipulation. By keeping the Chinese yuan pegged to the U.S. dollar at artificially low levels, the Chinese undervalue the prices of their exports. Not only does this practice provide their producers with a price advantage, but also it violates the International Monetary Fund and WTO rules. The Chinese government also reimburses many enterprises for their operating losses and provides loans to uncreditworthy companies.  Currently, U.S. industries have no direct recourse to combat these unfair practices. They instead must rely upon government-to-government negotiations or the dispute settlement processes of international organizations such as the WTO. While these channels might eventually lead to relief, it usually takes years to see results--and by that time, that industry could already be decimated.  Mr. President, unfair market conditions cannot continue to cause our manufacturers to hemorrhage jobs. No State understands this more than my home State of Maine. According to a study by the National Association of Manufacturers, on a percentage basis, Maine has lost more manufacturing jobs in the past three years than any other State.  There are many reasons for manufacturing job losses, including heavy tax and regulatory burdens. This is why I recently introduced a bill that would provide a variety of tax incentives for our Nation's manufacturers. However, without a level international playing field, tax reductions will not be enough to stop the flight of U.S. manufacturing jobs.  Industries across Maine that produce products ranging from paper to footwear to furniture are being harmed by unfair trade practices, and it is time that we put a stop to it. I ask you to join me in supporting the SOS bill to ensure that all countries are held accountable for their trade practices.                                 ______                                       By
