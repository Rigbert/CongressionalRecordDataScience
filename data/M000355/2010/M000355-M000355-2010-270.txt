 Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr.         Durbin, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Dodd):  S.J. Res. 29. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a joint resolution that would renew sanctions against the Burmese junta. As in years past, I am joined in this effort by my good friend Senator Feinstein. Senators McCain, Durbin, Gregg, and Lieberman are original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation and continue to be leaders on the issue.  Renewing sanctions against the military regime in Burma is as timely and as important as ever. Over the past year, the regime has not only made clear that it has no intention of reforming, it is also trying to stand up a new sham constitution and to legitimize itself in the eyes of the world through a sham election. In my view, the United States must deny the regime that legitimacy.  By way of background, a little history is in order. For nearly half a century, Burma has been under some kind of military rule, and every popular effort to reverse that situation has failed. In 1988, military authorities violently put down a popular uprising. Two years later, the Burmese people went to the polls and handed an overwhelming victory to the prodemocracy opposition, and the junta ignored the results. It never seated these popularly elected candidates. It jailed prodemocracy leaders, such as Aung San Suu Kyi, and it has maintained its brutal rule ever since.  In response to these events, the United States established on a bipartisan basis various sanctions against the Burmese regime.
