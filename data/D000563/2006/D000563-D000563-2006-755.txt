President, I have an amendment related to the rendition of prisoners which I would like to say a word about before we adjourn today. There may be an indication that there are still a few more amendments to be forthcoming. I will bring my amendment to your attention today, and I hope all Members will do the same so that you can plot the schedule for the upcoming week.
