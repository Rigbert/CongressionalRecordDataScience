Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to the outstanding achievements of an exceptional group of students from Munster High School, located in Indiana's First Congressional District. From April 29 to May 1, 2006, these students competed in the National Finals of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program held in Washington, DC. For their knowledge and understanding of the American government, these extraordinary young people were awarded the Central Region Award at this year's competition.  The We the People program, administered by the Center for Civic Education, is a program that reaches over 28 million elementary, middle, and high school students. The goal of the program is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The program helps students to understand their rights under the American governmental system.  The people of Munster, as well as the entire Northwest Indiana community, can be proud of the following members of this truly remarkable class of students: Sara Brown, Emily Clark, Andrea Coulis, Kim Dooley, Reem (Sara)Farooq, Scott Goodwin, Lauren Hudak, Hannah Huebner, Casey Jedrzejczak, Alexis Jeter, Joseph Kasenga, Emily Lyness, Thomas Paliga, Shobba Pai, Samantha Skrobot, Tamiko Toyama, Lindsay Weiss, and Matt Westerlund. The teacher for this award winning team was Michael Gordon.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to the members of Munster High School's We the People program for their commitment to excellence, as well as to the faculty members who have instilled in their students the desire to succeed. The values exhibited by these young people and their interest in the history and fundamentals of our great Nation serve to inspire us all. I am proud to represent these fine individuals in Congress, and I am proud to have been given this opportunity to recognize these future leaders. I look forward to their future achievements as they continue to rise to the top.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E835-E836]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              TRIBUTE TO STUDENTS FROM MUNSTER HIGH SCHOOL                                 ______                                                         HON.
