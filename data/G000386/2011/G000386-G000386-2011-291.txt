 President, as we begin the 112th Congress I want to discuss one of my continuing concerns with the Medicare Program. For the last 10 years, I have served most recently as ranking member and previously as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, which has jurisdiction over Medicare. During this time I have led efforts to reform the Medicare payment system and realign incentives in Medicare to promote higher quality and more efficient care. Today, I would like to address one of the flaws in the Medicare payment system: the inaccuracy of the Medicare geographic adjustment factors used for physician practice expense and the adverse impact they have on rural Medicare beneficiaries' access to care. This flaw has for many years resulted in unfairly low payments to high quality areas like my own home State of Iowa and many other rural States.  Medicare payment varies from one area to another based on the geographic adjustments known as the geographic practice cost indices or GPCIs. These geographic adjustments are intended to equalize physician payment by reflecting differences in physician's practice costs. But they do not accurately represent those costs in Iowa or other rural States. They have failed to do the job. They penalize rather than equalize Medicare reimbursement in rural States and discourage physicians from practicing in areas like New Mexico, Arkansas, Missouri, and Iowa because of their unfairly low Medicare rates. Iowa is widely recognized as providing some of the highest quality care in the country yet Iowa physicians receive some of the lowest Medicare reimbursement in the country due to these inequitable geographic disparities.  I introduced legislation to correct these unwarranted geographic payment disparities in the 110th Congress, the Medicare Physician Payment Equity Act of 2008. In the 111th Congress, I introduced the Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2009. And when the Senate Finance Committee conducted its markup of health reform legislation in the fall of 2009, I offered an amendment to reform the practice expense geographic adjustment, PE GPCI, that has caused unduly low payments in rural areas due to the inaccurate data and methodology that is used. My amendment provided more equity and accuracy in calculating this adjustment, and it provided a national solution to the problem. It was accepted unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee, and it was included in the Senate health reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, PPACA, that was enacted last year.  The goal of my amendment was to assure that the statutory mandate of the Social Security Act is met and that the most recent and relevant data is used for these geographic adjusters. The language of section 3102(b) is veryspecific. It requires a transitional 2-year period of limited relief to reduce the impact of the current, inequitable practice expense formula in rural areas while a broader analysis of the methodology and evaluation of the data is conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS. The Secretary is mandated to limit the impact of the existing adjustments by reflecting only one-half of the geographic differences in employee wages and rents in the PE GPCI adjustment for 2010 and 2011 and to hold harmless those localities that would otherwise see a reduction as a result of this adjustment. Most importantly, the provision requires that a longer term solution be implemented in 2012, at which time the Secretary must make appropriate adjustments to the formula to ensure accurate geographic practice expense adjustments.  This 2-year transition in 2010 and 2011 was provided to allow time for a focused, in-depth study by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, on the data and methodology used to support a revised PE GPCI formula that would be implemented by January 1, 2012. However, to date CMS has failed to make any significant changes in the sources of the data or the methodology used in calculation of the practice expense adjustment. Although CMS has acknowledged its obligations for an additional study as called for by section 3102(b), they continue to claim that their ``analysis of the current methods of establishing PE GPCIs and [their] evaluation of data that fairly and reliably establish distinctions in the cost of operating a medical practice in the different fee schedule areas meet the statutory requirements'' of section 3102(b), Federal Register, November 29, 2010, Page 73254. I strongly disagree.  When the current Medicare payment system was established, Congress decided that geographic adjustments would be appropriate to equalize physician payment by reflecting differences in physicians' practice costs, and it established the geographic practice cost indices, GPCIs, for physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice premiums. Congress also mandated that HHS use the most recent data available relating to practice expenses in calculating the geographic adjustments for physician practice costs.  However, CMS has long relied upon proxy data sources that bear little to no relevance to actual practice costs, such as using Housing and Urban Development, HUD, apartment rental data to calculate physician office rent. This doesn't have any connection with the cost of office space, let alone a physician's office. Also, the current formula only counts employee wages in four occupations: nurses, clerical personnel and medical technicians but it should reflect employee wages more accurately by also taking into account physician assistants, office administrators, and other more highly compensated specialists commonly employed in practices today. The third category, of ``other'' expense, is considered to be a national market and not adjusted. It should include expenses like office furniture and information technology that cost the same, no matter where you live, but it doesn't. And the weights used by CMS in their methodology are outdated and fail to represent physician practice expenses accurately.  Unfortunately, the more accurate calculation of practice expense costs that was intended to be achieved by my amendment also has been jeopardized by a special interest provision that was added to PPACA behind the closed doors of the majority leader during the Senate floor consideration of health reform. It addresses geographic disparities in Medicare payment but it helps just 5 States at the expense of the other 45 States. It is what I call the ``Frontier Freeloader'' provision. It improves Medicare reimbursement in these frontier States by establishing floors for the hospital wage index and the physician practice expense GPCI. A frontier State is defined as one with 50 percent or more frontier counties, defined as counties with a population per square mile of less than six.  This special deal will ensure that higher payments go to just five rural States in 2011--North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Nevada--at the expense of every other State. But the Frontier Freeloader is even more egregious because Iowa and other States like Arkansas and New Mexico that don't benefit from this provision are paying for it! So, taxpayers in your State and mine all the other 45 States--will kick in to pay for this unfair $2 billion Frontier Freeloader carve-out for five States that ends up harming all the other rural States. And that is just the cost for the next few years. The frontier States deal does not sunset, and it is not time-limited. It will continue to benefit so-called ``frontier States'' forever while taxpayers in your State and mine continue to pay the bills. It's another example of how the lack of transparency and the deals made behind closed doors to garner votes last year led to bad policies. And it became law when the President signed the health care reform bill.  I introduced legislation to eliminate the inequitable frontier freeloader provision in the last Congress and to improve Medicare beneficiaries' access to care in all rural States. The Medicare Rural Health Care Equity Act of 2010 would have eliminated this special Medicare reimbursement rate for frontier States and provided additional funds from its repeal to improve reimbursement in all rural States. Iowa provides some of the highest quality care in the country but it does not meet the definition of a frontier State. Certainly Iowa should have been helped since Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and physicians is lower in Iowa than in most of these so-called ``frontier'' States. Medicare also pays much lower rates in other rural States, like Arkansas and New Mexico, but they don't benefit from the Frontier Freeloader because they don't meet the definition of a frontier State. We should improve physician payments for all rural States, not just a select few. And it's unfair to improve hospital payments for just a few States. My legislation would have eliminated those special payments for just five States, and I will be reintroducing that legislation again soon.  The Institute of Medicine, IOM, has been asked by HHS to evaluate the accuracy of the existing geographic adjustment factors and whether the current measures and data are representative of the costs. I have prepared a statement for consideration by the IOM committee charged with this review, the Committee on Geographic Adjustment Factors in the Medicare Program. I urge the IOM to address the inaccuracy of the current geographic adjusters used for physician practice expense, the methodology and data used in their calculation, and the adverse effect of the existing practice expense geographic adjustment factor on rural access to care. I also urge IOM to review the frontier States provision and provide HHS and Congress with recommendations on specific factors that could be used to determine physician practice costs in those States in lieu of the inequitable frontier States floor.  It is my hope that the IOM will carefully consider these comments as it proceeds with its review and develops recommendations and a report to be submitted to HHS and the Congress later this year. I ask unanimous consent that my statement to the IOM be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Statement of Senator Chuck Grassley (Institute of Medicine, Committee on Geographic Adjustment Factors in                    the Medicare Program, Jan 5, 2011)       As the senior senator from Iowa and the Ranking Member of      the United States Senate Committee on Finance in recent      years, I appreciate the opportunity to provide this statement      to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on a study that the IOM      has undertaken at the request of the Secretary of the      Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding the      accuracy of the geographic adjustment factors used for      Medicare payment.       For the last ten years, I served either as Ranking Member      or as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, which      has jurisdiction over Medicare. During this time, I led      congressional efforts to establish more accurate geographic      adjusters for Medicare physician payment and to realign      incentives in Medicare to promote higher quality and more      efficient care. This IOM committee has been asked to evaluate      the accuracy of the geographic adjustment factors and to      provide their recommendations as to whether the current      measures and data are representative of the costs. I would      like to address the inaccuracy of the current Medicare      geographic adjustment factors used for physician practice      expense, the methodology and     data used in their calculation, and the adverse effect of the      existing practice expense geographic adjustment factors on      rural access to care. I offer these comments for      consideration by the committee as it proceeds with its review      and develops its recommendations and report to HHS and      Congress later this year.            Medicare's Flawed Geographic Adjustment Factors       Medicare's payment system for physicians is flawed in many      ways. One of those flaws is the unjustified geographic      disparities in payment that has for many years given unfairly      low payments to high quality areas like my home state of Iowa      and other rural states. Geographic equity in Medicare payment      has been a longstanding issue of major concern to me. The new      health care reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable      Care Act (PPACA), includes a provision I authored that makes      some much needed changes in the calculation of the geographic      adjustment factors that is intended to provide more equitable      payments to physicians in rural areas and to improve access      to health care for Medicare beneficiaries in rural states.       Medicare payment differences from one area to another based      on the geographic adjustments known as the Geographic      Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) are intended to equalize      physician payment by reflecting differences in physician's      practice costs but they do not accurately represent those      costs in Iowa or other rural states. They have been a dismal      failure, in fact. They discourage physicians from practicing      in rural areas because they create unfairly low Medicare      reimbursement rates.       I introduced legislation to correct these unwarranted      geographic payment disparities in the 110th Congress, the      Medicare Physician Payment Equity Act of 2008, as well as the      Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2009 in the      111th Congress. In the fall of 2009, I also offered an      amendment in the Senate Finance Committee markup of health      reform legislation to reform the practice expense geographic      adjustment that has caused unduly low payments to physicians      in rural areas due to the inaccurate data and methodology      that is used.       My amendment was intended to provide more equity and      accuracy in calculating this adjustment as well as to provide      a national solution to the problems that have arisen from the      current unwarranted disparities in Medicare payment due to      these geographic adjustments. The amendment was accepted      unanimously by the Senate Finance Committee during markup of      Senate health reform legislation in September 2009. Section      3102(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act      (PPACA) that passed the Senate and became law is based on      this amendment. It requires HHS to improve the accuracy of      the Practice Expense Geographic Practice Cost Index (PE GPCI)      data and methodology and to examine the feasibility of using      actual data or reliable survey data on office rents and non-     physician staff wages. These two PE GPCI inputs, which are      the only inputs adjusted to reflect local costs, currently do      not measure physician costs. Instead, they rely upon proxies.      The current input adjustments are not credible because of      their reliance on proxy data sources rather than actual      physician practice costs. As a result, some physicians are      paid more and others are paid significantly less for the very      same service with the same time, effort, and expertise needed      to furnish that service to a Medicare beneficiary.       I urge the committee to note the wide differences in      physician payment under the GPCIs as currently constructed.      At the beginning of calendar year 2010, before the      transitional adjustments required by PPACA, a 38.894%      difference in Medicare physician payment on average existed      between the highest paid and the lowest-paid Medicare Part B      payment locality (Alaska and Puerto Rico) for the same      Medicare service. The PE GPCI disparity for this same period      was even greater, ranging from 1.441 (San Francisco) for the      highest to 0.694 for the lowest (Puerto Rico) and 0.821 for      the second lowest (the rest of Missouri), with 1.0 being the      average. The PE GPCI for Iowa was 0.870. This means that      physicians in San Francisco received a PE GPCI adjustment      that was 144 percent of the average, while Iowa physicians      received an adjustment of just 87 percent.       Survey findings of the American Medical Association (AMA)      and others challenge this significant range in payment      disparity by showing little measurable distinction in      physician practice expenses throughout the country. The AMA      PPIS is based on actual physician data, rather than the proxy      data upon which CMS relies. Geographic distinctions in      physician practice expense payment in rural areas should be      supported by accurate and reliable data and calculations. I      urge the committee to address this discrepancy between      credible surveys, based on real physician cost data, and the      PE GPCI range established by CMS.       Section 3102(b) requires a transitional two-year period of      limited relief to reduce the impact of the current,      inequitable practice expense formula in rural areas while a      broader analysis of the methodology and evaluation of the      data is conducted by HHS. The Secretary is mandated to limit      the impact of the existing adjustments by reflecting only one      half of the geographic differences in employee wages and      rents in the PE GPCI adjustment for 2010 and 2011 and to hold      harmless those localities that would otherwise see a      reduction as a result of this adjustment. The provision      requires that a longer-term solution be implemented in 2012,      at which time the Secretary must make appropriate adjustments      to the formula to ensure accurate geographic practice expense      adjustments. These statutory adjustments were intended to      moderate the negative effects of the existing inaccurate GPCI      disparities on low-paid Medicare regions while allowing time      for a focused, in-depth study by the Centers for Medicare and      Medicaid Services (CMS) on the inputs, weights, and data used      in the PE GPCI to support a revised formula that would be      implemented as of January 1, 2012.       Congress agreed at the inception of the current Medicare      payment system that, to the extent physicians practicing in      the various Medicare payment localities face higher or lower      practice expense burdens, reasonable distinctions in Medicare      payment would be appropriate, and it established the      Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) for physician work,      practice expenses, and malpractice premiums to do so. To      support the PE GPCI, Congress directed the Department of      Health and Human Services to ``use the most recent data      available relating to practice expenses . . . in different      fee schedule areas.'' (Social Security Act, Section      1848(e)(1)(D)). The statutory requirement makes it clear that      there must be a nexus between data sources and actual      physician practice expenses as represented by the inputs of      the PE GPCI.       However, CMS has long relied upon proxy data sources that      bear little to no relevance to actual practice costs.      Furthermore, the weights used by CMS are outdated and fail to      represent accurately the relativity in expenses in this      dynamic and ever-changing field. It is my understanding that      the PE GPCI, in particular, is currently supported by data      that is neither relevant to physician practices nor credible      to physicians. Physicians who serve the Medicare population      must bear the burden of their true practice costs while the      Medicare payment system upon which they rely fails to reflect      those same practice expense costs fairly and accurately.       The goal of Section 3102(b) is to assure that the statutory      mandate of the Social Security Act is met and that the most      recent and relevant data is used for these geographic      adjusters. The language of Section 3102(b) is very specific      in its directions but so far CMS has failed to make      significant changes in the methodology or data used in      calculation of the PE GPCI. The final CMS CY 2011 Medicare      physician payment rule sets forth the results of CMS' sixth      3-year GPCI review. Although CMS acknowledged its obligations      for an additional PE GPCI study under Section 3102(b) of      PPACA, they stated that their ``analysis of the current      methods of establishing PE GPCIs and [their] evaluation of      data that fairly and reliably establish distinctions in the      cost of operating a medical practice in the different fee      schedule areas meet the statutory requirements'' of Section      3102(b) (Federal Register, November 29, 2010, Page 73254).       The most recent CMS review and analysis does not provide a      new analysis and evaluation of data but merely treads old      ground, looking at the PE GPCI underlying data and its      weights along the lines of what other studies have already      examined. For example, CMS continues to rely, with little      justification, on Housing and Urban Development (HUD) section      8 apartment rent data as a proxy for physician rent even      though Section 3102(b) directs CMS to evaluate ``the      feasibility of using actual data or reliable survey data      developed by medical organizations on the costs of operating      a medical practice, including office rents and non-physician      staff wages in different fee schedule areas.'' If no suitable      nationwide data on rental rates for physician office space      currently exist, the IOM should recommend other approaches      for CMS to use in studying this issue to come up with more      reliable data than HUD apartment rents.       CMS acknowledged in the final physician payment rule for CY      2011 that there is much ongoing analysis of the PE GPCI data      that could form the basis of future GPCI changes. They stated      that they would ``review the complete findings and      recommendations from the Institute of Medicine's study of      geographic adjustment factors for physician payment'' along      with other HHS activities and continue to study the issues as      required by Section 3102(b) (Federal Register, November 29,      2010, Page 73256). CMS will consider the GPCIs for CY 2012      again in the context of their annual physician fee schedule      rulemaking beginning in CY 2011 based on information that is      available then.       A significantly more comprehensive analysis and detailed      evaluation should be conducted for the PE GPCI study mandated      by Section 3102(b) than what has been detailed by CMS in its      final CY 2011 Medicare physician payment rule. New studies,      data, and other approaches must exist or be developed to      facilitate reliability and accuracy in identifying actual      physician practice expenses and setting weights among those      expenses. That is why a two-year transition was provided: to      ensure that CMS would have sufficient time to do additional      studies, if needed, and come up with more meaningful data      than, for example, continuing to use apartment rental data      which bears no relation to the cost of a physician's office.      I urge the committee to provide CMS with specific      recommendations for more accurate methodology that could be      used to determine the PE GPCIs and obtain more reliable      actual or     survey data sources to be used in these calculations.               The Inequitable Frontier States Provision       Unfortunately, the more accurate calculation of practice      expense costs that was intended to be achieved by Section      3102(b) has been jeopardized by a special interest provision      that was added to PPACA behind closed doors during the Senate      floor consideration of health reform. The ``frontier states''      provision addresses geographic disparities but helps just      five states at the expense of the other 45. It improves      Medicare reimbursement in the so-called frontier states by      establishing a permanent 1.0 floor for the PE GPCI as well as      for the hospital wage index, effective January 1, 2011. A      frontier state is defined as one with 50 percent or more      frontier counties, defined as counties with a population per      square mile of less than six. The frontier states provision      ensures that higher Medicare physician payments resulting      from a higher PE GPCI adjustment go to just five states in      2011--Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and      Nevada.       Iowa provides some of the highest quality care in the      country but it does not meet the definition of a frontier      state. Yet Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and      physicians is lower in Iowa than in most of these so-called      frontier states. Medicare also pays much lower rates in other      rural states that do not meet the definition of a frontier      state.       The frontier states provision is even more egregious      because taxpayers in all 50 states will help pay the      estimated $2 billion cost for a provision that benefits just      five states. That amount is the Congressional Budget Office      cost estimate of the frontier states provision for the next      ten years. A practice expense floor for rural states may be      warranted but it should not be an adjustment for just a few      select states. This automatic pay increase for frontier state      physicians could result in reduced access for Medicare      beneficiaries in nearby rural states that do not have the 1.0      PE floor if physicians migrate to those rural areas where      Medicare payment has been significantly increased.       Last spring I introduced legislation, the Medicare Rural      Health Care Equity Act of 2010, to eliminate the special      Medicare reimbursement rates for frontier states. It is      imperative to reduce unwarranted geographic disparities and      base physician practice expense costs on actual or reliable      survey data, not by legislative fiat that improves physician      payments for just a few states. Although legislative action      would be required to make changes in this regard, I urge the      IOM to review this situation and provide recommendations to      HHS on whether specific factors should be considered to      determine physician practice costs in frontier states if such      a floor did not exist.                               Conclusion       The practice expense geographic adjustment factor has a      significant impact on the health care workforce in rural      areas, because it plays a major role in the ability to      recruit and retain physicians in rural areas who see more      patients and work longer hours for correspondingly lower pay.      This in turn can result in Medicare beneficiaries in rural      areas having reduced access to physicians and other health      care practitioners. Twenty percent of the population lives in      rural America yet only nine percent of physicians practice      there. Shortages of primary care and specialty physicians      currently exist in many rural areas yet unwarranted      geographic payment disparities make it difficult to improve      access for rural Medicare beneficiaries and other patient      populations.       The existing inaccurate geographic adjustments by CMS      result in unwarranted and unduly low rural reimbursement      rates. More current, relevant, and accurate data sources      exist and should be used by CMS to make geographic      adjustments to Medicare payments, especially in the area of      physician practice expense. The current geographic      disparities in payment are not based on actual or reliable      data, and they put rural Medicare beneficiaries at risk. I      urge the committee to recommend that CMS use actual practice      cost data rather than the current inaccurate proxies to      ensure that Medicare payment reflects true geographic      differences in physician practice costs.                          ____________________
