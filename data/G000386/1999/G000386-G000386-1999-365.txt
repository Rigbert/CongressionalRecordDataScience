 President, I rise today to acknowledge the unfortunate expiration of the section 45 tax credit on June 30 for electricity produced from alternative energy sources. In response, I am introducing legislation to extend and expand the credit to help sustain the public benefits derived from these sources. As many of my colleagues know, I authored the section 45 credit in the Senate and it was included in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. I am being joined in this bipartisan effort today by Senator Murkowski and Senator Harkin.  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 414 to extend the wind energy portion of section 45, which has been extremely successful. The purpose of today's bill is to extend and expand the biomass portion of section 45 to include technologies such as biomass combustion and cofiring biomass with coal-fired facilities. Formerly, section 45 only allowed the use of closed-loop biomass, which has proven to be unworkable. Consequently, the biomass aspect of section 45 has never been utilized. The clean, controlled combustion of biomass, which in layman's terms consists of woodchips, agricultural byproducts, and untreated construction debris, is another proven, effective technology that currently generates numerous pollution avoidance and waste management public benefits across the nation.  Unfortunately, the 1992 bill restrictively defined qualifying biomass processes by requiring taxpayers to grow the biomass solely for the purposes of combustion. This then-untested theory has since proven to be singularly uneconomic, and taxpayers have never claimed one single cent of tax credits. My bill retains this dormant ``closed-loop'' biomass provision in the hopes that some day it may be found feasible.  In order to retain the environmental, waste management, and the rural employment benefits that we currently receive from the existing ``open-loop'' biomass facilities, by bill rewrites section 45 to allow tax credits for clean combustion of wood waste and similar residues in these unique facilities. These valuable, yet economically vulnerable, facilities that convert 20 million tons of waste into clean electricity annually, and which have never received section 45 tax credits, would be eligible for the same ten years of tax credits per facility, beginning at date of enactment.  Importantly, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the definition of qualifying biomass materials is limited to organic, nonhazardous materials that are clearly proven to burn cleanly without any pollution risk. Also, to allay any concern that biomass plants might burn paper and thus possibly jeopardize the amount of paper that is available to be recycled, I have specifically excluded paper that is commonly recycled from the list of materials that would qualify for the credit.  One promising technology that does not yet operate here in the U.S., but has now been proven to be feasible and practical, involves the cofiring of biomass with coal. A partial tax credit for cofiring would stimulate economic growth in rural areas by creating new markets for forage crops. The environmental benefits from reduced coal plant emissions would also be substantial.  Finally, my bill acknowledges the potential that biomass combustion has to solve the nation's pressing poultry waste problem by making electricity produced from the combustion of poultry litter eligible for the sec. 45 tax credit. As Chairman Roth has recently pointed out, the increased growth of our domestic chicken and turkey industry has created the need to find a new, creative means for disposing of the waste of some 600 million chickens in the Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia peninsula alone.  Today, much of the waste from these operations (deposited upon biomass materials) is spread on farmland, resulting in a nutrient runoff that has contaminated streams, rivers and bays, with devastating effect on the local environment. Fortunately, scientists in the United Kingdom have developed a combustion technology that cleanly disposes of the waste and produces clean electricity. While no such plants are currently operating in the U.S., state and local authorities in the affected jurisdictions assure us that, with the enactment of this critical tax credit legislation, action would be taken to build these plants immediately.  With regard to wind energy, and my involvement in supporting this technology which goes back to my authorship of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1992, I am proud to say that this credit is one of the success stories of section 45. The public policy benefits of wind energy are indisputable: it is clean, safe and abundant within the United States. I understand that every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy produced in the U.S. can reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons by replacing the combustion of fossil fuels.  Mr. President, I believe this bill provides a common sense combination of current and new technologies to help maintain the economic, environmental and waste management benefits derived from wind and biomass power. This bill has strong support from both the biomass industry and environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1351       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,      SECTION 1.
