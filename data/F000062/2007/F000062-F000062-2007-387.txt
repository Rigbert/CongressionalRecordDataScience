 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that ensures our Nation's homeland security grant resources are allocated in the most effective manner possible. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Texas, Senator John Cornyn, as well as Senators Boxer, Hutchison, Lautenberg, Schumer, Clinton, Menendez, and Obama.  Simply put, the current system for allocating homeland security grants to States is fundamentally flawed. Proportionate funding is not allotted to regions which face the highest risk of a terrorist attack, and adequate assessment of threats is not calculated.
