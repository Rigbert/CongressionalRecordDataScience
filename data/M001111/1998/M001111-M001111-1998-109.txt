 President, I rise today to speak about S. 1186--the Workforce Investment Partnership Act and to applaud the Labor and Human Resources Committee for the bipartisan manner in which the legislation was developed.  In the last Congress the opportunity for reform of employment and training programs was lost due to partisan bickering and the insistence on a reform structure which I believe jeopardized the investment in skills training--and in particular the investment in the retraining of dislocated workers.  This bill builds on the success of the dislocated worker program and adds other elements which will improve the program.
