President, I take this opportunity to honor those who have enriched the lives of men and women with disabilities. Each year the Illinois chapter of the American Association on Mental Retardation recognizes the work of Illinoisans who have dedicated and committed their lives to helping people with disabilities.  These award winners live in Illinois and play an important role in the lives of Illinoisans with disabilities. A 1999 Direct Service Award winner is someone who devotes more than 50 percent of their time working hands-on with their client. These award winners work directly with their clients with commitment, sensitivity, professionalism, and patience. These qualities set them apart and increase their value to their patients.  It is important we recognize these individuals who go beyond the call of duty to improve the lives of others. We should note that these individuals do not only enrich the lives of those for whom they care, but enrich our lives as well. They represent the true spirit of community service.  It is my honor and privilege to recognize the achievements of the following distinguished Illinois direct service professionals: Linda Barnes, Karen Catt, Candace Fulgham, Ross Griswold, Delores Hardin, Cathey Hardy, Raterta Kalish, Eldora Madison, Anita Martin, Vickie Mckenny, Ida Mitchell, Michael Peters, Noreen Przislicki, Douglas S. Revolinski, Angelo Reyes, Karie Rosenown, Laureen Saathoff, Ruby Sandefur, Emma Smith, and Kathie Tillman. It is a privilege to represent these award winners in the United States Senate.  Again, I applaud them for their lifetime effort and their dedication to better the lives of others who are less fortunate. These distinguished men and women are heroes in their field, and I am proud to recognize their work.                          ____________________
