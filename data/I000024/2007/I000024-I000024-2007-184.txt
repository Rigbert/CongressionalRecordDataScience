President, I rise today to introduce a resolution honoring the efforts and contributions of the members of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives Program under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the U.S. Armed Forces during and following World War II. This group, known as the ``Monuments Men,'' was responsible for the preservation, protection, and restitution of priceless artistic, and cultural treasures in countries occupied by the Allied armies.  In 1938, the Nazi party in Germany began a wide-scale confiscation of millions of pieces of artwork and other cultural artifacts throughout continental Europe, including masterpieces by Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Rembrandt. Much of the art was confiscated from Nazi-conquered Europe, as well as from Jewish private collectors who were forced to relinquish their property rights.  In 1944, with the Allied armies rolling across Europe, the Monuments Men began their work. They were given thecharge of protecting the cultural treasures of Europe, which proved to be a daunting task, given that they, at times, had to protect these treasures from friend as well as foe. Their first task was to prevent Allied forces in the field from damaging national monuments and from damaging or looting public or private collections. In the spring of 1945, the Monuments Men began discovering large caches of Nazi-confiscated artwork and artifacts. They began the arduous process of cataloging and repatriating the artwork and artifacts to their rightful owners.  I would like to take this moment to recognize the efforts of a couple of my fellow Oklahomans who served as Monuments Men. CPT Walter Johan Huchthausen served as a Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives officer with the U.S. 9th Army in Europe. Captain Huchthausen was born in Perry, OK on December 19, 1904. He earned a master of architecture degree from Harvard University in 1930 and went on to become the director of the Department of Design at the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts before joining the faculty at the University of Minnesota. Captain Huchthausen enlisted in 1942. He served as a Monuments Man in France and Germany before he was tragically killed by gunfire in April of 1945 while working to salvage an altarpiece in a German town.  Technical SGT Horace V. Apgar of Oklahoma City was transferred to the Monuments Men in Frankfurt in 1945, where he was involved in the retrieval and restitution of Jewish property. He was then assigned to the Rothschild home in Paris, which was being used as a depository for recovered Jewish artifacts stolen from synagogues and temples. Mr. Apgar returned home after the war and sought a career in music. He graduated from the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in 1949 served as a bass teacher at the University of Oklahoma from 1951 to 1955. He went on to a 56-year career with the Oklahoma City Philharmonic Orchestra.  It is in large part due to the tireless efforts of Captain Huchthausen, Sergeant Apgar, and the many brave American men and women who served as Monuments Men that over 5 million works of art and other cultural treasures were protected and preserved following the collapse of the Nazi regime.                          ____________________
