Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I think that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) makes a good point relative to the reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses of parties, particularly those who may be indigent, and I think that we ought to look at this issue as time progresses, basically in seeing how far away criminal trials have to be moved away from New Orleans and the other places on the gulf coast where the courts are either impaired or not able to function in their chosen venues.  However, I would point out that the Office of General Counsel For the Administrative Office of the Courts advises that jurors may obtain reimbursement for mileage, subsistence, and lodging expenses under this bill just as they may under normal circumstances. Similarly, there is the payment of travel and subsistence expenses for witnesses who will be available during the emergency special sessions under the bill.  As far as the parties are concerned, particularly the indigent ones, I can give the gentleman from Michigan my assurance that we all will continue to work with the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the appropriators, and the Senate on this point. I think the thing that we have got to do now is to get this bill enacted into law as quickly as possible so that the courts can be up and running to do their business even though their current facilities may still be under water.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
