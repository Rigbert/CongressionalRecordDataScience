Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Battle Creek Nature Education Society. The Battle Creek Nature Education Society received a 2003 Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network Grant for a project designed to enhance the Flag Ponds Nature Park and King's Landing Park in Calvert County, Maryland.  The Chesapeake Bay Gateways Network, which includes more than 120 museums, state parks, wildlife refugees and other sites in five states and the District of Columbia, was created to enhance the experience of visitors to the Chesapeake Bay and its many roads, rivers and trails. Authorized by the Chesapeake Bay Initiative Act of 1998, the Gateway Network is coordinated by the National Park Service in partnership with the Chesapeake Bay Program.  During the past four years, Gateways Network Grants have funded new maps, improved signs, and expanded trails that have made visits to parks, wildlife refuges and water trails even more exciting and enjoyable than they had previously been. These grants help enhance the public's ability to learn and enjoy the Chesapeake's stories and significance, explore its natural and cultural resources, and become involved in helping conserve and restore the Bay and its watershed. Through these projects and other Gateways Network efforts more and more people recognize the Chesapeake as a true national treasure.  In 2003, the National Park Service is awarding $1,387,309 in grant funding, matched by over $2 million in partner contributions. Thirty-two grants are being made to Gateways throughout the Bay watershed in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Battle Creek Nature Education Society is receiving a grant of $32,050 and $62,762 in partner contributions.  The project proposed by the Battle Creek Nature Education Society will create an overall plan for guiding interpretation at Flag Ponds Nature Park and King's Landing Park, as well as an extensive series of outdoor exhibits at each park. Up to twenty way-side panels will be developed to help visitors enjoy and learn about these two sites and their relationship to the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A short sampling of anticipated stories to be told includes: the geology behind the ever-changing sand bars that shape habitats at Flag Ponds; early 20th century uses of the area; and the importance of the swamps and freshwater pond habitats that have been naturally formed over hundreds of years.  Mr. Speaker, it is with the assistance and vision of organizations such as the Battle Creek Nature Education Society that the Chesapeake Bay and the entire region has become the treasure that we know it to be today. Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Battle Creek Nature Education Society on receiving this grant and wishing them the best of luck in completing their project.                          ____________________
