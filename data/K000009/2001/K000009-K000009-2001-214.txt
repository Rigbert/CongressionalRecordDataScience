Speaker, each year Crestwood Elementary School in Swanton, Ohio spends Veterans' Day honoring local veterans. It is an insightful and moving day-long series of events in which both the children and adults fully participate. The 2001 observance featured two essays describing ``What Makes America Great'' which I would like to enter into the Record. The first is by 6th grader Stephen Johnson and the second by 6th grader Dennis Parker.       Three things that make America great are: freedom, the land      and its climate, and the people.       First of all freedom makes America great because we can      choose our government. For example we can elect candidates      for president, vice president, mayor, trustee, secretary, and      various other offices within our country's governmental      system. We have the freedom to go where we want, and how      we're going to get there. We also have freedom to buy, and      drive what we want. For example, we can buy airplane tickets,      cars, houses, and many other things. We are even allowed to      choose what we want to do with our lives. For example we      could be a doctor, nurse, dentist, president, vice president,      and many different jobs within our country.       Secondly America's land and its climate make America an      abundant and bountiful country to live in. The land provides      us with minerals, food, water, shelter, wildlife, and the      clothes such as cotton. The climate provides this country      with sunshine, darkness, warmth, coldness,, and the four      seasons. The climate has caused America to form oceans,      mountains, valleys, plateaus. and hills. The natural      resources give us wood for pencils, lumber, paper, and fire,      oil for cars and other automobiles, water for drinking, and      land for farming.       Thirdly the people make America great because history and      events are based on people. The people are faithful, and      loyal to their country. There are many different kinds of      people living in America. The history, and events are based      on people because there was the Boston Tea Party, World War      I, World War II, and there was the tragedy that happened just      recently. The people are faithful, and loyal to their country      by recycling, burning waste, not polluting the air, and many      other things to help our environment. There are many      different kinds of people living in America because in      America you are free to pick your job, your house, and many      other things that make America a great place to live in.  Here is the second essay:       If you want to know what makes America great, then take a      look around you. I think people took America for granted      until the terrorists' acts on September 11, 2001. In a      heartbeat, innocent lives were destroyed.       Instead of television heroes like Batman and Superman, they      became firefighters, policemen, and just ordinary people like      moms and dads, every day Americans just like you and me.       Our country's freedom was taken for granted by Americans      that was won by our veterans and forefathers. We fought in      wars to end injustices, communism, and nationalism. Now, we      are trying to stop terrorists, and our country is united even      more.       People show their love and patriotism for our country by      flying flags, giving blood, money and food to people in need.      They don't care about how much money we have or our skin      color. They just want to help out. That is why America is the      best country in the world.       If you want to know what freedom is, then look around you.      We have freedom of speech, religion, and education. We can go      to school, speak, and pray without being punished. We aren't      told what job to have, where to live, and what to do. We have      many laws, but they are not to punish us, they are to protect      us.       America is great because we can vote for whomever we want      in a secret ballot. We are allowed to choose our president,      governor, or mayor without being punished.       So basically, America is cared for and so are its people.      They want to help America and make it even more united. Our      veterans played a very important part in American history      because they helped us gain freedom.       So remember every time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, or      sing the national anthem, be proud, and think of our real      heroes. We are united because we are free and we are free      because we are United. God Bless America!                               ____________________
