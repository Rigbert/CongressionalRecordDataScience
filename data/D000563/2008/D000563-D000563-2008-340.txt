I hope the Republicans will join us and do two things: Let us agree to move forward, let us approve LIHEAP so we can get peace of mind to families concerned about heating and air conditioning bill. Let us also move forward on speculation. We should offer our alternative, Republicans should offer theirs, and then each offer an energy bill, give us their best ideas on the Republican side and the best ideas on the Democratic side. Let's vote on them. Maybe we can merge some of them. That would be a constructive debate America would like to see.  I yield the floor.
