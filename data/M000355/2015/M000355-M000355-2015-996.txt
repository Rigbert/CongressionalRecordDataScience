 President, let me just say to all Senators that we are making progress on the highway bill, and we are setting the vote for next Tuesday to allow the bipartisan supporters of a longer term bill a couple of days to complete the draft substitute.  Chairman Inhofe, Senator Boxer, and a bipartisan group of Senators are working out the final language. I want to thank them for their efforts, and I hope we will find a way to go forward on a multiyear, paid-for highway bill.                          ____________________
