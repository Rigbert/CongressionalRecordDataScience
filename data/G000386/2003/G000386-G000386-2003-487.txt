 President, 1 minute does not give justice to saying what is wrong with this amendment, so I will just give two or three points.  First, in regard to the marriage penalty relief, it provides for acceleration of the standard deduction of married couples but doesn't do anything regarding the expansion of the 15-percent individual income tax bracket. And that is a major part of marriage penalty relief. It doesn't help hard-working, middle-class families the way it should.  Second, in regard to the child tax credit, this proposal only increases the child tax credit to $700 in 2003 and $800 in 2004.
