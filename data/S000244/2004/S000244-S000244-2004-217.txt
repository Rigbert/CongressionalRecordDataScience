Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I think we should make it very clear that this bill is narrowly drawn. There is liability to the volunteer pilot for willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct or conscious flagrant indifference to the rights and safety of the individual that is harmed by the volunteer. Anything that rises above ordinary negligence, there is no immunity involved.  I guess I would be remiss if I did not express my concern that there have been allegations that passing this bill will increase the risk of terrorism. The volunteer pilots who fly these important missions are carefully screened professionals. They undergo background checks that are above and beyond those that are required for licensure as a pilot, and many of the pilots who do volunteer their services are commercial pilots when they are being paid. I think that the checks that a terrorist could slip through are so severe that the chances of that happening really do not exist at all.  I take great umbrage at the notion that the passage of this bill, which provides a limited immunity from liability, opens the door, even a crack, to increased risk of terrorism in the airways. I would hope that the House would reject this notion by passing this bill overwhelmingly.
