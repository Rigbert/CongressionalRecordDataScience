 President, I totally understand the concerns of the Senator from Maine. I just would like to request--we only have one Senator on our side at this time who wants to bring up an amendment, and there are no Republicans here at this time. He is the only one I am aware of right now who is here in the Chamber ready to go. If it would not be objectionable, if it would be all right that he could just offer his amendment, he just wants to call it up.
