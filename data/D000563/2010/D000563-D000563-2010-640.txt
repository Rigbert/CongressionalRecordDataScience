MENENDEZ. For all of these reasons, I am in strong opposition to these amendments. I certainly urge their defeat. We are going to send billions more after billions that have already been sent to accomplish the same negative result, and your own words speak to the very essence of how we get to a solution, which is to pursue a comprehensive nature to this reality.  If you want to ensure a continuing set of circumstances in which law enforcement turns U.S. citizens into second-class citizens, then vote for the amendments. But otherwise, you should oppose them.  I will be happy to yield.
