Mr. Chairman, I rise in enthusiastic support of this bill, and I want to compliment the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) for having done an outstanding job in working with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), the ranking member, and the staff of the subcommittee, because they have taken a bill that has the potential for real controversy and made it a very good bipartisan bill.  That is not to say that there are not some differences, because there are some differences. That is always the case when we bring a bill to the floor. But these men have done a really good job.  I also want to compliment the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the Subcommittee, for the tremendous relationship that he has established with the authorizing committee, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, chaired by our friend and colleague, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young). Theyhad some problems that had to be worked out, and they were able to do that, mostly to the satisfaction of both of them. I believe this is a good example of how legislation can be drafted to get to a good bill that can be accepted by most everybody in this Chamber.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the bill, to thank the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), and to thank the chairman of the authorizing committee, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for the good work he has done in helping us to resolve some of these differences.  It is a good bill. Let us vote for it.
