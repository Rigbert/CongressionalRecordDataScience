Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 676) recognizing and honoring the 40th anniversary of congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 676       Whereas 2004 marks the 40th anniversary of congressional      passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352);       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the result of      decades of struggle and sacrifice of many Americans who      fought for equality and justice;       Whereas generations of Americans of every background      supported Federal legislation to eliminate discrimination      against African Americans;       Whereas a civil rights movement developed to achieve the      goal of equal rights for all Americans;       Whereas President John F. Kennedy on June 11, 1963, in a      nationally televised address proposed that Congress pass a      civil rights act to address the problem of invidious      discrimination;       Whereas a broad coalition of civil rights, labor, and      religious organizations, culminating in the 1963 march on      Washington, created national support for civil rights      legislation;       Whereas during consideration of the bill a historic      prohibition against discrimination based on sex was added;       Whereas the Congress of the United States passed the Civil      Rights Act of 1964, and President Lyndon Johnson signed the      bill into law on July 2, 1964;       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964, among other things,      prohibited the use of Federal funds in a discriminatory      fashion, barred unequal application of voter registration      requirements, encouraged the desegregation of public schools      and authorized the United States Attorney General to file      suits to force desegregation, banned discrimination in      hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other places      of public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce, and      established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;       Whereas title VII of the Act not only prohibited      discrimination by employers on the basis of race, color,      national origin, and religion but sex as well, thereby      recognizing the national problem of sex discrimination in the      workplace;       Whereas the Congress of the United States has amended the      Civil Rights Act of 1964 from time to time, with major      changes that strengthened the Act;       Whereas the 1972 amendments, among other things, gave the      Equal Employment Opportunity Commission litigation authority,      thereby giving the EEOC the right to sue nongovernment      respondents, made State and local governments subject to      title VII of the Act, made educational institutions subject      to title VII of the Act, and made the Federal Government      subject to title VII, thereby prohibiting Federal executive      agencies from discriminating on the basis of race, color,      sex, religion, and national origin;       Whereas the 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act      overruled several Supreme Court decisions rendered in the      late 1980s and allowed for the recovery of fees and costs in      lawsuits where plaintiff prevailed, for jury trials, and for      the recovery of compensatory     and punitive damages in intentional employment discrimination      cases, and also expanded title VII protections to include      congressional and high level political appointees;       Whereas the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is the most      comprehensive civil rights legislation in our Nation's      history; and       Whereas we applaud all those whose support and efforts lead      to passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) recognizes and honors the 40th anniversary of      congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and       (2) encourages all Americans to recognize and celebrate the      important historical milestone of the congressional passage      of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
