 President, I hate to see the Boxer-Inhofe team come to an end. We have had some great bipartisan accomplishments--this bill we are about to pass and the highway bill last year, which was something I think all of us and the three of us were very proud of.  I want to say to my colleague from California, as we have discussed on numerous occasions, there are not a whole lot of things we agree on, but when we do, we have a lot of fun working together. We are going to miss that opportunity next Congress.
