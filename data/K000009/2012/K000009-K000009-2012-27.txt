Rule by the few plutocrats truly threatens our Republic and greatly harms representative government.  Here is a great cartoon. It was in the Toledo Blade by Paul Kirk. It shows how the super PACs really have a stranglehold on the politics of this country.  With the Citizens United ruling by the Supreme Court, they threw away decades of legal precedent governing campaign contributions. The result has been a growing stranglehold by the money barons on good government and our political process. The American people know it, and they know we're not doing anything about it.  At a minimum, we should demand greater transparency of who is actually giving this money. No more hidden donors. I urge my colleagues to sign discharge petition 4010, which is here on the floor today, to move a bill for disclosure to the floor. What we really should do is pass a constitutional amendment to allow for campaign spending and contribution limits. I had that bill; and I've had that bill Congress, after Congress, after Congress. It's House Resolution 8. I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors.  Let's do what Canada and Britain have done, and that's to rein in the control of the many by the few money barons.                          ____________________
