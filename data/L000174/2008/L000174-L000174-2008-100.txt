President, I do not believe that the provisions of title VII of the Advancing America's Priorities Act, S. 3297, constitute a ``congressionally directed spending item,'' as defined by Public Law 110-81, but out of an abundance of caution I certify that neither I nor my immediate family has a pecuniary interest in the provisions of title VII of S. 3297, consistent with the requirements of paragraph 9 of Rule XLIV of the Standing Rules of the Senate.
