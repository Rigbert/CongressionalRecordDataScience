 President, back in July and August, the Senate spent a lot of time talking about the safety of Mexican trucks.  Originally, the White House wanted to allow Mexican trucks to travel throughout the United States without sufficient safety checks.  That raised real safety concerns for everyone from the Advocates for Highway & Auto Safety to the AAA of Texas.  The House of Representatives, meanwhile, voted to prevent any Mexican trucks from traveling beyond a limited area near the border.  I have always believed that we could ensure our safety and promote commerce at the same time.  So Senator Shelby and I--working with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle--created a commonsense safety plan.  The Senate turned back several amendments--and voted twice with strong bipartisan super-majorities--to invoke cloture both on the committee substitute and the bill itself.  This summer, there were several attempts to weaken the safety provisions, but the Senate consistently rejected them.  And I am proud to say that the final conference agreement strictly adheres to the outlines of the Senate bill.  This agreement prohibits the border from being opened to Mexican trucks until the DOT implements a number of important safety measures, and until the DOT's inspector general has concluded a thorough audit of the Department's efforts.  I would like to spend a moment comparing the conference agreement with the administration's original plan.  Let me start with compliance reviews, which are comprehensive inspections of a trucking firm's vehicles, its management systems, and all of its license, insurance, and maintenance records.  It looks at the trucking firm's operating and violation histories and yields a decision as to whether the firm should be allowed to continue operating in the U.S.  Under the administration's plans, there was never going to be a requirement that a Mexican trucking firm undergo a compliance review.  The conference agreement, however, includes a requirement that each and every Mexican trucking firm undergo a compliance review before being granted permanent operating authority. There are no exceptions.  Let's look at on-site inspections.  The administration never intended to require that inspections by U.S. truck safety inspectors take place on-site at a Mexican trucking firm's facilities.  The conference agreement, however, requires that U.S. truck safety inspectors must visit every Mexican trucking firm either when they conduct their initial safety examination or when they conduct a compliance review to determine whether the firm should be granted permanent operating authority in the U.S.  The only exception is granted to the smallest independent operators in Mexico. They will be required to have these same exams conducted at the border.  Even with this exception, it is likely that these smallest of firms will be visited on-site.  That's because the DOT will have to conduct on-site inspections of at least half of all firms and half of all the traffic volume coming into the U.S.  Originally, the administration did not intend to verify many licenses when Mexican truckers crossed the border.  The DOT told us that they would verify the licenses on a random basis--but deliberately avoided defining what was meant by the word ``random.''  That could mean verifying 1 out of every 100 licenses or 1 out of every 1,000 licenses.  Under the conference agreement, the DOT will be required to electronically verify at least one out of every two licenses.  And the actual ratio will be even higher.  That's because the conference agreement requires that border inspectors verify the license of every trucker carrying hazardous materials, and every trucker undergoing a Level I inspection, and then requires that inspectorsverify 50 percent of all other vehicles crossing the border.  On the issue of overweight trucks, the administration did not intend to implement any special effort to address overweight vehicles--even though Mexican weight limits far exceed those in the U.S.  The conference agreement, however, requires that--within 1 year of the date of enactment--each and every truck crossing the border at the ten busiest border crossings between the U.S. and Mexico will be weighed.  In fact, the conference agreement prohibits the border from being opened at all--until half of these border crossings have weigh-in-motion systems fully installed.  The administration did not intend to require that Mexican trucks cross the border only where DOT safety inspectors are on duty.  The conference agreement requires that the trucks cross where inspectors are on duty.  It also requires that they enter the U.S. at crossings where there is adequate capacity for the inspectors to conduct meaningful inspections and, if need be, place vehicles out-of-service for safety violations.  The DOT was planning to open the border whether or not a number of critical truck safety rulemakings had been finalized and published.  Some of these rulemakings have been delayed for years, but the DOT planned to open the border anyway.  The conference agreement, however, requires that the Secretary either implement policy directives or publish interim final rules that will immediately govern the behavior of trucking firms--before the border can be opened.  Now let's look at the hauling of hazardous materials across the border. The administration had not planned on implementing any unique requirements for hazardous materials trucks even though they represent a unique and dangerous threat on our highways.  The conference agreement, however, requires that even if other trucks have already been allowed to cross the border no hazardous material trucks will be allowed to enter the U.S. until the governments of the U.S. and Mexico enter into a separate agreement confirming that U.S. and Mexican drivers of these vehicles have been subjected to the same unique requirements.  Finally, concerning the oversight of the inspector general, the administration was planning to open the border without regard to the long list of safety deficiencies that had been cited by the DOT inspector general.  As far as the DOT was concerned, the inspector general could continue to publish as many critical audits as he wanted to--but they were going to open the border on January 1 without regard to whether any of the deficiencies had been addressed.  There wasn't even a process in place to require the Transportation Secretary to acknowledge the findings of the IG.  Under the conference agreement, no trucks may cross the border until the IG has completed another entire audit of the DOT's efforts.  And no trucks may cross the border until the Transportation Secretary has received the IG's findings and has certified in writing, in a manner addressing each of those findings, that the opening of the border does not present an unacceptable risk to our constituents.  So, the conference agreement includes a serious mechanism to hold the Transportation Secretary accountable for his decision to open the border.  And you can be sure that the Transportation Appropriations subcommittee will be holding a hearing with both the Transportation Secretary and the inspector general once the IG has made his findings and the Secretary is poised to issue his certification.  Some observers have suggested that the requirements of the conference agreement are not as restrictive as the measures that passed the Senate.  As I view it, the safety requirements are effectively the same.  The conference agreement gives the administration a degree of flexibility in implementing these safety requirements.  Others have said that the border is likely to open more quickly under the provisions of the conference agreement than under the Senate-passed bill.  That may be true. But I want to remind my colleagues that, it has never been our goal to keep the border closed.  I voted for NAFTA.  I represent a state that is highly-dependent on international trade.  And I believe in the economic benefits that come with lower trade barriers.  Throughout this entire process, my goal--and that of Senator Shelby--has been to ensure the safety of our highways.  And I am proud that this conference agreement makes great progress for our safety.  I am prepared to yield back all of our time on the bill if there is no one to speak.  I yield back the remainder of our time.                          ____________________
