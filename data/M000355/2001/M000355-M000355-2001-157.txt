 President, I missed the first part of the comment of the Senator from Arizona. I gather it was whether this amendment can be offered after 11 o'clock.  We have been on this bill 2 weeks. This was adopted the first day of the 2-week debate, and here we are at 2 minutes to 11 still trying to fix it. With all due respect to the Senator from Michigan, I am not going to agree to a modification of the consent agreement so it can be offered after 11 o'clock. I will be happy to work with him on whether it can be included as a technical amendment at the end on Monday. I am not going to agree to change the consent under which we are currently operating.
