Madam Chair, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger) for yielding.  Madam Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 3523. It is a step back.  Those of us who protested in the fifties and the sixties, who were called Communists, who had our telephone calls recorded, we have a long memory. We remember our Nation's dark past.  Martin Luther King, Jr.'s telephone was wiretapped. His hotel room was wiretapped. His home was wiretapped. Our office was wiretapped. Our meetings were wiretapped. And it was not just people spying on civil rights activists, but people protesting against the war in Vietnam.  We didn't have a Facebook, a Twitter, or email. These new tools must be protected. Today we have a mission, a mandate, and a moral obligation to protect future generations of activists and protestors.  So I say to my colleagues, stand with us today. Stand up and stand on the right side of history. Oppose H.R. 3523.
