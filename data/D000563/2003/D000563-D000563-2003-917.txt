 In the Bork situation, they said: We wish to cooperate to the fullest extent possible. We have decided to take the exceptional step of providing the committee with access to responsive materials we currently possess, except those privileged documents specifically described above.  The Department of Justice, in the Bork situation, said we are drawing a line but we are providing you with these internal memos and information. Now, if the same thing is to apply to Miguel Estrada, as I said, we can debate where the lines can be drawn, but Mr. Gonzales in the White House said, no, we will not consider producing anything.  It leads Members to conclude on this side of the aisle that there is something very damaging in these materials that they do not want disclosed. It is the only conclusion you can draw. The fact that Miguel Estrada volunteered the information, the fact that he is prepared to waive the privilege if it exists, is an indication he does not think the controversy is there, but this White House, tentative and concerned about whether or not Miguel Estrada has said some things that could jeopardize his nomination, refuses to disclose.  I yield to the Senator.
