Frankly, I believe the Secretary's initial proposal goes too far. It is overreaching.  But there are certain authorities that would be extremely helpful to the Secretary as he attempts to make sure we can reward civilian employees with higher pay and streamline the personnel process. We came up with a proposal. We are still assessing the import that the proposal might have. In addition, there may be some procedural barriers in our ability to bring forward the amendments. So we are continuing to work closely to see if we can come up with a consensus. I hope to have an answer shortly for the chairman.
