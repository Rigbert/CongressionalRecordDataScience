Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Whitfield-Strickland-Udall-Gibbons-Kanjorski sense of Congress resolution in the form of an amendment to cover workers from the Department of Energy and its contractors and vendors.  I would just say to my colleagues that as this legislation moves forward, there is one important category that is not covered and that is those workers, like those at Brush Wellman in Elmore, Ohio, who worked for the Department of Defense as contractors, vendors, subcontractors. I stand today in memory of Gaylen Lemke, a gentleman who died of chronic beryllium illness last year who first came to see me in 1994. It was an absolutely cruel illness. He was as much a veteran of this country as anyone who ever flewan airplane or served on a submarine. I would just hope that as these hearings are held that true compensation could be found for these individuals and their families who have suffered so greatly, actually through no one's fault but through our lack of knowledge about how these metals actually react with the human body.  When one's lungs turn to crystalline over a period of 10 to 15 years, it is among the cruelest of ways to die.  I just want to thank the Members of the Committee on Armed Services here today, my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Sisisky), for looking really seriously at this. I would say in my region of Ohio we have upwards of 200 people who have died or will die of this illness. Please do not forget those who have worked on contract to the Department of Defense, especially providing the material that was processed for the interiors of our missiles and our guided missile systems.
