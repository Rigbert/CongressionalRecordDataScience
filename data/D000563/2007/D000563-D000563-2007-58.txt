President, I will respond to the Senator from Texas, as he is deserving of a response.  Look what has just happened. Senator Reid of Nevada has asked for a registry for those in the United States afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease. He wants us to at least get the names and identities of people who are dying from this disease so that we can start to find treatments and cures.
