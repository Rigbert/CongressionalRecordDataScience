President, I applaud leaders on both sides of the aisle for the work that was being done around here this weekend. I saw the hard work of Senator Daschle, and Senator Dole, and of everybody else.  Let me just take a moment to applaud a lot of people whose names and faces do not get on the news, the men and women who keep the Congress running--many of whom were here not knowing whether they were going to be paid or not, who work extraordinary hours well past midnight night after night, whether they are the parliamentarians, the clerks, the security guards, the Capitol Police, the young pages, the men and women who come here to learn of the Government, whether they are from Vermont or any other State. The staff of Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike--those in the Cloakroom who, when many of us were able to go home at night, had to stay there for hours and hours after that time in case votes came up and we were called; and the same in the other body.  Those who keep doors open, those who make it possible for us to fulfill our constitutional responsibility to America to have this body--this body which should be the conscience of the Nation--open to the public; those who make sure that any member of the public who came here, even though Washington was shut down, could at least come and visit the Congress, and either be enlightened or enraged by the debate, depending upon how they might feel.                          ____________________
