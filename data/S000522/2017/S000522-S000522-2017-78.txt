Mr. Speaker, I rise to announce that my friend Anna Eshoo and I today introduced the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act of 2017 (H.R. 390).   H.R. 390 would require the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development to identify the urgent humanitarian needs of Christians and other genocide survivors from religious minority communities and to start supporting some of the entities effectively aiding them on-the-ground.   This bill is urgently needed because Christian survivors of the ISIS genocide are facing an emergency. Just before Christmas, I went to Erbil in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to meet with these survivors. They told me the United States had abandoned them. I saw first-hand how the Obama administration has failed to help them.   I was in Erbil at the personal invitation of the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Erbil, Bashar Warda. More than 70,000 Christians--10,500 families--who escaped from ISIS have relied on the Archdiocese of Erbil for food, shelter, and medical care to survive. Yet the Obama administration and United Nations have refused to give a single dollar to the Archdiocese to help them. They have been kept alive only because of the generosity of organizations like the Knights of Columbus and Aid to the Church in Need. However, the needs are so great that the Archdiocese is chronically in crisis mode, unsure whether it will soon run out of resources to sustain these Christians.   The winter temperatures are freezing and the risk of related illness is high. Iraq's Christian population is less than 250,000, down from up to 1.4 million in 2002, down from 500,000 in 2013 just before ISIS began targeting Christians for genocide.   Having fled ISIS, these Christians may have to flee their homelands. Perhaps they will take the little money they have left, and pay smugglers to get them to Europe. They would risk becoming prisoners of human traffickers or perishing in the Mediterranean Sea, where more than 5,000 refugees and migrants died or went missing in 2016.   For a few of these genocide survivors unable to return home, the only long-term option may be resettlement in a country like the United States as a refugee. Our legislation would create a Priority Two designation that they are of ``special humanitarian concern'' to the United States. The P-2 designation would ensure that they are able to get an overseas interview with the U.S. government to be considered for the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program without needing a referral from the United Nations, an NGO, or another U.S. government entity. This would not guarantee acceptance and admission and they would have to clear the same security screening as every other Iraqi and Syrian refugee before being admitted. But at least they will be considered.  The other key element of our bill focuses on accountability. It would require the U.S. government to identify and support some entities that are conducting criminal investigations, and collecting evidence, on perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Iraq and Syria. This evidence is usable in future criminal trials. Until now, the State Department has been considering these crimes merely as human rights violations, rather than as crimes.  Archbishop Warda has put it clearly. ``These coming months may well decide the fate of Christianity in Iraq: whether it survives and is given a chance for rebirth; or whether it perishes, existing only as a few scattered museum pieces with caretaker clergy, of interest to tourists and academics perhaps, but without the Christian people who had lived there for two-thousand years.''  As the Syriac Archbishop of Mosul, who had to seek refuge in Erbil from ISIS together with his people, told me during my mission, ``We pray that President Trump will help us. We are the last people to speak the Aramaic language. Without help, we are finished.''  Archbishop Nicodemus had reason to be hopeful. On September 9, 2016, at the Voter Values Summit, then-candidate Trump said, ``ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the Nation of the Cross. ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East. We cannot let this evil continue.''  If our legislation moves quickly onto the floor for a vote and to President Trump for his signature, I am confident that he will sign it and ensure that it is fully implemented. The Christians of the Middle East are counting on us.  Many groups support H.R. 390, including the Knights of Columbus, Family Research Council, In Defense of Christians, 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative, Commission for International Justice and Accountability, HIAS, Aid the Church in Need USA, Open Doors, A Demand for Action, Yezidi Human Rights Organization International, Religious Freedom Institute, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, and Syrian Accountability Project, and Civitas Maxima.  It is also supported by all the former U.S. Ambassadors-at Large for War Crimes, David Scheffer (1997 through 2001), Pierre Prosper (2001 through 2005), Clint Williamson (2006 through 2009), and Stephen Rapp (2009 through 2015), as well as the Founding Chief Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, David Crane, the Director of the Center for Religious Freedom Nina Shea, and the author of Defying ISIS, Rev. Johnnie Moore.  Fifteen of our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, are original cosponsors of H.R. 390. I call on my other colleagues to cosponsor this bill and help ensure that it gets to the new President as soon as possible so that Christian genocide survivors in Iraq and elsewhere get the help they so desperately need.                          ____________________
