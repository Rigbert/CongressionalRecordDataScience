  So this is really an amendment that is quite simple. The principle of the underlying bill, which I, as the Senator from Utah, do not support, is that Federal elections should be conducted in Federal money, hard dollars. And in pursuit of that principle, McCain-Feingold requires the national political parties to operate in 100 percent Federal dollars, so-called hard dollars--100 percent.  And in even numbered years, it essentially requires all the State and local parties in our country to operate, similarly, in Federal hard dollars.  So in the name of fairness, we ask the question, Why should labor and business be allowed to, in effect, subsidize their hard dollar activities, which are their political action committees--100 percent dollars--and why should they be allowed to subsidize the raising of their hard dollars when America's political parties can't do it, and when America's State and local parties can't do it in even numbered years? Where is the fairness?  If the idea is that Federal elections should be conducted in Federal dollars, why is that principle only going to be applied to the Nation's political parties?  The Bennett amendment is quite simple. It is easily understood. For those who believe soft money is a pernicious thing undermining our democracy, then why should they think it would only be pernicious when raised and spent by political parties but perfectly OK when raised and spent by labor and business?  That is the heart of this amendment. That is what this vote will be all about. We will have that vote at 4 o'clock. I think that pretty well adequately describes our side of this amendment.  I will be happy now to yield the floor at this time.
