President, I again rise to urge my colleagues, particularly from the other side, to join us in passing an extension of unemployment insurance, to stop blocking a program that is so necessary to every person in this country, not just those who are losing jobs but those who are fearful their jobs might be taken away.  This is a national issue, an emergency. It requires attention and action now, not weeks from now. For the last several weeks, we have been trying to get an agreement to proceed. Last week, Leader Reid justifiably filed the first of what could be three cloture motions that some on the other side would insist we must proceed through until we can enact this important effort and benefit for 15.1 million unemployed Americans.  Everyone in Congress, regardless of party affiliation, is concerned about jobs.
