 President, I understand the other side yielded this time. Let me simply respond by saying we are talking about a supplemental bill that talks about the cost of the war. Part of the cost of war is caring for the men and women when they return home. As President Lincoln said:       We all have an obligation to care for him who shall have      borne the battle and for his widow and for his orphan.  That is what this vote is about, whether we carry forward our obligations to care for those we sent to war.  I ask my colleagues to vote with us to override this motion that says this is not an emergency so our veterans can receive the care they deserve.  I yield the floor.
