Chairman, I want to thank both the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Canady] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank]. I have to say, I recall my testimony before the subcommittee chaired by the gentleman from Massachusetts, and I was always welcomed. Some of the thinking that we refined in those years has helped us move to this point.  I thank the gentleman for working with us and being so open to us, and I thank the gentleman from Florida for offering to hold hearings on this matter and bringing in other Members who may have related measures.  Mr. Chairman, I think as the audience and American people are listening to us tonight, this is on the minds of a lot of the public. They have questioned why we as a Congress cannot move a measure through here. I think with the strong leadership of the gentleman from Florida and the support of the gentleman from Massachusetts and other Members in this institution, we can really do something and give the 21st century the kind of service here in Washington that our people deserve.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment at this point, and ask that we be one of the first witnesses that the gentleman welcomes to his committee when he holds that set of hearings.
