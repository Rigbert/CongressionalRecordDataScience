 President, I wish today to pay tribute to Henry Couzens, a genuine World War II hero and survivor. Mr. Couzens performed extraordinary acts of courage during some of world history's most difficult and tumultuous times.  The day after his 18th birthday in 1942, Mr. Couzens applied for the Aviation Cadets, and after passing all requirements was accepted into the Air Corp Training School. A year later, Mr. Couzens graduated as a pilot and was commissioned as a second lieutenant to fly P-47 fighter planes. In early 1944, Mr. Couzens arrived in England to fight on the front lines in the European Theatre alongside the 8th Infantry and 356th Fighter Group. His unit's assignment was to control an area along the English Channel. Their purpose was to escort and protect B-17s and B-24s on bombing missions to Germany and other occupied countries.  On April 23, 1944, Mr. Couzens was assigned to destroy German airplanes on the ground. His target that day was the airfield at Haguenau, France. On his third pass over the airfield, he was hit by German anti-aircraft fire. The hit was so substantial it stopped the engine of his plane, forcing him to ``Belly in.'' While he was fortunate enough to land alive, the group commander and another pilot were shot down. For a little over a year, Mr. Couzens was a prisoner of the Germans at the famous Stalag Luft III Camp. He endured one of the coldest winters in decades and finally saw freedom when they were liberated on April 29, 1945, and became part of General Patton's Third Army.  Thank you, Mr. Couzens for defending freedom and democracy. The heroics you and your comrades displayed will forever be remembered; you truly are the Greatest Generation.                          ____________________
