Speaker, I too rise regarding a provision contained in this legislation to carry out the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program at the U.S. Department of Energy.  I would like to thank Congresswoman Schmidt for raising a concern regarding the potential of the language implementing the Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program having a negative impact on a project already well along in its development. I would be pleased to work with Representative Schmidt and her colleagues in the Ohio delegation to address any unintended consequences.
