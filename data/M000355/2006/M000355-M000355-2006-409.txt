 President, I agree very much, and I am glad that we can put this issue to bed.  By anchoring section 5 in the concept of ``preferred candidates of choice''--another term of art whose meaning iscemented in the Supreme Court's precedents--I think this bill eliminates any risk that section 5 of the Voting Rights Act will be interpreted to protect coalitions and influence districts and other tools of purely partisan gerrymanders.
