Mr. Speaker, like so many of my colleagues, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 4286, to award a Congressional Gold Medal to that heroine of the Burmese people and the world, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  It is fitting for Ms. Suu Kyi to receive this, the highest and most distinguished civilian award we have to offer. She is a courageous leader, a former Nobel Peace Prize recipient who has spent 12 of the past 18 years behind bars. For what? For daring to advocate for a peaceful, democratic system for Burma, instead of violent, military rule.  The military refuses to recognize the will of the Burmese people--made exceedingly clear in past elections, and most recently in the demonstrations we all saw this Fall. The people plead for human rights and an end to the junta's power. Instead, these thugs have cracked down even harder with their customary persecution and bloodshed.  The Congressional Medal of Honor was originally awarded to military leaders for achievement in battle. Ms. Suu Kyi and the Burmese people are currently waging their own battle--a peaceful one--based on democratic ideals that all Americans share with them. Let's honor Ms. Suu Kyi for this peaceful struggle, and send a message to her brutal captors and to the world, that we stand with her and her people.                          ____________________
