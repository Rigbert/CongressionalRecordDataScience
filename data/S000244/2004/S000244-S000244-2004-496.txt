Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, on January 7, 18-year-old Ashley Lyons and her unborn son, Landon, were murdered in Scott County, Kentucky. Current Kentucky law regards this crime as having only a single victim. But Carol Lyons, Ashley's mother and Landon's grandmother, said, ``Nobody can tell me that there were not two victims. I placed Landon in his mother's arms, wrapped in a baby blanket that I had sewn for him, just before I kissed my daughter good-bye for the last time and closed the casket.'' We are here today to tell Carol Lyons she is right. There were two victims that day.  The Kentucky legislature has recently acted to recognize Landon as a victim under Kentucky law, and Kentucky's Governor is going to sign that legislation. But today, Congress has yet to pass legislation recognizing unborn victims of violence under Federal law. The House has done so twice by large margins, but the Senate has failed to act.  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act provides that if an unborn child is injured or killed during the commission of crimes of violence already defined under Federal law, prosecutors can bring two charges, one on behalf of the mother and the second on behalf of the unborn victim. Indeed, the House of Representatives in the 106th Congress, by a unanimous 417 to nothing vote, passed the Innocent Child Protection Act, a bill only two sentences long, that banned the Federal execution of a woman while she carries a ``child in utero.'' ``Child in utero'' is defined in that bill exactly, to the word, as it is in this bill, namely, as ``a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.''  Now, opponents of H.R. 1997 will argue that harm to an unborn victim should simply be considered an additional harm to the mother, not an independent harm to another human being. Yet, a vote for the Innocent Child Protection Act two Congresses ago cannot be defended on the grounds that executing a pregnant woman would cause her to suffer additional harm because there can be no additional harm exceeding the ultimate and final punishment of death. Since the only logical rationale for the support of the Innocent Child Protection Act was to prevent the killing of an innocent unborn child, H.R. 1997, which also recognizes unborn victims, should have similarly overwhelming bipartisan support. We shall see.  The legislation before us now requires us to reflect on the goals and purposes of the criminal law. Ultimately, the criminal law is not a schedule of punishments. It is an expression of society's values. It is an expression of society's values. Anything less than the legislation before us today simply does not resonate with society's sense of justice. The tragic murders of Laci and Conner Peterson in California have drawn national attention to unborn victims and the American people have overwhelmingly responded with more than 80 percent support for bringing two separate charges against their murderer.  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act protects the right of a mother to choose to bring her wanted and loved child to term, safe from the violent hands of criminals who would brutally deny her that right. This bill, however, has nothing to do with abortion. Let me repeat that. The bill has nothing to do with abortion. That fact could not be expressed more clearly in the legislation which explicitly excludes abortion-related conduct. Further, the Supreme Court, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, has already refused to strike down Missouri's unborn victims of violence law, stating that it ``does not by its terms regulate abortion.'' Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1997, just like the Missouri law that the Supreme Court refused to strike down, does not by its terms regulate abortion and, indeed, H.R. 1997 includes provisions that specifically exclude abortion-related conduct.  Both before and since the Webster decision, every single unborn victims law passed by State legislatures that has been challenged in court has been upheld. Anyone who claims this bill has anything to do with abortion and opposes it on those grounds is inviting this body to focus not on unborn child victims, but on red herrings.  Tracy Marciniak, whose unborn child was murdered by her husband, has told Congress, ``Please don't tell me that my son was not a murder victim.'' The Unborn Victims of Violence Act, I hope, will pass this body overwhelmingly today if only each Member opens their eyes to the photo of the dead body of Tracy Marciniak's murdered child and opens their hearts to the mothers who have implored Congress to give their unborn babies the status they deserve under the criminal law. I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting this legislation before the House today.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I will include for the Record two letters that the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter), chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, and I have exchanged regarding the two committees' jurisdictional claims on this legislation.                                      Committee on Armed Services,                                     House of Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2004.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, House Judiciary Committee, Rayburn HOB, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: I am writing to you concerning      the jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Armed      Services in matters being considered in H.R. 1997, the Unborn      Victims of Violence Act of 2003.       I recognize the importance of H.R. 1997 and the need for      this legislation to move expeditiously. Therefore, at this      time I will waive further consideration of this bill by the      Committee on Armed Services. However, the Committee on Armed      Services asks that you support our request to be conferees on      the provisions over which we have jurisdiction during any      House-Senate conference. Additionally, I request that you      include this letter as part of your committee's report on      H.R. 1997.       Thank you for your attention to this request.       With best wishes.           Sincerely,                                                    Duncan Hunter,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2004.     Hon. Duncan Hunter,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Hunter: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 1997, the ``Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2003.''      H.R. 1997 was secondarily referred to the Committee on Armed      Services because section 3 of the bill relating to the      Uniform Code of Military Justice falls within its Rule X      jurisdiction. I appreciate your willingness to forgo      consideration of the bill.       I acknowledge that by agreeing to waive its consideration      of the bill, the Committee on Armed Services does not waive      its jurisdiction over the bill or any of the matters under      your jurisdiction in Section 3.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      our Committee's report on H.R. 1997 and the Congressional      Record during consideration of the legislation on the House      floor.       Thank you for your assistance in this matter.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
