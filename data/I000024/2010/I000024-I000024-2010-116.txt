I hear quite often people say that we only have 3 percent of the world's reserves. The only reason that figure is so low is because we can't go ahead and go after and define our recoverable reserves. CRS came out about 2 months ago with a report that we are No. 1 in the world in recoverable reserves of gas, oil, and coal. We have done a study, not a part of any formal study, but to determine where we would be if we, like every other country in the world, would exploit our own resources, where we would be in terms of our dependency on the Middle East for the ability to provide the energy we need. In a short period, just on this North American continent, Mexico, Canada, and ourselves, if we would lift all restrictions we currently have, we would be able to be independent of the Middle East.  A lot of people who are concerned about the national security ramifications of our dependency on the Middle East are concerned about the Middle East. They are not concerned about Canada or Mexico. They are not concerned about the North American continent.  For those people who don't want to drill offshore, certainly now is the time to stand up and say: Look what happened down here, a horrible disaster. But those people who have never wanted, at least in the 20 years I have been here, to drill offshore or even in some of the other areas that are now off limits are people who don't think fossil fuels have a place in our energy mix. Quite frankly, I am glad President Obama has changed his position and is now recognizing that fossil fuels, more clean coal technology and therefore more coal, more gas, more oil is something he would support. It is nice to talk about renewables. It is wonderful. We have more windmills in Oklahoma than any State right now. But until technology gets to the point where we can efficiently produce energy from renewables, we still have to run this machine called America. We can't do it without fossil fuels.  I am a little bit prejudiced. I come from Oklahoma. We are one of the largest producing States. Ours are mostly marginal wells, shallow wells. They are not the giant ones. That is the reason I have been on the floor several times objecting to the Menendez limits or caps they are talking about putting on something that would be unrealistic, that would shut down any opportunities for independents and confine all offshore drilling to the five majors plus the NOCs. That is the national oil companies, mostly talking about China.  I am concerned about that. I know right now we would be in a position to do something, and we could become energy sufficient in the North American continent within 5 years, if we would exploit our own energy resources.                           Amendment No. 4218  That is not the reason I am here this afternoon. I just happened to come in. I wish to comment on amendment No. 4218 by Senator Collins. She was here a little while ago. I had an amendment that would do essentially the same thing. It was the Inhofe-Collins amendment. This is the Collins-Inhofe amendment. It takes a slightly different approach. I support both amendments, although I am withdrawing mine in her favor.  This is the problem we have. On April 22, the EPA came out with a rule that made the statement that in the event you disturb any 6 square feet of a building structure that is older than 1978, then you have to have a permit from the EPA to become certified to work on such a building. If you don't do it, there is a penalty provision of some $37,500 a day. Realistically, we know they would not fine somebody $37,500 a day. But unfortunately, a lot of the contractors who do that kind of work are individuals who don't know that is nothing but a bluff to keep people from doing things. We very much want to participate in this dialog.  I think there may be a procedural problem that someone is whispering about here; is that correct? OK, I am sorry. I forgot to ask to be considered as in morning business. I ask unanimous consent at this time.
