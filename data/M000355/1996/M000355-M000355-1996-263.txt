 President, I rise today to congratulate Sullivan College in Louisville, KY on their championship victory in the National Junior College Athletic Association [NJCAA] National Championship Tournament. I would also like to congratulate Sullivan coach Gary Shourds on being selected the National Junior College Coach of the Year and player Eric Martin on being named tournament Most Valuable Player.  The Sullivan Executives, which were unranked going into the tournament, defeated the No. 1, No. 5, No. 7, and No. 15 ranked teams in the country. The Executives clenched the title in Hutchinson, KS after a 104-98 overtime victory over Allegheny College of Maryland.  As the Courier-Journal reported, when asked if he ever thought the Executives would win the title, Sullivan college President A.R. Sullivan responded, ``Never. Not with this team this year.'' The Executives had the worst record (23-10) in the 16-team field. However, out of their last 24 games, they won 22 of them. ``This team did not come together as a team until the regional final in Gallatin, Tennessee,'' Mr. Sullivan told the Courier-Journal. ``[I]t took a personality like (coach) Gary Shourds to get them to play together.''  Shourds is a first-year Sullivan coach who played for the Executives from 1982 to 1984. He told the Courier-Journal, ``I'm really a teacher. I do this (coaching) on the side. It ends up taking more time than teaching, but that's my choice.''  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Sullivan College and Coach Gary Shourds and congratulating the entire team on their National Championship victory.                          ____________________
