 President, I add I agree entirely with the remarks of the majority leader. This is the way the Senate ought to operate--on both these bills, both the postal bill, which was challenging for everyone to get through, and the Violence Against Women Act, on which there is broad, probably unanimous agreement. In fact, the last time it passed the Senate it did pass on a voice vote. We are proceeding to handle it in a way entirely consistent with the Senate's past and procedures, with some amendments but limited debate time on each of them. We will be able to finish this bill today.  I commend Senator Hutchison and others on our side who have been deeply involved in this--Senator Cornyn--in bringing us to the place we are now.                           Amendment No. 2093
