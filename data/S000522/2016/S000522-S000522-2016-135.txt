Mr. Speaker, for years, the parents of the children who have been preyed upon by pedophiles--and advocacy groups like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Megan Kanka Foundation--have been very supportive of legislation to better protect our children. Through their consistent, selfless work they have helped victims of abuse and have been an important part of the bipartisan, bicameral coalition supporting this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to read their statements submitted for the record, in support of passage of H.R. 515 The International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking.                                                 January 20, 2016.     Hon. Paul D. Ryan,     Speaker of the House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker and Madam Leader: On behalf of ECPAT-USA,      a policy and advocacy organization that has been at the      forefront of the fight to end the commercial sexual      exploitation of children for the past two decades, I would      like to respectfully ask you consider supporting      International Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation      Through Advanced Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders      (H.R. 515). When ECPAT-USA first began our work, we focused      on fighting sex tourism and holding Americans who traveled      abroad to buy sex with minors accountable in the US for      sexually exploiting children overseas. H.R. 515 or      International Megan's Law protects children from this exact      form of exploitation by establishing a notification system to      provide advance notice of travel by registered sex offenders      to destination countries. We strongly support this      legislation and urge not only its swift passage but also a      commitment to supporting this effort financially.       The Department of Homeland Security has a proven track      record of working cooperatively with foreign governments,      having made 99 arrests of traveling child sexual offenders      since 2003. International Megan's Law will establish the      Angel Watch Center at the Department of Homeland Security to      ensure that all destination countries receive a notification      that a convicted child sex predator is traveling to their      country. It also formalizes the process for the U.S.      Marshal's Service Sex Offender Targeting Center to provide      advanced notice of travel by all registered sex offenders to      destination countries using Interpol notification system.      International Megan's Law also coordinates communication      between Angel Watch Center and U.S. Marshal's Service Sex      Offender Targeting center and streamlines the international      notification system. We believe that these provisions are      necessary to strengthen and protect vulnerable children from      potential predators.       ECPAT-USA is part of a global network of over 80 ECPAT's in      77 countries all dedicated to protecting children from      commercial sexual exploitation. Headquartered in Thailand, we      are acutely familiar with the harm caused by sex offenders      who travel overseas and continuously exploit children. As a      member of the ECPAT network, we are committed to eradicating      the practice of child sex tourism. For this reason, we were      so pleased to see the Senate pass this bill late last year,      and we applaud the efforts and dedication of the bill's      original sponsor in the House Representative Chris Smith (R-     NJ). We strongly urge the House to swiftly pass International      Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation Through Advanced      Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders (H.R. 515).           Sincerely,                                                  Carol Smolenski,                                    Executive Director, ECPAT-USA.                                  ____                                                                        Family Research Council,                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2016.     Representative,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative: On behalf of Family Research Council      (FRC) and the families we represent, I urge you to vote for      International Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and      Other Sexual Crimes Through Advanced Notification of      Traveling Sex Offenders (``Megan's Law,'' H.R. 515), to      establish a system that prevents predators from traveling      under the radar internationally.       Megan's Law would expand and codify Immigration and Customs      Enforcement's ability to effectively alert countries about      the travel of registered child-sex offenders, require      convicted child-sex predators to have a unique passport      identifier to ensure they can be identified at the border as      they travel internationally, and ensure collaboration between      the U.S. Marshal's Service and the Immigration and Customs      Enforcement, making government work more effectively. The      bill would also provide an appeals process for persons who      want their record and notification status reconsidered and      make it a crime for registered sex offenders to fail to      report intended international travel with less than twenty-     one days of notice. Ultimately, the law would facilitate a      network to reduce child-sex tourism and reduce recidivism of      child-sex offenders.       Family Research Council recognizes that it is important to      protect families from child-sex abusers, supports passage of      International Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and      Other Sexual Crimes Through Advanced Notification of      Traveling Sex Offenders (H.R. 515), and encourages you to      vote for this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                David Christensen,                             Vice President of Government Affairs.                                  ____                                                                  Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation,                                      Trenton, NJ, September 2015.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: This past August marked the twenty-first      anniversary of the violent rape and murder of our seven year      old daughter Megan at the hands of a twice-convicted      pedophile. As a result of our pain, determination and the      support of the public and representatives like you we have      Megan's Law throughout the United States. However, children      abroad are still unprotected from U.S. sex offenders.       We are grateful that the Congress is advancing the      International Megan's Law (H.R. 515/S. 1867) to stop sex      offenders from exploiting children internationally--we      eagerly await a Senate vote on the bill so that it will      become law before the end of the year.       When do we as a society truly stand behind our vows to      protect the children of this world? Unfortunately for us, it      took the murder of our seven year old daughter Megan for us      to get involved.       This law has been eight years in the making. We urgently      need your help and support now to prevent new tragedies.           Sincerely,                                          Maureen & Richard Kanka.                                  ____                                                                                 National Center for                                 Missing & Exploited Children,                                 Alexandria, VA, January 12, 2016.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Smith: On behalf of the National Center      for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the families and      children we serve, I am writing to express our support for      your legislation, International Megan's Law to Prevent Child      Exploitation and Other Sexual Crimes Through Advance      Notification of Traveling Sex Offenders (IML) (H.R. 515).      NCMEC supports the goals of IML to help ensure the effective      monitoring and compliance of sex offenders who have harmed      children and pose a continuing risk to children in the United      States and abroad.       NCMEC's Sex Offender Tracking Team (SOTT) assists federal,      state, and local law enforcement in their efforts to locate      and apprehend noncompliant, convicted sex offenders and      determine if there is a possible link to unresolved cases of      missing and sexually exploited children. Today, our SOTT      analysts provide assistance to various law enforcement      agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service in the National      Sex Offender Targeting Center.       Through our SOTT work, we have learned the difficulties law      enforcement can face when monitoring sex offenders as well as      the potential danger to children when noncompliant, convicted      sex offenders travel within the United States or abroad,      including the possibility that they will commit additional      crimes against children. We believe the legislation you have      sponsored--International Megan's Law--will enhance law      enforcement's ability to monitor sex offenders when traveling      abroad.       As you know, NCMEC also supported the companion bill      sponsored in the Senate by     Senators Richard Shelby and Barbara Mikulski. Provisions of      their legislation were incorporated into H.R. 515 and then      passed unanimously by the Senate in December. We now look      forward to the House of Representatives prompt consideration      of H.R. 515.       NCMEC is proud to lend our support to this important      legislation, and we are grateful for your dedication to the      safety of our nation's children.           Sincerely,                                                    John F. Clark,                                                President and CEO.                                  ____                                                                            International Centre for                                 Missing & Exploited Children,                                 Alexandria, VA, January 12, 2016.     Re H.R. 515.     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative McCarthy and Representative Pelosi: On      behalf of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited      Children (ICMEC), I am writing in reference to H.R. 515,      International Megan's Law to Prevent Child Exploitation and      Other Sexual Crimes Through Advance Notification of Traveling      Sex Offenders.       For almost two decades, ICMEC has been working around the      world to advance child protection and safeguard children from      abduction, sexual abuse and exploitation. ICMEC responds to      requests for assistance from all over the world through      advocacy, training and collaboration. We strive to inform and      work with policy makers, law enforcement and others in an      effort to enhance and enrich frontline child protection      practices.       We strongly believe that all children have the right to      live without fear of abduction and free from sexual abuse and      exploitation. We believe every child deserves a safe      childhood, where they are able to grow into healthy and      successful adults.       We thank you for your efforts to protect children from      exploitation, to keep known sex offenders from harming      children again, and to promote and facilitate enhanced      cooperation and information sharing within the global law      enforcement community.           Sincerely,                                      Ambassador Maura Harty, ret.     President & CEO.                          ____________________
