President, no one deserves that holiday more than Senator Byrd who constantly reminds us of what this wonderful, interesting discussion is all about; that is, stand up for the Constitution, and stand up for the people we represent. To Senator Byrd and his wonderful wife, we wish an especially warm and cheerful holiday.
