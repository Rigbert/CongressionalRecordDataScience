 President, it is my understanding that Senator Grassley has been in some negotiations regarding the amendment. Trade is under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee. I don't know where he is now. I do not know if he voted, but we have been working with him.  I know the Senator wants to bring up his amendment as soon as he can. But I want to make sure Senator Grassley is ready and on the floor. We will try to locate him.
