Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the resolution. This resolution expresses the solidarity of the Congress and the American people with Israel in a struggle against the forces of hatred and violence. It is both fitting and appropriate for us today to declare our support at a time when Israel had been subjected to repeated acts of terror.  Israel is our most reliable friend in the Middle East. It is our only democracy, a beacon of hope in the region of the world for the freedom we all take for granted. Freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of religion, freedom to challenge your government nonviolently without fear of retribution simply do not exist. Israel is the only country in the Middle East that guarantees all of these freedoms.  The Congress stands here today to condemn and reject this paths of violence led by Chairman Arafat. Instead, we must return to the path of peace. Israel must have a partner who is willing to say no to those who will use terror and violence.  Chairman Arafat must take action against those Palestinians who would block the path to peace.
