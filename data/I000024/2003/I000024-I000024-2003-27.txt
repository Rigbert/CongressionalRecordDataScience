President, I thank Senator Voinovich for making his statement. I will be specific. The amount of jobs in his State alone, if this passes, would be 178,000.  For any other Members who want to know how their States will be affected, we have that breakdown. It is a study by Penn State University. I thank the Senator for his comments.
