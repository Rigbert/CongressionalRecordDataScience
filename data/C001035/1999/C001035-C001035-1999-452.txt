President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the resolution that the Senate just unanimously approved to designate May as the National Military Appreciation Month.  With troops in harm's way in Bosnia, in Serbia, in Haiti and the Persian Gulf, it is difficult to conceive of a more appropriate time for the Senate to have clearly put itself on record as supporting our brave men and women in uniform.  Regardless of how we may feel about these individual deployments, it is important that the American people send an unmistakable signal to our troops that we salute their bravery, their patriotism, their courage and their unparalleled skill as they carry out dangerous missions throughout the world.  I am proud to support our troops 100 percent, as they carry out their missions and the will of the Commander in Chief.  Mr. President, let us all join together today and every day to remember our troops throughout the world.  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
