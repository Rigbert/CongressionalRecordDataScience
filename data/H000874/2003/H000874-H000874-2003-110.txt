If the gentleman could answer the question, however, we understand there seems to be a disagreement. However, the House passed a provision that directed that there be no privatization of the air traffic controllers. The Senate passed a provision providing that there should be no privatization of air traffic controllers. But we understand there is a difference in the conference on this issue. Can you explain to me, Mr. Leader, when the House took a position on behalf of insuring on the continued public nature of the air traffic controllers and the Senate took the same position, why there might be a difference on that issue?  Mr. DeLAY. Well, I have to admit to the gentleman that I am not privy to the intricate negotiations that are going on in this bill. We are leaving that up to the chairmen that are presiding over the conference committees. So I cannot answer the question because I do not know the machinations that have been going on in detail, and I certainly do not want to mislead the House.
