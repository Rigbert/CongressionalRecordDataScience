Speaker, I rise today to honor and acknowledge the outstanding career of Corona Police Chief John Cleghorn, who retired on December 19, 1997. It is rare to find an individual who exhibits such strong leadership in the community, and also maintains a compassionate relationship with all levels of individuals within that community. My friend John Cleghorn is one of these individuals. My hometown of Corona, California has been extremely fortunate to have had Chief Cleghorn protecting our community and making it a safer place in which to live and work.  John Cleghorn served as the Chief of Police in Corona for 12 years. He came to Corona following a successful career with the Los Angeles Police Department where he rose to the rank of captain and served as head of the force's anti-terrorism unit. He brought with him the knowledge and experience needed to lead a city that was experiencing massive population and economic growth. Chief Cleghorn was appointed to the position in 1985, and in the years that he served as Chief, Corona experienced the same massive population explosion that many other cities in California also experienced. As the Chief of Police, he dealt with difficulties associated with this type of growth in an efficient and effective manner. Chief Cleghorn has overseen a police department that grew from 66 sworn officers to 131 during his tenure, as well as adding a 12-member SWAT team, a gang unit, and CAT, a program created to deal with an increasing number of car thefts in the Corona area.  In addition to his responsibilities to the force, Chief Cleghorn devoted much of his time to various community organizations. These groups include the Corona Rotary Club, the Navy League, the YMCA, the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation, and the Corona Police Community Partnership. He is also involved with Peppermint Ridge, a facility that cares for individuals with developmental disabilities. Chief Cleghorn was recently recognized for his tremendous community efforts by being named Man of the Year for 1997 by the Corona Chamber of Commerce.  On behalf of the citizens of the 43rd congressional district, I would like to thank Chief Cleghorn for his contributions and dedicated service to his community and for the example he has set for future generations. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
