Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 520, authored by Senator Crapo of Idaho, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to convey the title of specific Bureau of Reclamation facilities to the Freemont-Madison Irrigation District. The district has operated and maintained these facilities and will have paid all construction costs to the Federal Government prior to conveyance.  As part of this legislation, transfer proponents and several other water interests worked together on drought management provisions to address the needs of all water users in the watershed. This will protect and enhance the Henry's Fork fishery while continuing to provide water to the area's irrigators and other users.  The measure also would require compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and is consistent with the Bureau of Reclamation policy to transfer title to water districts that have operated and maintained their facilities and paid out their construction costs.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this consensus-based bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
