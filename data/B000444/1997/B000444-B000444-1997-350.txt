 President, I rise in support of our colleague, Congressman Richardson, to become our Ambassador to the United Nations.  Mr. President, I will very shortly yield back the remainder of the time. I understand I have 15 minutes under my control.  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to thank the chairman, Senator Helms, for his willingness to bring this important nomination to the floor so expeditiously.  I join Chairman Helms in endorsing the nomination of Representative Bill Richardson to be the Permanent Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations, with rank of Ambassador.  I commend President Clinton for having nominated him, and I strongly urge my colleagues here today to vote to confirm this distinguished Member of Congress who already has a long list of diplomatic accomplishments to his name.  Congressman Richardson has ably represented the Third District of New Mexico for 14 years, but it is his experience in successfully negotiating the release of Americans and others in some of the world's least hospitable locales that has brought his formidable diplomatic skills to light. This diplomatic experience will serve him well at the United Nations as he seeks to advance American interests in contacts with 185 other nations.  Likewise, Congressman Richardson's personal background and political experience have prepared him well to represent the United States in the world body.  Bill Richardson was born in California and grew up in Mexico City. He attended high school in Boston and remained there to attend Tufts University, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy.  Bill Richardson then came to Washington, working in the Legislative Affairs Office at the State Department and as a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where, like his predecessor, Secretary of State Albright, he gained an appreciation for the role of the Senate in helping craft American foreign policy.  In 1978, Bill Richardson moved to Santa Fe, and in 1982 he won election to this first term as a Member of Congress. His vast district has been described by one writer as a ``mini-U.N.,'' with a diverse population that is 35 percent Hispanic and 25 percent Native American, including members of 28 different tribes.  As a Congressman, he served on the Intelligence Committee and was a fervent advocate of the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the official biography of Bill Richardson.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Report for the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate     Subject: Ambassadorial Nomination: Certificate of          Demonstrated Competence--Foreign Service Act, Section          304(a)(4).     Post: U.S. Mission to the United Nations.     Candidate: Bill Richardson.       Bill Richardson has served as a member of the U.S. House of      Representatives, representing the state of New Mexico since      1983. He serves on the Commerce, Resources and Intelligence      Committees. Mr. Richardson is active on the North Atlantic      Assembly, the Helsinki Commission on Human Rights, the      Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the House Democratic      Steering Committee. In addition, Congressman Richardson      serves as Chief Deputy Minority Whip.       Congressman Richardson has been active in hostage      negotiations in a number of countries which include the      Sudan, North Korea, Cuba, and Iraq. His diplomatic skills      have been instrumental in the release of a number of American      hostages.       Prior to his election to the U.S. House of Representatives,      Mr. Richardson served as a Staff Member of the U.S. Senate      Foreign Relations Committee, a Congressional Liaison Officer      as the Department of State, and a Staff Member of the      Wednesday Group of the U.S. House of Representatives.       Mr. Richardson received a B.A. from Tufts University and an      M.A. from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts.      He is the recipient of honorary degrees from the University      of the Americas in Mexico, the College of Santa Fe, and the      Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Mr. Richardson has      published a number of articles dealing with U.S.-Mexico      relations.       Born November 15, 1947, Mr. Richardson speaks Spanish and      French. He has won numerous awards including the Aztec Eagle      Award from Mexico Government in 1994. In 1995, he was      nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.       Mr. Richardson's dedication to public service and his      strong diplomatic and leadership skills make him an excellent      candidate as U.S. Representative to the United Nations.
