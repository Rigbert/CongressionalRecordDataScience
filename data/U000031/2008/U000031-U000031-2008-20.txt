One of the bills that I have cosponsored, it is actually a bipartisan bill, is to look at increasing ethanol from nonfood source, or noncorn, and there are a couple of bills to do that using switch grass and a number of different things. We are not quite there in the technology, but we are not too far away, within a couple of years. And I think we ought to be investing more on that type of technology so that we can take some of the pressure off these rising food prices. I represent Kellogg's as well, as does the gentleman in the well, Mr. Walberg.
