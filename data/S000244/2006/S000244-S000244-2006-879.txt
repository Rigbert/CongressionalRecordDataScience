Speaker, today I rise to introduce H.R. 4710, the ``Judiciary Rent Reform Act of 2006.'' The purpose of this legislation is to ensure the rent paid by the Federal judiciary is rationally and equitably related to the actual costs of providing their facilities.  It may shock Members to learn that this is not the case nor has it been for some time. In fact, the Federal judiciary pays the General Services Administration (GSA) hundreds of millions of dollars more each year than the actual costs of maintaining and operating buildings. Chief Justice Roberts has characterized this practice as resulting in the judiciary being used ``as a profit center for GSA.''  By law, GSA is authorized to establish the rent to be paid by the judiciary. GSA's rates are supposed to approximate commercially equivalent rates. Their charges are not subject to negotiation.  Since 1986, the judiciary's annual rent payments to GSA have increased from $133 million to almost $920 million. As a percentage of the judiciary's operating budget, these payments have climbed from 15.7 percent to 20 percent. In contrast, rent for executive branch agencies averages less than one percent of their budgets and no department is charged more than 3 percent.  To cope with soaring GSA rent payments, the courts have been compelled to make difficult choices, including a decision over 18 months to reduce employee ranks by 1,850 positions--a full 8 percent of on board staffing levels.  Consider the irony: the staffing required by the Judiciary Branch is compromised because the Executive Branch charges our courts too much for rent.  In the absence of a swift Congressional response to redress this imbalance, there is little doubt that the continued budgetary pressures, which will result from constantly rising rental costs, will cause the loss of even more court personnel.  The administration of justice should not be compromised because our courts are denied the ability to contain their rental costs. The judiciary has taken available action to reign in these expenses, including adopting a 24-month moratorium on new construction and requesting rent relief from GSA. To date though, GSA has refused to work with the courts in any meaningful way to find a solution.  As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I believe Congress has a duty to act to ensure the fair, efficient, and equitable adjudication of all legitimate issues brought before the courts. The use of the courts as a ``profit center'' can no longer be tolerated.  The bill I am introducing today will put an end to this practice by replacing the ``commercially-equivalent'' rent calculation that GSA has used with a requirement that the courts pay only for the actual operating expenses incurred in providing space. This simple change will result in a dramatic savings in the judiciary's rent expense.  This change will also give the judiciary needed flexibility, accountability, and responsibility for balancing the requirements imposed by their capital costs, personnel, and nonsalary expenses.  The courts are best positioned to know whether the administration of justice will benefit more by hiring new personnel than by constructing a new courthouse or renovating an older one. Our courts should be empowered to make the decision that is in the public interest and that is most likely to enhance their ability to adjudicate and resolve cases.  In his inaugural year-end report on the Federal judiciary, Chief Justice Roberts addressed this issue directly:       The disparity between the judiciary's rent and that of      other government agencies, and between the cost to GSA of      providing space and the amount charged to the judiciary, is      unfair . . . [and] the judiciary must . . . find a long-term      solution to the problem of ever-increasing rent payments that      drain resources needed for the courts to fulfill their vital      mission.  Mr. Speaker, the solution is for Congress to enact the ``Judiciary Rent Reform Act of 2006,'' which will require the Administrator of General Services to charge the judiciary only the actual cost of providing space in federally-owned facilities or the actual costs of procuring and servicing leases in privately-owned space.  In addition to allowing the federal courts to better plan and control their budget, which will improve the delivery of judicial services to the public, this Act will improve the transparency associated with how the judiciary's funds are spent.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, which I am introducing in direct response to the plea of the Chief Justice that this issue ``now warrant[s] immediate attention and action.'' I and the Judiciary Conference of the U.S. look forward to the House passing this legislation without delay.                          ____________________
