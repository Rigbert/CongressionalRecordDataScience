  These are big stakes. If, in fact, you vote no, and if proliferation accelerates, whether or not because of this, mark my words, those who voted no will pay. Conversely, if you vote yes and we find out a year or 2 or 3 from now that all those horrible concerns about the treaty turned out to be true and the Soviets have a superiority and the Chinese are doing this, then those of us who voted for the treaty will be held accountable, as we should. I wasn't applying it to one side.
