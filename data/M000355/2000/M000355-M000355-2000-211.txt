 President, on Monday, the Financial Times carried a story headlined ``Burma Regime Has the Most Child Soldiers.'' As Burma drives toward a goal of a half million man army, more than 50,000 children have been forced into military service, with orphans and street children the most vulnerable.  These are the facts of life in Burma that no longer surprise any of us who follow the region closely. Forced labor, forced relocations, arrests, detention, torture, even executions are more facts--repeated so often that it is easy to develop a tin ear to the unreal horrors these words convey about daily life in Burma. Add words like hunger, disease, and illiteracy--add unemployment, injustice and drug trafficking, and you get the full picture of the misery the Rangoon regime has created.  As acute as Burma's pain is, this is not a day of mourning. Today is a celebration of wisdom and courage--a tribute to Burma's citizens who 10 years ago defied all risks and elected Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy [NLD] to lift the nation from a deep swamp of poverty, brutality and repression to the solid ground of democracy and prosperity.  The army may have stolen Burma's elections and her rightful past, but they will not be allowed to diminish our faith nor discourage our service to her future--to Burma's freedom.  For 10 years, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has honored the wisdom and courage of her constituents through countless acts of self-discipline, heroic judgment and profound humility. Treated with cruelty, especially during her husband's final days, her compassion has not withered. Imprisoned, isolated by house arrest, she finds strength to reach out for a peaceful, political dialog with her captors. Wounded with each report of a follower's detention or death, she does not scar with bitterness, she does not retreat from her destined course--democracy.  Today, Senator Moynihan and I have introduced a resolution of support for that destiny--for the restoration of democracy. Joined by Senators Lott, Helms, Leahy, Ashcroft, Feinstein, Lugar, Durbin, Kennedy, Sarbanes and Wellstone, we are honored to have the opportunity to pay tribute to those who persevere in the noble quest for Burma's liberty.  In particular, let me offer my appreciation to the Members and friends of the NLD who work tirelessly for Burma's free future and, especially the guardian angel of our common cause, Michelle Bohanna.                          ____________________
