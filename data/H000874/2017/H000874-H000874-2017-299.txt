 Would you give that advice to the President of the United States and tell him to take a breath before he makes policy or before he offends our allies or before he creates great fear in those who hear what he has to say off the cuff?  Yes, I understand that rhetoric counts. You might talk to him about that as well. He is the one that calls this a ban. I know that everybody else is trying to clean it up, and I hope thatis the case. In fact, I have seen the head of Homeland Security, Secretary Kelly, trying to clean it up.  It is a darn shame that it wasn't cleaned up before. It was a darned shame that the time was not taken to do an order that would make sure that vetting was appropriate, as my quote and our legislation that you talked about urged.  It is good advice to your children and good advice to this President: Take a breath. Just don't, as immediately it comes to mind, tweet it and have the impact not known to you, your staff, or to the country.  Almost invariably, we have seen this has a negative effect.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, President Obama said that he was rooting for President Trump's success.  I would also give the advice, let's not root against him. He still doesn't have his own Cabinet. When I watched and listened to what some on the other side of their own leadership say about some there, I could see where the rhetoric continues to rise. I think we should put that down. The election is over, and now is the time to govern.  There are big problems out there. We can score as many political points as we want back and forth, but there are challenges. You and I have worked together on so many issues out here, from opioids, from the visa waiver so many different times. And we have disagreed others times.  I think it would behoove us and the American public that we can show the leadership to do that, and I look forward to working with you on these issues.
