  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     University of California,                              San Francisco, CA, February 4, 1998.     Hon. Senator Kennedy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my deep      concern about the negative impact of impending legislation      introduced by Senators Bond, Frist et al. (S. 1599) intended      to regulate cloning of a human being. As an active researcher      in the scientific field of the discovery leading to Dolly, I      understand its implications for basic science and human      health. Dolly's existence proves for the first time that the      genetic material of an adult body cell can be completely      reprogrammed by the egg, thus totally restoring the genetic      potential for specializing into all possible cell types. This      discovery that genetic reprogramming is possible in mammals      is as important to human health as the discovery of      penicillin. Basic research on genetic reprogramming will      likely lead to novel transplantation therapies for numerous      human disease, including heart disease, diabetes,      neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson disease),      genetic diseases and birth defects. I believe that imprecise,      hastily-written legislation against human cloning, such as S.      1599, will hinder these important research opportunities for      understanding genetic reprogramming of adult cells. Excessive      regulation as specified by S. 1599, including civil penalties      and criminalization, in the areas of this new discovery is      likely to thwart the momentum of basic research on genetic      reprogramming and deter the enthusiasm and ability of      researchers poised to make new contributions in applying      their findings to human health problems.       In no conceivable instance would research on genetic      reprogramming involve cloning of human beings. Indeed,      active, credible researchers and clinicians overwhelmingly      regard cloning a human being as an unethical and      reprehensible act. Last year, working through the Society for      Developmental Biology, I spearheaded a voluntary moratorium      on cloning human beings. This moratorium unequivocally states      that we have no intention to clone human beings, where this      is defined as ``duplication of an existing or previously      existing human being by transferring the nucleus of a      differentiated, somatic cell into an enucleated human oocyte,      and implanting the resulting product for intrauterine      gestation and subsequent birth.'' To date, 15 additional      scientific and medical societies, including the Federation of      American Societies for Experimental Biology, the American      Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for the      Study of Reproduction, together representing more than 60,000      reproductive, developmental, cell and molecular biologists,      have endorsed this moratorium. Historical precedent (with      recombinant DNA technology) indicates that a voluntary      moratorium can deter activities that are potentially unsafe      for humans. It is evident from recent events that anyone who      advocates cloning human beings for any purpose will be      subjected to ostracism and discredited scientifically.      Therefore, I believe that the existing voluntary moratorium      against cloning human beings is an effective means of      regulating the behavior of U.S. scientists and physicians.       Presently, the fields of developmental biology and human      genetics are at an exciting juncture, where many novel genes      are being identified through the Human Genome Project and      their functions during normal development are being      understood for the first time. In addition, an understanding      of how these genes interact with the internal and external      environment of the cell is emerging for studies such as those      giving rise to Dolly. Deriving the full benefits of these new      insights for human health will require a dedicated and      cooperative research effort by many scientists, including      those who conduct research on human cells and tissues.       In conclusion, there is a great risk that anti-cloning      legislation would deprive the American people of      unprecedented human health benefits. I thus urge extreme      caution in any legal sanctions, such as those included in S.      1599, which would have lasting detrimental effects on our      ability to alleviate human diseases, and would also undermine      the competitive abilities of U.S. scientists in our field.           Respectfully yours,                                     Roger A. Pedersen, Ph.D.,         Professor and Research Director, Reproductive Genetics            Unit,            Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive                                                           Science.
