 President, every day, police officers from departments of all sizes spend their days trying to make sure the people under their protection have a safe and secure place to live, work, and play. But those who wish to break our laws don't make this an easy task. The tactics, threats, and information available to the modern criminal continue to grow. Just as developments in technology, transportation, and communications have created new opportunities for businesses to enter new markets, develop new products, and discover new efficiencies, crooks have taken advantage of these same developments to further their personal desires.  Law enforcement has a responsibility to stay abreast of the latest developments, and this means learning the latest technologies and techniques used by criminals, as well as understanding and being able to effectively deploy countermeasures that have been developed. Staying on top of the game demands learning new techniques, understanding new technologies, and employing new tactics to counter the latest criminal scam.  The challenge, then, is in identifying where this training should come from. Most citizens expect cops to learn many of these skills on the job--you never see the detectives on ``NYPD Blue'' or in ``Law and Order'' take classes to improve their skills. But the truth of the matter is what while on the job training is an essential part of any law enforcement organization, additional schooling is also increasingly prevalent and necessary. Some departments have funds in their budgets to bring in outside experts to provide training. Some depend upon classes offered by State governments. But for a vast number of departments, particularly those serving smaller, rural populations, the only training opportunities available are offered by the National Guard.  Operating under the authority of Title 32, United States Code, Section 112, the National Guard actively supports local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies and community based anti-drug coalitions. Over the past several years, the Guard has supported the establishment of five Counterdrug schools which facilitate valuable training for State and local law enforcement agencies. These schools are dedicated to teaching counterdrug-related skills to State and local law enforcement agencies and community-based organizations. The classes range from specialties such as how best to search a loaded semi tractor-trailer for narcotics to generally applicable classes on interviewing or surveillance techniques. They provide training to thousands of officers each year who would otherwise not be able to receive it for a lack of resources.  These schools, located in Pennsylvania, Florida, Iowa, Mississippi, and California, but serving law enforcement officers throughout the United States, have proved their effectiveness in developing training and educational opportunities for local law enforcement officials--opportunities that would not otherwise exist. The schools fill a need readily apparent in conversations with State and local law enforcement officers. The National Guard Counterdrug schools represent one of the few opportunities available to State and local law enforcement officers to improve the skills they need to be as effective as possible in maintaining the peace.  But in addition to law enforcement, community-based organizations also receive valuable training from the National Guard Schools, which allows them to be much more effective in their efforts. Almost any law enforcement officer will tell you that they would rather have a successful prevention effort, a way to convince kids that crime really doesn't pay, rather than having these kids begin a life of crime. Organized, motivated, effective community coalitions are a central, bipartisan component of our nation's drug demand reduction strategy.  The challenge the schools face is one of funding. They have been funded to date by Sate Plans funds from the Defense department and line items from Congress. The funding to each school has varied from year to year, making it exceedingly difficult for the schools and the law enforcement agencies they serve to know how many of what classes will be offered. And while I do not believe this should be an issue, there have been some questions raised as to whether the operation of these schools should be conducted by the Guard.  Today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Harkin, Cochran, and Nelson in introducing legislation that addresses these challenges. This legislation will formally authorize the five schools, and create a separate budget account for the schools. The establishment of a single account for all five Counterdrug schools will stabilize the funding for the schools so they can more efficiently and effectively plan, manage, and execute training for the law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.  In addition, a single line item supporting these schools will relieve the need for each school having to depend upon a Congressional line item for funding for their activities. It will provide easier management, oversight, and the establishment of performance expectations of the Schools by both the National Guard and Congress. With better oversight, management, and creating a regular funding stream, the schools will be able to better serve the training needs of state and local law enforcement.                          ____________________
