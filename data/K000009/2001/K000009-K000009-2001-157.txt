Chairman, I would like to thank my chairman for generously yielding that minute, and I just want to say that I share the gentleman's deep concern about what this particular condition can do to our export market.  We had a situation a couple of years ago where we had USDA officials up before our committee and we asked where on the continent does Karnal bunt exist. I said was it Canada? No, we do not have it in Canada. Is it in the United States? No, it is not in the United States. I said, how about Mexico? Absolutely. I said, How did it get over the border? And this goes back to NAFTA and these inspection issues. They could not say whether it came in seed in a car trunk or whether some bird carried it over. But, honestly, we have to work together to try to deal with the conditions that can come in here from other countries.  I would just express to the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies, tothe ranking member on the authorizing committee, and to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) that this Member is vitally interested in that problem, and he has my full cooperation on it.
