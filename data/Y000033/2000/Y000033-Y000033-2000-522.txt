Mr. Speaker, I wish to provide this clarification of legislative intent to Section 761 of H.R. 1000, the FAA Reauthorization bill, P.L. 106-181, enacted earlier this year.  Section 761 provides a process for land exchanges to facilitate a railroad track realignment and straightening project through Elmendorf AFB and Fort Richardson, Alaska. Track is to be relocated further away from the runway landing clear zone, ammunition storage areas, and other military facilities. It will also provide safety and operational benefits for the combined passenger and freight rail line. The small land parcel segments that need to be exchanged on a nearly acre-for-acre basis will be between the state-owned Alaska Railroad on the one part, and the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, or such other federal agencies as may be necessary, on the other part.  Of course, it is the intent of Section 761 that matters needed to facilitate these land exchanges between the federal agencies and the state railroad, as well as the overall purposes of this project, are necessarily implied therein. For example, it will obviously be necessary on a temporary basis during surveying, preliminary engineering, and construction, for one or more of these entities to be present simultaneously on each others' parcels of land, regardless of the exact dates legal title may be transferred. The railroad may, by necessary implication, locate and construct its new track facility without the need for a separate fee or use permit being processed under the usual federal land management statutes. Section 761 already authorizes the applicable Secretary to impose additional terms on the railroad as appropriate to protect the U.S. interests.  Further, while Section 761 did not directly amend The Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982, under which the federally-owned railroad was sold to the state, once again, it is logically and necessarily implied that the reversionary provisions of the 1982 Act will not apply to land segments given up by the railroad to facilitate this project. Instead, the reversionary provisions will transfer and apply to the new land acquired by the railroad from the federal entities in the exchange.  Finally, Section 761 had no intent to imply any derogation of the permanent withdrawal and agreement under Section 1425 of ANILCA, P.L. 86-487, as to any of the lands being exchanged. It is the intent of Section 761 that the lands received by each grantee, either the railroad or the federal entities, shall have in its hands the same status with respect to Section 1425 of ANILCA and the agreement as did the lands granted in exchange by each such grantee. Further, it is intended that any land or interest reconveyed by the railroad to a federal agency will be automatically considered a part of the surrounding public land withdrawal without need for further administrative action respecting those lands.                          ____________________
