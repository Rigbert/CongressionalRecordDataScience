Mr. Speaker, I am outraged by the killing of 14 Serbs last Friday near the town of Gracko in Kosovo. The culprits of this crime are, in my view, prime candidates for the next indictments for crimes against humanity by the International Tribunal which is located in The Hague. I certainly hope that the efforts of KFOR, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and Tribunal investigators will help identify and immediately apprehend those responsible for this crime.  The killings, however, are no isolated incident. Since NATO air strikes ended, the Serb forces have retreated, and the Kosovar refugees have begun to return to their homes, those Serb civilians who chose to remain in the region have repeatedly been subjected to violent retribution. Certainly a Kosovo which is ethnically cleansed of Serbs--and, according to reports, cleansed of Roma as well--is not the kind of Kosovo for which the international community undertook such a risky and costly intervention. Kosovo must pursue the path of rule by law not by lawlessness, and respect for and protection of basic human freedoms--including life itself.  A related disturbing trend is the attempt by leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army--the KLA--to fill the political vacuum created now that Serbian authorities have departed Kosovo. The KLA has yet to prove its democratic credentials; in many instances, its tactics have sent the opposite message. Mr. Speaker, before the KLA is granted any role in Kosovo's interim administration, it must prove itself. Helping to find those responsible for this latest atrocity would be a good place to start. Nationalist Kosovar Albanians can not hide behind the past victimization of their people by Milosevic and his forces, those responsible for these actions taken against Serbs and their property in Kosovo must be held accountable. Neither can they relegate responsibility for stopping these incidents to the international community alone.  The international community must make clear to all Kosovar Albanian leaders that their actions now will go a long way in determining what kind of support they will find for their own aspirations down the road. The benefits of enhanced political status for Kosovo cannot be enjoyed without also undertaking the responsibilities of democratic governance.                          ____________________
