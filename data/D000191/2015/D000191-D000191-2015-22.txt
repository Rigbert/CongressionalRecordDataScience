Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would allow commercialization within the Federal right-of-way, and that causes concern as to the potential for proliferation.  We have had many debates over the years that I have been on the committee over advertising proximate to interstates. We have come to a pretty good stasis on that issue. This amendment is not new. It is not widely supported.  We did not hear from California that they were in support. We were in touch with them numerous times. Perhaps they are, but we didn't hear that. The Outdoor Advertising Association of America does not support the amendment.  I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
