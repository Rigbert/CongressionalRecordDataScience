 President, this small business tax bill includes legislation that helps home buyers.  The provision is called contributions in aid of construction. It repeals the gross-up tax imposed on families building homes since the 1986 Tax Act.  It will save families and small businesses up to $2,000 off the price of a new home or building. The gross-up tax is one where under current law, regulated public utilities must include in their taxable income contributions from customers, or potential customers. These utility services include water and sewer systems.  Customers routinely must finance the cost to the utility of extending the necessary capital improvements to the family home. Therefore, State utility commissions require that homes hoping to get utility services contribute to the company both the cost for the capital improvements necessary to extend the service, and the amount of tax that the utility will have to recognize on the receipt of the funds or assets needed for those improvements.  This gross-up tax can increase the cost of the contribution in aid of construction by 70 percent.  The cost to families of the present law encourages the proliferation of small, uneconomical, and environmentally unsafe water and sewer systems.  This legislation is paid for by the water utility industry. Contributions in aid of construction are so important that the water utility industry has volunteered to change the depreciable lives of its property to finance the law change.  Over a 10-year period, this legislation in the chairman's mark raises an extra $200 million more than is necessary to pay for the legislation.  The contributions in aid of construction legislation is important tax relief for families, and I believe that it is an outstanding addition to this legislation.               CHURCH PENSIONS AND PENSION SIMPLIFICATION  Mr. President, I am pleased that this manager's amendment contains, in the pension simplification portion, provisions which will help clarify the treatment of church pension plans. The amendment would allow combined pension plan coverage for self-employed clergy. It would allow pension plans established prior to the enactment of ERISA, which is the case for many of the church plans, to use the new definition of highly compensated employees. It authorizes, but does not require, the Treasury to design safe harbors from the nondiscrimination rules for church plans. And it allows for the payroll deduction of pension contributions for clergy on foreign missions. The final bill will also retain a change in the tax treatment of parsonage allowances which will benefit many ministers.  Mr. President, we included last year in the Finance Committee's portions of the Balanced Budget Act legislation which Senator Pryor and I introduced early in this Congress designed to deal with many of the problems the church plans were having with the rules pertaining to highly compensated employees and to nondiscrimination. Ultimately, those provisions were dropped from the legislation on the grounds that they did not meet the requirements of the Byrd rule. If the legislation we are considering today is enacted, Mr. President, we will have gone a long way toward taking care of themost serious of the problems faced by the church plans. Of course, much will depend on the Treasury Department's willingness to develop rules for non-discrimination with which the church plans can live. I am optimistic that can be done, Mr. President. I believe that, as the Treasury Department reviews the situation faced by the church plans because of the way many of the interested denominations are organized, Treasury staff will conclude that it is practically impossible for many of the church plans to do the kind of data collection and analysis necessary to demonstrate compliance with the nondiscrimination rules. This is certainly not to say that these plans discriminate; but it is to say that Treasury should help work out a method to insure that such plans can more easily demonstrate that they do not.  I will conclude with just a word about the main pension simplification provisions in the bill, Mr. President. And that is to say that these simplification represent a major step forward. Their enactment should ultimately result in more pension plans being created, particularly by smaller businesses. Since it is that segment of the business community that has the greatest difficulty in offering pensions to their employees, enactment of these provisions should result in a major increase in pension coverage. Ultimately, that means more savings and more income for retirees. These simplification provisions have been on our congressional agenda for several years. It is high time they were enacted.
