Paul's Community Center. Ruth was a passionate advocate for the homeless, the impoverished, and for the welfare of the entire Toledo community. She first became involved with the center in 1975, when, as the outreach director for St. Paul's United Methodist Church, she took on the role of the center's first director. Although the job was initially supposed to have been temporary, Ruth's innate kindness, combined with the state of Ohio's decision to close mental hospitals, meant that her stay at the center turned out to be much longer than expected. Those discharged from the hospitals ``hovered into the doorways'' at the center, noted St. Paul's co-director Marcia Langenderfer, and in the face of such pressing need, Ruth simply could not turn people away.  Over the next 34 years, Ruth transformed St. Paul's from a small operation in a church basement into a $1.2 million organization that served 100,000 meals annually and supervised 12 transitional apartments as well as a 30-bed homeless shelter. ``I think she would have worked forever,'' Ms. Langenderfer said, adding that Ruth ``was very strong-willed and always determined to help this population.''  Yet Ruth's desire to make this world a better place was not limited to those whom she served at St. Paul's. An enthusiastic art lover, she participated in the Toledo Museum of Art's Children's Program and, from 2003 to 2007, served on the board of the Toledo Artists' Club. Additionally, Ruth belonged to the Rotary Club of Toledo and was on the board of the Coalition for Housing and Homelessness in Ohio from 1983 to 2003. In 1991, Inc. Magazine named her a finalist for the publication's prestigious Entrepreneur of the Year award.  I first met Ruth in 1983, and was floored by the way in which this remarkable woman seized every opportunity to remind others to be both grateful and kind. ``We would go to church,'' her daughter Kimberly Arden Chandler recalled, ``and on the way home, she would drive us through neighborhoods where people didn't have as much as we did and told us how lucky we were.'' It was a valuable lesson for Kimberly and her two siblings, and Ruth dedicated her life to teaching it to everyone she encountered. Yet she never asked for praise. She helped others not for her own self-satisfaction or for recognition from the community, but because it was simply the fair and noble thing to do. The size and success of St. Paul's Community Center is a shining testament to her perseverance, her zeal, and her overwhelming compassion. Ruth amazed me as a freshman Congresswoman, and her achievements continue to amaze me still. It is only right that she should now receive America's wholehearted gratitude and appreciation for her outstanding accomplishments and extraordinary life.  Ruth will be greatly missed in Toledo: she grew up there, raised her children there, and spent decades working to improve her hometown. A graduate of Waite High School, the University of Toledo, and Baldwin-Wallace College, Ruth was preceded in death by her son, Kris Kontak. We offer our heartfelt condolences to her daughters, Kimberly Arden Chandler and Karen Kontak; son, K. Reynold Kontak; seven grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; and her dear friend Jim Gottron.  I know that Ruth's family and friends are deeply comforted by the legacy she left behind and the memories they share. She helped so many people over the course of her rich and full life, and her efforts are ones for which all of us are profoundly grateful. May she be blessed with a restful peace, and may we always remember the life and good deeds of Ruth Arden.  Her achievements on behalf of our community benefited others too often forgotten in our technologically pigeonholed society. She painstakingly bestowed on our community a lasting endowment of vision and institutional capacity to serve the homeless and forgotten in the heart of Toledo. Indeed, Ruth gave this community heart. What was even more amazing was that she was of a position in life where this pursuit was not necessary to her existence. Her conscience and spiritual mission impacted thousands of people for the better. Her life stands as a bright star whose light points the path for those wise enough to follow its gleam.                          ____________________
