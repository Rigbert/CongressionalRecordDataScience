 President, today I wish to express my thanks and appreciation to John L. Martin for the excellent job he has done as director of San Francisco International Airport. After more than 30 years of public service, Mr. Martin will be retiring this summer.  John has served as airport director since November 1995 and has been with the airport since 1981. He was the founding president of the California Airports Council, a statewide consortium of 30 commercial airports that was formed in December 2009, and serves on the executive committee of the Bay Area Council, as well as the board of directors of San Francisco Travel. John also served as a past member of the board of directors and vice president of the Airports Council International-Pacific Region and was a former board member of ACI-North America.  During his tenure at SFO, the airport has undergone a truly impressive series of expansions and improvements. John oversaw one of the largest public works projects in the country at the time: the $2.4 billion SFO Master Plan, which included the construction of the new international terminal, a BART station linking the airport to the Bay Area, and the AirTrain light-rail system connecting all terminals.  Other more recent SFO accomplishments include a new terminal 2--the first and only LEED Gold terminal in the United States--and the completion of a new Federal Aviation Administration Air Traffic Control tower that was completely designed and built by airport staff.  Under his leadership, the airport is currently undertaking a $4.3 billion 10-year capital improvement plan, including a new four-star on-airport hotel, the redevelopment of terminal 1 and terminal 3, as well as an extension of the AirTrain system to the long-term parking garage. By the time the capital project is complete in 2023, it is anticipated that it will have created more than 36,000 jobs over the 10-year period.  John exemplifies excellence in public service. Under his guidance, San Francisco International Airport has truly flourished. I thank him for his tireless efforts on behalf of the city and county of San Francisco and the Bay Area region.  Again, I congratulate John Martin on a job well done and wish him a long and healthy retirement.                          ____________________
