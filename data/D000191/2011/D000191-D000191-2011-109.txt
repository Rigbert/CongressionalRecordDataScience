Speaker with gas prices exceeding $4 per gallon in much of the country, American families need real action, not meaningless gestures, to help deal with skyrocketing transportation costs. As gas prices continue to rise, people are increasingly turning to mass transit, yet high fuel prices coupled with cuts in local funding have forced nearly 60% of transit agencies nationwide to reduce service or raise fares in recent years. The Republican Budget for Fiscal Year 2012 would make matters worse by making significant cuts in transit funding which will result in more fare hikes, more service cuts, and more pain for American commuters and families.  In response, I am introducing the Providing Gas Price Relief Through Public Transportation Act of 2011 today. This legislation will provide support to struggling and increasingly overwhelmed transit agencies to allow them to maintain service and keep fares low. It ensures that people will have an affordable alternative to driving, and it helps those who need it most.  The bill authorizes $1.7 billion over two years of additional capital and operating funds for transit agencies to reduce fares and expand transit services. It would increase the Federal share for clean fuel and alternative fuel transit bus, ferry, or locomotive-related equipment and facilities from 90 percent to 100 percent. The bill would extend transit benefits to all Federal employees. And the bill would establish a two-year vanpool pilot program. Similar legislation was passed by the House in 2008 by a vote of 322-98.  I am pleased to have Representatives Hirono, Filner, Larsen, Nadler, Bishop, Boswell, Cummings, Richardson, Quigley, and Lipinski join me as original cosponsors of the bill. I am also pleased to have the support of a number of transit stakeholders including the American Public Transportation Association (AFTP), Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), Transportation for America, Association for Commuter Transportation, VPSI, Inc., and AVEGO.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.                          ____________________
