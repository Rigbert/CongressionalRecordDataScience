President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the Oman Free Trade Agreement.  International trade, if reached through the right paths, can confer tremendous benefits on all of its participants. Through this practice and agreements like this one, we have the opportunity not only to open up market access for American business but also to improve economic conditions for all participants.  Unfortunately, the Oman Free Trade Agreement fails to live up to that potential. This agreement does not provide for American business, while at the same time it fails workers both here, I believe, and potentially in Oman.  In 2001, the United States entered into a similar trade agreement with the country of Jordan. At that time, the agreement was heralded for its progressive labor standards. However, we have recently seen in Jordan instances of foreign workers forced into slave labor, stripped of their passports, denied their wages, and compelled to work for days without rest.
