 President, I wish to recognize two young pages who are actually on the floor with us today. Martin Charboneau and Mikhaila Fogel are the pages who energetically volunteered to stay until the Senate adjourns and actually have sacrificed some of their Christmas vacation. Also, they both volunteered their service over the weekend before the Thanksgiving break.  We typically have seven pages at a time on each of the sides, the Democratic side and the Republican side, but both Martin and Mikhaila marvelously have worked hard and dutifully, on both sides of the floor--both the Democratic side and the Republican side--to make a 14-person job work with just two people.  One can imagine how hard a task it must be for just two individuals to prepare for the numerous speeches we have had over the course of the past week. I know Senator Reid joins me in thanking them for their gracious and impeccable service to the Senate.
