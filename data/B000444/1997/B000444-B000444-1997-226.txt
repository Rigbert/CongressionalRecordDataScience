 President, on this amendment, of my 10 minutes, I will yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island. But prior to doing that, let me say briefly what this amendment does.  This amendment strikes a condition in the treaty that sets a verification standard that, if it were in the treaty, would not be able to be met; therefore, it would kill the treaty. I will not speak more at this time.  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.
