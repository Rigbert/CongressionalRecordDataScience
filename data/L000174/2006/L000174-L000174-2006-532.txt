President, Just south of Route 9 in southern Vermont, along a tree-lined road, lies one of Vermont's distinctive destinations, Marlboro College. Walk through this picturesque school in the summer months and you will hear some of the sweetest melodies imaginable, or you may be enveloped by warm pulses of sound that seem to linger like the wispy clouds above. The sounds you hear are those of another year of the Marlboro Music Festival.  Since its founding in 1951, this 8-week festival--one of the world's premiere chamber music workshops and weekend concert series--brings some of the most renowned and experienced musicians together with the rising stars of tomorrow.  This year has marked the 40th anniversary of the Musicians From Marlboro, the festival's active touring program which sends the musicians on the road to perform periodically across the country. At some of the Nation's premier venues, including historic places like the Freer Gallery in Washington and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the concerts feature the exceptional music heard first in the Marlboro Music Festival.  As this remarkable event approaches again this year, spanning the gorgeous Vermont months of June through August, it is fitting to pause to note the accomplishments of the Musicians From Marlboro and the entire Marlboro Music Festival. For four decades, the festival's touring group has brought their music to every corner of the United States. For four decades, the musicians have set a model of artistic excellence that has inspired other musicians and artists and their audiences. This band of musicians--outwardly casual but hard-driven in their pursuit of beauty and truth in their art--has moved thousands of concert-goers.  The touring group has featured such superb musicians as Rudolph Serkin, Richard Goode, Benita Velente, and Murray Perahia. Performers who went on to make up such noted ensembles as the Guarneri and Emerson String Quartets have received critical early boosts from the Marlboro experience of intensive summers and the tours. Their alumni can be found in many leading orchestras, from the Philadelphia Orchestra to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  There is certainly something about Vermont and the Green Mountains that helps inspire the ensemble. Whatever the inspiration, the Musicians From Marlboro are a superb reflection of the best Vermont has to offer.  Vermont is a richer place because of the Marlboro Music Festival, and the festival and its musicians have touched innumerable audiences across the country with their artistry. I know my colleagues join me in congratulating the Marlboro Music Festival and its Musicians From Marlboro on this great achievement of 40 years of touring and in wishing the festival many more happy and sonorous decades to come.                          ____________________[Page S4551]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        MARLBORO MUSIC FESTIVAL
