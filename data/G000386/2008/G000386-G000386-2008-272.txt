 President, today I support this resolution to honor the service and leadership of Iowa State University. I am cosponsoring this resolution because I know firsthand the substantial contributions that Iowa State has made to both Iowa and the Nation as a whole. In fact, as one of the first land-grant universities, it has led the way in technology advancement and outreach.  Iowa State University will celebrate 150 years of service to the United States this month. The university is a leader in agricultural, engineering, and computer science technologies. They have been pioneers in the education of minorities and women. Because of these advancements, Iowa State University is recognized throughout the world as a standard for excellence in education, practical research, and outreach through extension.  Iowa State is a great representative for the people of our State and will continue to leave an important legacy for our Nation. It is with great respect that I introduce this resolution in honor of Iowa State University's 150th year anniversary.
