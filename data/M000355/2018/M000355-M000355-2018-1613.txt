 President, I thank my friend from Oregon. I think this is a great project we can work on together.  During the recent break, I met with a lot of farmers in Kentucky. Since farmers demographically tend to be older in most of our States, I thought it was particularly noteworthy that there were a lot of young, enthusiastic farmers, including research people from the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, with genuine enthusiasm about what this could mean to help reinvigorate a rural economy in Kentucky that is not what it used to be when we had tobacco as our No. 1 cash crop. That has faded, and it should have, given the health implications of it.  This is an opportunity for us to do something together, to do something important for rural America, and I look forward to working with my friend and colleague to achieve success.
