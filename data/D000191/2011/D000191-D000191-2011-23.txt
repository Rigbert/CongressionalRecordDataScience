Now, it's true that Majority Leader Cantor kicked off the week by saying, Not a penny for infrastructure. We don't want to just build things in America. We don't want to invest. That doesn't put people to work. You know, the $50 billion the President proposed, that would create about 1.5 million private sector jobs in the construction industry, but they're not interested in that.  They do have a jobs plan: snakes. Yes, snakes. Yesterday, in the Oversight Committee, they held a hearing similar to what we're talking about here today on a job-killing regulation being proposed by the Obama administration. Keep out invasive species. Giant pythons, which are taking over the Everglades, the Republicans say that is a job-killing restriction. Just think of all the jobs related to snakes. First, there's the importer of these invasive species. Secondly, we sell them. Then there are people who raise things for them to eat.
