We are really going to miss him. We are going to miss all four who are not going to be back with us.  Joe is my neighbor in the State of Indiana. There is hardly a meeting ofDemocratic Senators where you don't hear some laughter and look at the center of the meeting and see that it is Joe Donnelly. He makes us all feel good about who we are and what we do, even when some of these assignments we receive are pretty tough.  I want to join Chuck Schumer in saying thanks to Joe Donnelly for serving Indiana and for being such a great colleague during these last 6 years. We will miss him.
