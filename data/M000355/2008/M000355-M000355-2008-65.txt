 President, I would like to speak briefly about a special group of Kentuckians who visited our Nation's capitol last month. In August, 39 World War II veterans from the Commonwealth visited the memorial which they inspired on the National Mall. These heroes were able to make this trip because of the Honor Flight Program, a nonprofit organization which transports surviving World War II veterans from around the country to see their memorial free of charge. Because Congress was out of session during their visit, I was back home in Kentucky. As a result, I was unable to participate in this Honor Flight event as I have in others before it. However, I hope to have the opportunity to meet more of these inspirational veterans on future Bluegrass Honor Flight trips.  The World War II Memorial was dedicated in 2004, nearly 60 years after our troops returned home. It sits, appropriately, between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial--reflecting the same principles of courage and valor that were embodied by these two great Presidents. The legacy of the World War II veterans who defended those principles from enemies of freedom is not only preserved by this memorial, but it is honored each day in the sacrifices of American troops who continue to do the same for our Nation in the war on terror.  As Americans, we are forever indebted to the brave men and women of the United States military who defend this great Nation. The veterans of World War II made tremendous sacrifices so that we could continue to live in prosperity and freedom and for that they are more than deserving of their title as the ``greatest generation.''  I would ask that my colleagues join me in honoring these Kentucky veterans:                         World War II Veterans       Henry Alford; Salvator Amato; Fairel Bailey; Harlan Barton;      Woodrow Bryant; Wilbur Cannon; Charles Carveth; Clarence Cox;      Richard Dolan; Luther Drury; Francis Fleck; John Frantz;      William Glye; Sam Goldstein; Eugene Haag; James Harrison;      James Hunt; Paul Jones; James Lenihan; William Lippy.
