Mr. Chairman, speaking to my point of order, this amendment constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2(c) of rule XXI because it will impose substantial new duties on the Secretary of Agriculture. Under Deschler's Precedents, volume 8, chapter 26, section 50, where an amendment seeks to impose on a Federal official substantial duties that are different from or in addition to those already contemplated in law, then it is considered legislative in nature and violates clause 2(c) of rule XXI.  Moreover, under Deschler's Precedents, volume 8, chapter 26, section 52, even though a limitation or exception therefrom might refrain from explicitly assigning new duties to officers of the government, if it implicitly requires them to make investigations, compile evidence or make judgments or determinations not otherwise required of them by law, then it assumes the character of legislation and is subject to a point of order under clause 2(c) of rule XXI.  This amendment will require the Secretary of Agriculture to make investigations and compile evidence not otherwise required under existing law, as well as make a substantive determination not required by any law applicable to his authority. See 8 Deschler's Precedents, chapter 26, section 52.38.  The amendment bars planning and studying of certain roads, those used for timber harvesting by individuals or private entities in the Tongass National Forest. Roads used for other purposes and by other entities are not affected. In addition, the amendment bars the use of funds to ``construct'' such a road. Under volume 23 of the U.S. Code, section 101(a)(c), ``construction'' is defined to include reconstruction of roads. This definition is reflected in the Forest Service budget, which differentiates between construction/reconstruction of roads and maintenance of roads. This is also reflected in the road provisions affecting all roads, including those in the Tongass National Forest. I cite pages 7-36, 7-33 and 4-115, ``Road and Bridge Construction/Reconstruction,'' of the draft proposed Tongass Forest Plan relating to roads to reflect this understanding. Therefore, this amendment will apply to not only proposed roads but also to the 3,653 miles of permanent roads already in the Tongass National Forest. Some of these roads are not currently used for timber harvesting but could be in the future.  Under the National Forests Roads and Trails Act (16 U.S.C. 532-538), the U.S. Forest Service constructs forest development roads ``within and near'' national forests that ``will permit maximum economy in harvesting timber from such lands tributary to such roads and at the same time meet the requirements for protection, development and management thereof, and for the utilization of the other resources thereof.''  Under the current Forest Service Transportation Planning Handbook and the Tongass Forest Plan, the Secretary does not identify or track roads by the character of their use nor is such a determination required for reconstruction of existing roads. A road in a national forest may have multiple purposes, including recreation access, subsistence hunting access, vehicle use for emergencies, travel routes, utility maintenance or egress to Forest Service ranger stations or other structures.  Moreover, a road could be used for timbering operations by multiple participants, including the Forest Service itself, the State of Alaska, local governments, mining corporations with mining permits, private contractors or Native Alaskan tribal entities. According to the Forest Service, these landowners take between 80 million and 100 million board feet of timber from their lands in a year.                              {time}  2000  Some of these users would not be barred by the Chabot amendment. No current law requires the Secretary to differentiate between users of Forest Service roads. In support of this assertion, I quote from a recent letter from Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment: ``Because the Forest Service does not distinguish roads on the basis of who uses them, implementation of the proposed Chabot amendment on the Tongass National Forest would require new processes, policies and additional work to ensure that, if the Forest Service is spending funding on roads, such roads are not utilized by individuals or private entities in support of harvesting timber on Federal or nonFederal lands.''  Under the terms of the amendment, the Forest Service would have to make an initial determination that the road proposed for construction or reconstruction would not be used for impermissible uses by impermissible people. For existing roads proposed for reconstruction, this would mean first monitoring the road to see how it is used and by whom over some period of time.  In addition, the Secretary would also have to monitor and enforce compliance with the limitation after the road is built or reconstructed. Enforcing this restriction would be burdensome. The Tongass National Forest, and the Nation's largest public forest, is 16.7 million acres, approximately the size of the State of West Virginia. It is comprised of scattered lands located along the mountains of Alaska's southeastern coast, and portions are remote and difficult to get to.  Within the forest are approximately 128,000 acres of State, Alaska Native Corporation and private land are accessed only through the Tongass National Forest roads. According to the Forest Service, 3,653 miles of permanent miles of roads have been constructed in the Forest, and these roads are used for travel, forest management, recreation, subsistence access, remote community connections, as well as the timber harvest.  Only 570 Forest Service personnel are assigned to the forest, one employee for every 45,000 acres. The majority of these employees do office work and are not out in the field, so the Secretary would have to make substantial hires and reassign these personnel to patrol roads. I cite eight Deschler's Precedents, Chapter 26, section 52.22 regarding the imposition of duty to monitor actions of recipients as transforming a limitation amendment into legislation.  For those reasons, I ask you to sustain my point of order.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order?
