Mr. Speaker, this motion is an attempt to obstruct an effort to redress some of the most abject poverty and living conditions of people living in rural Alaska. The motion makes no sense whatsoever, unless proponents are contending the federal government has no role to play in fostering public works projects and iniatives to improve the life of our rural areas.  Many communities in Alaska, most of which are Native villages, do not have public works projects such as those taken for granted by most communities in other states. The proposed commission will complement Alaska's ongoing work to alleviate the nearly Third World conditions brought on by the absence of basic infrastructure, such as modern water and sewage treatment or safe and environmentally sound bulk fuel storage.  Because of the magnitude of the problem--unsafe water, lack of modern sewage treatment, infant mortality, alcoholism, suicide, lack of job opportunity--a commission chartered by Congress will advance efforts to grant a shimmer of hope to those who know only hopelessness in these rural areas.  Let me offer just one example of why the Denali Commission is necessary. Forty percent of rural Alaska lacks flush toilets. Residents of these areas literally haul raw human waste in honeybuckets and dump them in a community lagoon sometimes leading to outbreaks of viral minengitis. Americans should not be living in these conditions in this day and age.  These problems have not been ignored by any stretch of the imagination: Congress and the State of Alaska have been cooperating for several years to devote resources to correcting these problems. However, these efforts have the effect of a ``scattershot'' approach to solving a $1 billion problem. The Denali Commission is a single entity that can bring a unified direction and approach needed for some of the poorest areas of the country.  There has been a lot of talk on the Floor about how generous the government has been to Alaska. In fact, it has not been very generous. Many of the funds Alaska receives are in defense programs, which serve a national as opposed to parochial purpose. It must also be recalled that when Alaska was made a statehood, it had to forego the benefit of reclamation projects such as those found in the lower 48. In addition, the federal government owns and controls two-thirds of Alaska's lands, but has awfully slow to show rural Alaskans any benefit this had brought them.  For these reasons, the Denali Commission is justified, necessary, and vital to the well-being of Alaska's rural people.                          ____________________
