Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and want to thank all the members of the committee and also particularly the ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the chairman, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), the subcommittee chairman, for the effort they and all our staff have put into this bill.  This is a good piece of work. It is a potential foundation for the second 100 years of the aviation industry in this country, an industry that contributes well in excess of 10 percent to our gross domestic product on an annual basis. It will begin to anticipate and invest in meeting the needs of the future.  There are a lot of folks that have seen the fall-off in air traffic, and they have forgotten the delays of 2 years ago and the capacity constraints of 2 years ago. But I have not and the members of the committee have not. It is going to require more investment, and there is significant investment in this bill over and above what was requested by the administration to begin to meet those capacity needs, in partnership with local communities and local airport authorities.  It also does include some environmental streamlining provisions which will not do violence to the National Environmental Policy Act, but will help move some of the bureaucratic impediments and sequential referrals and things that have gone on that have delayed unnecessarily projects that ultimately were found to have merit and to meet the environmental constraints and laws of the United States. We need to move some of these projects ahead more quickly, and this, I believe, will help facilitate that.  I am particularly happy with the air service section of the bill.                              {time}  1400  I represent what has become an underserved community because of the dominance of one major carrier who has chosen, despite the profitability of that market, to divest itself of service and substitute a substandard so-called express service.  There are many of us across the Midwest and the western United States and even in the East struggling with these sorts of issues. There are many communities that have no service whatsoever. So the improvements we are making in the essential air service authorization here are essential. The new pilot program that would allow other than the traditional essential air service program, which can sometimes be kind of lame, is to be undertaken by the Secretary. And, finally, the new section which I think is going to be the great benefit to airports like mine and other airports across the country that have seen a diminution in service is the Small Community Air Service Development program, which would, with language we have put in the bill, require and give preference to communities that are willing to partner with the government in terms of a contribution and also can demonstrate the potential sustainability of their plan. Not just a potential pilot program which essentially becomes another name for an EAS program, but something to encourage innovation, to attract in new carriers that could provide a permanent presence and a new competition and improvement in service to those communities. There are many of us that desire to facilitate that.  Also, being a west coast Member, the issue of Washington National Airport and the sort of outmoded restrictions we see there is also accommodated to some extent in the bill.  Flight attendants will get at least some small recognition for the vital service they provide the traveling public on a daily basis, where they are going to get a certificate when they have completed their training, which hopefully with the uncertainties in the industry, the bankruptcies and the layoffs, will give them some portability and viability perhaps to move to new jobs if they lose theirs or there are other problems.  We begin to anticipate the huge looming retirement of air traffic controllers with this bill and to require or authorize the hiring of replacements who have quite a long training window, and we need to move ahead with that so we do not have a crisis.  The cabin air-quality hearings which we had last week revealed that we are basically not monitoring cabin air quality; and where we do not monitor, we do not have a problem. But the few monitoring samples that have been done do show problems, and we are going to require studies that were called for by the National Academy of Sciences to be undertaken by the FAA.  Finally, the air traffic control system, there is no more successful model in the world of an efficient, well-operating, privatized air traffic control system. Those that do exist have had to be dramatically subsidized, reinvested in by the governments that went down that route. And when I recently met with the Chair of the committee of jurisdiction from the Parliament, she said, Do not go there. Look at the mistakes we made in Great Britain. And I am pleased to see the provisions in the bill that relate to that. All in all, Flight 100 is a great foundation over the next 4 years for the next 100 years of flight in the United States.
