Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to raise a question.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentleman--he has stated they are authorized. On this side, there is some confusion. Have these gone through a study and then the chief has submitted a report to us? Is that what we are doing is ratifying a Chief's Report, which is the process to be followed in this bill so as not to have earmarks? Or are these at an earlier stage, where they haven't had a Chief's Report, and, therefore, we are now about to authorize projects that are specific without following the procedures that everyone else has had to go through?  I understand what has happened is a tragedy there, but there are other places where there have been floods and other people might want to say: Well, gee, we don't have a report yet either, but we want to authorize something right now.  Can the gentleman tell me, do we have the Chief's Report, or is what has been authorized just a study which isn't yet completed?
