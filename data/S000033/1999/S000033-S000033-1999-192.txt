 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from my home State of Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert this statement in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of this young person will benefit my colleagues.                              [June, 1999]                    Regarding: The War in Yugoslavia           (On behalf of: Brendan Hurlbut and Anthony Blair)       Anthony Blair: American involvement in the war in      Yugoslavia is morally defensible on one level: It is the      right thing to do to stop atrocities. But are there not other      options for America than to conduct a war against Yugoslavia      in which many innocent civilians and American soldiers may be      killed? Is it America's duty to be a police force all around      the world, even when an action is morally right? Do we want      America to be playing the role of international policeman all      over the world?       Many reasons have been put forward as to why the United      States should avoid being the world's police force in Kosovo.      There are reasons, such as the cost. We are spending tens of      million of dollars a day. The United States is carrying out      about 90 percent of the bombings, while our other allies      should be carrying a heavier load than they are carrying      right now. Numbers of civilians are being killed by misguided      cruise missiles, hitting large groups of innocent people      instead of their targeted locations.       Brendan Hurlbut: The U.S. has few strategic or economic      interests in Yugoslavia.       And are we really willing to damage our long-term relations      with Russia over this issue? Communist and Russian      nationalist groups are gaining support for their anti-     American message due to this war. Hostile anti-American      groups may be aided in their efforts to gain control of      Russia due to this war. The threat of force did not stop      Milosevic. In fact, some say it has strengthened his position      among the patriotic people of Serbia.       Morally, our actions in Yugoslavia are right, but are they      in the best interests of our country, and are we not in a way      also committing atrocities against innocent people? Can't the      U.S. find other ways to stop Milosevic? Obviously, the      bombings have not worked. The U.S. could declare Milosevic a      war criminal and pay $1 billion to whoever captures him. The      captors could be also granted citizenship in any one of the      NATO countries. This would save lives, money, and maybe a      country from poverty.       Current U.S. policy is not consistent. We respond to      atrocities in one nation, such as Yugoslavia, but ignore      atrocities in other regions, such as Ruwanda. If the U.S. now      takes the role of worldwide policeman, the U.S. will have to      respond to every tribal or ethnic war worldwide. Do we really      want the U.S. to be like a puppet on a string that must      respond to every problem around the world?                              [June, 1999]                           Regarding: Tobacco(On behalf of: Andy Tyson, Carey Levine, Zach Pratt, Tina Reed and Doug                                  Lane)       Carey Levine: People who smoke are at increased risk of      heart disease, cancer, emphysema and other smoking-related      illnesses that contribute to over 420,000 deaths per year.      These people dying from cigarettes are our mothers, fathers,      aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, colleagues, peers, and      friends. Smoking is no longer just a problem, it is an      epidemic that is expanding nationally and globally.       Zach Pratt: In the wake of the recent landmark tobacco      settlement, which awarded $206 billion over the course of the      next 25 years to fund programs aimed at aiding smoking      victims, debate regarding the most appropriate use of the      funds has been fierce. The current proposals very drastically      by state.       According to a recent USA Today poll, popular opinion      favors utilizing the appropriated money in an effort to      improve public health care systems. Most Americans believe      that the tobacco cash should be returned to those most      affected by smoking and not split towards expanding health      coverage for impoverished or uninsured families. The same      poll reports that 27 percent of Americans would like to see      the money spent on antismoking education. However, many      governors would prefer to see the funds utilized in existing      state education programs, feeling that the development of new      programs would raise state expenditures to dangerous levels.       Doug Lane: I believe that the money would best be spent in      educational programs. The risk of getting addicted to      nicotine are reduced through a national educational program      targeting preteenagers, and highlighting the negative effects      of smoking. The money the government has obtained through      cigarette taxes and lawsuits of tobacco companies should be      used for preventative measures, to stop this addiction before      it starts.       Recently, President Clinton has publicly announced that he      is making it part of his agenda to reduce the amount of      teenage smoking that goes on in America.       Tina Reed: The ``Stop Teenage Addiction to Tobacco'' on      Oklahoma's Teenage Facts sheets states that, every day, 3,000      teens smoke their first cigarette, and approximately one-     third of these children will eventually die due to smoking-     related illness. These are serious enough statistics that      they demand a more intensive and proactive stance from      schools to encourage students not to smoke.       The new program would take a fresh new approach in      informing students about the negative effects of smoking,      through hands-on projects such as seeing a healthy lung      compared to a smoker's lung, science projects breaking down      the actual contents of the cigarette, and guest speakers.      Through these types of activities, students will see the      devastating effects of smoking     by guest speakers that have lived to regret ever taking a      puff of a cigarette, and touching a lung that is black and      distorted due to smoking.       Andy Tyson: There are many possibilities as to where the      tobacco money can be spent. The money could help everything,      from preventative measures to improving health and funding      education. The truth is, all of these are worthwhile causes.      The only thing that we must be especially careful of is the      possibility of spreading the money too thin. Wherever this      money goes, there must be enough of it to make a difference.      Smoking should stop, and this is our opportunity to do so.       Congressman Sanders: Good job.
