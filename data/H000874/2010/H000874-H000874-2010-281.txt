Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                              H. Res. 998       Resolved, That a committee of two Members be appointed by      the Speaker on the part of the House of Representatives to      join with a committee on the part of the Senate to notify the      President of the United States when a quorum of each House      has assembled and Congress is ready to receive any      communication that he may be pleased to make.  The resolution was agreed to.  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                          ____________________
