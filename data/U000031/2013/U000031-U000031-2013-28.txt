Speaker, at this point, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican whip.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the chairman for his work in keeping his pledge of bringing this bill to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3350, the Keep Your Health Plan Act.  From the start, ObamaCare has been a disaster.  First, the individual mandate was a bad idea before and is even more dangerous now because it is forcing people to choose health care they do not want, cannot afford, and isn't right for themselves and their families.  Second, the President's credibility continues to crumble as independent news sources have confirmed that he intentionally broke his promise to every American about whether they can keep his insurance under this law.  We will continue to see the shock waves of ObamaCare. Today, it is the fact that Americans cannot keep their coverage. Tomorrow, it will be the staggering and unexpected cost. Next month, it will be about losing access to their doctors, and the list continues. No administrative fix will undo the harm this law has caused.  Republicans believe that we must try and help Americans who have been harmed by ObamaCare. That is why, today, we will pass a bill to allow Americans to continue to enroll in plans currently offered without facing the individual mandate penalty. What the American people and our constituents need is certainty. The only approach that begins to provide them certainty is the bill before us today.  Our bill allows Americans a choice. It lets individuals keep their health care plans while giving others who currently are uninsured an escape hatch from ObamaCare. Our bill will allow individuals, whether one is a mother of a sick child, a small business owner, or a young, invincible adult, to keep their current plans. The National Federation of Independent Business and senior groups, such as 60 Plus, are urging Congress to fulfill its duty and pass this bill.  I urge my Democratic friends to join with us. Many of them voted for this bill. They stated they had an intent that Americans could keep their plans. Today is their opportunity to keep that pledge.                              {time}  1145
