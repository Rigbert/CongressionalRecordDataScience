Speaker, these people want to unbalance it and delist the entire lower 48. They want to defy good science. And, oh, by the way, what they are doing is so indefensible, but, well, we can't go to court because, actually, we are not following the law.  So this bill does a number of things that are really short-term bad.  By the way, it is going nowhere in the Senate. We are hearing messaging today that we could be doing a farm bill, and we could be doing affordable college education. There are a lot of things we could do--a budget for the United States Government. But, no, we are here on a talking point for a few idiots.
