 President, democracy; that is, government of the people, by the people and for the people, does not thrive or even survive unless we have a well-informed and well-educated public who are thinking about, discussing and debating the important issues facing our country.  In order to stimulate that goal, I have, for the last 2 years, sponsored an essay-contest asking Vermont's high school students what they think the United States should be doing to address the major problems we face as a nation. In other words, while tonight we hear the President's views about the State of the Union, the essays these students wrote reflect Vermont students' views about the State of the Union.  I am delighted that 308 students, from 30 different schools throughout Vermont, thought about these challenges as they wrote their own State of the Union essay. And I want to thank each and every one of them for their participation in the contest and the time and effort they put into it. I also want to thank the five teachers who acted as judges for these contests. They are Brian Burgess of Hazen Union High School; Liz Lebrun of Poultney High School, Lois Little of Canaan Memorial High School; Joe Maley of South Burlington High School and Terri Vest of Twinfield Union High School.  The winner, selected by a panel of five Vermont teachers, is Jennifer Sikorski, a senior at Winooski High School. In addition to Jennifer, 18 students were named as finalists. The four runners-up were: Monica Allard, Milton High School; Kayleigh Ehler-Vock, South Burlington High School; Kate Raszka, Champlain Valley Union High School; Karolina Sowulewska, Burr and Burton Academy.  Because of the excellent quality of the essays, we also honored 14 other students with an honorable mention.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the winning essay be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Jennifer Sikorski, Winookski High School (Winner)                           [January 23, 2012]       Ever since the Declaration of Independence was signed, the      United States has constantly paved the way to peace and      prosperity both for itself and the rest of the world.      However, as the world economy rapidly disintegrates, new      issues have emerged, from unemployment to the environment to      gay rights, and in the midst of it all, America stands still,      seemingly oblivious to the fact that its future is crumbling      in front of it. It is time to pave the way to prosperity once      again through these issues in order to ensure that someday we      can thrive again.       Perhaps the biggest problem we face as a nation is      unemployment. As of 2011, 8.5 percent of people in the U.S.--     over 26 million Americans--are jobless. While it may seem as      if putting such a large amount of people to work cannot      happen, there is a chance that it can be done. As      unemployment has been rising, the condition of our      environment has been deteriorating due to deforestation and      the emissions of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide given      off by the use of fossil fuels. Renewable energy such as      solar and wind power, on the other hand, has remained a topic      of interest, yet it is still somehow largely unavailable to      the public. However, the environment can be preserved, if not      improved, by phasing out fossil fuels in favor of solar and      wind energy, while millions of Americans can return to work      to plant trees to restore our forests and to build,      distribute, and repair solar panels, wind turbines, and other      renewable energy products. We are actually lucky in a way to      have to face both of these issues at once, as they can both      be improved simultaneously.       America has also had a long-standing tradition of leading      the way in human rights,     with such important movements such as women's suffrage and      civil rights abolishing discrimination based on gender and      race. There is no reason why this tradition should not      continue with gay rights as well. Currently, only seven      states in the entire country allow same-sex marriage, and I      am proud to live in one of the few states that has begun to      lead the way. I have many friends and relatives that consider      themselves gay or bisexual and are actively involved in the      LGBT community, and I have witnessed their struggles as they      have realized that many are intolerant of their lifestyles.      The entire country should follow Vermont's example and      legalize same-sex marriage to continue to encourage not only      the rights of certain groups of people, but the rights of      everyone.       In conclusion, the challenges that we face with      unemployment, the environment, and gay rights are just some      of the challenges that, when dealt with appropriately, will      make our country stronger and greater than before. Though our      current situation looks bleak, we can always work towards      goals such as these that will help make America and the world      a better place.
