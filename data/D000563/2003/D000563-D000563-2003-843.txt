President, today I rise before the Senate in support of a Senate Resolution submitted today by my colleague Senator Specter. This resolution designates March 25 of this year as ``Greek Independence Day: A day of celebration for Greek and American democracy.''  The people of ancient Greece made important, lasting contributions to humanity in the fields of literature, philosophy, mathematics, and the physical sciences. The greatest part of their legacy, though, is a simple yet powerful idea that was born over 2,000 years ago. It is the idea that citizens should possess the power to determine the course of their Nation.  The bonds that join the United States and Greece are deep and long lasting. In 1821, Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis said to the citizens of the United States: ``it is in your land that liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we succeed in resembling you.'' Since modern Greece's struggle for independence 182 years ago, our countries have stood to together as allies and friends. We have peacefully worked together in every major international conflict.  Today, Greece continues to embrace the ideals of freedom, democracy, and peace. The past few years have witnessed hopeful new steps toward the resolution of a number of the world's longstanding conflicts and animosities. With its strategic location at the nexus of Europe, Asia and Africa, Greece has been a key participant in many of these efforts. In particular, it has played a pivotal role in promoting democratization, economic development and, above all, peace in the Balkans.  In honoring Greek Independence Day, we pay special tribute to those Greek men and women who gave their lives for the common cause of freedom. Greek-Americans can especially take pride in their ancestors' sacrifice. The many Greek sons and daughters who have come to the United States have worked honorably in all areas of American life, including public service. Greek culture flourishes in American cities, adding to our country's rich diversity.  It is with great honor that I join my colleagues in recognizing this anniversary of Greek independence. Our two great nations have fought to maintain freedom and established democracy throughout the world. In designating March 25 of this year as ``Greek Independence Day'', we celebrate the freedom that these two great nations represent.  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to my colleagues about this important date.                          ____________________
