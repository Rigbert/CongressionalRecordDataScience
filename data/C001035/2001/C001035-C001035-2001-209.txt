President, the concerns and needs of small businesses have always been a priority for me. When I talk to small business owners throughout the State of Maine, I hear over and over again that they have two major problems: One is the high cost of health insurance. I will be introducing legislation shortly to try to help small businesses cope with that issue. The second issue is the need for more capital to finance their enterprises.  Today, I rise to introduce the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, a bill intended to stimulate private investment in the entrepreneurs who drive our economy. I am pleased to be joined today by my good friends and staunch supporters of small business, Senators Cleland, Breaux, Landrieu, Allard, Chafee, Lieberman, Hutchinson, and Hatch.  The bill we introduce today will encourage long-term investment in small and emerging businesses by providing incentives to individuals who risk investment in such firms. According to the Small Business Administration, small firms account for three-quarters of our Nation's employment growth and almost all of our net new jobs. At the same time, small businesses face unique financing challenges. Simply put, entrepreneurs need access to more capital to start and to expand their businesses. As the SBA noted last year, ``Adequate financing for rapidly growing firms will be America's greatest economic policy challenge of the new century.''  Just a few months ago, it would have been difficult for us to imagine that a capital gap could exist in an economy that had experienced such an unprecedented run of prosperity. Venture capital investments in emerging firms reached a record $103 billion last year, up 74 percent from the year before. Yet, there are signs that the rush of funds is subsiding. Venture capital investment activity decreased by 31 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and much of the funds that have been raised remains uninvested.  More important, venture capital funds tend to gravitate towards certain types of businesses and geographic regions, and tend to be invested in increasingly larger amounts, leaving many small business entrepreneurs frozen out of the capital markets. Internet-related companies attracted 76 percent of the venture capital invested in the first three quarters of 2000. And more than two-thirds of all the venture capital invested in the United States in 1999 went to just five States. Moreover, the average amount of venture capital invested in small businesses increased from $6.6 million in 1998 to $13.3 million in 1999, prompting the SBA to conclude that the needs of many small businesses for equity financing remain unmet.  The data paint a troubling picture. It is, unfortunately, a familiar one. Take the example of Vladimir Koulchin, a Russian by birth but a Mainer in heart and spirit. Vladimir holds a doctorate in biochemistry and has 25 years of research experience in the field. Six years ago, Mr. Koulchin moved to Portland, ME, to work for a biotechnology firm where he became vice president for research and development. This past fall, with no funding other than his own, he founded Chemogen with the goal of developing products to diagnose, treat, and prevent tuberculosis and other dangerous infectious diseases in humans and animals. Mr. Koulchin told me how difficult it has been to find the seed and early stage capital he needs to get his promising business off the ground. He spoke of the relative lack of seed capital in small markets and the welcome assistance that strong Federal tax incentives could provide.  Vladimir's experiences are all-too-common. A recent report by the National Commission on Entrepreneurship presented findings of 18 focus groups with more than 250 entrepreneurs across the country. According to the report, the focus groups were ``nearly unanimous in identifying difficulties in obtaining seed capital investments.''  And although the capital gap is pervasive, it disproportionately harms women- and minority-owned businesses. The Milken Institute, an independent economic think tank, concluded in a research report issued last year that, ``While minority businesses are growing faster than majority firms in number and revenue, they remain severely constrained by a lack of access to capital.'' Moreover, women receive only 12 percent of all credit provided to small businesses in the U.S. despite owning nearly 40 percent of the businesses.  If we want to remain the world's most entrepreneurial country, where small businesses generate the ideas and create the jobs that fuel our economy, we must continue to create an environment that nurtures and supports entrepreneurs.  The legislation we are introducing helps to create a supportive environment, not by establishing an expensive,new Federal program, or adding a complicated new section to our Tax Code, but rather by simplifying and improving a provision that is already there. The provision, known as section 1202, was added to the Internal Revenue Code in 1993 with strong bipartisan support.  Section 1202 allows investors to exclude from taxable income 50 percent of the gain from the sale of qualified small business stock when the stock is held for at least 5 years. Now, that concept is a sound one, but unfortunately, section 1202 prescribes a complicated set of requirements, and its attractiveness has been diminished due to the fact that when capital gains rates were lowered in 1997, the section 1202 rate remained the same. In addition, the increasing application of the alternative minimum tax has reduced its value. Indeed, early data on the use of section 1202 suggests that the alternative minimum tax has sharply limited its effectiveness.  Our bill restores section 1202 to its original role as a potent engine of small business capital formation. Our legislation simplifies section 1202, enhances its incentives, and eliminates the threat that gains on small business stock will be subject to the alternative minimum tax. In short, our bill makes a number of commonsense changes designed to encourage investment in small business.  The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act is supported by the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Women's Business Council, the National Commission On Entrepreneurship, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Biotechnology Association Of Maine.  Our legislation would implement changes recommended by a recent Securities and Exchange Commission forum on small business capital formation. In sum, our legislation would accommodate the capital-raising needs of small business, the foundation of our economy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act                       Section-by-Section Summary                            I. Introduction       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act is      intended to stimulate private investment in the entrepreneurs      who drive our economy. The Act will encourage long-term      investment in small and emerging businesses by providing      incentives to investors who risk investment in such firms.      According to the Small Business Administration, small firms      account for three-quarters of our nation's employment growth      and almost all of our net new jobs. Small businesses employ      52 percent of all private workers, provide 51 percent of our      private sector output, and are responsible for a      disproportionate share of innovations. Moreover, small      businesses are avenues of opportunity for women and      minorities, young and elderly workers, and those formerly on      public assistance. Yet entrepreneurs need access to more      capital to start and expand their businesses.       In 1993, Section 1202 was added to the Internal Revenue      Code in order to encourage investment in small businesses. In      brief, Section 1202 permits non-corporate taxpayers to      exclude from gross income 50% of the gain from the sale or      exchange of qualified small business (``QSB'') stock held for      more than five years. The concept is a sound one. However, in      practice, Section 1202 has proven to be cumbersome to use and      less advantageous than originally intended. As an article in      the December 1998 edition of the Tax Adviser noted, ``Sec.      1202 places numerous and complex requirements on both the QSB      and the shareholder,'' and that the provision ``is no longer      the deal it seemed to be.''       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act would      amend Section 1202 to eliminate unnecessary complexity and to      make it a more robust engine of capital formation for small      businesses. As it now stands, the engine needs work. Given      (1) reductions in capital gains rates subsequent to Section      1202's enactment and (2) the fact that more taxpayers are now      subject to the Alternative Minimum tax, Section 1202 is no      longer a viable option in many circumstances it was      originally intended to address. Moreover, Section 1202's      impact will continue to be diluted by a scheduled decrease in      long-term capital gains rates applicable to stock purchased      after 2000 and the probability that still more taxpayers will      be subject to the AMT. To understand the changes the Act      would make, it is first necessary to understand how 1202      currently works.       As noted, Section 1202 imposes numerous restrictions on a      business that seeks to qualify under its provisions. To be a      QSB, a business must be a domestic C corporation with      aggregate gross assets of no greater than $50 million at any      time prior to or immediately after issuing stock. Certain      types of businesses are excluded from QSB status, including      banking, insurance, investing, consulting, law, accounting,      financial services, and farming concerns as well as hotels      and restaurants. Any trade or business that relies on the      reputation or skill of one or more of its employees as its      principal asset also cannot be a QSB.       QSB's must also satisfy an ``active business'' requirement.      This means that, during substantially all of the time the      taxpayer holds the stock, at least 80 percent of the QSB's      gross assets must be used by the corporation in the active      conduct of the qualified trade or business. Assets used in      certain start-up activities or for research, or which are      held as ``reasonably required'' working capital are deemed to      be used in the active conduct of a qualified trade or      business. Two years after a QSB has come into existence, no      more than 50 percent of its assets can qualify as ``active''      by virtue of the Section 1202(e)(6) working capital rule.       As noted, under Section 1202, an individual can exclude      from gross income 50% of any gain from the sale or exchange      of qualified small business stock originally issued after      August 10, 1993 and held for more than five years. Under      Section 1045 of the Code, the taxpayer may roll the gain over      tax-free provided that the taxpayer (1) has held the QSB      stock for more than six months and (2) invests the gain in      other QSB stock within 60 days of the sale. Generally, the      holding period of the stock purchased will include the      holding period of the stock sold.       The maximum amount of a taxpayer's gain eligible for the      Section 1202 exclusion is limited to the greater of $10      million and 10 times the aggregate adjusted bases of the      stock sold. Gains of Section 1202 stock are taxed at the rate      of 28%.                    II. Section-by-Section Analysis       Section 1. Short title.       The ``Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act.''       Section 2. Increased Exclusion and Other Modifications      Applicable to Qualified Small Business Stock.       (a) Increased Exclusion.       This provision increases the amount of QSB stock gain that      an individual can exclude from gross income from 50 percent      to 75 percent.       (b) Reduction in Holding Period.       This provision reduces from 5 years to 3 years the period      of time in which an individual must hold QSB stock in order      to qualify for the 75-percent exclusion. Section 1045's      rollover provisions will still apply.       (c) Repeal of Minimum Tax Preference.       This provision strikes Section 57(a)(7), which makes 42      percent of the amount excluded pursuant to Section 1202 a      preference item under the alternative minimum tax. This      change is necessary because the AMT provisions in existing      law effectively eviscerate the benefit of Section 1202 in      certain situations.       Example. Jane buys Section 1202 stock for $2,000. After      five years, she sells the stock for $12,000. Under current      law, she excludes half of her gain and is taxed at 28% on the      other half [.28 $5,000 = $1,400]. Hence, her tax on the gain      is $1,400. However, if Jane is subject to the AMT, she must      pay additional taxes of $588, or 28% of 42% of the excluded      half of the gain. Jane's total tax bill of $1,988 amounts to      an effective rate of 19.9%, or nearly the same as the current      maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains of 20%. Under the      Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, Jane would be      able to exclude 75% of her gain, would be subject to the 20%      rate that applies to most capital gains, and would not have      to recognize any of the gain as a preference item for AMT      purposes. Hence, her tax bill would be 20% of $2,500, or      $500. Absent the change, Jame would have little incentive to      invest in a qualified small business over any other business,      particularly if she is subject to the AMT. Under the      Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, Section 1202's      original potent incentives to investors in small businesses      are restored.       (d)(1) Working Capital Limitations.       This provision eases Section 1202(e)'s working capital      restrictions on qualified small businesses. The provision      increases from 2 years to 5 years the time in which assets      that are held for investment by a business can be expected to      be used to finance research or an increase in working capital      needs. In other words, a corporation will be able to hold      assets longer, before eventually using them for research or      to satisfy increased working capital needs, and still meet      the active business requirements of section 1202.       (d)(2) Exception from Redemption Rules Where Business      Purpose.       Currently, the Section 1202 exclusion does not apply to      stock issued by a corporation if the corporation purchases      more than 5 percent of its own stock during the 2-year period      beginning on the date one year before the issuance of its      stock. Under the Encouraging Investment in Small Business      Act, this provision would be waived if the issuing      corporation could establish that the purchase was made for a      business purpose, and not to avoid the provision described      above.       (e) Excluded Qualified Trade or Business.       This provision tightens the language of Section 1202(e)(3),      which excludes certain     businesses from QSB status. It does so in two ways. First, it      provides that a coproration can be a QSB even if its      principal asset, for a temporary period, is the reputation or      skill of one or more of its employees. Hence, in the case of      a small start-up computer software company, for example, if      its employees engage in consulting work, say, in order to      generate some cash flow while the software is under      development, the company will not be disqualified from QSB      status.       Second, the provision makes it clear that biotechnology and      aquaculture companies are not disqualified from QSB status.       (f) Increase in Cap on Eligible Gain for Joint Returns.       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act fixes a      marriage tax penalty provision in Section 1202 by doubling      (to $20,000,000) the maximum amount of eligible gain for      taxpayers filing joint returns.       (g) Decrease in Capital Gains Rate       Section 1202 gains are currently taxed at a rate of 28      percent, which, prior to May 7, 1997, had been the maximum      marginal rate for net capital gains. The Taxpayer Relief Act      of 1997 reduced the maximum capital gain rate for individuals      from 28 percent to 20 percent, but left section 1202 gain      subject to the 28 percent rate. The Encouraging Investment in      Small Business Act would make section 1202 gains subject to      the generally-applicable 20 percent rate.       (h) Increase in Rollover Period for QSB Stock       Currently, a taxpayer can roll over, tax free, gain from      the sale or exchange of QSB stock where the taxpayer uses the      proceeds to purchase other QSB stock within 60 days of the      sale of the original stock. The Encouraging Investment in      Small Business Act would increase the roll over period to 180      days, thus increasing the liquidity of QSB stock. A 180-day      roll over period is also employed in section 1031 of the      Internal Revenue Code for like-kind exchanges.                                 ______                                       By
