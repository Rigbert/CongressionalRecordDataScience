  Now, if we may turn to something which is of very deep concern. Theamendment that I have sent to the desk is on behalf of the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy; the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray; my colleague from California, Senator Boxer; and the two Senators from Nevada, Senators Reid and Bryan. The amendment is an amendment to strike and substitute language. The section we would strike from the bill is section 305, which splits the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on an appropriations bill.  Mr. President, this legislation which I am presenting serves as a substitute to a nongermane provision of the fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill for Commerce, State, Justice.
