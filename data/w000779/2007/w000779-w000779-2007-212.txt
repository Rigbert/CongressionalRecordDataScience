President, it has been more than a decade since the U.S. Senate last addressed fixing health care. I do not think it is morally right for the Senate to duck on health care any longer and that is why I am proposing legislation today to provide affordable, guaranteed, private health coverage for all Americans.  The legislation, called the Healthy Americans Act, ensures care for the 46 million Americans who now live without health insurance, frees business owners from the skyrocketing costs of insuring their workers, and promises every American health care coverage that can never be taken away. My proposal is fully paid for, holds down health care cost growth in the future and provides coverage just like Members of Congress can get now.  America spent $2.2 trillion on health care last year. PriceWaterhouseCoopers expects premiums will increase 11 percent this year alone and I believe the American health care system as we know it is not sustainable.  Our current employer-sponsored health insurance system is a historic accident. In the 1940s, employers needed a way to attract workers as wage and price controls continued. Our country needs a uniquely American solution that works for an economy that is competing not just with the company across town but the company across the world. Americans need a health care system that works for individuals and families, and encourages people to stay healthy instead of only seeking care after they are sick.  The Healthy Americans Act does this and more. It doesn't take long to explain how the Healthy Americans Act works. From the first day individuals, families and businesses win. The Healthy Americans Act cuts the link between health insurance and employment altogether. Under the Healthy Americans Act, businesses paying for employee health premiums are required to increase their workers' paychecks by the amount they spent last year on their health coverage. Federal tax law is changed to hold the worker harmless for the extra compensation, and the worker is required to purchase private coverage through an exchange in their State that forces insurance companies to offer simplified, standardized coverage, with benefits like a Member of Congress gets, and prohibits insurers from engaging in price discrimination.  Requiring employers to cash out their health premiums, as I propose in the Healthy Americans Act, is good for both employers and workers. With health premiums going up 11 percent this year, employers are going to be glad to be exempt from these increases. With the extra money in their paycheck, workers have a new incentive to shop for their health care and hold down their cost. If a worker can save a few hundred dollars on their health care purchase, they can use that money for something else they need.  In addition, the Healthy Americans Act is easy to administer and guarantees lifetime health security. Once you have signed up with a plan through an exchange in the State in which you live, that is it; you have completed the administrative process. Even if you lose your job or you go bankrupt, you can never have your coverage taken away. Sign up, and the premium you pay for the plan and all of the administrative activities are handled through the tax system. For those who cannot afford private coverage, the Healthy Americans Act subsidizes their purchases.  Businesses that have not been able to afford health coverage for their workers, under the new approach, will pay a fee--one that is tiered to their size and revenue, with some paying as little as 2 percent of the national average premium amount per worker for that basic benefit package.  It will be easy to administer, locally controlled, with guaranteed coverage as good as your Member of Congress gets. The Lewin Group has costed out my proposal and reports that it is fully paid for and in addition to expanding coverage for millions of people, guaranteeing health benefits as good as their Member of Congress gets, it also saves $4.5 billion in health spending in the first year. Money is saved by reducing the administrative costs of insurance, reducing cost shifting, and preventing those needless hospital emergency room visits. Also, there are substantial incentives that come about because insurance companies would have to compete for the business of consumers, who would have a new incentive to hold down health costs.  There are other parts of the Healthy Americans Act I wish to describe briefly. As the name of the legislation suggests, I believe strongly that fixing American health care requires a new ethic of health care prevention, a sharp new focus in keeping our citizens well, and trying to keep them from falling victim to skyrocketing rates of increase in diabetes, heart attack, and strokes.  Spending on these chronic illnesses is soaring, and it is especially sad to see so many children and seniors fall victim to these diseases. Yet many Government programs and private insurance devote most of their attention to treating Americans after they are ill and give short shrift to wellness.  Under the Healthy Americans Act, there will be for the first time significant new incentives for all Americans to stay healthy. They are voluntary incentives, but ones that I think will make a real difference in building a national new ethic of wellness and health care prevention.  Parents who enroll children in wellness programs will be eligible for discounts in their own premiums. Instead of mandating that parents take youngsters to various health programs--and maybe they do and maybe they don't--the Healthy Americans Act says when a parent takes a child to one of those wellness programs, the parent would be eligible to get a discount on the parent's health premiums.  Under the Healthy Americans Act, employers who financially support health care prevention for their workers get incentives for doing that as well. Medicare is authorized to reduce outpatient Part B premiums so as to reward seniors trying to reduce their cholesterol, lose weight, or decrease the risk of stroke. It has never been done before. For example, Part B of Medicare, the outpatient part, doesn't offer any incentives for older Americans to change their behavior. Everybody pays the same Medicare Part B premium right now. The Healthy Americans Act proposes we change that and ensures that if a senior from Virginia or Oregon or elsewhere is involved in a wellness program, in health care prevention efforts, like smoking cessation, they could get a lower Part B premium for doing that.  The preventive health efforts I have described are promoted through new voluntary incentives under the Healthy Americans Act, not heavy-handed mandates. What this legislation says is--let's make it more attractive for people to stay healthy and change their behaviors to promote the kind of wellness practices we all know we should do but need an incentive to follow.  Finally, and most importantly, the Healthy Americans Act does not harm those who have coverage in order to help those who have nothing. The legislation makes clear that all Americans retain the right to purchase as much health care coverage as they want. All Americans will enjoy true health security with the Healthy Americans Act, a lifetime guarantee of coverage at least as good as their Member of Congress receives.  A recent ``Health Affairs'' article pointed out that more than half of the Nation's uninsured are ineligible for public programs such as Medicaid, but do not have the money to purchase coverage for themselves.  At present, for most poor people to receive health benefits, they have to go out and try to squeeze themselves into one of the categories that entitles them to care. Under the Healthy Americans Act, low-income people will receive private health coverage, coverage that is as good as a Member of Congress gets, automatically. Like everyone else, they will sign up through the exchange in their State. When they are working, the premiums they owe are withheld from their paycheck. If they lose their job, there is an automatic adjustment in their withholding.  In addition, under the Healthy Americans Act, it will be more attractive for doctors and other health care providers to care for the poor. Those who are now in underfunded programs, such as Medicaid, are going to be able to have private insurance that pays doctors and other providers commercial rates which are traditionally higher than Medicaid reimbursement rates.  Because low-income children and the disabled are so vulnerable, if Medicaid provides benefits that are not included in the kind of package Members of Congress get, then those low-income folks would be entitled to get the additional benefits from the Medicaid Program in their State.  The Healthy Americans Act also makes changes in Medicare. As the largest Federal health program, Medicare's financial status is far more fragile than Social Security. Two-thirds of Medicare spending is now devoted to about 5 percent of the elderly population. Those are the seniors with chronic illness and the seniors who need compassionate end-of-life health care. The Healthy Americans Act strengthens Medicare for both seniors and taxpayers in both of these areas.  In addition to reducing Medicare's outpatient premiums for seniors who adopt healthy lifestyles and reduce the prospect of chronic illness, primary care reimbursements for doctors and other providers get a boost under the Healthy Americans Act. Good primary care for seniors also reduces the likelihood of chronic illness that goes unmanaged. This reimbursement boost is sure to increase access to care for seniors--and I see them all over, in Oregon and elsewhere--who are having difficulty finding doctors who will treat them.  To better meet the needs of seniors suffering from multiple chronic illnesses, the Healthy Americans Act promotes better coordination of their care by allowing a special management fee to providers who better assist seniors with these especially important services.  Hospice law is changed so that seniors who are terminally ill do not have to give up care that allows them to treat their illness in order to get the Medicare hospice benefit. In addition, the Healthy Americans Act empowers all our citizens wishing to make their own end-of-life care decisions. The legislation requires hospitals and other facilities to give patients the choice of stating in writing how they would want their doctor and other health care providers to handle various end-of-life care decisions.  When I announced the Healthy Americans Act last December, I stood with an unprecedented coalition of labor and business. Andy Stern, president of SEIU said ``It is time for fundamental, not incremental change and Senator Wyden has a plan that is practical and principle, and sets down a moral test'' 'Why doesn't every American have the right to the same health care as the President, the Vice President, 535 members of Congress and 3 million Federal workers?' '' Steve Burd, the CEO of Safeway, a Fortune 50 company that has focused on prevention and wellness, called the Healthy Americans Act ``an innovative proposal that lays a foundation to begin a serious discussion on health care reform in this country.''  Ron Pollack of Families USA, listed the principles embodied in the Healthy Americans Act that he believes are important: universality; subsides to make the coverage affordable; community rating rules so the sicker and older are not priced out of the market; and benefits like a Member of Congress has today.  Also at my press conference was Mike Roach, of Portland, OR, a 30-year member of National Federation of Independent Businesses. He owns a clothing store in Portland and employs eight people. He believes the Healthy Americans Act will help him attract good employees. And Bob Beal, president of Oregon Iron Works, an Oregon-based company that competes internationally, believes that we must also address the skyrocketing health care costs that make it harder for companies like his in the international market place.  Like me, the people who stood by me when I announced the Healthy Americans Act believe we need to move the health care debate forward and cannot afford to let more time to go by. The last time Congress took a serious look at reforming health care, there wasn't anything resembling this kind of coalition of labor, business, low-income and end-of-life advocates standing together to call for action.  In tackling one-seventh of the economy, invariably technical issues arise. I want to thank many people who have assisted along the way. Len Nichols of the New America Foundation sent me e-mails at 2 in the morning that helped refine provisions. John Sheils, Randy Haught and Evelyn Murphy of the Lewin Group assisted in telling us our numbers worked or didn't. The Congressional Research Service staff followed up on questions from the common to the obscure. That group included: Bob Lyke, Jeanne Hearne, April Grady, Julie Whitaker, Christine Scott, Chris Peterson, Richard Rimkunas, Karen Trintz, Julie Stone and Andrew Sommers. The Senate Legislative Counsel staff translated the ideas and concepts into legislative language. They devoted an enormous amount of time in getting the ideas and the language right. I'd like to thank Mark Mathiesen, Mark McGunagle, Bill Baird, John Goetcheus, Stacy Kern-Sheerer, KellyMalone and Ruth Ernest for their patience and extraordinary effort.  On my staff, Joshua Sheinkman, my legislative director and Jeff Michaels, my administrative assistant, were instrumental in completing the tax and business sections of the bill. Emily Katz who started in my office as a legislative fellow and became a permanent part of the Wyden health team made sure we had credible facts and statistics. Last but not least, I would like to thank Stephanie Kennan, my Senior Health Policy Adviser for the last 9 years who played devil's advocate, worked through the conflicting and evolving ideas, and kept the many threads of the bill working together.  The full text of the Healthy Americans Act and the Lewin analysis are available on my Web site.  In closing, I believe that without your health, you don't get to the starting line of life. For too long, the Congress has dodged the debate and chosen to slice off parts of the issue. And as worthy as those past efforts have been to help certain segments of our citizens, all Americans deserve guaranteed coverage like their Member of Congress, and no one should go to bed at night worrying about losing their health care. It is time for Congress to provide 21st century solutions to one of the most important issues our country must address. The Healthy Americans Act starts that debate.  I ask unanimous consent, that the Healthy Americans Act section-by-section summary, and examples of how the legislation would affect individuals and families and employers be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              The Healthy Americans Act Section by Section       Section 1-- Short Title and Table of Contents       Section 2--Findings       Section 3--Definitions           TITLE I: HEALTHY AMERICANS PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS                Subtitle A--Guaranteed Private Coverage       Section 101: Guarantee of Healthy Americans Private      Insurance Coverage: Within 2 years of enactment States must      create a system as outlined in the bill to provide      individuals the opportunity to purchase a Healthy Americans      Private Insurance (HAPI) plan that meets the requirements of      the Act.       Section 102: Individual Responsibility to Enroll: Adults      (over age 19, U.S. citizens, not incarcerated) must enroll      themselves and dependent children in a plan offered through      the state-wide Health Help Agency (HHA) unless they provide      evidence of enrollment or coverage through Medicare, a health      insurance plan offered by the Department of Defense, an      employee benefit plan through a former employer (i.e. retiree      health plans), a qualified collective bargaining agreement,      the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Indian Health      Service.       Religious Exemption: If a person opposes for religious      reasons to purchasing health insurance the requirement may be      waived.       Dependent Children: Each adult has the responsibility to      enroll each child in a plan. Dependent children include      individuals up to age 24 claimed by their parents for      deductions in the tax code.       Penalty for Failure to Purchase Coverage: If an individual      fails to purchase coverage and does not meet the exceptions      or the religious exemption, then a financial penalty will be      assessed. The penalty is calculated by multiplying the number      of uncovered months times the weighted average of the monthly      premium for a plan in the person's coverage class and      coverage area, plus 15 percent. Payments will be made to the      HHA of the State in which the person resides. That agency      also may establish a procedure to waive the penalty if the      penalty poses a hardship. Each State shall determine      appropriate mechanisms to enforce the requirement that      individuals be enrolled, but the enforcement cannot be the      revocation or ineligibility of coverage. Subtitle B--Standards for Healthy Americans Private Insurance Coverage       Section 111: Healthy Americans Private Insurance Plans: At      least two plans that meet the requirements of the Act must be      offered through the Health Help Agency in each State. The      offerings permitted through Health Help include several      options: (1) a plan similar to the Blue Cross Blue Shield      Standard Plan provided under the Federal Employees Health      Benefit Program as of January 1, 2007; (2) plans with      additional benefits added to the standard plan so long as      those benefits are priced and displayed separately; and (3)      actuarial equivalent plans to the standard plan. In addition,      plans must provide benefits for wellness programs; incentives      to promote wellness; provide coverage for catastrophic      medical events resulting in the exhaustion of lifetime      limits; create a health home for the covered individual or      family; ensure that as part of a first visit with a primary      care physician, a care plan is developed to maximize the      health of the individual through wellness and prevention      activities; provide for comprehensive disease prevention,      early detection and management; and provide for personal      responsibility contributions at the time services are      administered except for preventive items or services for      early detection.       Family Planning: A health insurance issuer must make      available supplemental coverage for abortion services that      may be purchased in conjunction with a HAPI plan or an      actuarially equivalent HAPI.       Actuarial Equivalent Plans: Actuarial equivalent plans have      to have a set of core benefits that include preventive items      and services; inpatient and outpatient hospital services;      physicians' surgical and medical services; and laboratory and      X-ray services. Like the other HAPI plans, actuarial      equivalent plans cannot charge copays for prevention and      chronic disease management items or services.       Coverage Classes: There will be the following coverage      classes: (1) individual; (2) married couple or domestic      partnership (as determined by a State) without dependent      children; (3) coverage of an adult individual with 1 or more      dependent children; (4) coverage of a married couple or      domestic partnership as determined by a State with one or      more dependent children.       Premium Determinations: Community rating or adjusted      community rating principles established by the State will be      used. States may permit premium variations based only on      geography, smoking status, and family size. States may      determine to have no variations.       A State shall permit a health insurance issuer to provide      premium discounts and other incentives to enrollees based on      participation in wellness, chronic disease management, and      other programs designed to improve the health of      participants.       Limitations: Age, gender, industry, health status or claims      experience may not be used to determine premiums.       Section 112: Specific Coverage Requirements: This section      requires existing provisions of law currently applied to      group health markets to be applied to the plans offered      through Health Help Agencies including: protections for      coverage of pre-existing conditions; guaranteed availability      of coverage; guaranteed renewability of coverage; prohibition      of discrimination based on health status; coverage      protections for mothers and newborns, mental health parity,      and reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy; and      prohibition of discrimination on the basis of genetic      information.       This section also states that a HAPI plan shall not      establish rules for eligibility for enrollment based on      genetic information, and premiums and personal responsibility      payments cannot be adjusted based on genetic information. A      plan cannot request or require an individual to have a      genetic test.       Section 113: Updating Healthy Americans Private Insurance      Plan Requirements: The Secretary of Health and Human Services      (HHS) shall create a 15-person advisory committee that will      report annually to Congress and the Secretary concerning      modifications to benefits, items and services. The committee      members will include a health economist; an ethicist; health      care providers including nurses and other non-physician      providers; health insurance issuers; health care consumers; a      member of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; and an      actuary.    Subtitle C--Eligibility for Premium and Personal Responsibility                          Contribution Subsidies       Section 121: Eligibility for Premium Subsidies: Individuals      and families with modified adjusted gross incomes of 100% of      poverty ($9,800 individual, $20,000 for a family of four) and      below will be eligible for a full subsidy with which to      purchase health insurance. For individuals and families with      income between 100% of poverty and 400% of poverty ($39,200      for an individual, $52,800 for a couple and $80,000 for a      family of four), subsidies will be provided on a sliding      scale.       [Note: To calculate the subsidy level, the individual or      family would first subtract the health deductions and a      deduction for children in the family to determine the      modified adjusted gross income. See deductions in Section      664.]       Individuals have 60 days to notify the HHA that there has      been a change in income which may make them eligible or      ineligible for the subsidy. States may also develop other      mechanisms to ensure individuals do not have a break in      coverage due to a catastrophic financial event.       Section 122: Eligibility for Personal Responsibility      Contribution Subsidies:       Full subsidy: Individuals who have a modified adjusted      gross income below 100 percent of poverty will receive a      subsidy amount equal to the full amount of any personal      responsibility contributions.       Partial subsidy: For individuals with modified adjusted      gross incomes at or above 100 percent of poverty an HHA may      provide a subsidy equal to the amount of any personal      responsibility contributions the person incurs.       Section 123: Definitions and Special Rules:       The term modified adjusted gross income means adjusted      gross income as defined in the Internal Revenue Code      increased by the amount of interest received during the year      and the amount of any Social Security benefits received      during the taxable year.       Taxable year to be used to determine modified adjusted      gross income is determined by the individual's most recent      income tax return and other information the Secretary may      require.       Poverty Line is the meaning given in the Community Health      Services Block Grant.       The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to be used by      the HHAs to calculate premium subsides and personal      responsibility subsidies for individuals whose modified      adjusted gross income is significantly lower than for the      previous year being used to calculate the premium subsidy.       Special Rule for Unlawfully Present Aliens: Subsidies may      not go to adult illegal aliens.       Special Rule for Aliens: If an alien owes either a premium      payment or a penalty, the alien's visa may not be renewed or      adjusted.       Bankruptcy: Debts created by failing to pay premiums are      not dischargeable through bankruptcy.                     Subtitle D--Wellness Programs       Section 131: Requirements for Wellness Programs:       Defining Wellness: Wellness programs must consist of a      combination of activities designed to increase awareness,      assess risks, educate and promote voluntary behavior change      to improve the health of an individual, modify his or her      consumer health behavior, enhance his or her personal well-     being and productivity, and prevent illness and injury.       Discounts on premiums: Individuals who participate      successfully in approved wellness programs are eligible for a      discounted premium, including rewarding parents if their      child participates in an approved wellness program.      Determinations concerning successful participation by an      individual in a wellness program shall be made by the plan      based on a retrospective review of the activities the      individual participated in and the plan may require a      minimum level of successful participation.       A plan may choose to provide discounts on personal      responsibility contributions.       Wellness programs approved by the insurer must be offered      to all enrollees and permit enrollees an opportunity to meet      a reasonable alternative participation standard if it is      medically inadvisable to attempt to meet the initial program      standard. Participation in wellness programs cannot be used      as a proxy for health status.       To be an approved wellness program, the program must be      designed to promote good health and prevent disease, is      approved by the HAPI plan, and is offered to all enrollees.       Employers may deduct the costs of offering wellness      programs or worksite health centers.                  TITLE II: HEALTHY START FOR CHILDREN                  Subtitle A--Benefits and Eligibility       Section 201: General Goal and Authorization of      Appropriations for HAPI Plan Coverage for Children: The      general goal of Healthy Start is to ensure all children      receive health coverage that is good quality, affordable and      includes prevention-oriented benefits.       Funds needed for this section are to be appropriated.       If a child is in a family with an income of 300% or below      and the child does not have coverage, Healthy Start shall      ensure the child is enrolled in a plan. The States and      insurers shall create a separate class of coverage for      children not enrolled in a plan by an adult. A child is      defined as those under the age of 18 or in the case of foster      care, under the age of 21.       Section 202: Coordination of Supplemental Coverage under      the Medicaid Program to HAPI Plan Coverage for Children: If a      child was receiving services through Medicaid that are not      offered through the private coverage offered through Health      Help, Medicaid will continue to provide that assistance. This      includes Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment      (EPSDT) services.                     Subtitle B--Service Providers       Section 211: Inclusion of Providers under HAPI Plans:      Children receiving care though school based health centers,      other centers funded through Public Health Service Act, rural      health clinics or an Indian Health Service facility will be      provided services at no cost or HAPI plans will reimburse the      providers for the services.       Section 212: Use of, and Grants for, School Based Health      Centers: Creates and defines school based health centers and      provides for grants to develop more school based health      centers.       School based health centers must be located in elementary      or secondary schools, operated in collaboration with the      school in which the center is located; administered by a      community-based organization including a hospital, public      health department, community health center, or nonprofit      health care agency. The school based health center must      provide primary health care services including health      assessments, diagnosis and treatment of minor acute or      chronic conditions and Healthy Start benefits; and mental      health services. Services must be available when the school      is open and through on call coverage. Services are to be      provided by appropriately credentialed individuals including      nurse practitioner, physician assistant, a mental health      professional, physician or an assistant. Centers must use      electronic medical records by January 1, 2010. In addition,      the centers may also provide preventive dental services      consistent with State licensure law through dental hygienists      or dental assistants.       School based health centers may provide services to      students in more than one school if it is determined to be      appropriate.       A parent must give permission for the child to receive care      in a school based health center. Centers may seek      reimbursement from a third party payer including HAPI plans.      Funds received from third party payer reimbursement shall be      allocated to the center in which the care was provided.       Development Grants: The Secretary shall provide grants to      local school districts and communities for the establishment      and operation of school based health centers. The Secretary      shall give priority to applicants who will establish a school      based health center in medically underserved areas or areas      for which there are extended distances between the school      involved and appropriate providers of care for children;      services students with the highest incidence of unmet medical      and psycho social needs; and can demonstrate that funding      state, local or community partners have provided at least 50      percent of the funding for the center to ensure the ongoing      operation of the center.       Federal Tort Claims Act: A health care provider shall have      malpractice coverage through the Federal Tort Claims Act for      services provided through a school based health center.       TITLE III: BETTER HEALTH FOR OLDER AND DISABLED AMERICANS        Subtitle A--Assurance of Supplemental Medicaid Coverage       Section 301: Coordination of Supplemental Coverage under      the Medicaid Program for Elderly and Disabled Individuals:      The Secretary shall provide guidance to States and insurers      that takes into account the specific health care needs of      elderly and disabled individuals who receive Medicaid      benefits so that Medicaid may provide services not      provided by HAPI plans.Subtitle B--Empowering Individuals and States To Improve Long-Term Care                                 Choices       Section 311: New, Automatic Medicaid Option for State      Choices for Long-Term Care: If a State decides to do a waiver      similar to the Vermont waiver which allows individuals to      have access to home and community based services, so long as      the State meets criteria specified, the State may      automatically implement the program.       Section 312: Simpler and More Affordable Long-Term Care      Insurance Coverage: This section creates Medigap-like models      for tax qualified long term care policies and adds additional      consumer protections.       A Qualified Long Term Care Plan is a plan that meets the      standards and requirements developed by either the National      Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or by federal      regulations.       Development of Standards and Requirements: Within 9 months      after the date of enactment, the NAIC should adopt a model      regulation to regulate limitations on the groups or packages      of benefits that may be offered under a long term care      insurance policy; uniform language and definitions; uniform      format to be used in the policy with respect to benefits; and      other standards required by the Secretary of HHS.       If NAIC does not adopt a model regulation with the 9-month      period, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations within 9      months that do the same as the above section. In developing      standards and requirements, the Secretary shall consult with      a working group of representatives of long term care      insurers, beneficiaries and consumer groups, and other      individuals.       Limitations on Groups and Packages of Benefits: The model      regulation or federal regulation shall provide for the      identification of a core group of basic benefits common to      all policies and the total number of different benefit      packages and combination of benefits that maybe offered as a      separate benefit package may not exceed 10.       The objectives that need to be balanced in developing the      packages are: to simplify the market to facilitate      comparisons among policies; avoiding adverse selection;      provide consumer choice; provide market stability and promote      competition.       The requirements would go into effect no later than one      year after the date NAIC or the Secretary adopts the      standards.       Required State Legislation: State legislatures would adopt      the standards.       Additional Consumer Protections: This section amends the      1993 NAIC model regulation and model Act to require      additional consumer protections for qualified long term care      policies concerning, guaranteed renewal or noncancelability;      prohibitions on limitations and exclusions, continuation or      conversion of coverage, unintentional lapse, probationary      periods, preexisting conditions, and other issues.       Any person selling a long term care insurance policy shall      make available for sale a policy with only the core group of      basic benefits.                      TITLE IV: HEALTHIER MEDICARE  Subtitle A--Authority To Adjust Amount of Part B Premium To Reward                         Positive Health Behavior       Section 401: Authority to Adjust Amount of Medicare Part B      Premium to Reward Positive Health Behavior: The Secretary may      adjust Part B premiums for an individual based on whether or      not the individual participates in healthy behaviors,      including weight management, exercise, nutrition counseling,      refraining from tobacco use, designating a health home, and      other behaviors determined appropriate by the Secretary. In      adjusting the Part B premium, the Secretary     must ensure budget neutrality and the aggregate must be equal      to 25 percent of premium paid (as in current law).     Subtitle B--Promoting Primary Care for Medicare Beneficiaries       Section 411: Primary Care Services Management Payment: This      section requires the Secretary to create a primary care      management fee for providers who are designated the health      home of a Medicare beneficiary and who provide continuous      medical care, including prevention and treatment, and      referrals to specialists. This section is cross referenced in      the chronic care disease management section so that primary      care physicians providing chronic disease management may      receive the primary care services management fee for those      services. The amount of the payment will be determined by the      Secretary in consultation with MedPAC.       Requirement for Designation as a Health Home: The      management fee shall be provided if the beneficiary has      designated the provider as a health home. A health home is a      provider that a Medicare beneficiary has designated to      monitor the health and health care of the senior.              Subtitle C--Chronic Care Disease Management       Section 421: Chronic Care Disease Management: This section      requires Medicare to have a chronic disease management      program available to all Medicare beneficiaries no later than      January 1, 2008. The program must cover the 5 most prevalent      diseases. Physicians who are not primary care providers, but      do provide chronic disease management may receive an      additional payment for providing chronic disease management.      The fee will be determined by the Secretary in consultation      with MedPAC.       The Secretary shall establish procedures for identifying      and enrolling Medicare beneficiaries who may benefit from      participation in the program.       Section 422: Chronic Care Education Centers: This section      creates Chronic Care Education Centers to serve as      clearinghouses for information on health care providers who      have expertise in the management of chronic disease.               Subtitle D--Part D Improvements Chapter 1       Section 431: Negotiating Fair Prices for Medicare      Prescription Drugs (based on Snowe-Wyden MEND bill): This      section provides the Secretary with authority to negotiate      prices with manufacturers of prescription drugs. The      Secretary must negotiate for fall back plans and if a plan      requests assistance. However, the authority to negotiate is      not limited to these two scenarios. Specifies no uniform      formulary or price setting is permitted. Savings are to go      towards filling the coverage gap or deficit reduction.       Section 432: Process for Individuals Entering the Medicare      Coverage Gap to Switch to a Plan that Provides Coverage in      the Gap (based on Snowe-Wyden Lifeline Act to permit people      to change plans if they hit the donut hole): Permits      individuals to change plans if they hit the coverage gap. In      addition, the section requires the Secretary to notify      individuals they are getting close to the coverage gap and      what their options are. This provision would sunset 5 years      after enactment.      Subtitle E--Improving Quality in Hospitals for All Patients       Section 441: Improving Quality in Hospitals for All      Patients: Within 2 years after enactment, hospitals must      demonstrate to accrediting bodies improvements in quality      control that include: rapid response teams; heart attack      treatments; procedures that reduce medication errors;      infection prevention; procedures that reduce the incidence of      ventilator-related illnesses; and other elements the      Secretary wishes to add.       Within 2 years after enactment, the Secretary shall convene      a panel of independent experts to ensure hospitals have state      of the art quality control that is updated on an annual      basis.               Subtitle F--End-of-Life Care Improvements       Section 451: Patient Empowerment and Following a Patient's      Health Care Wishes: Within 2 years after enactment, health      care facilities receiving Medicare funds must provide each      patient with a document designed to promote patient autonomy      by documenting the patient's treatment preferences and      coordinating these preferences with physician orders. The      document must transfer with the patient from one setting to      another; provide a summary of treatment preferences in      multiple scenarios by the patient or the patient's guardian      and a physician or other practitioner's order for care; is      easy to read in an emergency situation; reduces repetitive      activities in complying with the Patient Self Determination      Act; ensures that the use of the document is voluntary by the      patient or the patient's guardian; is easily accessible in      the patient's medical chart and does not supplant State      health care proxy, living wills or other end-of-life care      forms.       Section 452: Permitting Hospice Beneficiaries to Receive      Curative Care: Changes the current Medicare requirement that      to choose hospice an individual must give up curative care.      Instead, an individual may continue curative care while      receiving hospice.       Section 453: Providing Beneficiaries with Information      Regarding End-of-Life Care Clearinghouse: When signing up for      Medicare, the Secretary shall refer people to the      clearinghouse described in this Act.       Section 454: Clearinghouse: The Secretary shall establish a      national toll-free information clearinghouse that the public      may access to find out State-specific information regarding      advance directives and end-of-life care decisions. If such a      clearinghouse exists and is administered by a not-for-profit      organization the Secretary must support that clearinghouse      instead of creating a new one.                   Subtitle G--Additional Provisions       Section 461: Additional Cost Information: The Secretary of      HHS shall require Medicare Advantage Organizations to      aggregate claims information into episodes of care and to      provide the information to the Secretary so costs for      specific hospitals and physicians may be measured and      compared. The Secretary shall make the information public on      an annual basis.       Section 462: Reducing Medicare Paperwork and Regulatory      Burdens: Not later than 18 months after the date of      enactment, the Secretary shall provide to Congress a plan for      reducing regulations and paperwork in the Medicare program.      The plan shall focus initially on regulations that do not      directly enhance the quality of patient care provided under      Medicare.                  title v: state health help agencies       Section 501: Establishment: Each state will establish a      Health Help Agency to administer HAPI plans. States must      establish an HHA in order to get transition payments to      develop them.       Section 502: Responsibilities and Authorities: Health Help      Agencies shall promote prevention and wellness through      education; distribution of information about wellness      programs; making available to the public the number of      individuals in each plan that have chosen a health home; and      promoting the use and understanding of health information      technology.       Enrollment Oversight: Each HHA shall oversee enrollment in      plans by: providing standardized unbiased information on      plans available; administering open enrollment periods;      assisting changes required by birth, divorce, marriage,      adoption or other circumstances that may affect the plan a      person chooses; establishing a default enrollment process;      establishing procedures for hospitals and other providers      to report individuals not enrolled in a plan; ensuring      enrollment of all individuals; developing standardized      language for plan terms and conditions to be used;      providing enrollees with a comparative document of HAPI      plans; and assisting consumers in choosing a plan by      publishing loss ratios, outcome data regarding wellness      programs, and disease detection and chronic care      management programs categorized by health insurer.       The HHA will determine and administer subsidies to eligible      individuals and collect premium payments made by or on behalf      of individuals and send the payments to the plans.       HHAs shall empower individuals to make health care      decisions by providing State-specific information concerning      the right to refuse treatment and laws relating to end-of-     life care decisions; and by providing access to State forms.       Each HHA will establish plan coverage areas for the State.       States that share one or more metropolitan statistical      areas may enter into agreements to share responsibilities for      administration.       States will have to work with the Secretary of HHS to      ensure transition from Medicaid and SCHIP is orderly and that      individuals receiving other benefits from Medicaid continue      to do so.       Section 503: Appropriations for Transition to State Health      Help Agencies: States will receive federal funds to establish      HHAs for two full fiscal years. States may assess insurers      for administrative costs of running their HHAs.                   TITLE VI--SHARED RESPONSIBILITIES                Subtitle A--Individual Responsibilities       Section 601: Individual Responsibility to Ensure HAPI Plan      Coverage: Individuals must enroll themselves and their      children in a plan during open enrollment periods; submit      documentation to the HHA to determine premium and personal      responsibility contribution subsidies; pay the required      premium and personal responsibility contributions; and inform      the HHA of any changes that affect family status or      residence.                 Subtitle B--Employer Responsibilities       Section 611: Health Care Responsibility Payments: Reorders      and changes the IRS code.         Subchapter A: Employer Shared Responsibility Payments       Section 3411: Payment Requirement: Employer Shared      Responsibility Payments: Every Employer must make an employer      shared responsibility payment (ESR) for each calendar year in      the amount equal to the number of full time equivalent      employees employed by the employer during the previous year      multiplied by a percentage of the average HAPI plan premium      amount. The percentage used is determined by size and revenue      per employee.       Once in effect, the percentages employers would pay are:       Large employers:       0-20th percentile 17%       21st-40th percentile 19%       41st-60th percentile 21%       61st-80th percentile 23%       81st-99th percentile 25%       Small employers:       0-20th percentile 2%       21st-40th percentile 4%       41st-60th percentile 6%       61st-80th percentile 8%       81st-99th percentile 10%       At the beginning of each calendar year, the Secretary in      consultation with the Secretary of Labor shall publish a      table based on a sampling of employers to be used in      determining the national percentile for revenue per employee      amounts.       Transition Rates: Employers who offered health insurance      prior to enactment will contribute ``make good'' payments to      their employees. The payments will be equal to the cash value      of the health insurance provided and the amount will be added      to the employee's wages. These employers will not be required      to make any other payments in the first two years.       If an employer did not provide health insurance to      employees prior to this legislation, the employer shared      responsibility payment for the first year will be equal to      one-third of the amount otherwise required and the payment      for the second year will be two thirds of the amount      required.       Employer Shared Responsibility Credit: The Secretary may      provide a credit to private employers who provided health      insurance benefits greater than the 80th percentile of the      national average in the 2 years prior to enactment, can      demonstrate the benefits provided encouraged prevention and      wellness activities and continue to provide wellness      programs.       Section 3412: Instrumentalities of the United States: State      and local governments must make employer shared      responsibility payments.        Subchapter B: Individual Shared Responsibility Payments       Section 3421: Amount of Payment: Every individual shall pay      an amount equal to the premium amount they owe.       Section 3422: Deduction of Individual Shared Responsibility      Payment from Wages: Employers may deduct the amount of the      payment for premiums from their employees' wages.                    Subchapter C: General Provisions       Section 3431: Definitions and Special Rules: Provides      definitions.       The average HAPI plan premium used to compute employer      responsibility payments will be a simple average of all four      premium classes (individuals, married, head of household and      family)       All individuals who perform work for an employer for more      than three months in the previous calendar year and who meet      the definition of common law employee, either full or part      time, will be counted toward the employer's total employees      when determining the employer shared responsibility payments.       Section 3431: Definitions and Special Rules: Provides      definitions       Section 3432: Labor Contracts: In general these provisions      do not apply to collective bargaining agreements until the      earlier of 7 years after the date of enactment or the date      the collective bargaining agreement expires.       Section 612: Distribution of Individual Responsibility      Payments to HHAs: The Treasury will provide to each HHA an      amount equal to the amount of individual shared      responsibility payments made through the tax code by each      eligible individual.                  Subtitle C--Insurer Responsibilities       Section 621: Insurer Responsibilities: To offer a HAPI plan      through an HHA, insurers will be required to: implement and      emphasize prevention, early detection and chronic disease      management; ensure wellness programs are available;      demonstrate how provider reimbursement methodology achieves      quality and cost efficiency; ensure a physical and a care      plan are available to the individual; ensure enrollees have      the opportunity to designate a health home and make public      how many enrollees have designated a health home; create a      medical record if the patient wants one; comply with loss      ratios established; use common claims form and billing      practices; make administrative payments the State requires      for the operation of its HHA; provide discounts and      incentives for the parent if the child participates in a      wellness program; report outcome data on wellness programs,      disease detection and chronic care management, and loss ratio      information; send large hospital bills to patients with a      contact name so the patient can contact a person to discuss      questions or complaints; and provide HHA with information      concerning the plans offered.       Insurers must use standardized common claim forms      prescribed by the State HHA chronic care programs offered      must help provide early identification and management. Each      program will use a uniform set of clinical performance      standards.       Insurers must report performance and outcomes of chronic      care management programs and loss ratios. Loss ratios will be      defined by the Secretary in consultation with NAIC,      consumers, and insurers.       Defines administrative expenses as including all taxes,      reinsurance premiums, medical and dental consultants used in      the adjudication process, concurrent or managed care review      when not billed by a health provider and other forms of      utilization review, the cost of maintaining eligibility      files, legal expenses incurred in the litigation of benefit      payments and bank charges for letters of credit.       The cost of personnel, equipment and facilities directly      used in the delivery of health care services, payments to      HHAs and the cost of overseeing chronic disease management      programs and wellness programs are not included in the      definition of administrative costs.                   Subtitle D--State Responsibilities       Section 631: State Responsibilities: States must: designate      or create a Health Help Agency; ensure HAPI plans are sold      through the HHA and comply with requirements (there must be      at least two HAPI plans offered); develop mechanisms for      enrollment and the collection of premiums; ensure enrollment      and develop methods to check on enrollment status; implement      mechanisms to enforce the individual responsibility to      purchase coverage (but this may not include revocation of      insurance); and implement a way to automatically enroll      individuals who are not covered and seek care in emergency      departments.       States will continue to apply State law on consumer      protections and licensure.       States must continue a maintenance of effort so they are      required to contribute 100 percent of what they spent on      health services prior to enactment.       Section 632: Empowering States to Innovate through Waivers:      A State may be granted a waiver if the legislature enacts      legislation or the State approves through ballot initiative a      plan to provide heath care coverage that is at least as      comprehensive as required under a HAPI plan. If the State      submits a waiver to the Secretary, the Secretary must respond      no later than 180 days and if the Secretary refuses to grant      a waiver, the Secretary must notify the State and Congress      about why the waiver was not granted.         Subtitle E--Federal Fallback Guarantee Responsibility       Section 641: Federal Guarantee of Access to Coverage: If a      State does not establish an HHA and have a system up within      two years, the Secretary shall establish a fallback plan so      individuals can still receive a HAPI plan.             Subtitle F--Federal Financing Responsibilities       Section 561: Appropriation for Subsidy Payments:      Appropriations will be made each year to fund the insurance      premium subsides.       Section 652: Recapture of Medicare and 90 Percent of      Medicaid Federal DSH Funds to Strengthen Medicare and Ensure      Continued Support for Public Health Programs: All of Medicare      DSH stops and remains in the Part A Trust Fund.       Medicaid DSH continues at 10 percent of current levels. The      amount not spent is put into a new trust fund, the ``Healthy      Americans Public Health Trust Fund.''       Section 9511: Healthy Americans Public Health Trust Fund:      The Treasury shall establish a trust fund in which the funds      that would have been spent on Medicaid DSH will now go. This      trust fund will be used only for premium and personal      responsibility payment subsidies and to States for a bonus      payment if they adopt certain medical malpractice reforms.      Any additional amounts will go toward reducing the federal      budget deficit.    Subtitle G--Tax Treatment of Health Care Coverage Under Healthy   Americans Program; Termination of Coverage Under Other Governmental           Programs and Transition Rules for Medicaid and SCHIP       Part 1: Tax Treatment of Health Care Coverage Under Healthy      Americans Program       Section 661: Limited Employee Income and Payroll Tax      Exclusion for Employer Shared Responsibility Payments,      Historic Retiree Health Contributions, and Transitional      Coverage Contributions: The following payments made by      employers are not taxable as income to their employees: (1)      shared responsibility payments by employers; (2) payments for      coverage of retirees under existing retiree health plans; (3)      payments for continuing employer-provided health plans under      existing collective bargaining agreements; and (4) payments      for employer-provided coverage for long-term care.       Section 662: Exclusion for Limited Employer-Provided Health      Care Fringe Benefits: The value of employer-provided wellness      programs and on-site first aid coverage for employees is not      taxable as income to the employees.       Section 663: Limited Employer Deduction for Employer Shared      Responsibility Payments, Retiree Health Contributions and      other Health Care Expenses: Limits the current employer      deduction for the costs of employee health care coverage to      the following: (1) shared responsibility payments made by      employers; (2) coverage of retirees under existing retiree      health plans; (3) continuing employer-provided health plans      under existing collective bargaining agreements; (4)      employer-provided wellness programs; and (5) on-site first      aid coverage for employees.       Section 664: Health Care Standard Deduction: Creates a new      Health Care Standard Deduction. Taxpayers can claim this      deduction and reduce the amount they pay in taxes whether      they file an itemized tax return or take the standard      deduction. The amount of the deduction a taxpayer can claim      depends on the class of health care coverage the taxpayer      has. The deduction is indexed to the consumer price index      with the deduction amounts initially set as follows:       Individual coverage--$6,025       Married couple or domestic partnership coverage--$12,050       Unmarried individual with dependent children--$8, 610 plus      $2,000 for each dependent child       Married couple or domestic partnership (as determined by a      State) with dependent children--$15,210 plus $2,000 for each      dependent child       The deduction can be claimed by individuals and families      with incomes greater than the poverty line. Both the health      care and the healthy child deduction are phased in starting      from 100-400 percent of poverty. The deduction begins phasing      out starting at $62,500 ($125,000 in the case of a joint      return) and is fully phased out at $125,000 ($250,000 in the      case of a joint return). The deduction will be adjusted for      inflation       Section 665: Modification of Other Tax Incentives to      Complement Healthy Americans Program: Sunsets the following      tax breaks for health care: tax credit for health insurance      costs of individuals; coverage of health care benefits under      ``cafeteria plans''; and Archer Medical Savings Accounts.      This section also allows Health Savings Accounts in      conjunction with high deductible Healthy Americans Private      Insurance plans and long-term care benefits to be provided      tax-free to workers through cafeteria plans.       Section 666: Termination of Certain Employer Incentives      When Replaced by Lower Health Care Costs: Beginning 2 years      after enactment, terminates tax provisions relating to income      attributable to domestic production activities, relating to      tax-exempt status of voluntary employees' beneficiary      associations, and relating to inventory property sales source      rule exception, and the deferral of active income of      controlled foreign corporations.       Part II: Termination of Group Coverage under other      Governmental Programs and Transition Rules for Medicaid and      SCHIP       Sections 671-673: eliminates group coverage, FEHBP,      Medicaid (except for its wrap around and long term care      functions) and SCHIP.                      title vii: other provisions           Subtitle A--Effective Health Services and Products       Section 701: One Time Disallowance of Deduction for      Advertising and Promotional Expenses for Certain Prescription      Pharmaceuticals: If a drug is new and on the market, there is      no tax deduction for advertising unless it is being studied      for comparison effectiveness. If the drug is already on the      market it must inform consumers that a generic will be on the      market if the drug is coming off patent.       Section 702: Enhanced New Drug and Device Approval: Drugs      and devices get additional exclusivity or additional patent      protection if they submit comparison effectiveness as part of      their application to the Food and Drug Administration.       Section 703: Medical Schools and Finding What Works in      Health Care: Medical schools and other researchers may post      on a website run by Agency Healthcare Research and Quality      (AHRQ) evidence-informed best practices. AHRQ will run a      pilot program to find ways to get that information into the      curricula of medical schools.       Section 704: Finding Affordable Health Care Providers      Nearby: Creates a website so individuals can find affordable      high quality providers by zip code. The website can begin      with the providers who report under pay for performance      efforts and then be broadened out to include all providers      using uniform care standards developed in consultation with      Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs).       The affordability standard would be developed by the      Secretary in consultation with insurers.   Subtitle B--Other Provisions to Improve Health Care Services and                                 Quality       Section 711: Individual Medical Records: Individuals own      their medical records.       Section 712: Bonus Payment for Medical Malpractice Reform:      If a State adopts certain reforms the State may get      additional funds. Those reforms are: (1) require an      individual who files a malpractice action in state court have      the facts of their case reviewed by a panel with not less      than one qualified medical expert chosen in consultation with      the State Medicare quality improvement organization or      physician specialty whose expertise is appropriate for the      case; not less than one legal expert and not less than one      community representative to verify that a malpractice claim      exists; (2) permit an individual to engage in voluntary non-     binding mediation with respect to the malpractice claim prior      to filing an action in court; (3) impose sanctions against      plaintiffs and attorneys who file frivolous medical      malpractice claims in courts; (4) prohibit attorneys who file      three or more medical malpractice actions in state courts      from filing others in state courts for a period of 10 years;      and provides for the application of presumption of      reasonableness if the defendant establishes that he or she      followed accepted clinical practice guidelines established by      the specialty or listed in the National Guideline      clearinghouse.       The bonus payments must be used to carry out activities      related to disease and illness prevention and for children's      health care services.                  title viii: containing medical costs       Section 801: Cost-Containment Results of the Healthy      Americans Act: Summarizes what in the bill contains costs.

Only the 8      full-time employees are currently eligible for the Daisy      Hills health plan, and 6 take advantage of it. The firm pays      half of the premium for employees, nothing for family      coverage. Daisy Hills's total current health care costs are      $10,400 per year, which pays for coverage of only 6      employees. Under the Healthy Americans Act, Daisy Hills would      pay a total of $6,208 per year in Employer Shared      Responsibility payments. This amount represents 4 percent of      the national average essential benefit premium multiplied by      20 full-time equivalent employees.                            Small Restaurant       Doug's Diner has 3 full-time and 9 part-time employees who      work an average of 30 hours per week. Doug cannot currently      afford to offer health care to his employees. He often loses      his best staff to chain restaurants that offer health      insurance and is unable to afford insurance for himself and      his family on the individual market. This small family      business falls into the lowest rate tier under revenue by      employee, paying a 2 percent rate. Under the Healthy      Americans Act Doug will pay $1,513 per year and he, his      family, and all of his employees will have access to      affordable health insurance.                     Mid-Size Financial Institution       Happy Valley Bank has 1,600 full-time employees and 400      part-time employees who work an average of 25 hours per week.      All employees who work over 20 hours per week are offered and      take advantage of health care. The firm pays 80 percent of      the premiums for individuals and families. Under the current      system, Happy Valley's total health care expenditures are      $10,200,000 per year. Under the Healthy Americans Act, they      will pay a total of $3,589,463 per year. This amount      represents 25 percent of the national average essential      benefit premium per employee.                      Mid-Sized Manufacturing Firm       Allied Industrial has 1,000 full time employees. The firm      pays 100 percent of individual premiums and 80 percent of      family premiums for all employees. Currently Allied pays      $6,100,000 per year in health care premiums and has been      seeing 10 percent increases year over year for several years      despite the use of a number of cost-control measures. Allied      falls into the middle range of companies in revenue per      employee, paying the 21 percent rate. Under the Healthy      Americans Act, Allied will pay $1,629,890.                        Large Specialty Retailer       Acme Game Emporiums is a national specialty retailer with      2,000 full time and 7,000 part time employees who work an      average of 22 hours per week. All full time and 4,500 of the      part time employees are eligible for and take advantage of      Acme's health plan. The firm pays 95 percent of employees'      premiums and 60 percent of family premiums. Their current      total health care costs are $52,000,000 per year. As a      retailer with relatively low revenue per employee, Acme pays      the 19 percent rate. Under the Healthy Americans Act, Acme      will pay $8,626,351.                                 ______                                       By
