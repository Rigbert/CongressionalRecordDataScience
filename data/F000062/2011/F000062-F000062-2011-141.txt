 President, I am pleased to introduce, together with Senator Snowe, legislation today to protect one of Americans' most valuable but vulnerable assets: Social Security numbers.  The Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act would protect personal privacy and reduce identity theft by eliminating the unnecessary use and display of Social Security numbers.  Since the 106th Congress, I have worked to safeguard Social Security numbers. I believe that the widespread display and use of these numbers poses a significant, and entirely preventable, threat to Americans' personal privacy.  In 1935, Congress authorized the Social Security Administration to issue Social Security numbers as part of the Social Security program. Since that time, Social Security numbers have become the best known and easiest way to identify individuals in the United States.  Use of these numbers has expanded well beyond their original purpose. Social Security numbers are now used for everything from credit checks to rental agreements to employment verifications, among other purposes. They can be found in privately held databases and on public records, including marriage licenses, professional certifications, and countless other public documents, many of which are available on the Internet.  Once accessed, the numbers act like keys, allowing thieves to open credit card and bank accounts and even begin applying for government benefits.  According to the Federal Trade Commission, between 8 and 10 million Americans have their identities stolen by such thieves each year, at a combined cost of billions of dollars.  What's worse, victims often do not realize that a theft has occurred until much later, when they learn that their credit has been destroyed by unpaid debt on fraudulently opened accounts.  One thief stole a retired Army Captain's military identification card and used his Social Security number, listed on the card, to go on a 6-month, $260,000 shopping spree. By the time the Army Captain realized what had happened, the thief had opened more than 60 fraudulent accounts.  A single mother of two went to file her taxes and learned that a fraudulent return had already been filed in her name by someone else, a thief who wanted her refund check.  A former pro-football player received a phone call notifying him that a $1 million home mortgage loan had been approved in his name even though he had never applied for such a loan.  Identity theft is serious. Once an individual's identity is stolen, people are often subjected to countless hours and costs attempting to regain their good name and credit. In 2004, victims spent an average of 300 hours recovering from the crime. The crime disrupts lives and can destroy finances.  It also hurts American businesses. A 2006 online survey by the Business Software Alliance and Harris Interactive found that nearly 30 percent of adults decided to shop online less or not at all during the holiday season because of fears about identity theft.  When people's identities are stolen, they often do not know how the thieves obtained their personal information. Social security numbers and other key identifying data are displayed and used in such a widespread manner that individuals could not successfully restrict access themselves.  Limitations on the display of Social Security numbers are critically needed.  In the last Congress, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and I worked together to pass a bill to prevent Federal, State, and local entities from printing social security numbers on government checks and to prohibit government entities from employing prisoners in jobs like data entry that gave them access to people's social security numbers.  But comprehensive legislation is still needed.  The U.S. Government Accountability Office conducted studies of this problem in 2002 and 2007. Both times--in studies entitled Social Security Numbers Are Widely Used by Government and Could Be Better Protected and Social Security numbers: Use Is Widespread and Could Be Improved, the GAO concluded that current protections are insufficient and that serious vulnerabilities remain.  The Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act would require government agencies and businesses to do more to protect Americans' Social Security numbers. The bill would stop the sale or display of a person's Social Security number without his or her express consent; prevent Federal, State, and local governments from displaying Social Security numbers on public records posted on the Internet; limit the circumstances in which businesses could ask a customer for his or her Social Security number; commission a study by the Attorney General regarding the current uses of Social Security numbers and the impact on privacy and data security; and institute criminal and civil penalties for misuse of Social Security numbers.  I believe this legislation could play a critical role in halting the growing epidemic of identity theft that has been plaguing America and its citizens.  As President George W. Bush's Identity Theft Task Force reported to us now three years ago, ``[i]dentity theft depends on access to . . . data. Reducing the opportunities for thieves to get the data is critical to fighting the crime.''  Every agency to study this problem has agreed that the problem will continue to grow over time and that action is needed.  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1199       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting      the Privacy of Social Security Numbers Act''.       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act      is as follows:Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.Sec. 2. Findings.Sec. 3. Prohibition of the display, sale, or purchase of Social               Security numbers.Sec. 4.

Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of Social      Security numbers has contributed to a growing range of      illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in      some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers,      and other entities have often used Social Security numbers to      confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to      the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used      to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of      individual privacy.       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every      individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a      Social Security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for      Social Security benefits, or to seek employment. An      unintended consequence of these requirements is that Social      Security numbers have become one of the tools that can be      used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy      of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because      the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and      because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to      exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate      for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of      Social Security numbers.       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of Social Security      numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale,      or purchase would not affect public debate.       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or      purchase of Social Security numbers in circumstances that      create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or      financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are      assigned.       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that      has been assigned a Social Security number some degree of      protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that      number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful      conduct.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF THE DISPLAY, SALE, OR PURCHASE OF                    SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS.
