Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, people are going to think we are making this up. I am not making this up. But let us go to the source. Economic Report of the President, signed on page 4 by President George Bush and endorsed by all of his economic advisers, and it says right here: ``When a fast food restaurant,'' this is page 73, chapter 2, halfway down the page, ``When a fast food restaurant sells a hamburger, for example, is it providing a service, or is it combining inputs to manufacture a product?'' Well, we can erase that very embarrassing manufacturing job loss that George Bush has provided, the largest manufacturing job loss in the history of the United States, worse than the Great Depression, we can erase that in one fell swoop. All we have to do is turn to page 73 and say, well, of course, as the President's chief economic adviser says, that is manufacturing a product. That is not a service.                              {time}  2130
