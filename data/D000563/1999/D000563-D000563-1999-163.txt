President, this letter is dated September 27, 1999. It comes from a long list of organizations that comprise the American Public Health Association.  Reading the introductory paragraphs will make it clear where they stand, in opposition to the Bond amendment:       We are deeply concerned about S. 1070, legislation that      would not only block OSHA from issuing an ergonomics      standard, but even from issuing voluntary guidelines to      protect working men and women from ergonomic hazards, the      biggest safety and health problem facing workers today.       We strongly support OSHA's efforts to promulgate a standard      to protect workers from ergonomic injuries and illnesses.      These disorders are real, they are serious and they account      for nearly a third of all serious job related injuries (more      than 600,000 workers a year); moreover, they are preventable.      One type, carpal tunnel syndrome, alone results in workers      losing more time from their jobs than any other type of      injury, including amputations. The worker's compensation      costs of ergonomic injuries are estimated at $20 billion      annually, the overall costs at $60 billion.       For women workers, OSHA's efforts are particularly      important, because nearly half of all injuries and illnesses      among women workers result from ergonomic hazards. Though      these hazards are present in a variety of jobs, many of the      occupations predominantly occupied by women are among the      hardest hit by ergonomic injuries.  Why is it when it comes to this floor and the battle is worth fighting, if the well-heeled special interest groups with the strongest lobbies can come in, whether it is an oil company trying to avoid paying its fair share of royalties to drill for oil on public lands or other large companies, we take the time and end up giving the special favors, but when it comes to women in the workplace, minorities in the workplace, time and time again this Senate, this Congress, will cut a corner and say, ultimately: Perhaps we ought to give the benefit of the doubt to the employer, perhaps we ought to ignore the 600,000 who are injured?  As one who spent a small part of my life in the workplace, that standard is upside down. If the Senate in Washington, DC, is not here to protect those who are voiceless, then we have lost our bearings completely. This issue goes to the heart of that debate.  The General Accounting Office has found employers can reduce costs and injuries associated with musculoskeletal disorders and improve not only employee health but productivity and product quality.  When workers know their employer cares enough about them to make the workplace safer for them, it is a clear and strong message to them that increases employee morale. The time has come for the other side of the aisle to make good on its promise to the American people. The leader in the candidacy for the Presidency on the Republican side, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, claims he is a compassionate conservative. During the course of this campaign, we will try to figure out what that means.  Today, we can ask ourselves if we are seeing an exhibition of compassionate conservatism from the Republican side of the aisle. I think not. With this amendment, I think we see an effort to turn our backs on people who need compassion, understanding, and protection.  Last year, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Robert Livingston of Louisiana, and his ranking Democratic member, David Obey of Wisconsin, made it clear in a letter to the Secretary of Labor:       . . . by funding the National Academy of Sciences study [on      this issue], it is no way our intent to block or delay      issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule on ergonomics.  The reason I raise that is so those who are following the debate understand that this attempt at delay is nothing new. I have the letter. The letter makes it clear that both the Democratic and Republican leaders on the House Appropriations Committee last year made it clear they wanted to go forward with the rule or a standard of protection on these types of injuries.  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Appropriations,                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 1998.     Hon. Alexis Herman,     Secretary of Labor,     Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Secretary: Congress has chosen not to include      language in the Fiscal Year 1999 Labor, Health and Human      Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations      Act that would prohibit OSHA from using funds to issue or      promulgate a proposed or final rule on ergonomics. As you are      well aware, the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor, Health and Human      Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations      Act did contain such a prohibitiion, though OSHA was free to      continue the work required to develop such a rule.       Congress has also chosen to provide $890,000 for the      Secretary of Health and Human Services to fund a review by      the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of the scientific      literature regarding work-related musculoskeletal disorders.      We understand that OSHA intends to issue a proposed rule on      ergonomics late in the summer of 1999. We are writing to make      clear that by funding the NAS study, it is in no way our      intent to block or delay issuance by OSHA of a proposed rule      on ergonomics.           Sincerely,     Bob Livingston,       Chairman.     David Obey,       Ranking Member.
