President, I rise today to join Cape Verdeans in the July 5th celebration of Cape Verde Independence Day.  Every country is rich with its own history and unique story of how it achieved democracy, and Cape Verde is no exception. In 1462, Portuguese settlers arrived at Santiago and foundedRibeira Grande, now Cidade Velha, the first permanent European settlement city in the tropics. After almost three centuries as a colony, in 1951 Portugal changed Cape Verde's status to an overseas province. Then in December 1974, an agreement was signed which provided for a transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. In 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly, which received the instruments of independence from Portugal.  For the first fifteen years of independence, Cape Verde was ruled by one party. Then in 1990 opposition groups came together to form the Movement for Democracy. Working together they ended the one party state and the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991.  Cape Verde now enjoys a stable democratic government. It is an example to other States as to what can be accomplished. These democratic changes have meant better global integration as the government has pursued market-oriented economic policies and welcomed foreign investors. Tourism, light manufacturing and fisheries have flourished. Cape Verde has made the difficult transition from a colony to a successful independent and democratic State.  Today, there are close to 350,000 Cape Verdean-Americans living in the United States, almost equal to the population of Cape Verde itself. These Americans hold a special right since the Cape Verdean Constitution formally considers all Cape Verdeans at home and abroad as citizens and voters. Thus, July 5th is a day of independence for all Cape Verdean-Americans as well as those in Cape Verde.  As we approach the independence day of our own country and reflect on freedom and democracy, it is especially fitting that we remember and celebrate those special independence days of other peaceful democracies, such as Cape Verde. Join with me in wishing all those with direct and ancestral ties to Cape Verde a happy independence day.                          ____________________
