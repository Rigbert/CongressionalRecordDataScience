 President, I am hopeful Senator Schumer will come to the floor as soon as possible. Let me make a couple of comments to the remarks the distinguished Senator from Kentucky just concluded. I very much appreciate his comment about the political parties. On our side of the aisle, when you are in public office, there is concern about asking individuals to contribute large amounts of money to a party, period, and that this uses power unwisely. What McCain-Feingold does is it eliminates the soft money aspect of that powerful use of request. You can't ask someone to contribute $500,000 to the party or $1 million to the party or $100,000 to the party. You are essentially limited to the $35,000 per election to go to the party. There are some on our side who don't like that because they say it is too big a request. I don't happen to believe that it is. I also don't happen--well, some are willing to do that and others are not willing to do it.  But in answer to the question of the Senator from Kentucky, that is really the answer. It is people in elected office requesting citizens to contribute large amounts of money. And what that request in itself conveys is the sense of that public official then giving the appearance, somehow, of indebtedness to the individual because they contribute that large amount of money.  The beauty of McCain-Feingold is that is now removed and a Senator is not in the position of having to do that anymore. I think that is very healthy for the system.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
