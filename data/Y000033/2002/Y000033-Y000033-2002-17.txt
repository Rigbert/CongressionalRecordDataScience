Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that today we will send H.R. 1070, the Great Lakes Legacy Act of 2002, to President Bush to be enacted into law.  The Great Lakes are a vital resources for both the United States and Canada, but have been adversely impacted by over 200 years of development and industrialization.  This is not a situation that can be addressed by pointing fingers and suing people under the Superfund law or other liability statutes.  The solution provided by the Great Lakes Legacy Act is to address sediment contamination through cooperative efforts and public-private partnerships.  Cleanup activities funded by this bill can be carried out as separate projects or in conjunction with other efforts to clean up sediments--including efforts being carried out under consent decrees or consent orders authorized by other environmental laws and efforts of the Army Corps of Engineers.  This approach is supported by both industrial and environmental groups in the Great Lakes Basin.  The Senate amendments that is before the House today consists of the House text of H.R. 1070, as title I. Accordingly, the report of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee provides the relevant legislative history for this title.  The Senate amendment also includes, as title II, a limited authorization to EPA to support activities proposed by State and local governments to help restore Lake Champlain.  Finally, the Senate amendment includes, as title III, some miscellaneous items, including the restoration of various Clean Water Act reports to help my Committee's oversight of Clean Water Act programs.  I urge all members to support the Senate Amendment to H.R. 1070.
