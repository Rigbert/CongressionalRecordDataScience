Madam Speaker, I understand that. The gentleman should keep in mind, although I will admit there have been mistakes by ICWA, this goes far beyond, as I have talked to the gentleman and the other Members, it goes far beyond just ICWA. This goes into the concept of the constitutionality of our responsibility to the American Indian tribes, and it is our responsibility.                              {time}  2200  When you transfer it to the State courts to make the decisions, then I think, very frankly, you have gone too far. I suggested that to you.  I will argue that case tomorrow before the amendment because what you have done is exceed ICWA. It gets into the whole concept of sovereignty and the constitutional role of the Congress to the American Indian tribes.  If you would strike that provision out of the bill, I would be much more sympathetic to what you are trying to do.
