 President, tomorrow morning the Senate will be resuming the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. We hope to complete action on that bill during tomorrow's session. Therefore, Senators can anticipate votes throughout the day and a possible late-night session may be necessary.  Also, as a reminder to all Senators, tomorrow at 10 a.m. there will be a joint meeting of Congress to hear an address by Prime Minister Bruton, of Ireland. Members are asked to be in the Senate Chamber at 9:40 a.m., so they may proceed to the House of Representatives for the address.                          ____________________
