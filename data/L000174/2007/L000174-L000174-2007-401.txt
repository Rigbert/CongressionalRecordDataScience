Under Senator Kohl's leadership, the NOPEC bill has passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee without amendment in four separate Congresses, under both Democratic and Republican leadership.  This NOPEC amendment will hold accountable certain oil producing nations for their collusive behavior that has artificially reduced the supply and inflated the price of fuel. Unless this amendment becomes law, consumers across the Nation will continue to suffer.  According to a recent Washington Post article, gas prices last month came within a half-penny of the modern era's inflation-adjusted record set in 1981. The rise and fall of oil and gas prices has a direct impact on American consumers and our economy.  Prices have come down slightly in recent weeks, but that is no reason to condone anticompetitive conduct by foreign government cartels. American consumers should not be held economic hostage to the whim of colluding foreign governments.  Just a few days ago, the Associated Press reported Iran's oil minister's statement that the members of OPEC would not release more oil into the market. This, despite reports that demand is on the rise. Without collusion, OPEC members would compete to serve that demand and prices at home would fall.  When entities engage in anticompetitive conduct that harms the American consumers, it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute. It is wrong to let members of OPEC off the hook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the seal of approval of national governments. I am disappointed that the administration, which announced it would oppose this bill, does not share this view.  NOPEC has bipartisan, bicameral support. The Senate Judiciary Committee approved it unanimously, and the House passed it with 345 Members voting for it.  We cannot claim to be energy independent while we permit foreign governments to manipulate oil prices in an anticompetitive manner. It is long past time for Congress to act. I thank Senator Kohl for his leadership on this issue.                amendment no. 1546 to amendment no. 1502
