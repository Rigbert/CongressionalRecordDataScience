President, I rise today in recognition and support of one of the most important months of the year that should be celebrated year round: Black History Month.  Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a prominent African-American historian, author, and journalist, founded ``Negro History Week'' in 1926 to establish a sense of pride in African Americans who had been ignored or misrepresented in traditional American History lessons. ``Negro History Week'' later evolved into Black History Month, a celebration of the people, history, culture, and contributions of persons with African heritage.  In part because of Black History Month, many are familiar with prominent African Americans who have changed the course of history: Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks were at the forefront of the civil rights movement, Shirley Chisholm was the first African-American woman elected to Congress, and Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play major league baseball. But let's not overlook people such as the Golden Thirteen, the first African Americans to receive officer's training by the U.S. Navy.  At the Great Lakes Naval Training Station in my home State of Illinois, these young men worked and studied together for the comprehensive exam that would allow them entry into Officer Candidate School. Not only did they pass the exam and go on to become commissioned officers in the Navy, they earned the highest grades ever recorded in Navy history. In fact, their record has yet to be broken. Though they were often denied the privilege and respect afforded White naval officers, they served with distinction in World War II and knocked down the walls of Jim Crow in the process.  Illinois, in fact, has produced some of the greatest contributors to Black history, including jazz musician Miles Davis, Olympic track and field runner Jackie Joyner Kersee, famed composer Quincy Jones, and countless others. Illinois also has the unique distinction of electing two of the five African Americans who have served in the U.S. Senate: our very own Senator Barack Obama and former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun.  During the past 400 years, against all odds and in spite of numerous roadblocks, African Americans have woven themselves into the fabric of this country. Through academics, government, music, art, food, sports, America would not be what she is without the contributions of her African-American population.                          ____________________
