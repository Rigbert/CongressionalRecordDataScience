President, the distinguished majority leader had mentioned the Defense authorization bill, and the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the senior Senator from South Carolina, is also here on the floor.  Mr. President, I realize this would have to probably be hotlined from both Cloakrooms, but I certainly am willing to agree to a vote at a time certain. But I mention two provisos: First, at some point prior to the vote, and if the vote is going to be tomorrow, at that time tomorrow, that I be recognized for 20 minutes to speak--of course, with equal time on the other side, naturally--to speak on the subject of landmines.  I will do that with the understanding of the distinguished chairman that on the subsequent Defense authorization bill, there not be language on landmines, certainly not the language that I have stated my objection to and have given on the floor to him and to the distinguished Republican leader. I mention that for the sake of our distinguished majority leader, because I know he has to try to put together a schedule. I just want him to know, with the distinguished Senator from South Carolina here on the floor.
