Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important than our children's education. That is why Democrats want to invest in our classrooms, our teachers, our crumbling school buildings and in our children's future.  Since they came to power, Republicans have vowed to cut education. Now they propose taking millions out of public education and putting it into vouchers, allowing a privileged few to attend private schools. We should not punish the many to help a privileged few. That is not right, it is not fair, it is not just. That is why Democrats will continue to stand. We will continue to fight for quality education for every child.  Abolish the Department of Education, end the school lunch program, cut funding for education, and now divert money to private schools. That is the Republican education plan. Is it any wonder the American people do not trust their children's education in the hands of Speaker Gingrich?                          ____________________
