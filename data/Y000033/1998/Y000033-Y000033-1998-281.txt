Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation with my distinguished colleague, Mr. Dale Kildee of Michigan, to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (IHCIA). In 1988, pursuant to Section 405 of the IHCIA, the Indian Health Service (IHS) was directed to select up to four tribally-operated IHS hospitals to participate in a demonstration program to test methods for the direct billing for and receipt of payment for health services provided to Medicare and Medicaid eligible patients. This was established to determine whether collections would be increased through direct involvement of tribal health care providers versus the current practice which required billings and collections be routed through the IHS.  In 1996, Congress extended this demonstration program until 1998. This extension allowed Congress additional time with which to consider whether to permanently authorize the collection program. The law also required the IHS to submit a report to Congress on the demonstration program on September 30, 1996, the same day the program was originally to expire. The report was to evaluate whether the objectives were fulfilled and whether direct billing should be allowed for other tribal providers who operate an IHS facility. This report is still undergoing Departmental review, however, it is our understanding that the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Indian Health Service are very pleased with the success of the demonstration program.  All four participants have reported a dramatic increase of collections for Medicare and Medicaid services, which provided additional revenues for IHS programs at these facilities. In addition, there has been a significant reduction in the turn-around time between billing and receipt of payment and an increase in efficiency by being able to track their own billings and collections in order to act quickly to resolve questions and problems.  On behalf of my constituents, the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation and the South East Area Regional Health Corporation, I am introducing this legislation to provide permanent status for the demonstration program established by Section 405 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, to provide a ``grandfather'' clause for the current four demonstration participants to enable them to continue their programs without interruption, and to expand eligibility for the program to tribes or tribal organizations who operated or are served by an IHS hospital or clinic.                          ____________________
