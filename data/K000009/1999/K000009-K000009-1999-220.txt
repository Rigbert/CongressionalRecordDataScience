 What is very interesting to me in our area of Ohio and around the Midwest, many companies that used to pay taxes for education and used to help schools, got abatement, tax abatement over the last 20 years, and now what is happening is educational systems across this country are faltering at the local level and asking the Congress to appropriate money in order to help for school construction. The President of the United States a couple of months ago was up here asking for money for school construction. This is a shift in priorities of the Federal Government to move into school modernization and construction.  One of the reasons this is happening is that locally, these very same companies that have gotten abatement and are cutting back on their public responsibilities are then shifting that burden up to the Federal Government where we have a lot of other responsibilities, and it is very interesting to me that the gentleman has to fight for dollars for education, dear dollars that we need for curriculum, for instruction, for making up the differential between lower income districts and higher income districts, and yet now we also have to fund buildings. It is amazing to me how much foregone tax revenue there is at the local level. Just another example of corporate America not meeting its public responsibilities.  I would wish for the Federal Reserve to do a study on that.
