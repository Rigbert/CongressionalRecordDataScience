 Let us use a couple of examples here. This is a simple vote. It would allow Americans to reimport, without limit, American-manufactured, FDA-certified, safe drugs from Canada back into the United States. The interesting thing about these drugs is they are manufactured in the United States of America; but when they take a vacation to Canada, their price drops dramatically because the Government of Canada, unlike the Government of the United States, with the exception of the Veterans Department and some other agencies at the Pentagon, negotiates with the pharmaceutical industry and negotiates lower prices. They use market forces to benefit the people of Canada.  The Republicans here in the House, bizarrely enough, are offering a $400 billion prescription drug benefit for seniors that is based on subsidies to the private insurance industry and supporting the outrageous list price for drugs, which no one pays except the uninsured; but they would mandate that that be done. They would outlaw the United States Government from negotiating lower prices, unlike the Government of Canada, the Government of Great Britain, the governments of all the EU, virtually every other government in the world. In almost every country in the world a person can buy U.S.-manufactured, FDA-certified drugs for a substantial discount below the price those drugs are made available here.  In the case of one drug for glaucoma, Xalatan, the cost in the U.S. is $631 a year. If we buy it in Canada, it is $429 a year. If the government negotiated, as the VA does, we can get it for $336 a year; but under the brilliant Republican plan here in the House, a drug that costs $631 a year will cost a senior $746. They will pay actually more than the drug costs today list price. This is the grand new benefit that they are going to deliver at a cost of $400 billion.   We could lower the price of drugs more substantially for every American, particularly those on Medicare, by simply voting for and allowing the safe reimportation of U.S.-manufactured, FDA-certified drugs from Canada, plain and simple.  We are going to hear a whole host of reasons why that is a bad idea. It will hurt their profits. Yes, it will hurt their profits. They say, well, if our profits go down, we will not do the research. That is a lie. The pharmaceutical industry makes its money on new drugs. They get an exclusive 17-year patent for those drugs. That is their profit center. The last thing that is going to go is the research because that is where they are going to make their money. Maybe they will cut the obscene salaries of their CEOs. Maybe they can be get by on two, three million a year instead of sixty.   Maybe they will cut the billions they are spending to direct promote their drugs on television, something that was outlawed by the FCC and the FDA until quite recently and something that is very problematic, to get people induced to go out and by a particular drug, to go into their doctor who is pushed for time and say I want that purple pill, I saw it on television. Well, that is not what you need. I want the purple pill. Okay, I have only got 10 minutes, you are out of here, you have got the prescription. Doctors tell me they do that. So if they saved those billions, they cut the salaries and some of their other overhead and administrative costs, they would still have plenty of money to do the research, and they could still earn a good profit; but Americans would pay 40 or 50 percent less for their drugs.  They say this legislation will kill people. They claim somehow the drugs that took a vacation to Canada have become unsafe while they were there. They say this will kill people. I will tell my colleagues what is killing people in the United States of America today: the fact that they cannot afford life-saving drugs. There are seniors in my district who divide their drugs in half. There are seniors in my district, couples, who decide which one is going to get the critical drugs this month because they cannot afford to buy all of them because they do not have a benefit. That is killing people.   Bringing back U.S.-manufactured, FDA-certified drugs from Canada is not going to kill people. It will kill obscene profits on the part of this industry because they are gouging America's seniors. America's seniors are paying twice as much as people in Canada for many drugs and even more if we go across the border to Mexico.   So this is going to be a simple vote, but it is going to be a vote on which millions of dollars are unleashed to send false messages to try and pressure Members of Congress to vote against the interests of all Americans who would be healthier and benefit from less expensive drugs. We could do this through the miracle of market forces and, yes, even free trade.  I voted against the NAFTA agreement. I think it stinks and it is killing jobs in this country; but guess what, probably prohibiting the reimportation of drugs is NAFTA illegal, but no one ever files a complaint when these NAFTA illegal things benefit the big corporations, only when they benefit people, and this Congress is going to try and stop changes in that situation.                          ____________________
