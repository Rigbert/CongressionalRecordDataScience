Mr. Chairman, today I rise once again in support of the Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy For Users, also known as TEA-LU.  I have been chairman of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for the last 4 years. These 4 years have convinced me that we face a crisis in this country because of our inadequate, crumbling, and congested highways. We are not taking the steps today to ensure the ability to move people and freight tomorrow. Continuing to underfund and undermaintain our highways and transit systems ensures more traffic fatalities and reduces economic opportunity for our citizens.  Congestion of our highways causes over $67 billion and probably higher than that because very frankly the cost of gasoline has gone up. It costs the average driver about $2,400 a year and more than a week and a half spent stuck in traffic, actually more days than they usually get for vacations.  I introduced H.R. 3, TEA-LU, on February 9, 2005, along with my colleague, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), our ranking minority member, as well as our subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), and another subcommittee ranking minority member, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).                              {time}  1130  We were joined by 71 other committee members who sponsor this legislation.  H.R. 3 is substantially the same bill as H.R. 3550, which passed the House last year and which we conferenced with the Senate and, unfortunately, were unable to come to a decision. I am disappointed that the conference was not successful because of inaction ofthe other body. However, I am committed to getting H.R. 3 passed before our current extension expires.  The Department of Transportation and the highway, transit, highway safety, and motor carriers programs of DOT are all operating under the extension until May 31, 2005. After that date, DOT can no longer reimburse the States for the funds that the States are obligated to expend for highway, transit, and other programs covered by this legislation. My goal is to complete work on this legislation and send the bill to the President for signature before the end of May.  H.R. 3 will provide a funding level of 283, very frankly, $284 billion, in guaranteed funding over 6 years for Federal highways and transit programs, as well as highway safety and motor carrier safety programs. Fortunately, we have been able to increase the funding under H.R. 3 over last year's bill, and H.R. 3 represents a 42 percent increase in funding over TEA-21. The increased funding levels in H.R. 3 are supported by the administration.  H.R. 3 provides a new emphasis and a new program to relieve congestion, maximize roadway capacity, and remove bottlenecks.  H.R. 3 creates a new core program for the highway safety infrastructure improvements, a new high-risk rural roads safety program that promotes a number of new safety programs aimed at human factors that contribute to accidents.  H.R. 3 funds five programs designed to improve movement of freight, including funds for border infrastructure, intermodal connectors, projects of regional and national significance, and a new corridor infrastructure program.  The bill also provides funding for construction of dedicated truck lanes.  H.R. 3 continues our commitment to provide for public transportation both in our city and to man rural areas where the need is great.  Mr. Chairman, most significantly, H.R. 3 will put Americans to work by creating the kind of jobs that support families and increase our tax base. It is much-needed legislation that will move our country toward a stronger economy.  Mr. Chairman, before I close, I want to take one moment to thank all the Members and staff who have worked so hard to produce this legislation.  The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), our Democrat ranking member, has been one of the most ardent supporters of this legislation. His contributions to this bill have resulted in a much better bill.  The chairman of the Subcommittee on Highways, Transit and Pipelines, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri), has been the real workhorse on this bill. He has taken his subcommittee around the country to investigate the infrastructure needs of the United States.  We have a new subcommittee Democrat ranking member, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio). He has begun his new term with energy and enthusiasm, and I want to thank him for his contribution.  We could not have found the increases in funding without the contributions and efforts of the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. He has been a strong and steadfast supporter.  The gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), chairman of the Committee on the Budget, has worked hard with me to accommodate the increases in authorizations needed to produce this legislation.  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority leader, for his help in getting the bill scheduled so quickly in this session and for helping us find solutions to some very difficult problems.  Last, but not least, I want to thank the Speaker of the House for the countless hours he has spent working for us to keep the process moving. Without his support, we would not be here today.  Also, at this time, I want to thank the hardworking staff of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure who have been here for many nights and weekends drafting this legislation. The subcommittee staff who have made this happen are Graham Hill, Jim Tymon, Joyce Rose, Derek Miller, Suzanne Newhouse, Bailey Edwards, Will Bland, Sharon Barkeloo; Debbie Gephart and Patrick Mullane on the gentleman from Wisconsin's (Mr. Petri) staff.  In addition, my chief of staff, Lloyd Jones, and chief counsel, Liz Megginson, Mark Zachares, Charles Ziegler, Fraser Verusio, as well as Debbie Callis and Kevin McColaugh.  I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), who is not here, but I see the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) over there. They have worked well with us. They have worked very hard. We have worked out a bill I believe that is good. His chief of staff, David Heymsfeld, and chief counsel, Ward McCarragher, as well as Kathy Zern, Art Chan, Ken House, Eric Vanschyndle, Stephanie Manning, and Kathie Dedrick of the gentleman from Oregon's (Mr. DeFazio) staff.  Last, but not least, I want to express my appreciation for the hard work of the legislative counsel who have made sure the proposal ended up on paper and in proper form. Our appreciation goes to David Mendelsogn, Curt Haensel, and Rosemary Gallagher.  This is a piece of legislation, Mr. Chairman, that is long overdue. It is important we pass this legislation so we can leave the legacy for users in the future.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The chairman has done a good job of talking about the people who do the real work around here, which is the staff, with good direction from the Members, and the chairman of the committee and the subcommittee chairman and the direction that I and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) have attempted to provide in this endeavor.  This, I believe, may be the signature accomplishment of this Congress, as it goes to positive accomplishments for the economy of the United States and domestic programs.  The investment in this bill, investment of taxes, paid by the American people at the pump, we are not creating new deficit or debt here; we are spending their tax money in the way it was intended when it was collected from them when they tanked up their car or their commercial vehicle.  For every billion dollars in this bill of investment, of mitigating congestion, of repairing cracked bridges, of resurfacing highways, for transit, for every billion we spend, the President's Department of Transportation estimates that it creates about 47,000 jobs, not just direct good-wage construction jobs, but jobs that spill over to the contractors, the small businesses that subcontract, the communities where the projects take place with the spending in those communities, with improvement in the movement of freight so trucks do not have to take lengthy detours, so the just-in-time delivery can work better for American businesses, putting people to work in companies that are more competitive. All of that flows from this $284 billion investment.  In an ideal world, I would invest more and I believe that the chairman has a similar position on that, but we are constrained by current budget reality, and this is a good step to be taken by the House of Representatives; and hopefully, this will move the process out of limbo in the Senate. In the last Congress, we could have gotten this job done had the Senate followed the lead of the House. They did not. Hopefully, this time they will be more amenable to getting this bill done and getting it done long before the temporary extension expires at the end of May.  Our departments of transportation across the country need certainty. Many of them are restricted legislatively or constitutionally from obligating funds into larger projects or projects that will go more than 1 year because we are in this series of temporary extensions of the Transportation Efficiency Act as we move toward TEA-LU.  With the adoption of TEA-LU and the certainty that will come with that, we will see a whole lot of on-the-shelf, ready-to-go vital projects across America, that will put tens of thousands to work this next summer, move forward. But only if they get that certainty. It is estimated in the last year $2 billion of necessary spending, investment in roads, bridges, highways, transit projects was foregone because of thisuncertainty. I mean, everyone knows we are going to make these investments, but at what level and over what period of time and with what constraints on the spending. So the States themselves need this.  In my own State, we have a tremendous problem with cracked bridges on Interstate 5, and it is interfering with international commerce and interstate commerce, and we want to move ahead; but we need the certainty of this legislation, the investment in this legislation to do that.  I see that the ranking member of the full committee has come in.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of the time on this side since I believe we will probably hear from the other side of the aisle.
