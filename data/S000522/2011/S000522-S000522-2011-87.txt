Dr. Broun, thank you for your eloquence and your kind remarks, and I want to thank you for your leadership. Again, as a medical doctor, I think you and Dr. Roe and the other docs bring such credibility.  I hope Americans are listening. I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle who take the other side of this issue will begin listening. There needs to be a reevaluation. America needs to take a second look, a long and sustained look at the surface appeal arguments of the abortion rights side.  Abortion is violence against children. It dismembers a child; it decapitates a child; it chemically poisons a child. One of our earlier speakers talked about RU486 and how tailor-made abortions are being promoted by Planned Parenthood. RU486 actually operates in two ways. The first chemical starves the baby to death so the child in utero, the child in the womb simply cannot get nourishment to continue living. The second chemical brings about the expulsion of that baby--who is usually dead, but not always. If that isn't child abuse, if the other methods of abortion are not child abuse, I don't know what is.  This idea that life begins at birth belongs in another era, especially with ultrasound technologies available, as several of my colleagues have said, the ``window to the womb.'' As a matter of fact, it should be noted that even the leading pro-abortion activists in the 1960s and early 1970s, Dr. Bernard Nathanson from New York, one of the three cofounders of NARAL, which is one of the leading pro-abortion groups in the country, Dr. Nathanson said he presided over 60,000 deaths to children as he ran the largest abortion clinic in New York City. He went on to become a pro-lifer. And what caused that huge change of heart both in his mind and in his heart? It was that he began doing blood transfusions and began to see that an unborn child is a patient just like any other patient who may be sick, have a disability, that early efforts and interventions could mitigate whatever that anomaly might be. And because of that he said, how can I be in one room killing a baby with poison or dismemberment while in another doctor's office or in another operating theater providing this prenatal surgery? He saw the schizophrenia inherent in treating some children because they're wanted as being acceptable, and we welcome them, and if they are unwanted, they're throwaways. The feminists had it right when they said no woman should ever be treated as an object. Well, we all know that the unborn child, if he or she is unwanted, is treated like an object and a throwaway, and no human life is a throwaway.  Let me also say that Abby Johnson, who just recently, a little over a year ago, left a Planned Parenthood directorship in Texas--what caused her to change? She saw an ultrasound abortion in real time and said, I just saw the baby crumple right in front of my very eyes. If that isn't a human rights abuse, I don't know what is either. So she became a pro-lifer and now speaks out very, very boldly.  Finally, Dr. Alveda King, as I mentioned earlier, is Martin Luther King's niece. Dr. King had two abortions. She was a ``pro-choicer.'' She now is one of the most eloquent pro-life leaders in the United States and even in the world. She has said, ``How can the dream survive''--talking about her uncle's dream of inclusion, of human rights, of civil rights for all--``how can the dream survive,'' she writes, ``if we murder the children?''  She goes on to talk about how the African American population in this country is so disproportionately targeted by Planned Parenthood and others. The number of abortions for African Americans is about five times the rate of Caucasians and it is because of targeting. There are other reasons, but that is one of the main reasons. That's where the Planned Parenthood clinics are, frankly.  Abortion hurts women, she makes it so clear. She is eloquent in her defense, as are others, in ministering to women who have had abortions. One thing about this pro-life movement--and I've been in it for 38 years, I've been in Congress for 31 years--it loves them both. It says to both the mother and to the baby, we want to put our arms around you, we want to help, we want to be of assistance. And to any post-abortive woman, we are all about trying to help and to assist and provide some kind of pathway to reconciliation. That's where the post-abortive women like Dr. Alveda King play such a crucial role in helping women who otherwise would feel so disenfranchised and left out.  I want to thank our leadership, Speaker Boehner, our majority leader, Eric Cantor. We have a very pro-life leadership who recognizes how sacred life is, how this Congress, this House needs to defend the defenseless. Tomorrow, I will be joining the distinguished Speaker as he speaks on the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. We will be having a press conference tomorrow. We have over 125 cosponsors. I have never seen a leadership so dedicated to protecting innocent human life as these individuals in our leadership. I would hope my friends on the other side of the aisle would take a second long look at the carnage, the unbelievable pain and agony and suffering that abortion has visited upon women. It is not pro-women. Abortion exploits women. And it's certainly not pro-child either because it decimates unborn children as well.  So we have a great leadership. We have an excellent group of Members, men and women, Democrats and Republicans. And I do hope that we will move this human rights issue forward. The young people are with us, and this is the greatest human rights struggle ever.                          ____________________
