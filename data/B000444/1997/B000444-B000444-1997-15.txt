 President, this evening, the Senate conducted two rollcall votes--on the conference report to the Defense Department Appropriations bill and on the nomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden to be U.S. District Judge for the District of New Jersey. Unfortunately, I was not present for those votes.  Tonight, at my daughter's school in Wilmington is what is called mini roster night. That is what most people know as open house or parents' night--where the parents go around and meet all of the teachers. Because of the Senate voting schedule, I will either have to miss votes or miss mini roster night at my daughter's school.  On both matters voted on tonight, my position is already on the record, and my vote is not expected to change the outcome.  With regard to the defense bill, I voted for the bill on July 15 when it passed the Senate by the overwhelming margin of 94-4. There have been no substantial changes in the legislation, and I continue to support it.  On July 10, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the nomination of Katharine Sweeney Hayden to be a New Jersey district judge. I supported her nomination, and I continue to do so.  Again, Mr. President, on both matters, my vote is not expected to change the outcome, and therefore, I have decided to attend parents' night at my daughter's school. I appreciate the understanding of my colleagues and my constituents.                          ____________________
