 President, today Mr. Ken Apfel will be sworn in for the position of Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Mr. Apfel was confirmed earlier this month to direct the agency responsible for administering the largest domestic program in the United States. Social Security will have an impact on the life of every single American at one time or another. I support Mr. Apfel's confirmation to head this vital agency.  Mr. Apfel will guide the Social Security program into the 21st century, bringing it right up to the edge of the largest demographic shift this country has ever seen. Starting in 2010, the baby boom generation--70 million strong--will begin entering retirement. Because of the tremendous medical strides we have made in extending life expectancy, this cohort will be living longer and collecting benefits longer. It is imperative that our Social Security program be ready to absorb such a huge influx of beneficiaries. The Commissioner must be a leader in preparing the agency and the program itself, to meet this challenge.  Preparing for the retirement of the baby boom generation is only half of the challenge. There are on-going problems that must be addressed as well. The Social Security Administration has had difficulties protecting taxpayer dollars. The General Accounting Office recently elevated the Supplemental Security Income Program to its high-risk list of Federal programs because of their inability to pay out the proper amount of money. Huge overpayments go out to beneficiaries--most of which are never collected. Additional problems exist in the Disability Insurance Program. Prisoners and legal aliens have received benefits improperly. The agency has not fulfilled its legislative mandate to refer applicants and recipients of disability benefits to appropriate rehabilitation. Addressing these issues is very important because problems in any one of the programs that the Social Security Administration operates undermines confidence in all of the programs.  I will say right now that I do not envy Mr. Apfel. He is endeavoring to take on a job with many difficult challenges. Having met with him personally, I can honestly say I believe he can do the job. It is my hope, however, that he will not fall into the practice of his predecessors of not taking a pro-active stance with regard to policy issues faced by the Social Security Administration. When he sees the need for legislative action, or he sees problems with policies that must be changed--that he communicate with Congress immediately.  I hope he will see himself , in his capacity as Commissioner, as a liaison to the public, to the President, and to Congress to resolve some of the most important challenges that will face our country and the Government over the next 6 years. Most of all, SSA, like any other Government agency, is an overseer of taxpayer dollars--our money. That responsibility must be taken with the utmost seriousness and deliberation. If he can motivate his personnel to do that--protect taxpayer dollars--he will have a successful term as Commissioner.                          ____________________
