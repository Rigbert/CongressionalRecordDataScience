Last year, Senator Reed and I offered an amendment set aside of $10 million in Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), funds to provide grants to assist communities in providing treatment services that will serve the needs of their homeless populations. With the help of the distinguished Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa, who have done so much through the years to help the homeless, our amendment was adopted. This year, we are seeking to ensure that $16 million in SAMHSA funds are set aside to serve the needs of homeless individuals. We respect the chairman's wishes that SAMHSA earmarks not be made specifically in bill language, and, accordingly, we will not offer my amendment on the floor. We would ask, however, whether the chairman and ranking member will advocate for the $16 million set-aside in the conference report to this bill.
