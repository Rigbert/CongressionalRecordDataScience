 The amendment converts tax incentives for conventional energy and, in turn, puts that as an incentive for alternative energy, as well as conservation.  The amendment continues the path to development of clean coal, hybrid vehicles, and biofuels. A vote for this amendment is a vote for a brighter American future for all families, for cleaner fuel. I ask that you all support the amendment.  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
