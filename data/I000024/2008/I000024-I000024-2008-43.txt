President, I was pleased to join Senator Lautenberg yesterday in introducing S. 3416, The Federal Aviation Administration Employee Retention Act. I am supporting Senator Lautenberg in his efforts to correct what I believe is a very unfair process imposed upon employees of the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, by Congress.  Essentially, S. 3416 will correct the collective bargaining process Congress established for FAA employees in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 1996--Public Law 104-264--in which we inserted ourselves as arbitrators in labor disputes. Under the 1996 act, if the FAA and the union with whom they are in negotiation can not reach an agreement, then Congress has 60 days to intervene and if we do not, the FAA is able to impose its terms on the employees. Mr. President, this is not fair, it has not worked and it is time that we correct it.  In addition to the widely published dispute between the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, NATCA, the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, PASS, also have been unable to negotiate a new contract with the FAA. Furthermore, in my State of Oklahoma, there has been an 8-year disagreement between the FAA and the FAA Academy Instructors represented by the Professional Association of Aeronautical Center Employees, PAACE. It is my understanding from PAACE that FAA has basically refused to come to the bargaining table, which has resulted in year to year extensions of an 8-year-old contract. This is not right.  The very reasonable procedure established by S. 3416 will provide both sides in a labor dispute with a means to resolve disagreements by allowing FAA employees the same collective bargaining protections that employees covered under the National Labor Relations Board currently have. The bill provides the option of resolving disputes through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or through mutual agreement on an alternative procedure. If no agreement is reached, then matters of disagreements will be presented to the Federal Services Impasses Panel for binding arbitration.  Finally, the bill would require both sides go back to the negotiating table for any ``personnel management system implemented'' by the FAA Administrator on or after July 10, 2005. Inother words, contract negotiations between FAA, NATCA and PASS are restarted with a 45-day deadline. If no agreement is reached, then there is an additional 90 days for binding arbitration.  As a pilot I am well acquainted with the exceptional work done by the employees of the FAA and I know firsthand that our aviation system is only as good as these employees. They deserve the right to bargain in good faith on their employment contracts. This bill will give them that opportunity.  Thank you, Senator Lautenberg, for introducing this bill, and I hope we get an opportunity to debate it very soon.                          ____________________
