Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House has reportedly said that the House can ``no longer duck'' a vote on the minimum wage. It's about time, Mr. Speaker. Why have you been ducking for so long.  The minimum wage is at a near 40-year low in real terms. People earning the minimum wage deserve the right to a livable wage. No one can live on $4.25 an hour, much less support a family.  Republican Majority Leader Dick Armey has said he will fight an increase in the minimum wage with ``every fiber in his being.'' While corporate CEO's earn 212 times the wage of the average worker, Republicans would deny the poorest workers in America a modest increase in the minimum wage. This is not right, it is not fair, and it is not just.  Stop the stonewalling, Mr. Speaker. Let's raise the minimum wage now. People deserve the right to earn a livable wage.                          ____________________
