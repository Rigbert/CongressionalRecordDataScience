 President, I ask unanimous consent that following consideration of the tax conference report, the Appropriations Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4818, the Foreign Operations appropriations bill, and the Senate now proceed to its consideration; provided that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 2812, the Senate Foreign Operations appropriations bill, be inserted in lieu thereof; the amendment be considered as original text for the purpose of further amendment with no points of order waived; provided that the only first-degree amendments in order be managers' amendments agreed upon by both managers and the following list that I send to the desk; provided that the amendments listed as ``relevant'' be considered as related to the bill or the subject of foreign affairs.  I further ask that all listed first-degree amendments be subject to second-degree amendments that are relevant to the first-degree amendments to which they are offered.  I ask consent that following the disposition of amendments, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage, without intervening action or debate; in addition, I ask consent that following passage, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on behalf of the Senate.
