I understand that several Senators on the other side have refused to allow the Senate to debate and vote on this bill, for one reason or another. That is unfortunate, because it provides the funding for many programs that have critical importance to the Nation's security. Let me mention a few:       It supports our counterterrorism strategy in South Asia,      the Horn of Africa, and the Far East. It responds to the      turbulent events in the Middle East and North Africa, and      threats on the Mexican border. It combats transnational      crime, piracy of intellectual property, and the denial of      fundamental freedoms. It promotes access for U.S. companies      to foreign markets. It provides the funds to operate and      secure our embassies and consulates that serve millions of      Americans while traveling, working and studying overseas. It      preserves U.S. influence in key international organizations      and alliances. And it responds to a massive famine in      Somalia, floods, and other humanitarian disasters.  We have to do this and much more with a budget allocation that is $6 billion below the President's request.  I worry that ``foreign aid'' today is a term often maligned and misunderstood. It is viewed by many as a form of charity, or a luxury we can do without, or that it is a sizable part of the Federal budget. But it is none of those things, as that list I just mentioned illustrates.
