President, I rise today to introduce the Parental Accountability, Recruitment, and Education National Training (PARENT) Act of 1999, which seeks to increase parental involvement in the educational lives of their children.  Mr. President, research, experience, and reason tell us that providing parents with opportunities to play active roles in their children's schools empowers them to help their children excel. When parents are actively involved in their child's education, not only do their own children go further, but their child's school also improves to the benefit of all students. And, as I have witnessed in Rhode Island, and I am sure my colleagues can attest to this in their home states, our best schools are not simply those with the finest teachers and principals, but those which strive to engage parents in the education of their children.  A recent National PTA survey revealed that 91% of parents recognize the importance of involvement in their children's schools. Unfortunately, even as we extol the virtue of parental involvement, we must recognize that reality falls far short of the goal. The National PTA survey also found that roughly half the parents surveyed felt they were inadequately informed about ways in which they could participate in schools, or even gain access to basic information about their children's studies and their children's teachers. There are also other obstacles to greater parental involvement, such as working parents who find it difficult to get to schools and be involved or parents who have had negative schooling experiences and are wary of entering schools to participate in their children's education.  With 73% of parents favoring a federal effort to help schools get parents more involved with their children's education, the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) provides an opportunity to help bring schools and parents together, and to ensure parents have the tools to meaningfully and effectively get involved in their children's education. While the ESEA currently contains parental involvement provisions, they mainly apply to Title I schools and students, and have not been fully implemented.  That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murray, Kennedy, Harkin, and Bingaman and Representative Lynn Woolsey in the other body in introducing the PARENT Act. This legislation would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) to bolster existing and add new parental involvement provisions.  The PARENT Act requires that all schools implement effective, research-based parental involvement best practices. It also seeks to improve parental access to information about their children's education and the school's parental involvement policies; ensure that professional development activities provide training to teachers and administrators on how to foster relationships with parents and encourage parental involvement; utilize technology to expand efforts to connect schools and teachers with parents; and promote parental involvement in drug and violence prevention programs. In addition, the PARENT Act requires any state seeking funding under ESEA to describe, implement, and evaluate parental involvement policies and practices.  To succeed in the endeavor of increasing parental involvement, we must depend on parents, teachers, and school administrators throughout the country to work collaboratively to implement effective programs. However, federal leadership is needed to provide schools, teachers, and parents with the tools adequate to this task.  Mr. President, the bottom line of federal support for education is to increase student achievement. Parental involvement is an essential component to ensuring that our students succeed. This legislation is strongly supported by the National PTA, and I urge my colleagues to join Senators Murray, Kennedy, Harkin, Bingaman, and me in supporting the PARENT Act, and working for its inclusion in the ESEA reauthorization.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  The being no objection, bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1556       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Parental Accountability,      Recruitment, and Education National Training Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.       Except as otherwise specifically provided, whenever in this      Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an      amendment     to, or a repeal of, a section or other provision, the      reference shall be considered to be made to a section or      other provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act      of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Parents are the first and most influential educators of      their children.       (2) The Federal Government must provide leadership,      technical assistance, and financial support to States and      local educational agencies, as partners, in helping the      agencies implement successful and effective parental      involvement policies and programs that lead to improved      student achievement.       (3) State and local education officials, as well as      teachers, principals, and other staff at the school level,      must work as partners with the parents of the children they      serve.       (4) Research has documented that, regardless of the      economic, ethnic, or cultural background of the family,      parental involvement in a child's education is a major factor      in determining success in school.       (5) Parental involvement in a child's education contributes      to positive outcomes such as improved grades and test scores,      higher expectations for student achievement, better school      attendance, improved homework completion rates, decreased      violence and substance abuse, and higher rates of graduation      and enrollment in postsecondary education.       (6) Numerous education laws now require meaningful parental      involvement, including title I of the Elementary and      Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), the      Goals 2000: Educate America Act (20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.), the      Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), and the Individuals      with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), and      elements of these laws should be extended to other Federal      education programs.
