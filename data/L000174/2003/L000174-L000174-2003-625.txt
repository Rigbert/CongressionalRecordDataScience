President, after years of shortchanging our nation's crime labs, the Administration has unveiled a proposal to spend more than $1 billion over five years on forensic DNA programs. This proposal is overdue, but it is welcome, and it will make a difference.  For two years I have repeatedly urged the Administration and House Republicans to fully fund existing programs aimed at eliminating the DNA backlog crisis and, in particular, the inexcusable backlog of untested rape kits. Until now, the Justice Department has simply refused to make this a high priority. In the meantime, untested critical evidence has been piling up while rapists and killers remain at large, while victims continue to anguish, and while statutes of limitation expire.  I am pleased that the Administration's new commitment to funding DNA programs includes $5 million a year for post-conviction DNA tests that can be used by inmates to prove their innocence. Post-conviction DNA testing has already been used to exonerate more than 120 prisoners nationwide, including 12 awaiting execution. Last year the Justice Department cancelled plans to spend $750,000 on a post-conviction DNA testing initiative, and diverted the money to another program. It is heartening that the Department at last has recognized the importance of ensuring that the power of modern science, in the form of DNA testing, is available to help prosecutors and defendants alike establish the truth about guilt and innocence.  Clearly, DNA testing is critical to the effective administration of justicein 21st Century America. But like every forensic tool, DNA testing is only as accurate as the labs and technicians that process the evidence. When we shortchange our labs, we shortchange the whole criminal justice system. The appalling situation in Houston, Texas, is only the most recent example.  Last December, a state audit conducted by a team of forensic scientists uncovered widespread problems at the Houston Police Department's crime laboratory. These problems included poorly trained technicians, shoddy recordkeeping, and holes in the roof that allowed rain to possibly contaminate samples. A Houston councilwoman who toured the lab last June described trash buckets and water buckets throughout the facility: ``They were having to move tables around, because some of the leaks were near and sometimes above where the analysis was occurring.''  Elizabeth Johnson, a DNA expert familiar with the Houston police lab, has pointed to serious problems beyond holes in the ceiling problems that suggest widespread incompetence or even corruption. Dr. Johnson has testified that lab technicians often vastly exaggerated the probability of a defendant's guilt, while mischaracterizing evidence that exonerated a defendant as ``inconclusive.'' In many cases, she found, lab technicians' reports, which were used to make critical decisions throughout the criminal justice system, asserted conclusions that were entirely unsupported by their data: not technical errors; not misjudgments; but flat-out fabrications.  I have spoken before about the disastrous consequences of sloppy lab work. Two years ago, an FBI investigation found that a police chemist in Oklahoma City was routinely exaggerating her results. At least one man who was convicted on the basis of the chemist's so-called ``expert'' testimony was later exonerated and released from prison. He had already served 15 years of a 65-year sentence.  There are many other cases in which people have been wrongly convicted because forensic specialists were incompetent, or because they fabricated or overstated test results to support the prosecution's theory of the case. In 1997, we learned about major problems at the FBI's crime labs, ranging from unqualified forensic scientists to contamination of evidence and the doctoring of laboratory reports. Before that, there were similar problems in various state crime labs. Police in Baltimore are currently reviewing 480 cases worked on by a former police chemist who testified at a 1983 rape trial against a defendant who was later exonerated.  While the situation in Houston is not unprecedented, it is particularly alarming. That is because Houston is in Harris County, the execution capital of the United States. Harris County sends more people to death row in a year than many states do in a decade. More defendants from Harris County have been executed than from any other county in the country.  Harris County prosecutors are now busily reviewing their closed cases to determine whether they involved evidence processed by the Houston police lab. They have already ordered new DNA testing in more than 20 cases, including 7 cases in which the defendant was sentenced to death. Ultimately, several hundred cases will need to be retested.  Retesting has already cleared one man, Josiah Sutton. Sutton was only a teenager when he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years for rape, based largely on a bogus DNA match by the Houston police lab. It now appears that he spent the last 4\1/2\ years in prison for nothing.  How many Josiah Sutton's has Harris County wrongfully convicted? Probably quite a few. Hundreds of people have been convicted using DNA evidence processed by the Houston police lab. The fact that the very first batch of cases to be retested has exposed a wrongful conviction suggests that Sutton may be just the tip of the iceberg.  How many more people will be cleared through retesting? That is a trickier question. According to the state audit, the Houston police lab routinely consumed most if not all of the evidence available for testing, with little or no regard for the importance of conserving samples. This practice will greatly limit the possibility for retesting in the hundreds of cases now under review.  DNA testing is an extraordinary tool for uncovering the truth, whatever the truth may be. It can show us conclusively, even years after a conviction, where mistakes have been made. But it cannot show us anything if there is no evidence to test. By needlessly consuming entire DNA samples, the Houston police lab may have destroyed the only key to freedom for more than one wrongly convicted person.  The failure to preserve DNA evidence is a problem in many parts of the country, but it seems to be an official policy in Harris County. In 1997, DNA testing exonerated Harris County defendant Kevin Byrd only because, by pure luck, the 12-year rape kit had not been destroyed pursuant to bureaucratic routine. The very week that Byrd was freed, however, Harris County officials systematically destroyed the rape kits from 50 other old cases, citing a lack of storage space.  No doubt many of the rape kits that Harris County destroyed that week and over the years were analyzed under the leaky ceilings of the Houston police lab. But even with the best of intentions, Harris County prosecutors will not be able to resurrect that evidence for retesting. There may well have been another Josiah Sutton or two among those cases--defendants who were wrongfully convicted based on bad lab work--but without the evidence to prove it, we will probably never know.  The essence of law enforcement is seeking the truth, not hiding from it or destroying evidence in a fit of pique or to save face. The disdain for science, truth, and justice we have seen in Houston, at the heart of the nation's capital punishment system, is an utter disgrace.  All of which is to say that I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the Administration's new DNA initiative. One billion dollars will give States the help they desperately need to improve the quality and credibility of their crime labs, and to eliminate the backlog of untested DNA evidence. Five million dollars a year will go a long way toward ensuring that no deserving inmate is denied post-conviction DNA testing because he or she cannot afford to pay for it.  In his remarks announcing the DNA Initiative, Attorney General Ashcroft said he ``looked forward to working with the Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to develop legislation that provides appropriate post-conviction DNA testing to federal inmates.''  I welcome that, but I have a better idea. With Chairman Hatch's agreement, I would like to issue a bipartisan invitation to Attorney General Ashcroft to come to talk to us in open committee about a legislative proposal that is already written, has already been refined and debated, and has already received overwhelming bipartisan support.  I refer to the Innocence Protection Act, a modest and practical package of reforms that aims at reducing the risk of error in capital cases. The reforms proposed by the IPA are designed to create a fairer system of justice, where the problems that have sent innocent people to death row would not occur, and where victims and their families could be more certain of the accuracy, and finality, of the results.  More specifically, the Innocence Protection Act would ensure that post-conviction DNA testing is available in appropriate cases, where it can help expose wrongful convictions, and that DNA evidence is adequately preserved throughout the country. The bill also addresses one of the root causes of wrongful convictions--inadequate defense representation at trial.  Last year, the IPA won the support of a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and more than half the entire House of Representatives. Together with other lead sponsors--Senator Gordon Smith, Senator Susan Collins, Representative Bill Delahunt, and Representative Ray LaHood--I am committed to reintroducing the IPA this year and getting it signed into law.  The path to prompt reform is through legislation that is already written and fine-tuned. The path to consensus is through legislation that has already received broad bipartisan support. And the path to addressing the fundamental problems in our criminaljustice system is through legislation that addresses the most common cause of wrongful convictions--inadequate defense counsel--as well as their most conspicuous solution--DNA testing. The path, in each case, is the Innocence Protection Act.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the Innocence Protection Act this year.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record 2 articles, one from the Washington Post, the other from the New York Times, which describe the ongoing investigation into the Houston police lab.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 11, 2003]               Review of DNA Clears Man Convicted of Rape                            (By Adam Liptak)       When Josiah Sutton went on trial for rape in 1999,      prosecutors in Houston had little to build a case on. The      victim was the only witness, and her recollection was faulty.      But they did have the rapist's DNA, and technicians from the      Houston police crime laboratory told the jury that it was a      solid match.       That was enough to persuade the jurors to convict Mr.      Sutton and send him to prison for 25 years.       But new testing has conclusively demonstrated that the DNA      was not Mr. Sutton's, the Houston Police Department said      yesterday.       The retesting is part of a review of the laboratory that      began after a scathing state audit of its work led to a      suspension of genetic testing in January. Mr. Sutton's      apparent exoneration is the first to result from the review.       Legal experts say the laboratory is the worst in the      country, but troubles there are also seen in other crime      laboratories. Standards are often lax or nonexistent,      technicians are poorly trained and defense lawyers often have      no money to hire their own experts. Questions about the work      of laboratories and their technicians in Oklahoma City,      Montana and Washington State and elsewhere have led to      similar reviews. But the possible problems in Houston are      much greater. More defendants from Harris County, of which      Houston is a part, have been executed than from any other      county in the country.       ``This is an earthquake,'' Mr. Sutton's lawyer, Bob Wicoff,      said. ``The ramifications of this for other cases, for death      penalty cases, is staggering. Thousands of cases were      prosecuted on the basis of this lab's work.       The audit of the Houston laboratory, completed in December,      found that technicians had misinterpreted data, were poorly      trained and kept shoddy records. In most cases, they used up      all available evidence, barring defense experts from refuting      or verifying their results. Even the laboratory's building      was a mess, with a leaky roof having contaminated evidence.       The police and prosecutors vowed to retest DNA evidence in      every case where it was used to obtain a conviction. But they      remained confident that the laboratory's problems were      primarily matters of documentation and testimony that was not      conservative enough.       The Sutton case has changed that.       ``It's a comedy of errors, except it's not funny,'' said      State Representative Kevin Bailey, a Houston Democrat who is      chairman of a committee of the Texas Legislature      investigating the laboratory. ``You don't need to be a      scientist to know that you have to wear surgical gloves. You      have to tag evidence. You need to not have a leaky roof      contaminating evidence.''       The Houston police have turned over some 525 case files      involving DNA testing to the Harris County district      attorney's office, which has said that at least 25 cases      warrant retesting, including those of seven people on death      row. Both numbers will grow significantly as more files are      collected and analyzed, Marie Munier, the assistant district      attorney supervising the project, said.       Mr. Bailey said he was troubled that the retesting was      being conducted under the supervision of Harris County      prosecutors.       ``I have lost confidence in the Police Department and the      district attorney's office to handle this,'' Mr. Bailey said.      ``I'm really bothered by the fact that the review is being      done by the same people who allowed the errors to go on and      prosecuted these cases and so have a stake in the outcomes of      the review.''       Joseph Owmby, who prosecuted Mr. Sutton, said his office      had not received a formal report from Identigene Inc. of      Houston, the outside laboratory his office hired to perform      the retesting.       ``If he has been exonerated,'' Mr. Owmby said, ``we also      have an eyewitness identification, and we will have to work      through that. If he was exonerated, it certainly doesn't make      me feel any better.''       Mr. Owmby said his confidence in the police laboratory's      work had been shattered. ``We're not scientists,'' he said.      ``We were presenting evidence that was presented to us. There      is a big problem. We are treating it as a big problem.''       Houston police officials issued a statement yesterday      confirming Mr. Sutton's exclusion, but noted that they had      not received a formal report from Identigene.       At a hearing on Thursday, Chief C. O. Bradford said his      department had shut down its DNA laboratory and begun an      internal affairs department investigation on whether there      was criminal or other wrongdoing. Chief Bradford added that      there should be a ``cease and desist'' on executions in the      relevant cases until the retesting is complete.       ``There certainly is a fear that people were wrongly      accused, wrongly convicted or received longer sentences than      they should have,'' he said last week in an interview in      Austin.       William C. Thompson, a professor of criminology at the      University of California at Irvine who has studied the      Houston police laboratory's work, said, ``The likelihood that      there are more innocent people convicted because of bad lab      work is almost certain.''       Elizabeth A. Johnson, a DNA expert retained by Mr. Sutton's      lawyers, has appeared as a defense witness in about 15 cases      involving the crime laboratory and is perhaps its most vocal      critic.       In one rape case, Dr. Johnson said, a technician testified      that a swab of the victim found semen, even though initial      laboratory reports said there was no semen present. In other      cases evidence that technicians said was inconclusive      actually exonerated the defendant. Often, she said,      technicians would vastly exaggerated the probability of a      defendant's guilt.       There was, she said, ``an overall lack of understanding of      how this work is done and what it means.''       She said the laboratory was particularly weak where the      sample involved a mixture of DNA from two people.       ``They can't do a sperm sample separation to save their      lives,'' Dr. Johnson said. ``If you put a gun to their heads      and said you have to do this or you will die, you'd just have      to kill them.''       There is plenty of blame to go around in the Sutton case,      legal experts said, and it suggests a need for an independent      investigation and systemic reform.       ``The criminal justice system in Houston is completely      dysfunctional,'' Professor Thompson said. He examined eight      DNA cases processed by the Houston police at the request of      KHOU-TV, the television station that first called attention      to the laboratory's problems in several reports in November.       In Mr. Sutton's case, there happened to be a small amount      of evidence available for retesting. That is seldom the case      in Houston, according to the state's audit.       Mr. Sutton's mother, Carol Batie, said her son's main      concern on hearing there would be retesting was that so      little evidence remained available.       ``We were concerned it would come back inconclusive,'' Mr.      Batie said.       Mr. Bailey, the state representative, said the Sutton case      should change the usual presumptions in cases where retesting      is impossible. ``Unless there is other strong corroborative      evidence,'' he said, ``those people at the very least deserve      retrials.''       The victim in the Sutton case identified him, but her      testimony has been questioned. She said she was raped by two      men. Both were around 5 feet 7 inches tall, she said; one      weighed 135 pounds, the other weighed 120.       Five days later, she saw several men on the street and      identified two of them as her attackers. DNA evidence      excluded one man at the time, meaning one of her two      identifications was demonstrably mistaken from the start. Mr.      Sutton, moreover, is 5 foot 10 and weighs more than 200      pounds.       The Sutton case, said David Dow, a University of Houston      law professor who represents death row inmates in capital      appeals, ``is probably the tip of the iceberg.''       ``There were two different problems in the crime lab--     scientific incompetence and corruption,'' Professor Dow said.      ``That's a deadly combination. Once you have corruption,      there is no reason to think that this is limited to DNA cases      or cases where there is scientific evidence of any sort.''       ``If this were a death penalty case,'' he added, ``Sutton      may well have been executed by now.''                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2003]     Tex. Lawmakers Probe Lab Over Reports of Tainted DNA Evidence                          (By Karin Brulliard)       Austin, Feb. 28.--The Texas Legislature has launched an      inquiry into the operations of the Houston Police crime lab      after reports that the lab's shoddy facilities and faulty      practices may have led to contamination of DNA evidence in      hundreds of cases.       An independent audit by the state in December uncovered the      problems. In January, police officials suspended DNA testing      at the lab, and the Harris County District Attorney's office      began a review of all cases that involved evidence processed      there.       So far, the DNA from at least 14 convictions will be      retested because of information secured during the reviews,      said District Attorney Charles A. Rosenthal Jr. At least      three involve death row cases.       Houston is in Harris County, which has sent more people to      death row than any other county in Texas.       ``It's a serious, serious problem,'' said state Rep. Kevin      Bailey, a Democrat from Houston who is chairman of the House      General Investigating Committee, which will hold hearings on      the lab next week. ``The public has a right to expect a fair      and accurate analysis     by a metropolitan crime lab. When we find out that we've not      had that, it causes people to question the whole criminal      justice system.''       In the December audit, a team of forensic scientists      detailed problems that included inadequate recordkeeping,      poor maintenance of equipment and a leaky roof that it said      could lead to contamination of DNA samples.       City Councilwoman Carol Alvarado, who toured the facility      June 11 after receiving complaints from lab employees, said      the roof was in poor shape.       ``These were not just leaks; these were holes,'' she said.      ``There were trash buckets and water buckets throughout the      lab. They were having to move tables around, because some of      the leaks were near and sometimes above where the analysis      was occurring.''       Alvarado said she reported her findings to the council June      19, but funding issues prevented the council from awarding a      contract for roof repair until January.       Houston Police Department spokesman Robert Hurst refused to      comment on the lab.       Elizabeth Johnson, who directed the Harris County DNA lab      until 1996, said water from a leak could taint samples. But      she also said the city police lab's problems run deeper than      a leaky roof.       ``Every single case I ever reviewed of theirs had at least      one serious error and sometimes more than one error,'' she      said. ``I'm not talking about a typo. I'm talking about      things like controls being missing. Most common were that      their reports would say one thing, and their data didn't      support that at all.''       Rosenthal said any DNA retests that reveal errors will lead      to new trials.       Bailey said the use of DNA evidence from a flawed lab      reveals the ``win and get a conviction at all costs''      attitude of the district attorney's office. He wants hearings      to determine whether an external review is necessary.       ``No innocent people should be convicted because of faulty      analysis,'' he said. ``At this point, I'm skeptical as to      whether the Houston lab can analyze their own mistakes.''                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 13, 2003]  Tex. Execution Stayed at Last Minute--Supreme Court Considers Review                           (By Charles Lane)       The Supreme Court granted a last-minute stay of execution      last night to a Texas death-row inmate who says he is      innocent of the murder of which he was convicted 23 years      ago, setting the stage for another high-profile debate at the      court over alleged flaws in the U.S. capital punishment      system.       In a brief order issued about 10 minutes before officials      were to administer a lethal injection to Delma Banks Jr., the      justices said that he should be kept alive at least long      enough for them to consider his request for a full-scale      hearing on claims that his 1980 trial in Bowie County, Tex.,      was marred by prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective defense      counsel and racially discriminatory jury selection.       Banks, an African American, was convicted of killing a      white teenager by an all-white jury. If his execution had      proceeded last night, he would have been the 300th person put      to death in Texas since the state resumed executions in 1982.       It was unclear when the court might meet to consider Banks'      petition. Its next scheduled closed-door conference is March      21. However, the stay may be a favorable sign for Banks      because it required the votes of at least five justices, and      a decision to hear his case could be made with the assent of      just four justices.       Consistent with growing public concern over the possibility      of wrongful death sentences, the court has shown interest      recently in the issues raised by Banks' appeal, though its      rulings have not always come out the way death penalty      opponents would have liked.       The court ordered a lower court review of another Texas      man's death sentence last month, ruling that a case could be      made that jury selection at his trial was racially biased;      last year, it abolished capital punishment for the mentally      retarded. But also last year, the court rebuffed an effort to      seek abolition of the death penalty for juveniles and let      Virginia proceed with the execution of a murderer who had      been represented at trial by the murder victim's former      lawyer.       ``Delma Banks Jr., who has maintained his innocence from      the beginning, found justice in the courts today, and we are      hopeful that this delay will allow a meaningful review of the      serious claims in his case,'' Banks' lawyer, George Kendall      of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, said in a      prepared statement. ``The court's decision to stay the      execution in order to potentially hear the significant claims      put before it demonstrates that our tribunals will not turn a      blind eye to egregious miscarriages of justice.''       Bobby Lockhart, district attorney of Bowie County, said,      ``Factually, [Banks] was guilty, and legally the jury found      him guilty. As to the death penalty, that's up to the Supreme      Court. I think that the Supreme court will review the case      and find that he was guilty, and I think there's no way the      stay [of execution] will be extended beyond 30 days.''       Banks' case has attracted attention in part because of the      supporters who have rallied to his cause, including former      FBI director William S. Sessions and two former federal      appeals court judges.       In a brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of      Banks' request for a stay, Sessions and his colleagues said      that the Banks case is tainted by ``uncured constitutional      errors'' that are ``typical of those that have undermined      public confidence in the fairness of our capital punishment      system.''       Banks, then 21, was convicted in 1980 of shooting his co-     worker Richard Wayne Whitehead, 16, to death with a .25-     caliber handgun.       Banks' lawyers argue that prosecutors wrongfully suppressed      evidence that one of their key witnesses, who has since      recanted, lied on the stand. Banks' attorneys also argue that      his inexperienced defense lawyers offered little evidence to      counter prosecutors' claims that Banks deserved the death      penalty, even though he had no previous criminal record.       Prosecutors kept African Americans off the jury, they      contend, producing the all-white panel that convicted Banks      and sentenced him to death in the course of two days of legal      proceedings.       No physical evidence linked Banks to the crime. But Banks      was the last person seen with Whitehead, and prosecutors said      their case against him is strong. Last week, the New Orleans-     based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, reversing a      federal district judge's ruling in favor of Banks, permitted      his execution to proceed, on the grounds that the alleged      flaws in his trial were not substantial enough to have      changed the outcome.       The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals this week refused to      block Banks' execution, and the Texas Board of Pardons and      Paroles would not hear his plea because it was filed too      late.       Because of the prolonged appeals process in his case, Banks      has been on death row while Texas conducted 299 executions,      the most of any state since the Supreme Court permitted      states to resume capital punishment in 1976.                          ____________________
