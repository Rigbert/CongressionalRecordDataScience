Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  I am doing this for one reason. My good friend, the gentleman from Washington, if I am not mistaken, voted for the Senate bill, and in the Senate bill they had no bag screening at all, period.  I read the paper today, and Mr. Mineta, unfortunately, did say what he said, and he is probably correct unless we do fund it; but I also see a couple of other Members jump up and holler in anguish, saying this is terrible, this is wrong, we are letting the American people down, who voted for the Senate bill.  * * * In reality, the Senate bill had no screening of baggage at all.
