President, I thank my colleagues. I will be very brief.  Colleagues, what we are debating is whether the Senate will be the Senate. If you vote in favor of this, you are voting for cloture, there will be no amendments then. We would have the opportunity, if we vote against cloture, for improving this bill.  I want to emphasize that if we take a short time to improve this bill, as Senator Lee, Senator Leahy, and Senator Paul want to do, this program continues to operate. It is not in any way going to harm our ability to fight terrorism. This program would stand.  I urge my colleagues to vote to carry out our constitutional obligation as Senators, to have real debate and vote against cloture.  I yield.                             Cloture Motion  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.  The legislative clerk read as follows:                             Cloture Motion       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the      provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate,      do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to      concur in the House amendment to S. 139, an act to implement      the use of Rapid DNA instruments to inform decisions about      pretrial release or detention and their conditions, to solve      and prevent violent crimes and other crimes, to exonerate the      innocent, to prevent DNA analysis backlogs, and for other      purposes.
