President.  First, let me commend Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar for the work they have done on this antitrafficking bill.  This is, in fact, a horrendous crime. Just a few months ago in my home State, in Bangor, a couple was arrested for allegedly trafficking a 13-year-old girl. That is what we are talking about, and that is why this legislation is so important.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill, and I commend Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar and others for working so hard on it.  The antitrafficking bill deals with the law enforcement piece of this horrendous problem. But we also need to pay attention to prevention programs. That is why this afternoon we will vote on a proposal that Senator Leahy and I, along with Senators Heitkamp, Ayotte, Murkowski, and Baldwin, have put forth to reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act programs, which already have expired. They expired in 2013.  These are absolutely critical programs for preventing homeless youth and runaway youth from ending up in the hands of sex traffickers. The runaway and homeless youth programs are comprised of three programs: the Street Outreach Program, the Basic Center Program, and the Transitional Living Program. They have helped thousands of our homeless youth meet their immediate needs and provided long-term residential services for those who, sadly, cannot be reunited with their families.  The amendment that we are offering complements the underlying bill by addressing prevention, intervention, and recovery service for trafficking victims, particularly among the most vulnerable population--our homeless youth.  According to a 2013 report by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council, homelessness is one of the most common risk factors for sex trafficking. Without access to food, shelter, and social supports, homeless young people often turn to what is termed ``survival sex;'' that is, a way to trade sex for a place to sleep, for food, and for other basic necessities.  Another recent report found that one in four homeless youth are victims of sex trafficking or engage in survival sex. Our amendment strengthens the existing programs by ensuring that service providers know how to identify trafficking victims and give these youth the support they need. In many cases these services can prevent these homeless and runaway youth from becoming victims in the first place.  In Maine, our homeless shelters are critical partners in the fight to end human trafficking. In Portland, for example, the Preble Street Resource Center has used Runaway and Homeless Youth Act resources to connect youth who need food, shelter, health services, and educational support. The Preble Street Anti-trafficking Coalition is currently helping approximately 50 trafficking victims whose ages range from 14 to 42. They enable them to start new lives.  New Beginnings, a great program in Lewiston, ME, and the Shaw House in Bangor, ME, are other organizations that have successfully leveraged Federal grants from the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program to provide shelter and services to homeless youth in my State. With this kind of support, young people can make their way off the street and away from criminals who will exploit them at a time when they are at their most vulnerable.  There are more than 1.6 million homeless teens in our country--a truly astonishing number. A growing number of these homeless youth identify themselves as LGBT. It is estimated that up to 40 percent of runaway or homeless youth are LGBT. Some of them have been kicked out of their own homes. Others have felt that there has been no place for them in their community. Our amendment would help ensure that those seeking services through the federally funded programs are not denied assistance based on their race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.  All homeless young people need access to safe beds at night and services during the day so that they never have to choose between selling their bodies and a safe place to sleep. I would like to thank Senator Leahy and Senator Heitkamp for being so passionate about this issue. They have worked with me to incorporate important feedback into our amendment, particularly from faith-based organizations.  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, a letter be printed that I have from numerous faith-based organizations endorsing our amendment. These organizations represent millions of people in all 50 States. They urge us to pass our legislation with that nondiscrimination clause intact.  They include, for example: Covenant House International, the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the Interfaith Alliance, the National Council of Jewish Women, the Metropolitan Community Churches, the Methodist Federation for Social Action, theUnited Church of Christ, Justice and Witness Ministries, and many others that are backing our amendment.  We have clarified that providers can still provide and offer sex-specific shelters and programming. By that, I mean all-girl shelters or all-boy shelters. The nondiscrimination clause is modeled--it is virtually identical to a provision enacted into law during the last Congress through the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act. Nothing, nothing in our amendment alters the ability of faith-based providers to give preference in hiring to people of their same faith.  The stand-alone bill on which our amendment is based was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 15 to 3. It has the support of nearly 270 organizations including, as I mentioned, many faith-based providers that serve homeless youth, other service providers, and antitrafficking groups. They all strongly support the reauthorization of these prevention, intervention, and treatment programs.  Our health care workers in Maine are also tremendous partners in helping to address trafficking crimes and their victims. Saint Joseph Hospital in Bangor has educated its clinicians to identify the signs of human trafficking among their patients. Congress must do more both to provide law enforcement with the tools it needs to pursue sex trafficking, but we cannot forget those prevention and intervention programs that are provided by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program.  By giving homeless youth the support and the services they need, we can help prevent them from becoming trafficked in the first place. These programs have provided lifesaving services and housing for America's homeless and runaway youth for 40 years. They are vital in addressing this serious problem. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment that Senator Leahy and I, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Ayotte, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Baldwin are offering today. It is so important.  Again, I want to especially thank Senator Heitkamp for all of her advocacy. She has done tremendous work.  I am very happy to yield the floor for her.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   March 11, 2015.       Dear Senators: As faith-based organizations representing      millions of people in all 50 states across our nation, we are      writing today regarding the Runaway Homeless Youth and      Trafficking Prevention Act. Based on the values of our      diverse faith traditions, we are committed to ensuring that      all victims of violence have equal access to justice, strong      legal protections and can access the lifesaving services they      need to move from crisis to stability. We urge you to pass      this legislation with the nondiscrimination clause intact.      Federal funds should not be used to discriminate.       In times of crisis, victims often turn to their faith      communities and leaders for guidance and support. Faith      leaders are on the front lines each day identifying victims,      providing refuge, referring victims and their families to      programs and services for homeless and trafficked youth, and      offering hope and healing. Part of meeting these needs      includes respecting the religious liberty of those receiving      services.       A study conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and      Human Services found that 46% of homeless youth had run away      from home because of physical abuse and 17% because of sexual      abuse. A growing number of homeless youth identify as LGBT,      and it is estimated that they comprise up to 40% of the      runaway homeless youth (RHY) population. We believe that ALL      vulnerable young people should have access to programs      designed to stop the cycle of victimization and provide      comprehensive solutions. Federal grantees must be prohibited      from discriminating against any youth based on their sexual      orientation or gender identity.       Thank you for your steadfast commitment to working with      faith communities to support vulnerable young people and      victims of trafficking. We look forward to working with you      to swiftly pass the Runaway Homeless Youth and Trafficking      Prevention Act.           Sincerely,       Catholics for Choice, Congregation Beit Simchat Torah,      Covenant House International, Evangelical Lutheran Church of      America, Global Faith and Justice Project, Global Justice      Institute, Interfaith Alliance, Jewish Labor Committee      Western Region, Methodist Federation for Social Action,      Metropolitan Community Churches, National Council of Jewish      Women;       National Center for Housing and Child Welfare, Religious      Coalition for Reproductive Choice, Religious Institute,      Society for Humanistic Judaism, The General Board of Church      and Society, United Methodist Church, The Jewish Federations      of North America, T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights,      Unitarian Universalist Association, Unitarian Universalist      Women's Federation, United Church of Christ, Justice and      Witness Ministries, Women's League for Conservative Judaism.
