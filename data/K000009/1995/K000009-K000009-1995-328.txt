Speaker, we are going to spend some time focusing on a very important issue that came before the Congress about a year ago called NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or as some of us would like to say, the agreement that some would call ``no more taking American jobs away someplace else, especially south of our border.''  If you have been reading the newspapers, though it is sometimes buried on page 17 or 25, you will note that in Mexico there is a severe financial crisis currently going on in that nation. the purpose of today's colloquy will be to discuss with my good friend, the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] and others who will join us, what this means for the American worker and what it means for the American taxpayer, as well as the citizens of Mexico, because this week we are introducing legislation which the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio] will talk about in just a second.  For those of us who opposed NAFTA, it is difficult to get up here and say ``I told you so,'' but if the pain were not so great for thousands of people in our country and thousands of people in Mexico, we would not be so compelled as we are today.  There is a new kind for foreign aid afoot in our land. It is called NAFTA. Because of the instability in Mexico, our taxpayers, with no vote occurring here in the Congress of the United States, our taxpayers are being asked to foot a multibillion dollar bail-out of the Mexican peso. We do not even get a seat at the table.  Congress has no vote. The taxpayers in my district have no vote. The players who are at the table are giving the whole set of transactions a very fancy name. They are calling it debt swaps. They are calling them peso bail-outs. They are calling it teso bonos.  The average person that lives on my street in Ohio doesn't know what all this is. Only people connected with Wall Street and the Federal Reserve are supposed to understand this. So today we are going to try to clear the air a bit, because what this deal is actually doing is asking our taxpayers to back up a minimum of $9 billion of loans to Mexico, and through the Federal Reserve an additional $5 billion plus, we don't know quite how much.  But of course it is the deposits of our people in our banks, that then make payments into the Federal Reserve, that creates Federal Reserve, so we are all connected to that system. And then there are additional funds coming from some of the commercial banks in this country that are having a whole lot to worry about at the moment.  Over this past year, if you think about it, our Federal Reserve has raised interest rates on the American people seven times. All of the press has been wondering why are they doing that, because wages aren't going up in America. There is no inflation. What is going on over at the Fed? In fact, some group of citizens demonstrated against a Fed a couple of weeks ago.  We understand what the Fed is up to. When you have got to discount losses that you are going to be taking on loans that went bad through the commercial banking system to countries like Mexico, and when you have to monetize $150 billion of trade deficit, you have a problem on your hands. They are taking it out in higher interest rates on the American people.  As my colleagues and I predicted, just 1 year after NAFTA, NAFTA has meant a worsening of America's trade position with Mexico. In fact, it has been cut in half. We were told, for example, in the auto industry that we would sell 60,000 more cars to Mexico, but if you look at this charter, this is the truth about what has been happening since NAFTA passed.                             {time}   1440  Prior to NAFTA passing, this red arrow represents how many cars and trucks Mexico was sending to the United States. Over the years we have only been sending a trickle into Mexico, represented by this little arrow.  But after NAFTA, which was supposed to make this arrow look better for our people and this arrow look worse, what do we have? We have more vehicles coming up from Mexico into the United States, and the trickle from the United States down to Mexico continues, largely automobiles going down to rental car agencies in Cancun and Yucatan and Mexico City where our people vacation. There has been no real growth of the middle class in Mexico.  With what has been happening in Mexico, what have we seen? Their currency, called the peso, has been nearly cut in half. It has been devalued by nearly 40 percent since the end of December.  What does this mean? That means that their goods will be cheaper on export, which means this number, whether it is cars or whether it is electrical wiring harnesses, whatever, it will be cheaper for them to send more into our marketplace and it will be much harder for the United States to send goods down there because our goods will become more expensive in their market.  Mr. DeFAZIO. If the gentlewoman will yield on that point.
