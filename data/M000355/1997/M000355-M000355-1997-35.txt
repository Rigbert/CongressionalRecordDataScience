 President, I just want to thank the distinguished majority leader for his leadership on this very important issue. In the judgment of this Senator, there is nothing more important than protecting the first amendment and giving American citizens an opportunity to participate in the political process.  I would say that is not just my view. That is the view of the United States Supreme Court. It is the view of the American Civil Liberties Union. The Court has said you have a constitutional right to support, to contribute to the candidate of your choice. So we are talking about fundamental first amendment rights in this debate.  I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues who have spoken during the course of this debate. The number of speakers has been roughly equal on both sides. Every one of the Senators who spoke on my side of this issue spoke in defense of the first amendment.  I also extend my gratitude and my appreciation to Tamara Somerville, my long-time assistant in this struggle to protect the first amendment. Nobody has ever worked harder, produced more brilliant subject matter, and done it with greater humor than she. So, my thanks to Tam, not only for her good work for me but also on behalf of the country, in defense of the first amendment.  I also want to thank her assistant, Lani Gerst, who did a remarkable job as well, for all of her help.  Mr. President, it has indeed been a wonderful debate. We will in all likelihood have it off and on again. It seems that is the history of this issue. It has been around a few times over the last 10 years, but I think the opposition to ruining the first amendment continues to grow. Today's cloture vote against cloture was the highest in 10 years.  So, I end today on an optimistic note, that the first amendment will, indeed, survive for another year.  I yield the floor.
