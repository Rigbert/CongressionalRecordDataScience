 The team was comprised of 15 Vermont students, ranging from grades 8 through 12, and seven alternates. The countrywide event, of which this was a part, is the Nation's highest precollegiate math competition.  In the individual competition, two Vermonters placed in the top 10. Both students achieved perfect scores, which qualified them to advance to a final round, which ultimately determined the ranking of the 10 students who received perfect scores. Following up perfection with an even tougher competition, Colin Sandon placed fifth overall, and David Rolnick placed tenth. Both Colin and David are high school seniors who will attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall.  Deserving of special mention--and special honor--is Mr. Anthony Trono, both founder and coach of the team. Tony Trono is a retired math teacher who had a long career teaching mathematics at Burlington High School.  Many years ago he began a program entitled the Vermont Talent Search, in which a math test is distributed to middle school and high school students. This was to be the first step in bringing Vermont students to the American Math League competition. The top achievers on the Vermont Talent Search tests are chosen for the team that competes in the American Mathematics League's competition.  Not content with working on this, and desiring to share his love of mathematics with students all over ourState, Tony Trono also runs a week-long summer math camp at the University of Vermont.  Because family reasons precluded him from accompanying the team this year, as he has done so often before, Barbara Unger chaperoned the team to Penn State. Like Tony a retired math teacher, from Middlebury Union High School, she said of Tony Trono, ``He has given his life to upper level math.'' How true that is!  Our Nation has excelled in the areas of math, engineering and science in large measure because of dedicated teachers such as Tony Trono--and Barbara Unger. They serve as role models to future generations of teachers, in addition to so ably training generation after generation of capable--and as the recent success of the Vermont All Stars indicates--superior mathematicians. Our State and our Nation owe a deep debt of gratitude to Tony Trono and to the many thousands of dedicated math teachers who follow along similar paths by sharing their love of mathematics.                          ____________________
