Speaker, in Washington, we hear a lot of talk about legislative train wrecks these days. But has anyone noticed that America is hitched to a runaway locomotive racing us toward a record trade deficit this year?  Today the Jobs and Fair Trade Caucus begins a monthly report to the American people called the Trade Deficit Watch. Our focus will be on how our Nation's trade deficit acts as an undertow in our economy, destroying good jobs, pulling wages down and displacing investments and industry here at home. The latest trade deficit figures released yesterday show that this year America will record an overall trade deficit of $164 billion, and just looking at the merchandise portion of that, we are talking about over $200 billion more of goods coming in here from abroad than we are able to sell in other markets. Folks, that is a bigger deficit than the budget deficit we are trying so hard to reduce.  How will a $164 billion trade deficit this year affect the American people? Let us take a look at the historic debate that is about to occur here in Congress on Medicare. How does our historic trade deficit play a role in this debate? The administration often uses the ratio of 20,000 jobs equaling every 1 billion dollars' worth of trade. Therefore, a $164 billion deficit will put 3 million more good American jobs at risk, added to the 2 million well-paying manufacturing jobs that were destroyed since the 1980's.  Unfair competition with low-wage, undemocratic countries puts continuing pressure, downward pressure, on wages in this country, and it is no surprise. Real wages and purchasing power in America have declined steadily over the past 20 years. Talk to your relatives, talk to people who work every day. They know what is happening with the buying power of their check.  Think about this: With 5 million lost jobs, that is 5 million paychecks, fewer paychecks, from which FICA, the portion of your paycheck that pays for Medicare and Social Security, is not being collected.  Think about this, too: Trade deficits have bled our manufacturing base almost dry. America is becoming a nation of temporary workers, the fastest growing segment job market in this country.  Before, a worker earning a decent wage at General Motors contributed 33 cents an hour to Medicare and Social Security through their FICA deduction. But a temporary worker at Manpower who typically earns only $5 an hour contributes one-fourth as much, about 8 cents an hour, one-fourth as much as a worker who worked in one of those good jobs that we have continually destroyed over the last 15 years in this country. No wonder the Medicare trust fund and Social Security are in trouble.  We have to keep finding new answers to try to refinance them. The high-skilled, high-wage jobs needed to fill the coffers of these programs are disappearing right before our eyes, and Washington has been asleep for 15 years at the wheel.  But corporations and their profits have continued to soar. In fact, Wall Street is slaphappy at this point because with low-paid workers, corporations are required to pay only one-fourth of what they had been paying before into trust funds like Medicare.  So, what is the Clinton administration and the Republican leadership doing about these trade deficits? Today the Committee on Ways and Means decided to adopt legislation which will allow more trade agreements to come down the pike without the American people having a say in the matter. This is called fast-track, and it is a bill that will force Congress to again consider trade agreements with no debate and without the ability to make amendments. In other words, it is a done deal when it comes to the floor.  We are again ceding our constitutional responsibilities to the trade ambassadors.  What, may I ask, are we on a fast track to? Are we going to continue putting every high-skilled, high-wage job with benefits in America on fast track right out of this country? It is happening in every single trade sector of this economy.  We have got to stop cashing out American industries and American jobs for the sake of a few trade deals that make a few traders and their shareholders rich but bankrupt the rest of America.  Look around the towns that you live in. How does the Clinton administration or Speaker Gingrich expect to balance the Federal budget or solve the Medicare problem if real wages for working Americans are locked in a race to the bottom because of trade policies that destroy good jobs and good wages here at home?                          ____________________
