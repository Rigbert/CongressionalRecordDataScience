Mr. Speaker, we have spent 2 good days of very legitimate debate. I was hoping we could avoid some of the things being said now. Although it may sound clear and true, I can say we face reality. This bill came out of our committee unanimously with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) supporting it. We want to go forth. The 318 figure coming from the Senate side, very frankly, I do not think is true. What we have to do is try to find the real dollars, and we are going to attempt to do that in conference.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas).
