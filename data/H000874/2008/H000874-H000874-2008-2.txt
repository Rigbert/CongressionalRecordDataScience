 Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of chairing a subcommittee on the Appropriations Committee many years ago, and Rob Nabors was my staff director, so I had an opportunity to work with him firsthand. And I want to echo the comments of Mr. Obey and, I know, the comments that Mr. Lewis will make.  Mr. Nabors is an individual of great intellect, great integrity, and great insight. And I want to frankly express on behalf of the House our appreciation to the President-elect for having the wisdom to choose somebody who knows the House so well and I think we will be able to work with very closely, although my impression is that his relationship with Mr. Obey may be modified just slightly.  Rob, congratulations to you.
