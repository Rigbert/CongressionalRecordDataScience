 President, I rise to speak on Senator Biden's amendment to add over $1 billion to the COPS Program. I am troubled by this amendment because it would declare these funds an emergency, siphoning away much needed funds that should go directly to the hurricane effort. The definition of an emergency includes situations that are necessary, or vital, sudden, urgent, and unforeseen. This amendment does not fit those characteristics.  I must also oppose this amendment because it lacks an offset. As a senior member of the Budget Committee and the chairman of the Finance Committee, I believe that we owe it to the taxpayers to be fiscally responsible with their tax dollars. Congress passed a budget, and we should stick by it.
