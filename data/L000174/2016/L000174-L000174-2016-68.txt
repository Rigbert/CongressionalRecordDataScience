President, Vermonters are proud of the innovation and creativity that generate successful businesses in our small State. And for years, Vermont's tech incubator, the Vermont Center for Emerging Technology, VCET, has been providing space for entrepreneurs to take the next steps in driving their startup businesses. As demonstrated in a recent profile of VCET in the New York Times, any objective observer can see Vermont as more than just an outdoor enthusiasts' playground--but also as an oyster community of emerging technologies and innovative thinking in building smart cities and the infrastructure to go with them.  It is no secret that Vermont is full of entrepreneurs eager to take the next steps in their respective fields. From ice cream to craft beverages, digital forensics to game programming, our State is home to many successful business endeavors. The Vermont Center for Emerging Technologies plays a key role in expanding Vermont's tech network while addressing the skilled labor shortage in the State. At its helm is president and fund manager David Bradbury, whose vision for the city of Burlington as an east coast Silicon Valley has driven the nonprofit's development and success.  Housed in a brick building in downtown Burlington, VCET is powered by a city-owned green energy grid with an enviable fast internet connection. The small but skilled team not only manages the Vermont Seed Capital Fund to administer initial funding for high-opportunity businesses and teams but also provides mentoring and advice to new startups. In collaboration with other Burlington-based companies and nonprofits, including BTV Ignite and Vermont HITECH, VCET encourages technology pioneers to dream big. With the help of local colleges offering courses in high growth fields, students learn the skills needed to thrive in a fast-changing economy. In turn, Vermont employers benefit from a larger pool of skilled technology workers, while employees gain access to better jobs and benefits.  The success of David's vision to grow Burlington into a technology hub while addressing the lack of skilled workers is rooted in something deeper than the rapidly expanding field of technology. Vermont's community and socially focused values bring neighbors together to benefit from shared experiences while providing local, sustainable, and accessible services. Corporate responsibility and attention to green energy reflect Vermont's commitment to lessening our environmental footprint while promoting energy conservation and efficiency. Whether encouraging Vermonters to pursue their passion for technology or forging new paths in the field, VCET is spurring economic development and technology jobs throughout our Green Mountain State.  I ask unanimous consent that a New York Times article from July 20, ``A `Smart' Green Tech Hub in Vermont Reimagines the Status Quo,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From The New York Times, July 20, 2016]    A ``Smart'' Green Tech Hub in Vermont Reimagines the Status Quo                         (By Constance Gustke)       Inside a plain brick building in Burlington lies the      Vermont Center for Emerging Technologies, a buzzing hipster      incubator that looks as if it could be in Silicon Valley. It      is powered invisibly by forces that any city would envy: a      green grid that is highly energy-efficient and a superfast      one-gigabit internet connection.       ``People would kill for this internet connection,'' said      Tom Torti, president of the Lake Champlain Regional Chamber      of Commerce. ``For us to grow our tech network, we needed to      double down on fiber network.'' The new Burlington economy is      going to be knowledge- and skills-based, he added.       This digital superhighway runs through beautiful      Burlington, a small city sandwiched between the distant Green      Mountains and the 125-mile-long Lake Champlain. It is an      outlier as far as emerging technology hubs and so-called      smart cities go. But Burlington, which has a lower      unemployment rate than Silicon Valley, is now spawning a wave      of technology pioneers.       The technology center, called VCET, provides free advice,      mentoring, seed money and gorgeous co-working spaces that are      available to entrepreneurs for a low fee. Students can use      these spaces free, so Max Robbins and Peter Silverman, 20-     year-old college students, are starting their business,      Beacon VT, there. It is similar to the dating site OkCupid,      but for employment, matching students with employers.       ``We're trying to give people an unfair advantage,'' said      David Bradbury, president and fund manager at VCET. ``There's      nothing too big that you can't dream here. And the snowball      is moving faster.''       An ultrahigh-speed internet backbone even helped Burlington      form a partnership with US Ignite, which aims to build the      next generation of internet apps, to form BTV Ignite. Its      goal is to mindfully build on the city's network and further      innovation, said Michael Schirling, who heads BTV Ignite.       ``Smart cities and new technologies have the potential to      change everything,'' said Mr. Schirling, a former Burlington      police chief ``When you put in the right building blocks, you      get a collision of ideas, which can become self-generating.      It's attitude and infrastructure.''       A result is that Burlington, once a timber port, has a      stunningly low unemployment rate of 2.3 percent. On the      downside, the city is also experiencing a skilled-labor      shortage; hundreds of coding jobs alone languish on job      boards. Burlington was named a TechHire city by the White      House in 2016 to help link local employers with local      workers, and to help these workers get the skills they need      for a fast-changing economy. The designation does not come      with funding, but it does help Burlington get grants for free      training.       The TechHire mandate in Burlington is to train 400      technology workers through 2020.       ``We want younger people to know that there are career      opportunities here,'' Mr. Torti said. ``We're trying to grow      our work force rather than importing it.''       A nonprofit organization known as Vermont Hitec is a      crucial part of that vision.       It works in partnership with local companies to offer boot      camps online and in classrooms that teach skills such as      medical coding and programming that lead to good-paying jobs      with benefits.       Vermont Information Processing, which develops software for      the beverage industry, has been working with Vermont Hitec so      that it can retrain or recruit employees as its business      grows and it becomes less interested in outsourcing.       Colleges like the University of Vermont, which offers a      biotechnology program, and Champlain College are also helping      solve the employment puzzle Champlain College offers degrees      in high-demand careers like digital forensics and game      programming, along with a special program for federal      employees who can get online degrees in high-growth fields.       ``We're responsive, nimble and entrepreneurial,'' said Don      Laackman, president of Champlain College. ``There's a      connection between employment needs and sources offered.''       Burlington got its first push into technology start-ups      when IDX Systems, a health care software maker, was founded      there in 1969. It was sold to General Electric about 10 years      ago.       ``IDX created a lot of wealth and talent, and these people      could be angel investors,'' Mr. Bradbury said. ``It was a      tipping point.''       The next wave of innovation has come from internet      companies like MyWebGrocer, which offers digital grocery      services, and Dealer.com, which offers digital marketing      services for the auto industry. Dealer.com became a legend in      Burlington after it was sold for $1 billion a couple of years      ago. Mike Lane, one of Dealer.com's founders and its former      chief operations officer, who is now on the VCET board, is an      angel investor who has funded eight start-ups. One of his      investments is Faraday Inc., which uses data analytics to      help companies target customers.       ``In the future, there will be several $50 million to $100      million exits here,'' Mr. Lane said, ``along with other      larger ones mixed in.''       He credits Vermont's community and socially conscious      spirit with his success. ``We didn't buy the philosophy that      we had to be in a hot spot,'' said Mr. Lane, who returned to      Vermont after working in Cambridge, Mass. ``Even Zuckerberg      realized that he could have been anywhere to build      Facebook.''       That can-do spirit also inspired Marguerite Dibble, 26, who      began her firm GameTheory while she was still a student at      Champlain College. Its mission is to use gaming to inspire      behavior changes, such as teaching teens financial literacy.       ``In Burlington, I can call anyone and learn from their      experience,'' said Ms. Dibble, who was born in a small      Vermont town with no ZIP code. ``The degrees of separation      are lessened here. There's a shared Vermonti-ness.''       The energy to power GameTheory's innovation comes from      Burlington's green grid, which is owned by the city. The      state has long been one of the country's greenest. But in      2014, Burlington upped the ante by turning only to wind,      water and biomass to power the city--one of the first cities      in the nation to do so. There are also incentives for      reducing energy. Landlords, for example, can choose to have      free energy audits, and more than 100 have done so.       Other Burlington businesses also work hard to save energy      on their own. Seventh Generation, which makes environmentally      conscious household products and was founded in Burlington,      gives its employees bonuses for helping reduce greenhouse      gases. Like many other companies in Burlington, Seventh      Generation also aims to be socially responsible and was      formed as a B Corp, which means it has to meet social,      environmental, accountability and transparency standards.       With this focus on energy efficiency, the city's      electricity rates have not risen in eight years, said Neale      Lunderville, general manager of the Burlington Electric      Department. ``And there are no rate increases on the      horizon,'' he said, ``since we're not chasing the next      kilowatt-hour.''       Electric cars even have their own parking spaces with      chargers.       Burlington will eventually become a net-zero city, said the      mayor, Miro Weinberger. ``Our isolation promotes a commitment      to pride and place,'' he said.       The city that helped propel Senator Bernie Sanders also has      its own nonprofit urban farm called the Intervale Center. The      land was once an abandoned dumping ground with old tires and      cars. That space now contains 350 acres with bee hives,      commercial farms, greenhouses and other projects. Through its      food hub, local foods are delivered to area businesses and      individuals.       Intervale's farm incubator, a five-year program, even      teaches new farmers the ropes, said Travis Marcotte,      executive director of Intervale Center. ``They then      transition out of the Intervale,'' he said, ``So we're      spinning off whole farms.''       It is a hopeful message, Mr. Marcotte said.                          ____________________
