DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, we are taking some of the bills and issues out of the House-passed energy bill that did not find their way into the conference report that is pending before the Senate that the House has already passed. So the major piece of legislation, the Energy Policy Act of 2004, is a restatement of the energy conference report that is pending in the Senate, the ANWR AML bill. There are amendments against ANWR that have failed, but we have had votes on ANWR in this House in the debate on the energy bill leaving the House. The U.S. refinery revitalization bill is a bill that we anticipate being on suspension. The ANWR AML bill will be under rule.
