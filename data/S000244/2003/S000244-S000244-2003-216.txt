Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend my friend from Maryland and my friend from Texas for being very consistent on the issue of retroactivity. Retroactivity is in here to prevent a race to the courthouse to avoid the new rules that are contained in this bill, should it be enacted into law. But, then again, they were against the retroactive tax cut. The tax cut that was enacted into law just a little while ago is retroactive to the first of January and, as a result of that retroactivity, there is going to be a reduction in withholding rates beginning the first of July that would be twice the amount if it were not retroactive.  So I guess they are against providing benefits of good legislation retroactively to anybody, because they are against good legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 4 minutes.
