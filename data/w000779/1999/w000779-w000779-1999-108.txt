President, today Senator Snowe and I are introducing legislation to provide seniors with insurance coverage for prescription drugs. This legislation, the Seniors Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act, SPICE, is the only bipartisan, market-based approach to provide seniors with choice and access to coverage that is actually paid for. It will give seniors the same kind of coverage that their member of Congress has.  The key issue for seniors around our nation, when it comes to the issue of prescription drugs, is affordability. Our proposal will assure that each and every senior who voluntarily chooses to enroll in a SPICE plan will have the bargaining power of HMOs and of the large insurers whose job it is to get the best price they can. At least 13 million seniors have no prescription drug coverage at all. Those seniors get penalized twice: they have to pay all their costs, and they pay more because they can't get the negotiated rate that the insurers and HMOs can. This bill will level the playing field for those seniors giving them affordability and access.  We know the kinds of drugs that are coming on the market now can help save lives, better the health status of an older person and, in many instances, save dollars because seniors taking their prescription drugs as they are told to by their doctor will prevent costly hospitalizations and the progression of disease. If we were to create Medicare today from scratch, there would be no questions about including prescription drug coverage. If we want to assure that Medicare beneficiaries stay healthy longer we must provide prescription drug coverage. If we want to be thoughtful, prudent purchasers of health care, we must find a way to assure seniors access to the drugs.  I believe the Snowe-Wyden proposal is that thoughtful, prudent and reasonable way. It assures a variety of options for coverage, and it assures that we bring real dollars to the table to pay for the program. There is no smoke and mirrors, no IOUs or other budget gimmicks in this plan.  The Snowe-Wyden proposal will be funded by funding from the non-Social Security on-budget surplus and a 55-cent increase in the tobacco tax. During this body's deliberations of the budget resolution, an amendment that Sen. Snowe and I offered received 54 votes, including 12 Republican votes to do just this--fund a prescription drug benefit for seniors with an increase in the tobacco tax.  The SPICE legislation creates a senior-oriented program using the Federal Employees Benefit Program (FEHBP) as a model to provide benefits that include prescription drugs and other non-Medicare covered benefits. This benefit would be open to every beneficiary and be voluntary. However, if the senior elected coverage later rather when they were first eligible, the individual would pay incrementally more the longer he or she waited to choose a comprehensive coverage option.  The individual senior would be able to select from an array of drug policies and Medicare+Choice plans with prescription drugs coverage. This would be voluntary. No senior would have to change what their current coverage is if they do not choose to do so. All plans would be offered by private sector companies. For beneficiaries under 150 percent of the poverty level--$12,075 for a single senior and $16,275 for a couple, the federal government would pay the entire premium. For those between 150 percent and 175 percent of the federal poverty level, the amount the federal government would pay phases down from 100 percent of premium to 25 percent of the premium amount. For beneficiaries at 175 percent of poverty and over, the federal government would pay 25 percent of the premium amount.  Our SPICE benefit will be administered by a new Board that would be separate from the Health Care Financing Administration but report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Board would approve plan designs and premium submissions, approve and distribute consumer education materials, develop enrollment procedures and make recommendations concerning additional funding, further ability to pay mechanisms and other steps needed to assure continuing availability of comprehensive coverage as seniors' health needs change over time.  Many of us would prefer to do an overhaul of Medicare and modernize it to include benefits like prescription drugs. However, the thirteen million Medicare beneficiaries who need coverage and the millions who have coverage that does not truly help them, need a way to get meaningful coverage today. This proposal will do that.                                 ______                                       By
