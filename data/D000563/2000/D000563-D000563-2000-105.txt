There was a bipartisan coalition in the House that endorsed the Democratic bill, the one that really works, the only one endorsed by virtually every medical group in America that understands patients ought to have the benefit of a doctor's judgment, not an insurance company's judgment, when it comes to critical health care.  They have created their own Trojan horse, this phony bill on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Honestly, I think the American people are going to see through it.
