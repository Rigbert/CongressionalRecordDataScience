 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:45 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday May 4. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and following the time for the two leaders, the Senate then begin a period of morning business for up to 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader or his designee and the final 30 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee; provided that following morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 381, S. 1637, the FSC/ETI JOBS bill, and the time until 12:30 p.m. be equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee or their designees.  I further ask consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party luncheons.
