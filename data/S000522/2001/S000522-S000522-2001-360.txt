Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  First of all, Mr. Chairman, let me again say that the underlying bill is a good bill. This is a strengthening amendment, and I rise in very strong support of it. This amendment is about stopping genocide, Mr. Chairman, the deliberate and systematic attempt to eliminate an entire people in southern Sudan, by cutting off the flow of U.S. dollars to entities that are making genocide possible.  The whole world knows, Mr. Chairman, that the Khartoum regime routinely bombs schools and hospitals, and uses enslavement, mass rape, and starvation as weapons of war against black Christians and animists in the south. The good news, until 1997, was that the south was likely to win its independence and an end to the bloodshed. However, then Khartoum got foreign companies from China, Malaysia, and even Canada to develop oil fields and build a pipeline.                              {time}  1430  The equation is simple: By selling oil to the west, Khartoum can buy anarmy that can destroy the south and is destroying the south. We all know that the devastation is absolutely numbing and frightful. Two million people have been killed. Millions more have been wounded, and over 4 million people have been displaced.  Oil revenues have enabled the government to double spending on its war machine since 1998. The government has used roads and air strips built for oil projects to launch military attacks. As one Sudanese victim put it, ``Oil has done nothing but bring us death.''  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and I have worked very hard to get New Jersey out of the mix with Talisman, which is a Canadian company. We held over 60,000 equities in that Talisman company as part of our New Jersey commitment to our State employees. Thankfully they got out of it, at some point kicking and screaming; but they are only one of many. There are many individual shareholders who will never read the disclosure information sent to them and maybe will not even care.  Mr. Chairman, we need to act in a collective manner that will have a high utility to say we want out. We want no part of this killing machine going on in Sudan. It is worth pointing out that the speaker of the Sudanese parliament does not make any bones about it. He said that the oil revenues will be used to buy war weapons. They are taking this oil revenue and buying guns and planes, and all kinds of other implements of destruction that are used against innocent men, women, and children.  The Talisman chief executive said that 70 percent of the oil revenue from the partnership will be going to the government. We are talking about a massive amount of money, $500 million per year, being put into the coffers of this war machine.  Finally, let me say the Bachus-Hall-Smith amendment prohibits any foreign company from raising capital or listing its securities in U.S. markets as long as the company is engaged in oil development in Sudan. We have trade sanctions in place against Sudan, but foreign companies continue to invest in Sudan, and then they freely and openly raise money in the U.S. stock market and bond market to finance these activities.  Shame on us, Mr. Chairman, if we do not realize that we are facilitating the deaths of so many innocent children. The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) should be commended as should the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and all of us who are trying to make some difference here to stop this facilitation.  Mr. Chairman, we can make a difference; and hopefully our European and other allies will follow suit. We must lead by example. That is what this amendment does.  Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  First of all, Mr. Chairman, let me again say that the underlying bill is a excellent piece of legislation. The Bachus-Hall-Smith strengthening amendment improves the Sudan Peace Act. This amendment is about stopping genocide, Mr. Chairman, the deliberate and systematic attempt to eliminate an entire people in southern Sudan, by cutting off the flow of U.S. dollars to entities that are making genocide possible.  The whole world knows, Mr. Chairman, that the Khartoum regime routinely bombs schools and hospitals, and uses enslavement, mass rape, and starvation as weapons of war against black Christians and animists in the south.  The good news, until 1997, was that the south was likely to win its independence and an end to the bloodshed. However, then Khartoum got foreign companies from China, Malaysia, and even Canada to develop oil fields and build a pipeline.  The equation is simple: By selling oil to the west, Khartoum can buy an army that can destroy the south and is indeed destroying the south. We all know that the devastation is absolutely numbing and frightful. Two million people have been killed. Millions more have been wounded, and over 4 million people have been displaced.  Oil revenues have enabled the government to double spending on its war machine since 1998. The government has used roads and air strips built for oil projects to launch military attacks. As one Sudanese victim put it, ``Oil has done nothing but bring us death.''  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) and I worked very hard a couple of years ago to get New Jersey out of complicity with genocide. We worked--and succeeded--in convincing state officials to divest its stock holdings of Talisman, which is a Canadian oil company. Before divestiture, New Jersey owned over 600,000 shares of Talisman. Thankfully, New Jersey got out, but New Jersey is only one of many institutional holders of this stock. There are many individual shareholders who own Talisman oblivious to its facilitation of genocide. Some argue mere disclosure is adequate. I respectfully disagree. Disclosure information sent to shareholders or potential buyers of the stock may or may not make any difference.  Mr. Chairman, we need to act in a collective manner in unison, if we are to help end this horrific slaughter. We want no part of this killing machine. It is worth pointing out that the speaker of the Sudanese parliament does not make any bones how oil money equals a more lethal military force. He has said that the oil revenues will be used to buy war weapons. The Sudanese dictatorship is taking oil revenues and buying weapons of every stripe to be used against innocent men, women, and children. We are talking about a massive amount of money, $500 million per year, being put into the coffers of this war machine.  The bottom line is this I say to my distinguished colleagues. The Bachus-Hall-Smith amendment prohibits any foreign company from raising capital or listing its securities in U.S. markets as long as the company is engaged in oil development in Sudan. We have trade sanctions in place against Sudan, but foreign companies continue to invest in Sudan, and then they freely and openly raise money in the U.S. stock market and bond market to finance these activities.  Shame on us, Mr. Chairman, if we do not realize that we are facilitating the deaths of so many innocent children. The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) should be commended for crafting this humanitarian amendment.  Mr. Chairman, we can make a difference; and hopefully our European and other allies will follow suit. We must lead by example. We must be serious about ending the nightmare endured by the Sudanese people.
