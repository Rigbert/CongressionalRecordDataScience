The article made the point that today's environmental groups, like NRDC, are more about their own prosperity than environmental protection. I still have those articles in my office. I thought one particular quote was especially fitting.  The author wrote of environmental groups:       Competition for money and members is keen. Litigation is      blood sport. Crises, real or not, is a commodity, and slogans      and sound bites masquerade as scientific fact.  That quote was written in 2001. It is still more true today in 2004. But it is not something new. That quote captures the way NRDC and its cohorts have been doing business for years. They should be responsible. They should be truthful. This type of activity goes beyond what the NRDC does with Federal tax dollars, but I intend to explore what NRDC and groups like it are also publishing and the extent of the rampant false claims made by these groups the American taxpayers help to fund each year.  We are not going to allow this to continue. They are getting into the types of discretionary grants we are dealing with through the EPA and other agencies. It is shameful that it is going on. We are now in a position, with the committee I chair, to do something about it. We intend to do that.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
