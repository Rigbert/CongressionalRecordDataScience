President, I rise today to offer congratulations to one of Maine's most impressive athletes. At the age of 95, Mr. Napoleon ``Nappy'' LaChance of Westbrook, ME, will be our State's oldest participant in the National Senior Olympics.  Mr. LaChance, who earned a gold medal in the fast walk competition in the last Maine Senior Olympics, will travel to Orlando, FL, tomorrow, October 23, to represent the State of Maine in that event.  Equally impressive, Mr. LaChance does not excel in just one sport. Not only did he win a gold medal for fast walking in the Maine Senior Olympics, but he also has won gold medals for golfing and bowling.  Mr. LaChance has achieved success in his career as well as in athletic competitions. In 1917, Mr. LaChance began working at Valee Pharmacy as a floor sweeper and errand boy. Through hard work and dedication, he became a registered pharmacist and managed the pharmacy until his retirement. For his dedication to his community's well-being, Mr. LaChance has been rewarded with the respect, affection, and admiration of his customers, neighbors, family, and friends.  Mr. LaChance's accomplishments are an inspiration to anyone who aspires to be the best they can be. Whether old or young, athlete or artist, social worker or science teacher, those who seek to be the best share the dedication and the determination exhibited for so long by Mr. LaChance. I extend to him my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes as he competes in the National Senior Olympics representing the great State of Maine. Regardless of the outcome of the race, I know Mr. LaChance will make Maine proud.  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
