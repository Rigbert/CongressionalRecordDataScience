  This hurts me to even say it. From the projects listed earlier to the comments I read you, it is clear that Tom has demonstrated the ability as well as understands the importance of workingto empower the underserved and underutilized minority communities.  Simply put Tom Dorr is no racist, and anyone who has worked with or around him knows that. The comment that has been manipulated to generate this accusation, made during a forum at Iowa State University, was taken out of context.  I have not yet met or had any participant of this conference tell me that he or she believes Tom's remarks were meant to promote a lack of diversity. Quite the contrary, his actions while at USDA have served to show anyone who is interested that he is insightful and extremely sensitive to the ongoing issues of the minority populations that are underhoused, underbanked, and in general, underserved.  If anyone should question Tom's service at USDA, all you need do is visit with former Congresswoman Eva Clayton, Dr. Clinton Bristow, Ralph Paige, executive director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, and see what they think of Tom Dorr.  Tom Dorr is the person for the job. His background, recommendations, and now his track record more than provide justification for him to be confirmed as the Under Secretary for Rural Development.  Tom has already suffered a terrible disservice through the political witch hunt to which he has been subjected. It would be outrageous if rural America were to be deprived of the leadership and talent that President Bush has provided for this terribly important position. Rural America is regaining its economic, social, and cultural momentum. It would be a shame to deprive it of leadership at this critical juncture.  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and to support the ultimate confirmation of this committed and talented leader.  I yield the floor.
