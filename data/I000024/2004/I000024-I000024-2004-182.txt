Unfortunately, we do not agree on his preferred solution which is why compromise language was developed and the amendment was modified. I will agree with the Senator that the modified amendment was indeed cleared by both the majority and minority sides of the committee. However, as the Senator notes, this modified amendment was inadvertently left out of the manager's package that was approved by the Senate. I commit to fixing this error at the earliest possible opportunity and will work in conference to protect the Senate position on this issue.
