 President, in a moment I wish to make a motion, but I would like to say as a prelude, for 6 years I have worked on legislation to provide for notification in the event of a data breach. During that period of time, 43 States have passed their own legislation. We would not know of data breaches if it were not particularly for the State of California which has put forward action on several of them.  The bill went to the Judiciary Committee. It has been heard in the Judiciary Committee. With the cooperation and support of the chairman of that committee, Senator Leahy, the bill has come out unanimously and has been pending before this body. There are holds on the bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 180, S. 239, data breach modifications; that the committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, without further intervening action or debate.
