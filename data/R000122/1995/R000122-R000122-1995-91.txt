Chairman, I move to strike the last word and say that we have looked at the amendment. It simply requires a further specification in the regulatory impact analysis of certain provisions for the proposed regulation, including whether the individual would have to obtain licenses, permits, or other certification and a discussion of the question of fees or fines.  It strikes me that most of these provisions would be outlined in the basic law governing the particular activity. I do not see any particular harm by specifying the regulatory impact analysis. It tends, I would think, to simply do what is done elsewhere. But I at this point, subject to further review and perhaps if we have comments, working with the gentleman from New Jersey as we move through the process, would be prepared, I think, to accept the amendment unless someone else has a more persuasive argument at the moment.  I believe at this time we are prepared to accept the amendment.
