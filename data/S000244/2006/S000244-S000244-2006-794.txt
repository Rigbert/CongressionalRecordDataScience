Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 335) honoring and praising the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on the occasion of its 97th anniversary.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 335       Whereas the National Association for the Advancement of      Colored People (NAACP), originally known as the National      Negro Committee, was founded in New York City on February 12,      1909, the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, by a      multiracial group of activists who answered ``The Call'' for      a national conference to discuss the civil and political      rights of African Americans;       Whereas the National Association for the Advancement of      Colored People was founded by a distinguished group of      leaders in the struggle for civil and political liberty,      including Ida Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Moscowitz,      Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villiard, and William      English Walling;       Whereas the NAACP is the oldest and largest civil rights      organization in the United States;       Whereas the mission of the NAACP is to ensure the      political, educational, social, and economic equality of      rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and      racial discrimination;       Whereas the NAACP is committed to achieving its goals      through nonviolence;       Whereas the NAACP advances its mission through reliance      upon the press, the petition, the ballot, and the courts, and      has been persistent in the use of legal and moral persuasion,      even in the face of overt and violent racial hostility;       Whereas the NAACP has used political pressure, marches,      demonstrations, and effective lobbying to serve the voice, as      well as the shield, for minority Americans;       Whereas after years of fighting segregation in public      schools, the NAACP, under the leadership of Special Counsel      Thurgood Marshall, won one of its greatest legal victories in      the Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of      Education;       Whereas in 1955, NAACP member Rosa Parks was arrested and      fined for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus in      Montgomery, Alabama--an act of courage that would serve as      the catalyst for the largest grassroots civil rights movement      in the history of the United States;       Whereas the NAACP was prominent in lobbying for the passage      of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, the Voting      Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act, laws which      ensured Government protection for legal victories achieved;      and       Whereas in 2005, the National Association for the      Advancement of Colored People launched the Disaster Relief      Fund to help survivors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas,      Florida, and Alabama to rebuild their lives: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) recognizes the 97th anniversary of the historic      founding of the National Association for the Advancement of      Colored People; and       (2) honors and praises the National Association for the      Advancement of Colored People on the occasion of its      anniversary for its work to ensure the political,      educational, social, and economic equality of all persons.
