Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Captain Rhonda Powell, a daughter of Metro Atlanta, for her extraordinary service to the nation while serving in the United States Army for the past 23 years.  Since the beginning of her career, Captain Powell exhibited a steadfast commitment and dedication to serving her country. A graduate of the University of Memphis and George Washington University, Captain Powell has been stationed in Fort Gillem, Fort Bragg, and is currently a congressional legislative liaison to the Office of the Chief, Army Reserve for the U.S. Department of Defense at the Pentagon.  While deployed in Doha, Qatar from 2006-2007, Captain Powell served as the detachment commander of the 312th Adjutant General Company in direct support of Operation Iraqi Freedom to Camp As Sayliyah. Captain Powell exhibited strong operational planning and intelligence analysis, and assumed duties as the officer in charge (OIC) of the Quick Reaction Force element on Camp As Sayliyah. She not only supported the health, welfare, morale, and development of her assigned soldiers, but also led her team in rapid responses to threats and other developments on or near the base.  In her current role interfacing with the U.S. Congress, Captain Powell used her experience in military relations to establish the Soldiers and Leaders United Through Engagements (SALUTE) Program. This unique and timely initiative helps connect Members of Congress with issues and experiences facing American soldiers.  Upon her retirement next month, Captain Powell plans to return to her roots in Atlanta, where her parents still reside near Howell Mill Road, and to begin a new chapter of her life. Mr. Speaker, I join others in congratulating and thanking Captain Powell, for her service, perseverance, hard work, and contributions to our nation. I and the other residents of Georgia's 5th Congressional District are happy and proud to welcome her home.                          ____________________
