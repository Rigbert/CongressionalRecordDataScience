Speaker, I rise today to voice my concern with H. Res. 34, an imperfect resolution congratulating the Prime Minister-elect of Israel, Ariel Sharon, calling for an end to violence in the Middle East, and reaffirming the friendship between the Governments of the United States and Israel. While I will vote in favor of this resolution, as I did on earlier resolutions late last year, I hold serious and continuous concerns about its implications for the peace process.  Like my colleagues, I applaud Israel on its open and democratic election process. While the process was encouraging, the results were disappointing. Voter turnout was the lowest in Israel's history and participation by the Arab population was minimal. This division in the population further fractures the possibilities for a lasting peace.  According to statistics released from the Israeli Embassy, 55 Israelis have been killed since September 27, 2000, in riot-related situations.  According to statistics released from the Palestinian Initiative for the Promotion of Global Dialogue and Democracy (MIFTAH), 366 Palestinians, Israeli Arabs, and Palestinians in southern Lebanon have been killed between the dates of September 28, 2000 and February 6, 2001.  H. Res. 34 specifically calls on Yassir Arafat, Chairman of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (and President of the Palestinian Authority) to ``use his influence and resources to see that violence in the Middle East is brought to an end.'' This statement unwisely places the onus of peace solely on the shoulders of the Palestinians. I have been consistent in my calls for all parties to be accountable and willing to strive for a workable peace. Isn't it counterproductive to place the blame or praise wholly on one party?  Americans must be concerned about how the new government will proceed. I strongly hope that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will look to the future with the goal of peace and reconciliation. Israel, the Palestinians, and the Middle East Region overall have suffered greatly throughout the last century. This new millennium offers a chance for hope. It is my wish that Mr. Sharon will take that chance for peace.  If the United States wishes to be an honest broker for peace, we must be fair-handed and aware of how our votes, actions, and statements will be viewed by all factions involved in this unsettled region of the world.                          ____________________
