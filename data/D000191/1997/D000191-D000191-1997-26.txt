  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, those of lesser intellect might question the wisdom and efficacy of our trade policy. After all, our deficit rose last month. In fact, the $10.4 billion deficit in August was the worst in 7 months. We are headed toward a $114 billion budget deficit this year, eclipsing last year's record of $111 billion.  Mr. Speaker, we are headed toward an all-time high deficit with China and our deficit with our NAFTA, free-trade partners increased once again. There was only one spot on the horizon that looked a little dark. We are actually running a surplus, a trade surplus with Central and South America. Imagine that. That is against the principles of free trade.  But do not worry, Mr. Speaker. This administration and the Republican leaders want to fix that. They want to jam through a fast track trade agreement so we can have free trade and the same principles with Central and South America that we do with the rest of the world. That means trade deficits for the United States, job exports for the United States, and disaster for the American workers.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to say no to fast track and let us get a real trade policy that makes sense for American workers in this country.                          ____________________
