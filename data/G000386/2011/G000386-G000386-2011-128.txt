 President, I rise to pay tribute to a noble fallen warrior. CAPT Matthew Gunnar Nielson of Jefferson, IA, gave his life for his country on June 29, 2011, during an attack by insurgents in Badrah, Iraq. He was 27 years old. My prayers are with Captain Nielson's parents, Roger and Christine, and all his family and friends who are feeling his loss.  In a statement, his family said, ``Since Matt was a small boy he loved anything military, so he died doing what he loved best. Serving others was of the utmost importance to him and how he wanted to spend his life. He always gave his all, whatever he was doing. Matthew was a beloved son, brother, friend and Soldier. He's already home, and we know we'll be together again someday. Apart, but forever in our hearts. Psalms 11.'' What can I say about such selfless service and sacrifice? We just celebrated 235 years of independence and liberty, which is an occasion to reflect on the incalculable debt we owe to Matt and his comrades in arms over the years who have secured that legacy for us and for posterity. So long as we continue to have brave patriots like Matthew Nielson who are willing to give their all for their fellow Americans, our heritage as a free people will be in safe hands.                          ____________________
