Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for doing this tonight on the floor of the House. I do appreciate his bringing this to light.  He is from Pennsylvania. I am from Alaska. We recognize the need for an energy policy. Hopefully this new Congress and with the new President, this Nation will come forth with an energy policy that can deliver the needed Btus to every family and improve the way we live today and not have anyone suffer.                          ____________________
