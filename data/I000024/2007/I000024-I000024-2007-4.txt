President, the first call I received from Trent Lott was in 1986 when I first ran for Congress. Though the polls hadn't yet closed and I still didn't know that I won, Trent called me up to congratulate me. In 1994 when I ran for my Senate seat, Trent Lott again called me on election night to tell me congratulations. Trent and I have worked together for 21 years and he has always been the best political mechanic in Washington. I take great pride in having helped launch the successful political career of Trent Lott by being one of his first supporters in his bid for the Republican Whip position.  People quite often take shots at Trent without justification. Don Imus used to say on his morning radio program that it looked like Trent ``combed his hair with a sponge.'' Well, I have to admit it did look that way sometimes, but if that is the worst you can say about Trent, I think he is doing just fine.  One lesson I've learned from Trent is that you shouldn't take things too seriously. I've seen him laugh in the face of adversity on more than one occasion, most recently when Trent's home in Mississippi was wiped out by Hurricane Katrina. Romans 5:3 tells us to rejoice in our sufferings because ``suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope,'' and certainly I've seen that in the life of Trent Lott.  When he talked this morning about his four pillars of family, faith, friends, and freedom, the one that people didn't talk much about was his faith. I have prayed with him at a weekly meeting for many years, an I have to say this about him: he is a faithful and obedient person to his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. So many of my colleagues say they have lost a friend, a colleague, and a statesman, but I have lost a brother. I rejoice in the contributions that Trent Lott has made throughout his life.
