Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to thank the chairman very much for bringing this legislation to the floor. It is a Senate bill very much like the bill I introduced that came out of the committee.  The bill promotes energy projects critical for economic development areas around Indian Country. Native communities face a significant number of obstacles to developing and delivering energy on their land. Ultimately, the lack of affordable energy undermines efforts to promote social and economic well-being in these communities.  I have always said Alaska Natives and American Indians are the best caretakers of their lands. This is what Tribal self-determination is all about: empowering Native communities with the tools and authority to manage their resources.  S. 245 makes important progress in this effort. The bill incorporates a variety of policy changes to enhance Indian energy development. This includes expanding the ability of the Department of Energy to provide technical assistance to tribes and Tribal organizations for energy projects, improving the Department of the Interior's process for approving energy resource agreements, and requiring FERC to give tribes equal footing with municipalities for hydroelectric licenses.  I am also pleased that the bill includes a Tribal biomass demonstration program that mirrors a provision in my Native American Energy Act.  I appreciate Chairman Hoeven's willingness to continue to work on Indian energy and his commitment to hold a hearing on my Native American Energy Act in 2019. My bill can serve as the foundation for the next step in promoting Indian energy. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.
