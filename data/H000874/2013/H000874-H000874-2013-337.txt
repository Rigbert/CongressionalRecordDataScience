Speaker, I am extremely disappointed that the sequestration has taken effect because Republicans refused to work with Democrats on a balanced plan to prevent it.  The automatic, arbitrary, and irrational cuts it has imposed could have, and I think will have, serious, negative effects. It could erode our military readiness and weaken our national security, and it could reverse the gains we've made in our economic recovery and see reductions in critical programs that help the poor and most vulnerable in our society.  Sequestration is not a solution. Only a balanced approach can achieve the savings we need to get our fiscal house in order and end the uncertainty that is keeping our businesses from creating the jobs we need.  It is not too late to act. This Republican-controlled Congress may not have been able to avert the sequester, but it can limit its impact if both sides work together. And I still believe that if Republicans are willing to compromise, we can achieve the big, balanced solution to deficits the American people expect from us.  Today's vote is on whether you think sequester is rational. The next vote will be on keeping government open.                          ____________________
