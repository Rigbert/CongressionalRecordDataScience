Mr. Speaker, Coretta Scott King was a radiant symbol of the best that the American South and this nation have to offer. She was beautiful, charming, graceful and dignified. She was a shining light who had the ability to brighten the dark places, to bring hope where there was hopelessness.  I first met her in 1957 when I was a 17-year-old student in Nashville. She was traveling around America, especially in the South, telling the story of the Civil Rights Movement through song. I will never forget it. She looked like an opera star standing on stage. She wore a lovely pearl-white dress with layers of cascading ruffles falling gently around her. She would sing a little and then talk a little, and through her singing and talks she inspired an entire generation.  She was more than the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr. She was a leader in her own right. She was the glue that held the Civil Rights Movement together and the strength that sustained one of the most charismatic leaders of our time. Long before she married Dr. King, she was an activist for non-violence, traveling to a conference in Europe with Women Strike for Peace to discuss the dangers of atmospheric nuclear testing.  Though she tasted the bitter fruits of segregation and racial discrimination, Coretta Scott King was prepared for a privileged life. She was well-educated and married a gifted minister from a prominent family. Just like any other mother she wanted to raise her four children in peace. But when an opportunity came for her to actualize the philosophy of non-violent change, she did not ignore her convictions.  Along with her husband and the more than 50 thousand black people of Montgomery, she responded to the courage of Rosa Parks, who on December 1, 1955, refused to give up her seat on a city bus in Alabama. That simple act launched the modern-day Civil Rights Movement and changed Coretta King's life forever.  Her commitment to non-violence led her to trade her privilege to live under the constant threat of brutality. Her home was bombed, her husband was repeatedly jailed, people she knew were killed, her husband's life was always in jeopardy. And finally one day he was assassinated by a gunman's bullet.  She did not become bitter or hostile. She did not hide in some dark corner, but she drew on her faith in the transformative power of peace. And a few days after the assassination, she led striking workers through the streets of Memphis. All the days of her life, she would travel throughout the South, America, and the world urging respect for the dignity of humanity.  She went all out to create a living memorial to her husband called the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change, one of the most visited landmarks in Atlanta. She met with President Reagan, who was not inclined to sign the legislation, but in the end he could not deny her. She used her prominence to mobilize the American people and built a bi-partisan coalition in Congress to make her husband's birthday a national holiday. Because of her efforts, generations yet unborn will learn his message of peace, and they will hear about his struggle for equal justice in America.  I loved Coretta Scott King. She was so warm, so genuine, so caring. For 20 years, she always sent me a card or a book on my birthday. I will cherish those mementos always.  I will remember Coretta Scott King as a dear friend. But the historians will remember her as one of the founding mothers of the new America, for through her noble acts, she helped liberate us all. This nation is a better nation, and we are a better people because she passed this way. However, she was not only a citizen of America, she was a citizen of the world, a world still yearning to build the Beloved Community, a world still yearning to make peace with itself. Above all, Coretta Scott King personified the beautiful, peaceful soul of a non-violent movement that still has the power to transform America, that still has the power to change the world.                          ____________________
