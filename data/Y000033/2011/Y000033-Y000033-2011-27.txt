I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 295 would use existing authorized appropriations in the Hydrographic Survey Improvement Act of 1998 for fiscal year 2012 to fund surveys and mapping activities in the Arctic.  Currently, base hydrographic data in the Arctic is woefully inadequate and not sufficient to support current, let alone future, marine activity. With the last major hydrographic survey activity having occurred more than 60 years ago, after World War II, and with other areas not having been surveyed since the 1800s, there's a lot of work to do.  As we all know, the Arctic has become the focus of many of its surrounding nations to determine ownership of the sea bed and any potential energy sources in the area. In addition, the lack of sea ice is opening up shipping routes to commercial and recreational vessels.  H.R. 295 is an effort to move this process forward, and this bill is necessary to emphasize the need for the agency to collect hydrographic data and provide hydrographic services in the Arctic region. Last Congress, similar legislation passed out of the House by a roll call vote of 420-0.  I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.
