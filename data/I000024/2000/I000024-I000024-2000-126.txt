If the Senator will yield further, I do support what the chairman is doing. I would like to do more. Impact aid is a promise; it is an obligation. We have taken things away from the tax base that preclude States from financially supporting their schools, and it happens that between our military installations and our Indian population and some of the unique ways we handle it in the State of Oklahoma, we are impacted greatly by this program.  So I appreciate the fact that the Senator has made an effort to stop the President in his budget from reducing impact aid, but I would like to do a little more if I could.  I thank the Senator.
