Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The rule states in pertinent part:  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''  The amendment includes an emergency designation under section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 and, as such, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI. Therefore, I insist on my point of order.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to speak on this point of order?
