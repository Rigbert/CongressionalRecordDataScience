Speaker, on September 7, 2011, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall vote 692.   Had I been present for rollcall 692, on a motion to suspend the rules and agree to H. Con. Res. 67, authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run, I would have voted ``aye.''                          ____________________
