President, I have to answer some of the comments made earlier by the Republican leader as he talked about the state of negotiations between the President and Congress as we face the fiscal cliff. He said at one point that the President is calling for raising taxes $1.6 trillion. That is true. But I would call to his attention that the Simpson-Bowles Commission suggested that 40 percent of the $4 trillion in deficit reduction comes from revenue and taxes. What the President is suggesting is entirely consistent with that bipartisan group's call for more revenue and taxes as part of our deficit reduction.  The President has made it clear, though, that he wants to protect and insulate middle-income families from any income tax increases, and I agree with him. We should not raise the income taxes on those making less than $250,000 a year. I voted that way in July. We sent the bill to the House. It sits there. It languishes in the House because the Speaker will not call it. He has his chance this week or next to call that bill on the floor of the House of Representatives to avoid any tax increase on middle-income families. That is an important bill for us to get done before we leave at the end of this particular session of Congress.  Let me say that $1.6 trillion in taxes over 10 years is not an unreasonable amount. The tax rate the President is asking for is the rate that was in place during the expansive period in our economy under President Bill Clinton. To argue that the President has gone too far in asking for tax and revenue is to ignore the obvious. It is the same percentage asked for by Simpson-Bowles, if not less, and it is a tax rate that, frankly, ruled in this country at a period of time when we had more jobs and businesses created than ever in recent history.  A second argument that was made by the Republican leader is that there is a proposal from the President to raise the debt ceiling at his whim. Those are his words. I beg to differ. What the President has proposed is exactly the McConnell procedure. Senator McConnell of Kentucky suggested to us that we have a process for extending the debt ceiling that allows Members of Congress to vote to approve or disapprove and ultimately for the President to decide whether to sign into law--their resolution of disapproval, for example. That, of course, could lead to a veto and another opportunity for Congress to vote again.  This was a process Senator McConnell suggested. It was a way out of a bind when the House Republicans and others threatened to shut down the economy over the debt ceiling extension, which is, in fact, the mortgage of the United States of America. It would have otherwise led to the first major default on America's debt in our history, with calamitous results when it came to the impact on our economy.  For the Republican leader to come to the floor and criticize the very same procedure he suggested and voted for I think is hard to understand and explain. Last week he came to the floor and suggested that we enshrine it in law. He offered the bill on the floor. Senator Reid came and said: We accept your invitation, and we will take a rollcall vote on that, at which point Senator McConnell filibustered his own bill that he had introduced, I recall, earlier in the day. I think he made history in the Senate, filibustering his own bill when we had a chance to vote and pass it.  I would say this notion that the President is looking for an extraordinary power when it comes to the debt ceiling is not quite accurate. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, if we accept your approach to it, it will give the Senate and House a voice, but we will not risk default.  Third, the Senator from Kentucky was lamenting the size of government growth. When we took a look at the last time we balanced the budget and had a surplus in Washington, it was under President William Jefferson Clinton, a little over 12 years ago. What has happened to spending since President Clinton's balanced budget? It has gone up substantially. Where has it gone up? In domestic discretionary accounts, which are often the target of speeches like Senator McConnell's today? No. That has basically been flatlined when you take inflation into consideration. The dramatic growth in government spending since we were last in balance has been in two areas. One of those was in military spending. I might add that the reason it has grown dramatically is we have been at war in Afghanistan and Iraq. ThePresident has extricated us from Iraq, and we are in the process of leaving Afghanistan.  If you want to know why government spending has gone up so fast, there has been a 64-percent increase in military spending since the budget was last in balance. There was no increase in domestic discretionary spending when you take inflation into account but 64 percent in military spending. That is why spending has gone up. Yet, when they suggest we will cut spending in the sequester, people say: You cannot touch it; it has to continue to grow. I question that. I think we can be safe as a nation and really address the wasteful spending taking place in the Pentagon as well as every other government agency.  Where else is there a growth in government spending? The same analysis by Senator Inouye says that since the budget was in balance, the expenditures in entitlement spending have gone up 30 percent--30 percent. It is a substantial pool of money. Why? Because yesterday 10,000 Americans reached the age of 65, today another 10,000, tomorrow another 10,000 and every day for the next 18 years as the boomers arrive. To lament the growth in entitlements is to ignore the obvious: we have more people calling on Social Security and Medicare for help. People have paid into these systems for a lifetime and now--I think quite rightfully--expect to be covered by the same programs they have supported for so many years in their working lives.  Is the Senator from Kentucky suggesting that we need to cut back when it comes to eligibility in Social Security and Medicare? That would sure restrain the growth, but it would be fundamentally unfair and unwise to tell people who paid in a lifetime to Social Security and Medicare that now you do not get your benefits.  Let's be honest about the growth in government spending. When you have wars that you do not pay for, when you have entitlement programs created, such as the Medicare prescription Part D, unpaid for, when you have a growth in entitlements just by the demographic growth in America, that accounts for a lot of the increase in spending.  There is one other key element. A large measure of the increase in Federal spending has been increased health care costs, and we estimate that in the next 10 to 20 years, 70 percent of Federal budget outlays will grow because of increased health care costs. We addressed this. We went after the growth in health care costs with the President's ObamaCare--the health care reform bill--in an attempt to contain it and had not one single Republican who would join us in that effort. Not one. We ended up passing it exclusively as a Democratic bill. That is a shame because I think Democrats and Republicans should share the same goal of trying to reduce the increased cost of health care spending.  When it comes to the President's offer, we need a bold approach again. We need to contain the spending costs as we already have, already cutting $1 trillion in spending to date. We need to have revenue sources, which the President has asked for, and we need to look at entitlement programs--I want to be very specific--not entitlement cuts per se but entitlement reform. Untouched, Medicare runs out of money in 12 years. That is a challenge to each and every one of us today--not 12 years from now but today. What will we do in the next year, looking at entitlement programs such as Medicare, to make sure they have a life well beyond 12 years? I think that is a responsibility we should face squarely, and it should be part of this deficit negotiation. I am not for a quick fix that is introduced in the next couple of days or hours; rather, I would like to see a thoughtful repair and reform of Medicare and other entitlement programs so they will continue to be in service in the future.                          ____________________
