And I thank Congresswoman Diane Watson for her compassionate service and certainly for this memorial service tonight. And I extend deepest condolences on behalf of the people of Ohio to the family of our beloved Congresswoman, Juanita Millender-McDonald, her husband, Jim, her children, her grandchildren.  Having had the great pleasure of serving with her during her entire tenure, let me say, when I think of Juanita, I think of a woman who was resilient, who was strong, determined, refined, accomplished, persevering and, indeed, courageous, a pioneer with a great sense of humor and, as a minister's daughter, a boundless sense of hope.  Even today, for a woman to chair a full committee of this House is a rarity. And for an African-American woman, she created the mold, the first African-American woman in the history of this country to chair a full committee in this House.  Just a few weeks ago, a new volume of ``Women of Congress'' was published, and hers is the first name in that volume, commissioned by order of the Chair of the House Administration Committee, Juanita Millender-McDonald.  There are some people who teach us how to live and indeed, she did. And many people can teach us how to die, and she has done that with her great dignity and her courage.  Just a few weeks ago, when Nancy Pelosi of California was sworn in as our first Speaker, I had the great honor of being one of the two Democratic tellers. Juanita, as Chair of the House Administration Committee, sat to my right. I shall never forget that moment, and I think she lived partly for that moment.  May her strength comfort her family in these trying moments of bereavement. I believe God holds close those who journey toward the light in this Easter and Passover season. And may the angels of mercy lift her and lift the spirits of those who love her and bring comfort and bring peace.
