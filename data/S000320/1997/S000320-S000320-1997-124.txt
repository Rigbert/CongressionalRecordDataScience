  Mr. President, the committee has received the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 858. CBO found that the public bill would not affect direct spending or receipts in 1998; thus, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to it. In addition, the Unfunded Mandates Reform act [UMRA] excludes from application of the act legislative provisions that are necessary for the national security. CBO determined that all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by UMRA.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for Senate bill 858, the intelligence authorization bill, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1997.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 858, the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Dawn      Sauter.           Sincerely,                                                  June E. O'Neill,                                                         Director.       Enclosure.               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate      s. 858--intelligence authorization act for fiscal year 1998       Summary: S. 858 would authorize appropriations for fiscal      year 1998 for intelligence activities of the United States      government, the Community Management Account, and the Central      Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System      (CIARDS).       This estimate addresses only the unclassified portion of      the bill. On that limited basis, CBO estimates that enacting      S. 858 would result in additional spending of $91 million      over the 1998-2002 period, assuming appropriation of the      authorized amounts. The unclassified portion of the bill      would not affect direct spending or receipts in 1998; thus      pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to it. The Unfunded      Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from application of the      act legislative provisions that are necessary for the      national security. CBO has determined that all of the      provisions of this bill either fit within that exclusion or      do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by UMRA.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary effect of S. 858 is shown in the following table.      CBO was unable to obtain the necessary information to      estimate the costs for the entire bill because parts are      classified at a level above clearances held by CBO employees.      The estimated costs, therefore, reflect only the costs of the      unclassified portion of the bill.       The bill would authorize appropriations of $91 million for      the Community Management Account and $197 million for CIARDS.      The funding for CIARDS would cover retirement costs      attributable to military service and various unfunded      liabilities. The payment to CIARDS is considered mandatory,      and the authorization under this bill would be the same as      assumed in the CBO baseline.       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumed that S. 858 will      be enacted by October 1, 1997, and that the full amounts      authorized will be appropriated for fiscal year 1998. Outlays      are estimated according to historical spending patterns for      intelligence programs.

Note: The costs of this legislation would fall within budget function  050 (national defense).       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: The Unfunded      Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from application of the      act legislative provisions that are necessary for the      national security. CBO has determined that all of the      provisions of this bill either fit within that exclusion or      do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by UMRA.
