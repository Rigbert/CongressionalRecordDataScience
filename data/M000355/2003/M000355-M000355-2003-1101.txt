 President, today marks the last day in Congress of one of the most remarkable people I have had the pleasure of meeting in my entire life, one of the most decent, clearly one of the most outstanding individuals, and that is Dave Hoppe, who will be leaving Congress to go on to some other line of work after today.  We all got to know Dave as chief of staff of Senator Lott. He has labored in the vineyards of the Senate and the House for 27 years. Without ego, without a desire to go out and seek public office, like many of us have done, Dave Hoppe devoted himself to improving America and to advancing the causes in which he believed by working through elected officials.  Dave is originally from Wisconsin. He graduated from Notre Dame in 1973. By the way, his birthplace was Baraboo, Wisconsin, which also happens to be the place where the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey circus began.  Dave came to Washington after graduating from Notre Dame to have an impact on his country. As he ends his public service today, there is no question that he has had an enormous impact on the lives of all Americansthrough his work both in the House and the Senate.  There was a fascinating article in USA Today back in 1997 about the impact Dave had on the reauthorization of the IDEA legislation that year. He had a particular interest in it because his son, Gregory, suffers from a disability. Dave, raising that son and living with the disability his son had, had a particular awareness of how to adapt that legislation to the needs of not only his son but a lot of other youngsters who found themselves in the same dilemma.  This is a quote from Dave in the article:       Every night when I came home and every morning when I got      up, I saw who it could help.  He was talking about the IDEA reauthorization.  Referring to his son:       I know his horizons are not unlimited, but I want them to      be as great as they can be.  What a marvelous way to put Dave's hopes and aspirations for his son. Dave and his wife, Karen, met in a carpool 21 years ago as conservative idealists. He worked for the House Republican study committee and she for the Heritage Foundation. They were engaged 3 weeks after their first date and married December 30th, 1976--a truly remarkable family.  I expect others might want to include this USA Today article, but it is so interesting and so important I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From USA Today, June 27, 1997]                     A Law That Transcends Politics                           (By Richard Wolf)       Washington.--Six-year-old Gregory Hoppe climbs up on the      bench installed for him in his father's office and peers out      on the nation's capital.       But this isn't just any office. It's for the chief of staff      to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, perhaps the USA's most      powerful Republican.       And Gregory isn't just any child. The framed Senate roll-     call vote that hangs over his bench attests to that. Still      two weeks shy of his 7th birthday, Gregory already has played      a quiet but crucial role in overhauling the law that guides      special-education policy for 5.6 million disabled children in      America's public schools.       His father, David Hoppe, was the one who worked out the      final agreement between Congress and the Clinton      administration last month. But Gregory, born with Down      syndrome, was the new law's guiding light.       Call it Gregory's Law.       ``You had somebody who brought a deep life experience to      the whole process,'' says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``It's a      piece of legislation with a lot of heart in it.''       The roles played by David and Gregory Hoppe demonstrate the      powerful influence of private lives in public policy. Their      impact on the nation's special-education law is emblematic of      how elected and even non-elected officials work behind the      scenes here, using personal experiences to set the      legislative agenda and guide the political process.       And David Hoppe's role was significant for another reason:      at a time of public dismay over how Washington works--or      doesn't--in the glare of partisan politics and harsh      publicity, he became the rare individual to emerge heralded      by all sides.       ``This was a fair, decent, caring soul who was not going to      sell anybody down the river,'' says Robert Silverstein, the      Senate's top Democratic expert on disability issues.       But without Gregory's disability and his dad's doggedness,      President Clinton and Congress still might be embroiled in      emotional debate over the Individuals with Disabilities      Education Act (IDEA), signed into law earlier this month.       For two years, the bill had been caught between two      seemingly immovable forces: Leaders of the Republican      revolution, who wanted to help schools cut costs and curtail      classroom disruptions caused by disabled students, and      advocates for the disabled, who wanted expanded educational      opportunities.       It took a deeply religious, conservative Republican and a      highly motivated advocate for the disabled to bring the two      sides together. David Hoppe was both of those. And Gregory      was his inspiration.       ``Every night when I cam home and every morning when I got      up, I saw who is could help,'' Hoppe says of his son. ``I      know his horizons are not unlimited, but I want them to be as      great as they can be.''       Says Paul Marchand, director of The Arc, which represents      the mentally retarded: ``He might have been thinking,      `Everything that I do here may someday affect my child, and      if not my child, hundreds of thousands like him.' ''                  a strong family that weathers crisis       David and Karen Hoppe met in a car pool 21 years ago as      conservative idealists. He worked for the House Republican      Study Committee, she for the Heritage Foundation think tank.      They were engaged three weeks after their first date and      married Dec. 30, 1976. He would go on to work for a future      vice presidential nominee, Jack Kemp; she would go on to work      for a future vice president, Dan Quayle.       David rose through the Capitol Hill ranks, but Karen quit      when their first child, Katie, was born in 1981. Geoffrey      arrived two years later. The Hoppes--David is 45, Karen, 44--     are devoted parents to both ``big kids,'' as they call them      now. But it was Gregory's arrival in 1990 that gave the      suburban Burke, VA., couple a whole new outlook on life.       The night before Gregory's birth, the Hoppes happened to      pick up a copy of a Sesame Street parents guide featuring a      story on Down syndrome. ``I remember sitting on the edge of      the bed and saying, `I hope we don't have to deal with      anything like this,' ``Karen Hoppe says. They had forgone      pre-natal testing that could have determined Gregory's      disability, caused by an extra chromosome, because they do      not believe in abortion.       The next night, the Sesame Street story came to life. ``He      was four minutes old,'' she recalls. ``They came and told me      right away that they thought he had Down syndrome.''       Those first few minutes in Fairfax Hospital are etched in      the Hoppes' minds. With doctors buzzing around Gregory, the      couple made hasty plans to baptize him, in case he died. But      Gregory was tough; he overcame many of the complications      that accompany Down syndrome births.       Karen reacted emotionally, but her husband was then what he      has been ever since--a rock. ``I got one tear out of David,''      she says, ``and that was it.''       Sen. Coats, Hoppe's boss at the time, recalls getting the      call from the hospital concerning Gregory's obvious      disability. ``I think the birth of Gregory was one of those      defining, life-changing experiences that open people's eyes      to a whole other world,'' he says. ``I don't think unless you      experience that, you can fully identify with that world.''       Today, the pain of that first realization is overwhelmed by      two other emotions common to families of disabled children--     exhaustion and achievement. The physical and mental      challenges can seem never-ending. Gregory didn't walk until      age 2\1/2\, didn't run until last summer, and only now is      learning to jump. Typical of children with Down syndrome, his      cognitive and language skills are significantly delayed.       But just as distinctive is his unconditional love for his      family. While his father helps run the country, Gregory rules      the roost at home. He's a ham, singing and dancing to his      favorite videos. Ask a question, and he taps his temple as if      deep in thought. He speaks in two- and three-world bursts      packed with meaning: ``Throw the ball!'' ``My turn!'' And the      every-welcome, ``Thank you, Mommy.''       Says Karen, ``I wouldn't have missed this for the world.''                   personal lives, professional lives       For David Hoppe, plunging into the middle of a two-year-old      battle over the IDEA law was a deeply personal crusade that      made use of his education, experience, philosophy, Catholic      faith and fatherhood.       The law was first enacted in 1975 to guarantee disabled      students equal access to public schools, no matter how      profound their afflictions.       Over the past 20 years, the number of students classified      as disabled has soared to 12.4% of the public-school      population of 44.7 million, including those with behavioral      and emotional problems. About 70% of them are taught in      regular classrooms, alongside non-disabled kids.       The costs are high: more than $32 billion, only $4 billion      of which comes from the federal government.       Since taking control of Congress in 1995, Republicans had      tried to change the law, motivated partly by anecdotes about      students with disabilities causing harm to others. One      teacher in West Virginia wound up in an emergency room;      another in North Carolina broke an arm.       But during the 104th Congress, a deal proved elusive. Not      even Bob Dole, a disability-rights advocate and master deal-     maker, could do it. On his final day as Senate GOP leader      before resigning to run for president last June, Dole      implored his colleagues to pass an IDEA bill.       ``Some issues transcend politics, foster a bipartisan      spirit and result in legislation that makes a real and      lasting difference,'' Dole said on the Senate floor.      ``Disability has always been one of those issues.'' But not      in 1996.       Enter David Hoppe. Already one of the busiest staffers on      Capitol Hill as Lott's top deputy, he saw the chance to break      the logjam over a law that will guide his son's education      into the next century and ``give kids born 20 years from now      even more opportunities than Greg has.''       Hoppe came with a rare advantage: knowledge of how to write      laws, drawn from 21 years on Capitol Hill, and knowledge of      how to help the disabled, drawn from nearly seven years as      Gregory's dad.       ``I was uniquely placed. I was a conservative, and I had a      child with a disability,'' he says. ``I looked at everything      . . . through a parent's eye: `Let's put Greg in this      situation.' ''       That was easy. In many cases, Gregory already had been      there.       ``I was at the meeting where Gregory was given his label,''      Hoppe recalls, with a rare, small show of emotion. That was      in 1995,     when Gregory was 4 and aging out of preschool. He was labeled      ``MR,'' for mild retardation. His father, who knew it was      coming, still took the official designation hard. ``This is a      landmark,'' he says, ``and I knew it was.''       Hoppe's familiarity with the world of the disabled helped      turn theoretical debates into practical ones.       ``He made people think about the long-term and child-     specific implications of the policies,'' says Katherine Beh      Neas, senior government relations specialist at the National      Easter Seals Society.       Occasionally during the closed-door negotiations and open      town meetings he organized, Hoppe would mention the      bureaucratic hoops he and Karen had to jump through to get      services for their son. Several times, he interrupted      meetings to take calls from his family--at least once from      Gregory, who wondered when Dad was coming home.       ``The perspective of a parent (with a disabled child) would      have been completely missing'' without Hoppe, says Rep.      Matthew Martinez, D-Calif.       Adds Bruce Hunter, director of public affairs for the      American Association of School Administrators: ``Nobody could      say to him the way they could say to other Republicans, `Oh,      you guys just don't care.'''                  understanding differing perspectives       What Hoppe found as he waded into the legislative thicket      were school administrators who feared soaring costs,      educators who feared for their safety and advocates for the      disabled who feared losing hard-won rights. ``It was fairly      obvious how emotionally charged the issue was,'' he says.      ``You're dealing with vulnerable people.''       The flash point was discipline. Teachers, principals and      school administrators wanted more flexibility to punish      disabled students in much the same way they did others, even      if it meant segregating them or stopping their education.      Advocates for the disabled refused to go along.       Hoppe did not play the Gregory card to sway the      negotiations.       ``I'm sure that everybody in that room knew that David had      a disabled kid,'' says Judith Heumann, the Education      Department's assistant secretary of special education and      rehabilitative services. ``But he didn't wear it on his      sleeve.''       Where he wore it was on his computer. When other parents of      disabled children first came to Lott's office last fall to      voice their concerns, they had no idea of his personal      interest. Then they noticed the image of Gregory on his      computer screen.       ``I looked over and saw on the screen his little one,''      recounts Madeleine Will, mother of a 25-year-old son with      Down syndrome and a disability activist. She figured she was      imagining things. ``I thought, I'm overtired here and      distraught, but . . . I'm seeing the face of a child with      Down syndrome on that computer.''       Despite his advocacy on behalf of Gregory's interests,      Hoppe never forgot the interests of his other children.      Katie, 16, and Geoff, 13, attend public schools in Virginia      and know well the other side of the disability coin, when      students with behavioral problems disrupt classes or won't      leave them alone. They think disabled students should be      disciplined--but not blamed for all that goes wrong.       ``I just don't see the point of people complaining that all      disabilities ruin class,'' says Geoff. Adds Katie: ``The more      we integrate these kids, the more accepting and understanding      people will become with them.''       Out of this stew of colliding interests emerges David      Hoppe's philosophy: ``I believe in limited government,'' he      says. ``But I think government is there to protect rights and      opportunities.''       The IDEA law attempts to do that. The overhaul makes it      easier for schools to discipline disabled students, but      doesn't let states cut off their education. The law also      upgrades teacher training, gives parents a greater role and      improves planning and mediation.       Everyone had to compromise.       ``We kind of held our noses and supported it,'' says Sally      McConnell of the National Association of Elementary School      Principals, which wanted the measure to go farther. But, she      adds, ``Emotions run high on this issue, and I think he did a      really good job.''       Ironically, Gregory won't use all his rights. Despite the      law's goal of educating disabled children in the least      restrictive setting, the Hoppes aren't seeking full inclusion      just yet.       Beginning this fall, Gregory will be in a self-contained      first-grade class for academic subjects with other mildly      retarded kids. He will be mainstreamed a half-hour each      morning and also for art, music and gym. Demanding inclusion      when it might not be best for their child isn't what the law      intends, they say.       Their hopes for Gregory are high. ``I want him to be able      to live by himself, to have a job that he likes, to be able      to go to that job by himself, to sit and have conversations      with people who work where he works . . . to have him      involved with his church,'' Hoppe says. ``My big dreams for      him are things that seem very normal.''       But his value won't be defined by his achievements. Says      Karen Hoppe: ``Greg is a worthwhile individual right now,      just the way he is.''                      Celebrating a success story       Gregory Hoppe was heard about but not seen until the Senate      voted 98-1 on May 14 to send the bill to President Clinton.      Then it was time for this coming-out party.        From his vantage point in the vice president's office off      the Senate floor while the votes were being cast, Thomas      Hehir, director of the federal Office of Special Education      Programs, looked outside and saw a child with Down syndrome      walking into the Capitol with his mother.       Only after the vote, when Hehir joined a celebration in      Hoppe's office featuring chocolate-chip cookies made by Karen      and Gregory, did he figure out who that special child was.       ``To me, it was kind of symbolic,'' Hehir recalls thinking      at the time.       Three weeks later, the Hoppe family was in the audience on      the White House's South Lawn to watch President Clinton sign      the bill into law.       At Secretary of Education Richard Riley's suggestion,      Clinton invited Hoppe up to the front; he brought Gregory.      Photographs show the two of them just behind Clinton, amid      the usual assortment of politicians. ``Staffers never get in      those kinds of photographs,'' marvels Erik Smulson, an aide      to Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who worked on the new law.       In this case, however, even the lawmakers say it was      justified. ``He was the hero of the ultimate passage of the      bill,'' says Sen. William Frist, R-Tenn. ``He was uniquely      placed, uniquely committed.''       Hoppe sums it up as a dad: ``I think I did something good      for Greg.''             Laws get passed when the politics is personal       Major changes in policy have come about because lawmakers      were affected personally.       Take the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, among the      most far-reaching civil rights laws. Former congressman Tony      Coelho, a California Democrat, says it was easy to win      converts.       ``I didn't have any trouble,'' recalls Coelho, whose      epilepsy made him a leading advocate. People ``were already      on board because of personal experiences.''       The same was true last year when three senators with family      stories of mental illness--Pete Domenici, R-N.M., Alan      Simpson, R-Wyo., and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.--tried to      improve mental health insurance coverage.       The personal touch can be key in turning legislation into      law, personal cause into public crusade:       Vice President Gore has used his sister's death from lung      cancer to push for tobacco regulation.       Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., whose sister is mentally      retarded and whose son lost a leg to cancer, has been a      leader in health and disability issues.       Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, voted against increasing highway      speed limits after his 22-year-old daughter died in a car      crash.       Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., sponsored an alcohol labeling      bill after losing his daughter, 22, to a drunk driver.       ``All of us are touched by different circumstances.'' says      Kennedy. ``It heightens your sensitivity and your awareness      of the issue and how it impacts people.''  Mr. McCONNELL. We will miss Dave Hoppe. Senators come and go. Members of the staff come and go. Frankly, about most of us, I expect it will be said we did not in the end have footprints that lasted very long. But having watched Dave Hoppe and his extraordinary accomplishments over the years I have known him, I would say he has made an enormous difference in the life of the Senate and in the life of our Nation.  So, Dave, we wish you well and hope we continue to see you in the future in whatever capacity you may choose to serve. You are the best, the most kind, decent, honorable person many of us ever had the chance to meet.  I yield the floor.
