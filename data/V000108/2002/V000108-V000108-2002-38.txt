Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize Mr. Carl ``Bronko'' Stankovic, a proud World War II veteran and dear friend of mine. Bronko has recently brought to my attention an inspirational poem written by his friend Bev Freeman, of Morgan Hill, California, during the Second World War. Bev passed away last year leaving behind not only loved ones but strong friendships forged during the war. After the funeral, Bronko and Bev's daughter, Carolyn Turner, came across a poem written by Bev and two members of his Tank Battalion that embodied the war experience not only for Bronko, but many other veterans.  This poem speaks powerfully to the uncertainty and fear faced by World War II combatants. The emotions it represents rings true with Bronko, and the hundreds of veterans he has shared this poem with. Bev's poem has been copied and given out at reunions since its discovery, and now I would like to share it with the Congress of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I submit this untitled poem as a tribute to Bev's tank crew and to the memory of all our lost World War II veterans:     Look, God I have never spoken to you.     But now, I want to say, ``How do you do?''     You see, God, they told me you didn't exist.     And, like a fool, I believed all this.     Last night from my turret I saw your sky.     I figured then they told me a lie.     Had I taken time to see things you made,     I'd have known they weren't calling a spade a spade.     I wonder, God, if you'd shake my hand?     Somehow I feel that you will understand.     Funny I had to come to this Hellish place     Before I had time to see your face!     Well, I guess there isn't much more to say.     But I'm sure glad God that I met you today.     I guess the hour will soon be here.     I'm not afraid since I know you're near.     There's the signal; Well, God, I've got to go.     I like you a lot--this I want you to know.     Look now, this will be a kind of a rough fight.     Who knows, I may come to your house tonight.     Though I wasn't friendly to you before,     I wonder, God, if you'd wait at the door?     Look, I'm crying, Oh, me shedding tears;     I wish I had known you these many years.     Well, I have to go now, God, so good-bye.     Strange, since I met you, I'm not afraid to die.  Mr. Speaker, I hope this poem inspires my distinguished colleagues as it has inspired me. The Greatest Generation has given so much to younger generations that I am happy to give something back by submitting this poem to the House of Representatives. I would ask my colleagues to join me in honoring World War II veterans with a moment of silence.                          ____________________
