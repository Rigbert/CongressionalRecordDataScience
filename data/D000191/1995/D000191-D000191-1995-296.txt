So perhaps a rational person could have anticipated that the peso was overvalued, that there were problems with political manipulations of the currency values in Mexico and, in fact, that inextricably tying the fate of our economy to Mexico, which seems to be what our administration is telling us, was a mistake.  I would ask the gentlewoman if she noticed the statement in the Washington Post last weekend where the Speaker said there was a relationship between the minimum wage and the value of the peso in Mexico and Mexican workers, and said he was hesitant to support an increase in the minimum wage in the United States of America for people who work in this country because that would probably drive more jobs across the border.  So we have just seen the value of the wages in Mexico, which were pitiful to begin with compared to U.S. wages, dropped by 50 percent, and now we have to withhold any increase in the standard of living for the people of the United States because be might lose yet more manufacturing jobs to Mexico.  What happened to the promise of hundreds of thousands of jobs in America as we sold goods to the Mexican people? I am puzzled.
