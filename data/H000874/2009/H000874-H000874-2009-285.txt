 The last time Iran got money from the United States of America was 1984. You recall who was President of the United States in 1984, I'm sure. That was the last time Iran got money from the United States--excuse me, from the IMF.  With respect to your second observation, the gentleman knows how the IMF works. The gentleman knows the United States is involved, as are the other countries, in overseeing the distribution of IMF funds. There is no intention--and there will be no action, certainly, that the United States would support--to give any assistance.  I don't know whether they've talked to the IMF or not. The gentleman may have more information than I do.
