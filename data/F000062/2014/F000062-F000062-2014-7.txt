 President, I would like to express my support for the consideration of the nomination of Nani Coloretti to be the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD.  Ms. Coloretti has a distinguished history of public service; she currently is the Assistant Secretary for Management at the U.S. Department of Treasury, a position she has served in since 2012. Prior to joining the U.S. Treasury, Ms. Coloretti assisted setting up operations at the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, serving as the Acting Chief Operating Officer. Additionally, from 1999 to 2005, Ms. Coloretti served as director of policy, planning and budget for the San Francisco Department of Children, Youth, and their Families, as well as budget director to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, where she managed the implementation of San Francisco's $6.2 billion annual budget.  Ms. Coloretti received a B.A. in economics and communications from theUniversity of Pennsylvania and a master's in public policy from the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley. In 2012, Ms. Coloretti was awarded the National Public Service Award by the American Society for Public Administration and the National Academy of Public Administration.  I believe that Ms. Coloretti brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the position of Deputy Secretary, and I look forward to voting for her confirmation.
