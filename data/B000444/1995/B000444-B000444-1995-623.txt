 President, we talked about State total indebtedness. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this survey of State and local governments by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. It is in current dollars. Just going back to 1983, the total indebtedness was $167,289,000,000 for the States. In 1993, 10 years later, it is $387,680,000,000 indebtedness.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  State government total indebtedness                        [In millions of dollars]Fiscal year:                                                     Amount  1993..........................................................387,680  1992..........................................................371,901  1991..........................................................348,769  1990..........................................................318,254  1989..........................................................295,500  1988..........................................................276,786  1983..........................................................167,289  [[Page S2746]] 1978...........................................102,568  1973...........................................................59,374  1968...........................................................35,666  1963...........................................................23,176  1958...........................................................15,394  1953............................................................7,824  1948............................................................3,676Note.--Amounts are in current dollars. Total indebtedness amounts include both long- and short-term debt. Long-term debt includes full-faith and credit (general obligation) and revenue debt. State government debt total excludes debt obligations of local governments; in fiscal year 1992 local government debt amounted to $598 billion compared with $372 billion for State governments.Source.--Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finance, U.S. Bureau of the Census.
