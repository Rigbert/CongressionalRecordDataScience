As the father of three young women myself, I know the joy of having a daughter. And, of course, I know the gentleman's son well, and he is going to be blessed with his sister.  I want to say that I am sure there is not a person in this Chamber or an American anywhere who does not think the gentleman made the right judgment. Congratulations to you.
