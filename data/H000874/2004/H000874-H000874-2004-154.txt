Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his statement. I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) for his leadership on the Help America Vote Act. Without his leadership and strong support, it would not have passed. Indeed, the gentleman from Illinois (Speaker Hastert), the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young) of the Committee on Appropriations and others were critically important in its passage and funding.  I want to rise with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) in strong support of report language that was offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) during the June 23 markup of the bill before us today. I applaud the Committee on Appropriations for including it in the report. I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) for their leadership and attention to this very important matter.  That report language reads: ``The committee strongly urges NIST to give priority consideration to Help America Vote Act outreach to the election community; expediting work on a new voting standards accreditation program; and its work with the Technical Guidelines Development Committee working with the Election Assistance Commission. NIST is directed to provide in advance of the fiscal 2006 hearings a report detailing what steps must be taken to bring its activities in line with the timetable established by the act.''  The gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) indicated that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) had worked with us. In fact, of course, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) was the principal sponsor in assuring that NIST was included as an integral part of the Help America Vote Act.  Obviously, technology is one of the critical issues in the HAVA proposal, which funds new technology for voting around the country. The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) correctly said that we ought to have the best possible advice regarding technology, and NIST was the agency to provide that.
