 Our neighbors to the south will be doing more to secure their own borders and to control the flow of people through Mexico. These stepped-up efforts should help relieve some of the extraordinary pressure on the U.S.-Mexico border.  This was an important step in tackling the unacceptable and unsustainable crisis--the crisis that continues to roil our southern border. Mexico has an important role to play in solving the ongoing security and humanitarian nightmare.  Americans were also happy to hear the President's announcement that, as a result of this progress, our own families and businesses will not need to absorb the cost of higher tariffs on imports from Mexico. This would have been a step backward for the U.S. economy generally, a new obstacle for many of our manufacturers and small businesses, and a pain that families back home tell me often would hurt them directly.  At its best, the U.S.-Mexico friendship should combine strong mutual efforts on security with a strong and prosperous trading relationship. I am glad that is the direction we seem to be headed.  So this was an important step, but as my Republican colleagues and I have been sounding the alarm for months, the magnitude of this border crisis means that more will obviously be necessary.  Our U.S. processing facilities are badly strained beyond capacity as record numbers of individuals and families continue to pour through.  The men and women of Customs and Border Protection and our other agencies on the border are juggling too much, making do with too little and having to triage resources away from other important priorities so they can keep up even the most basic security functions and provide even the bare minimum humanitarian assistance.  The administration is working overtime on this. Now our Mexican friends are stepping up as well. In short, about the only important players who are still refusing to take action are myDemocratic friends right here in Congress.  Democrats in the House and the Senate have had no shortage of rhetoric on the subject. They are very focused on sounding concerned about this but thus far have stood in the way of any action.  It is not rocket science. The agencies on the border that are confronting this unprecedented crush of people need more resources. They have explained that to Congress as clearly as possible.  There is nothing remotely partisan about this. A few weeks ago, even the New York Times editorial board wrote:       As resources are strained and the system buckles, the      misery grows. Something needs to be done. Soon.  That is the New York Times. Just yesterday, they followed up with another piece: ``When Will Congress Get Serious About the Suffering at the Border?''  So for those scoring at home, President Trump and the New York Times editorial board are actually on the same side. It seems like everyone across the country understands that we should provide this funding--everyone except Democrats here in Washington who have become so addicted to picking political fights with the Trump administration that they are letting even their most basic responsibilities slip.  Well, I will have a lot more to say on this subject in the days ahead. I think everyone understands quite well that my friends across the aisle are not personal fans of the President. We got that.  I would suggest it is time to get over it. The security of the United States and the humanitarian conditions on our border cannot afford to go underfunded any longer just because Democrats cannot bring themselves to give this White House anything it asks for.                              Nominations  Madam President, examples continue to pour in about the big difference that well-qualified individuals the Senate has been confirming are making in government service.  Last autumn, the Senate got the Securities and Exchange Commission up and running at full steam when we confirmed the fifth member. Just last week, we saw the Commission take a major step forward thanks to those Commissioners and to the leadership of Jay Clayton, its Chairman.  In the area of investor protections, as with many other subjects, the legacy of the Obama administration was messy and ineffective.  President Obama's Department of Labor decided to unilaterally go even further than Dodd-Frank in regulating the advisers and broker-dealers who sell to investors. The regulation they put in place was a confusing, garbled attempt at imposing a single, one-size-fits-all standard on all kinds of businesses where it was not necessarily the best approach. It was wrong on the merits and, even apart from that, it was implemented in a half-baked and ineffective way.  Now Chairman Clayton and his colleagues are getting back on track. The SEC has carefully crafted a tailored new rule to make sure brokers really act in the best interests of their clients. There are new standards for disclosing conflicts of interest, new standards for transparency in fees, and new prohibitions against shady sales tactics.  In short, the new rule seems to be a case study in regulation done the right way, a careful, prudent step that will actually protect the American people.  This will not necessarily make front-page news across the Nation but just another example of the way we are literally turning the page on the Obama administration's failed policies and taking a smarter, better direction for the good of the country with outstanding nominees and sound decision making.                   Remembering Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie  Madam President, on one final matter, last week, the Senate learned of the passing of our longtime friend and counselor, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, who was the 61st Chaplain of the U.S. Senate.  Dr. Ogilvie served as Chaplain for 8 years, beginning in 1995. His career in ministry, teaching, and writing had already spanned four decades when Lloyd agreed to come serve here.  He brought with him unceasing patience, an attentive ear, and genuine concern for the thousands of Members, staff, and families who made up his Senate flock.  The Senate and the Nation saw tragedy during Lloyd's tenure. We mourned the death of three colleagues in office; we endured an attack on this building that left two Capitol Police officers dead; we faced September 11 and its aftermath; we weathered the anthrax scare; and, of course, those to whom he ministered also faced their own private, personal challenges during that time.  On all of these matters, so many people sought guidance, comfort, and counsel from Lloyd, and every single day, he provided it--a joyful, consistent, straightforward messenger and example of God's love.  He delivered daily prayers with kindly wisdom. He offered common ground in Bible study. He checked in on spouses, children, and staff, and he did it all while immaculately dressed with that deep, ringing voice. He was the complete package--a Scot, a Midwesterner, and briefly a Washingtonian, all in one.  After Dr. Ogilvie moved on in 2003, he moved to Fuller Seminary and established a center for preaching which bears his name. I am glad his legacy will continue to ripple out into new generations of spiritual leaders who will learn from his singular example.  So today the prayers of the Senate are with Lloyd's family. We are grateful for his lifelong ministry and especially for the fact that it brought him here.  One day early in his tenure, Dr. Ogilvie convened the Senate by asking God ``to hope through us today.'' He prayed: ``Make us people who are a lift and not a load, a blessing and not a burden.'' Today the many people whose lives he lifted up are remembering just how blessed we were by his friendship and how blessed we are by his example.                          ____________________
