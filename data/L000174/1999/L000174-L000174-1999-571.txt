I note the Senator from New Jersey is within his rights to make such a request. The Senator from Utah is within his rights to object to it.  Mr. President, I note the distinguished majority leader was on the floor earlier, urging we move forward on this legislation, that we try to get as much done as possible today and Monday, a position both the distinguished Senator from Utah and I joined. I suspect the two of us have probably worked more hours than anybody else in this body to bring that about. But there are not an awful lot of Senators around here waiting to be heard. I urge the majority, they may well allow Senators like Senator Lautenberg or others who have amendments to bring them up, discuss them, have some debate on them, and then if there are those who wish to oppose those amendments, they would of course have an equal amount of time on Monday to do that. Otherwise, of course, the Senator from New Jersey can bring it up Monday.  But you cannot keep holding it off with the idea that maybe it will only come up at the time of the vote on Tuesday, because that would be, in effect, a debate cloture on the part of the Republican side that would say even if it was a serious matter they would only get 2.5 minutes of debate.  I know the distinguished senior Senator from Utah is a fair person. I think he would perhaps agree that 2.5 minutes debate is not quite enough on major amendments. I hope they will find in their heart to allow the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey to bring up his amendment. Clearly, he is going to be allowed to bring it up sometime prior to the vote on it.  I yield the floor.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).
