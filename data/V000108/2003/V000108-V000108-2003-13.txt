 Mr. Speaker, it is with genuine sadness and a very heavy heart that I rise today in support of the resolution in honor of Indiana Governor Frank O'Bannon. Governor O'Bannon, as was mentioned, tragically passed away this past Saturday. I also want to extend my deepest sympathy, prayers and offer of assistance to Governor O'Bannon's wife Judy and their children and family.  One of the finest opportunities my career in politics has given me is meeting, working with and becoming friends with Frank O'Bannon. Frank was one of the most gentle men, one of the most decent men and one of the kindest individuals I have ever, ever met in my life. He is a man who could have been successful at any pursuit in life. He chose a life of public service because it was a life he could give to others. Except for his love for Judy and their children and their family, nothing was more important to Governor O'Bannon. His commitment to the future in children was foremost as far as his administration. And because Frank O'Bannon always knew who he was, he allowed his quiet demeanor and gentle nature to mask his inherent strength and ability to make very hard and very tough decisions for the good of all of the citizens of Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, a number of my colleagues have mentioned anecdotes and we all deal with individuals on a personal level, and I would add my two. Many years ago when Frank O'Bannon was first campaigning for Governor, I was at St. Mary's Orthodox Church hall in Gary, Indiana, at a political rally. Someone came in and said my father had fallen on the ice and snow outside. I go outside, Dad was perfectly fine, but there was Frank O'Bannon becausehe was near my father. There was nothing more important to Frank at that moment in time and if it took all night he was going to make sure he was up, he was fine, he was cleaned off and he got in that hall, no matter what his other demands were.  The other continuing recollection I have is I tried not to impose upon the Governor's good nature or offices very often but whenever I called for assistance, he never said he would do it. He never said yes. He always said, ``I'll see what I can do.'' And invariably the problem was solved, someone was helped or the State of Indiana moved ahead because you knew he was always going to do his best.  Frank O'Bannon was a good, good man. We are all going to miss him not only in our State but in this great country.                              {time}  1545
