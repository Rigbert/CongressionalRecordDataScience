President, today I am introducing legislation to name the U.S. Post Office at 7401 W. 100th Place in Bridgeview, IL after Postal Police Officer Michael Healy.  On June 21, 1981, while guarding the Chicago Main Post Office at Harrison Avenue and Canal Street, Officer Healy's life was senselessly cut short by a random act of violence. Officer Healy was murdered by three assailants in a foiled robbery attempt. Sadly, Michael Healy became the first officer of the Postal Inspection Service to be killed while on duty.  Shortly after his murder, the Postal Inspection Service retired Michael's badge, number 3972. Subsequently, Michael's name was added to the Federal Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, DC as well as the Law Enforcement Memorial in Springfield, IL.  In 2001, the Northern Illinois Division of the United States Inspection Service honored the 20th anniversary of Michael's death. The Fraternal Order of Police, FOP, has tried for two years to rename the local post office after Officer Healy.  In protecting others, Officer Healy made the ultimate sacrifice. I believe it is fitting to pay tribute to him by designating the postal facility in honor of Michael J. Healy. I think that it is the most appropriate way to recognize and remember a man who gave so much to his family, his friends, the Postal Inspection Service, and his community of Hometown, IL.                                 ______                                       By
