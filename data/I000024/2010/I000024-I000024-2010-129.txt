President, I support Senator Sanders' amendment No. 3738 regarding Federal Reserve transparency. As a cosponsor of S. 604, the Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009, my support for these efforts is clear. American taxpayers have a right to know how, where, and when their money is spent or put at risk. For too long, they have put up with secrecy and arrogance. That has to stop, and that is why I would have voted for Senator Sanders' amendment had I been able to do so and why I voted for Senator Vitter's amendment when I arrived in Washington. My travel was detained due to severe weather and tornadoes affecting Oklahoma yesterday.
