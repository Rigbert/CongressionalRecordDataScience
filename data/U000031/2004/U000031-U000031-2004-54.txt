Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Coy Dean Fortson who regretfully passed away recently. A life-long resident of Berrien County, Michigan, Coy was a dedicated family man whose extensive charity and dedication to local individuals and the community as a whole made southwest Michigan an even greater place to live and grow.  Coy valiantly served his country in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, and was a member of the Air Force Reserves for more than 30 years. Over his inspiring career at the Whirlpool Corporation, Coy helped to improve the lives of countless individuals who had the fortune of crossing his path. There is no question that Coy's passion for the betterment of our corner of Michigan will be greatly missed. He undoubtedly touched many lives as a member of Berrien County's FEMA Emergency Planning and Response Team. Coy also served on the Board of Directors for the local public library, where he spent many hours volunteering in order to expand the availability of educational resources for our extended community.  On behalf of the Sixth District of Michigan, our prayers and sincere regards go out to Coy's family and friends--he will certainly be deeply missed.                          ____________________
