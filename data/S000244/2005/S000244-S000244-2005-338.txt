 Madam Speaker, I am the author of the sunsets that were put in the PATRIOT Act that was signed by the President in October of 2001 because I agreed with what I heard from the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), that we ought to look at what the Justice Department had done with these expanded powers. We have looked at those actions. We have looked at how those expanded powers have been utilized; and in 14 of the 16 cases, nobody had any complaint about how those expanded powers have been utilized.  Now, sunsets are very rare in congressional action. I am proud of the fact that I put the sunsets in almost 4 years ago. But what I will say is that we do not sunset a whole host of other programs. Social Security is not sunsetted, nor should it be. Amtrak is not sunsetted, maybe it should be, but it is not. And I have, I am looking at the Federal criminal code and the national security letters that have been complained of by people on the other side of the aisle; they are not sunsetted. The authority for the national security letters was passed in 1986 when, I recall, the current minority party had a significant majority in the House of Representatives.  Now, if sunsets were so important when we are dealing with the civil liberties of the people of the United States of America, why did you forget about them 19 years ago?  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
