 President, I rise this morning to begin speaking on the issue of crime and justice in America and the Democratic crime bill, the Clinton [[Page S2349]]  crime bill that was passed last year, and the proposals to change that crime bill. I realize there is sort of a frenzy underway here where, to use the old expression, the freight train is rolling down the tracks, the contract is underway, and we are in a great hurry to change everything here.  I am going to spend a half hour or so this morning, and then future mornings, as we approach the debate on the Senate floor on the changes in the Biden crime--in the crime bill, and try to lay out some of at least what I see to be the facts.  Last year, Congress completed a 6-year effort and enacted a major anticrime law in which the Federal Government launched a bold and multifaceted attack on violent crime and its roots back in our communities, not here at the national level. For the first time, the Federal Government made major commitments to help States and localities, the places where 95 percent of all the crimes are committed and all the crimes are prosecuted. We got involved, to help them redress the greatest shortcomings in our system. And after years of study and overwhelming consensus, it was agreed what those shortcomings in our criminal justice system were and are.  No. 1, first and foremost, there is a shortage of police out on the streets of our communities. That is number one.  No. 2, the shortage of prison space and the need for sentencing reform at the State level.  No. 3, the shortage of effective responses to drug offenders.  No. 4, the lack of serious response to rape and family violence.  No. 5, the lack of safe places and positive activities for those children referred to as at-risk children, who grow up surrounded by illegal drugs, crime, and violence.  Everybody I am aware of agrees these were the problems we had to speak to. I might point out we pretty well have taken care of--which is a much easier problem to take care--the Federal side of that equation. We have enough Federal prison space in the Federal prison system. When you get sentenced, you go to jail for the totality of that term. I was the coauthor of that bill. In the Federal courts, if a judge says you are going to go to prison for 10 years, you know you are going to go to prison for at least 85 percent of that time--8.5 years, which is what the law mandates. You can get up to 1.5 years in good time credits, but that is all. And we abolished parole. So you know you'll be in prison for at least 8.5 years.  But in the States, the average amount of time people serve once sentenced in the State court is 43 percent of the time. So on average, in the States--my State being one of the exceptions, the State of Delaware, which essentially has the same records as the Federal Government; they keep people, on average, 85 percent of the time--but most States keep people in jail, if they get sentenced to 10 years in the State court, they only serve 4 years 2 months in a State prison.  So we fixed it at the Federal level. This was to help begin to not send rules or regulations or mandates to the States, but to send them money to fix the problems. It was to help them fix the problems I have stated, which everyone agreed on: Lack of police, lack of serious response to rape, et cetera.  Now, in its breadth, the crime bill we passed reflects the lessons learned over the past decade as we studied crime and law enforcement and worked on passing this law; namely, that all of the shortcomings have to be addressed at one time. Correcting one without the other is futile because crime knows no easy single answer. What we found out in the States and what we found out in our earlier experience in the Federal Government is when you increase penalties and you do not increase the number of prison spaces, you do not do much. If you put more cops on the street, they make more arrests, you increase the penalties, and you do not have places to put the felons, then the people just walk. So now you have convicted felons who are out on the street, not having served their time. So we learned we cannot just deal with one piece of it.  The anticrime law we passed last year addressed each of these shortcomings, as I will detail in a moment. In its approach, as well as in many specifics, the law was a result of bipartisan efforts--at least at the outset.  The law is already at work; $1 billion has already been awarded to the States and localities to put almost 15,000 new police officers on the streets in the community policing program. That is already done. The law only passed last fall and already almost 15,000 cops, new cops, brand new--not supplanting cops that were on local forces, almost 15,000 new local cops that were not there before--within the next several months, after they finish their training, are going to be on the streets in the United States of America because of this crime bill. Dollars, under the drug court program, the Violence Against Women Act, are going to be awarded over the next few months.  I hoped I could spend the next several months watching over the smooth and speedy implementation of this law, as well as turning my focus to the substantial issues that still lie before us. Just to name two priorities, we must turn all our talk about our war on drugs into a real battle, and we have to reform our juvenile justice system as it struggles to deal with violent, youthful offenders unlike any the current system was designed to handle.  That is work still to be done. I thought we would be on the floor here this next year and the following year, dealing with finally doing something real about the drug problem and doing something more about juvenile justice because when I wrote the crime bill, I never advertised it as--as my grandfather would say, this is not a horse to carry the sleigh. The whole sleigh on crime is more than what the crime bill was about, and we have said that, frankly, from the beginning. What we did, we thought we were going to have in place; we thought we were going to be just implementing.  Very soon, the Senate will embark on a debate, not about new challenges, but of the anticrime law we just enacted last fall. The House is already taking apart this law piecemeal.  What is motivating a retreat on the bill that contained so many provisions drafted and once supported by Republicans, as well as Democrats, quite frankly, escapes me. I will let you draw your own conclusions. But I ask you walk with me through the changes the Republican leadership seeks to make in the anticrime law. I suspect the merits will speak for themselves.  At the same time, I want to make clear what I will fight for and what I will fight against, as we revisit the issues debated in the crime bill last year so thoroughly. Let me turn first to the central provision of the present new crime law, a program designed to address the first major law enforcement shortcoming I mentioned, a program that deserves, in my view, to be preserved and one I will fight to save from the Republican chopping block. Let me speak first about that program.  That program puts 100,000 new police on the street. I do not know a responsible police leader, an academic expert, a public official who does not agree that putting more police officers on our streets back home and in our neighborhoods is a good idea, a good idea that goes by the name of community policing. The true innovation of community policing is that it enables police officers to pursue dual goals. They are better positioned to respond to and apprehend suspects when crime occurs. But they are also better positioned to keep crime from occurring in the first place.  Today, too many police officers are strangers in their own communities. From headquarters or cruisers, they respond to radio calls only after crime has occurred, forever behind the curve. Police officers are a part of their community. Community police officers will be a part of their community. They know their community--the hot spots, the troublemakers, the gang members--and they can work to prevent crime in the first place.  I do not want to go back to a nostalgic and romantic view of what used to be the case. But most of us who grew up in anything that remotely resembles a city or a town that had an identity when we were kids, those of us in this Chamber, when we were kids, we knew the local cop. He walked down the street. He knew everybody. He knew who owned what store. He knew the kids who were troublemakers and those who were not. We knew if we got into trouble, he would call our mothers or call our fathers.  Things have not been working too well is for a whole range of reasons--mainly the shortage of bodies--but one of the reasons is that we have moved away from community policing. In my own State, community policing took the form of foot patrols with a particular focus on breaking up street-level drug dealing that had turned one of Wilmington's neighborhoods into a crime zone. These efforts successfully suppressed drug activity without displacing it to another part of the city. The Wilmington example fits the shorthand description often used for community policing; that is, putting cops on the streets to walk the beat. But in practice, community policing takes on many forms, depending on the needs of any particular community.  The form of community policing takes various forms. From community to community, the results coming in from the field are all the same. Community policing works. In New York City, a place where crime can seem insurmountable, the police commissioner began an aggressive community policing program that contributed to a significant decrease in serious offenses last year.                          ____________________
