 President, I rise today to offer my continued endorsement for the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic Byways Program, and to express my support for the Kennett Pike Preservation Committee's efforts to seek both state and federal scenic byways designation for Route 52, the Kennett Pike, in New Castle County, Delaware.  The National Scenic Byways Program recognizes roadways that exhibit outstanding examples of scenic, historic, recreational, cultural, archeological or natural qualities along their routes. The Kennett Pike boasts a number of cultural, scenic, historic and recreational values that I believe make it an excellent candidate for federal designation as a national scenic byway.  Originally constructed in the 1700's and named Doe Run, the Kennett Pike maintains much of its original character, despite more than 200 years of steady development in the area. During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington and his troops were thought to have marched along the road, and, during the Civil War, soldiers settled at Camp Brandywine, now the location of an intersection on the Pike.  Along its route, not only will you find world renown tourist attractions, including Winterthur Museum, Hagley Museum and Longwood Gardens, but also historic villages, numerous inns, farms, parks and mills. Within the Kennett Pike Corridor, over 30 sites are already listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with many more sites in the corridor also eligible for the historic designation.  In addition to its historic and cultural relevance, the Kennett Pike has been designated a greenway by the State of Delaware. A ride along the Pike reveals a beautiful landscape of rolling hills, forests and a state park. The Kennett Pike is truly a gem among the ever increasingly populated suburban landscape of the middle Atlantic region.  In the Fall of 1999, the State of Delaware received a grant from the Federal Highway Administration, in the amount of $140,000, to establish a state scenic byways program. A roadway can only be nominated for a national scenic byway designation after it has been designated on the state level.  It is my hope that the State will act quickly and implement its scenic byways program, so I can continue my efforts to see that Route 52, the Kennett Pike, is designated the first national scenic byway in the State of Delaware.                          ____________________
