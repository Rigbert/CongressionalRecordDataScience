Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time.  Well, again, in response to my good friend, the President said hundreds of times: Mexico is going to pay for the wall. They are not.  We have the transcript of the phone call where he called the new President of Mexico and said: Look, I know you are not going to pay for the wall, but you can't say that. We are going to pay for it.  So, that is one thing.  Also, he talked about moving the Embassy to Jerusalem. The President was going to deliver a peace plan for the Middle East. Where is it?  There are a lot of things this President said he was going to do that haven't happened.  Getting close to the President is sort of like being in the orbit of a black hole, which sucks in everything. And that sucked in a lot of things and a lot of people who have been, then, blown back out at some point by the President.                              {time}  1030  His current Acting Chief of Staff--I don't know how long he has been acting now; a year, a year and half, something like that. The President likes them to be acting because he can get rid of them more easily, he thinks.  When he had his own opinions, when he wasn't in the orbit of the black hole of Donald Trump, he said about walls, Mick Mulvaney, the President's acting Chief of Staff: ``You go under, you go around, you go through. What they need is more manpower and more technology.'' Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said that August 25, 2015, when he had his own opinions, when he worked here in the United States House of Representatives. He can't have his own opinions anymore.  He thought a wall was stupid then and it wouldn't do anything. And he said what we have been saying; we inspect six percent of the semi-tractor trailers that roll across the border, and we have testimony in the conviction of a drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, in New York, we have testimony in that trial. They are bringing the drugs in in just boatloads, or truckloads, boatloads--we already talked about the Coast Guard--and truckloads across the border because we only inspect a fraction of them.  So what if they lose a few? Hundreds of millions of dollars; that is the cost of doing business. This is a multi-billion-dollar business, these cartels.  And as Mick Mulvaney said in an honest moment, we need manpower. We already heard that they have only got four people at the border crossing in Arizona.  Why do they only have four people? We have appropriated more money for more Border Patrol people consistently, year in, year out. But they are way behind in their numbers. They haven't been able to hire up to the numbers we have authorized.  And technology, which is what I am talking about, they don't have that either.  There is also--I mean, you know, people over there are pooh-poohing child care centers for the troops in the military and things like that. They don't need it. Their kids don't need it. Really?  And then also the President is taking hundreds of millions of dollars out of the European defense initiative.  I have been to Poland recently, and I have seen the Suwalki Corridor. That is the Russian invasion route into Europe. For years it was the Fulda Gap, but now it is the Suwalki Corridor since Germany is reunified.  And we are going to cancel projects in countries to defend that area and give them better capability to defend themselves against the Russian invasion.  But since Vlad--that is Mr. Putin, whatever dictators are called in Russia--is buddies with the President; they have secret phone calls, secret conversations that aren't transcribed, the President is withholding money from Ukraine to defend itself.  And now we are going to cut money for our allies, the European defense initiative, to build a stupid, useless wall on the border.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
