President, I rise to address the problems we are having getting energy legislation to the Senate floor.  I strongly believe we need to have a comprehensive energy package brought to the Chamber.  My colleagues may remember that a short while ago, I offered an amendment on the Defense authorization bill that would have included a comprehensive energy policy--H.R. 4, the House-passed bill, the bill the administration wants, the bill the majority of people in this Chamber want to pass--in the legislation. I was criticized for that. Yet there is no stronger supporter of the military than I.  Having been chairman of the defense authorization readiness subcommittee for some 5 years, I see energy as a major national security issue. Frankly, it was a wrong decision for the Parliamentarian to say it was not germane.  Let's look at where we are today. Today we are 56.6 percent dependent upon foreign countries for our oil supply. That means we are 56 percent dependent upon foreign countries for our ability to fight a war. What is alarming is that 50 percent of what we have to import is coming from the Middle East. The fastest growing contributor to that amount upon which we are dependent is none other than Iraq. You can say in one-sentence form: It is ludicrous that we should be considered to be dependent upon Iraq for our ability to fight a war against Iraq.  We have a new figure I would like to share with the Senate. In the year 2000 alone, the United States bought $5 billion worth of oil from Iraq.  Let's look at where we are today. For all practical purposes, not only are we at war in Afghanistan, but also in Iraq. They have shot down three of our Predators. We have no-fly zones. We have our troops who should be better trained when they arrive in the Persian Gulf. Yet we are dependent upon Iraq and the Middle East for our ability to carry out a war. If something should happen, an accident of a tanker coming in, any number of things, it would be an absolute disaster.  I will cite for my colleagues some recent statements that I didn't have at the time to share when I brought up my amendment.  One is from Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense. In response to my question, he said:       [It] is a serious strategic issue. . . . My sense is that      [our] dependency is projected to grow, not to decline. . . .      I think you're right to point out that it's not only that we      would, in a sense, be dependent upon Iraqi oil, but the oil      as a weapon. The possibility of taking that oil off the      market and doing enormous economic damage with it is a very      serious problem.  Senator Carper, the other day, was in a colloquy and statements were going back and forth, and quoting Mr. Greenspan responding to one of Senator Carper's questions--this is Greenspan, and we are getting ready for an economic stimulus:       At the moment, the demand for power is pretty soft because      the economy is soft. That is going to change. And when it      changes, unless we have a long-term focus on how we put our      infrastructure together, how we set incentives and rules to,      one, maintain energy security while protecting the      environment, we are going to run into trouble. And I think      unless we give it very considerable thought now--projecting      five, six, seven years out in the future--we are going to get      sub-optimal solutions.  This is not a new issue. I started on this issue back in the Reagan administration. Nor is this a partisan issue because the Reagan administration, while he was President, refused to have a comprehensive energy policy. Then along came George ``the first.'' He came out of the oil patch, so we thought surely this man would be able to successfully have a national energy policy. And he would not do it. This was at a time when we were nearing a war. This is a national security issue, not an energy issue. During the Clinton administration, he would not do it either.  Now we have an agreement where the leadership on both sides says we need a comprehensive energy policy. We need to have a vote this year to accomplish two things: One, our national security, to get out of this quagmire in the Middle East and to be able to fight a war; two, an economic stimulus. I can't think of anything that would be more positive to stimulate the economy than a national energy policy. It involves some controversial things, yes. ANWR is one small part of this. People keep saying this is an ANWR bill. It is not. We are talking about H.R. 4 over in the House. It has 300 pages. Only 2 pages are ANWR. It includes a comprehensive approach, including nuclear; some of our marginal production in this country that is virtually cut off because of the unpredictability of prices. If you get a marginal operator drilling a well for 15 barrels or less and he is not going to be able to know the price of oil 15 months down the road, he is not going to do it. Consequently, we are not doing it. If we had all of the marginal production that we have ceased to have over the last 10 years in production today, it would equal the total amount we are importing from Saudi Arabia. Consequently, I see this as a critical issue that has to be dealt with this year.  Just recently, I notice almost on a daily basis President Bush expresses the administration's position. This is from the 17th in Sacramento:       I ask Congress to now act on an energy bill that the House      of Representatives passed back in August. . . . Too much of      our energy comes from the Middle East. The plan I sent up to      Congress promotes conservation, expands energy supplies, and      improves the efficiency of our energy network. Our country      needs greater energy independence. The issue is a matter of      national security, and I hope the Senate acts quickly.  We have many other quotes. I will mention a last one from the Secretary of the Interior, Gale Norton, the other day:       The President has said very clearly this is a priority.      This situation--  Referring to September 11--     has made it more urgent, and we need to begin moving the      process. We have always said that national security is part      of the reason we need to get the energy program in place, and      we certainly have not backed away from that position now that      September 11 has occurred.  So I think there is nothing more important to deal with between now and the end of the session than a comprehensive energy bill. Let's at least bring it up for a vote. That is what this is supposed to be about, so we can debate this issue. We can't really debate this issue, other than the way I am doing it now, in anticipation of a vote, unless we have an opportunity to have a vote. So I think you are going to see this offered again as an amendment. The logical place should be on the economic stimulus package, because this is an economic stimulus issue, as well as a national security issue.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
