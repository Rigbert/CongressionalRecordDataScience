Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution which calls for the condemnation of the vast Laogai labor system of more than 1,000 prisons, camps and mental institutions maintained by the government of the People's Republic of China, and of the use of forced labor as an integral part of China's economy.  I would note parenthetically that, back in 1992, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf) and I gained access to one of those prison camps, Beijing Prison Camp Number 1, a horrible place where 40 Tiananmen Square activists were being punished for their peaceful activities. Hundreds of others were also imprisoned there for political, religious and other alleged crimes. The place reeked of cruelty and sadness and was a nightmarish insight into the dark soul of the Chinese Communist dictatorship. Today, sadly, the Laogai continues its cruelty unabated.  Indeed, the continued operation of this network of Stalinist camps withinChina's borders raises grave questions about Beijing's commitment to engage in reform even after it seeks to be recognized as a leader among the community of nations.  The Laogai, which was created by the Chinese Communist party under Mao Zedong and modelled after the Soviet Gulag system, serves the one-party dictatorship as a tool to maintain control of a population yearning to be free. The Laogai system has tormented more than 50 million people since its founding and still contains as many as 4 million prisoners today. It not only provides the government a source of cheap labor, it also serves to instill fear in its citizens lest they be forced to go through ``reeducation'' through hard labor and compulsory political indoctrination.  The low cost of maintaining these prisons provides additional incentive for the PRC to continue its use of the Laogai system. The use of slave labor to manufacture a product for export as an integral part of its economy represents not only a violation of international law and labor standards but represents an unfair trade practice which widens the trade deficit and threatens American jobs.  As is so common in authoritarian regimes, the PRC represses freedom of religion and expression through this system of more than 1,000 prisons. As we know, Mr. Speaker, these prisoners are given no legal rights and are often tortured in order to induce confessions. All Laogai prisoners are forced to labor in order to remake them as new socialist persons. New arrivals are subjected to immediate, daily, lengthy interrogation sessions and forced to admit their ``crimes.'' These sessions may last days, weeks and even months. In some cases, they last years. If a prisoner resists, he or she is tortured.  The horrifying trade in human organs from China is the latest development of the Laogai system. The organs of more than 1,000 executed prisoners have reportedly been harvested for money. In the 1990s and to the year 2005, as part of the series of about 24 Congressional hearings that I have chaired on human rights abuses in China, I conducted one extraordinary hearing on this grizzly business. In that hearing, with the help of the great Harry Wu, a survivor of the Laogai himself, we heard from a former PRC police officer who testified and brought compelling proof as to how prisoners were shot, but not killed, and moved to awaiting ambulances to begin the process of removing their organs for transplantation.  The practice reminded me and many others in that hearing of the atrocities committed by the infamous Nazi, Dr. Joseph Mengele.  Despite numerous human rights treaties, Mr. Speaker, to which the PRC is a signatory, the government continues to use the Laogai as a means to suppress groups such as the Falun Gong and other religious believers, but in the case of the Falun Gong, up to 50 percent of the Laogai prisoner population is made up of those individuals.  Cyber dissidents and journalists are increasingly being crushed by the Laogai system as well. As in the case of Shi Tao, a journalist who is now serving a 10-year forced labor sentence at a jewelry factory attached to the Chishan prison for sending an e-mail through his Yahoo account warning journalists of the dangers of social destabilization and the risks of return of certain dissidents on the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.  I point out to my colleagues, and I hope that each and every one of you will read this, there is a very, very strong statement on torture by the U.N. rapporteur on torture who has just finished his report, Manfred Nowak.  He said that the abuse of suspects and prisoners remains widespread. His report describes some of the torture methods used by China's police and prison officers to extract confessions and maintain discipline: Emersion in sewage, sleep deprivation, cigarette burns and beating with electric prods. Not surprisingly, Mr. Nowak also accused the Chinese officials of systematically interfering with his investigations.  Victims and family members were intimidated by security personnel during the visit, placed under surveillance or instructed not to meet with Mr. Nowak. Among the prisoners, Mr. Nowak said he observed ``a palpable level of fear and self-censorship'' that he had not seen in missions in other countries.  One cannot be optimistic given recent events, but killings by gunfire last week of at least 20 residents in the village of Dongzhou in southern China by Beijing's security forces is further evidence that China has a long way to go in achieving the rule of law.  The cold-blooded murder of these villagers protesting over land use and the corruption demonstrates clearly that, 16 years after Tiananmen Square, Chairman Mao's famous dictum that ``all political power comes from the barrel of the gun'' is still the credo of Beijing's leaders.  Those among our friends in Europe who seek removal of an arms embargo against China should reflect on the use of guns and bullets to kill the innocent villagers in Dongzhou and to keep 4 million inmates, many prisoners of conscience, locked up in the vast Laogai system.  This resolution sends a strong message, and I urge its passage.Special Rapporteur on Torture Highlights Challenges at End of Visit to                                  China                              Introduction       Beijing, 2 December 2005.--The Special Rapporteur of the      United Nations Commission on Human Rights on torture and      other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment      concluded a two-week visit to the People's Republic of China      (PRC) today.       Nearly a decade after the initial request, the visit to the      PRC by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture,      Manfred Nowak, finally materialised from 20 November to 2      December, and included visits to Beijing, Lhasa, Tibet      Autonomous Region (TAR) and Urumqi, Xinjiang Uighur      Autonomous Region (XUAR). The long-awaited visit of the      Special Rapporteur on Torture to China has its origins in a      1995 request by the then Special Rapporteur, Sir Nigel      Rodley, for an invitation to carry out a fact-finding visit.      The Government responded in 1999 with an invitation for a      ``friendly visit'' in May 2000, however, differences between      the Government and the Special Rapporteur on the standard      methodology for country visits by United Nations human rights      experts (including unannounced visits to detention centres      and private meetings with detainees) prevented it from being      realized. In spring 2004, the Government extended an      unconditional invitation to the then Special Rapporteur, Theo      van Boven, for a two-week visit in June of that year, which      was then postponed by the Government. Upon Manfred Nowak's      appointment as Special Rapporteur on Torture in December      2004, the Government of China renewed its invitation for a      visit in 2005, accepting his Terms of Reference.       The mission's aim was two-fold: fact-finding and starting a      process of cooperation aimed at the common goal of      eradicating torture in the PRC.       The Special Rapporteur wishes to express his deep      appreciation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in      particular Dr. Shen Yongxiang, Special Representative on      Human Rights Affairs, and his team for their professionalism,      cooperation, and shared commitment to the objectives of the      mission. The Special Rapporteur credits the Ministry for its      great efforts in ensuring that the mission proceeded as      smoothly as possible and that his Terms of Reference were in      principle respected. All meetings with detainees were carried      out in privacy and in locations designated by the Rapporteur.      No request for a meeting or interviewing of a particular      individual was refused. Prison staff were generally      cooperative. The Special Rapporteur was also able to meet      with a number of individuals outside of his official      programme, notwithstanding the obstructions elaborated upon      below.       While visits were also planned for Jinan in Shandong      Province and Yining in the XUAR, the Special Rapporteur      sincerely regrets that he had to cancel these visits due to      time constraints, and expresses his gratitude to the Ministry      of Foreign Affairs and the respective leaderships of Shandong      Province and Yining Autonomous Prefecture for accommodating      these last minute changes to the programme.       While in Beijing, the Special Rapporteur met with      Government officials, including the Assistant Foreign      Minister, the Vice Ministers of Justice and Public Security,      the Deputy Procurator-General, as well as prominent members      of civil society including the All China Lawyers'      Association, the Beijing Lawyers' Association, China      University for Political Science and Law, Renmin University,      Tsinghua University, Beijing University, the Chinese Academy      of Social Sciences, and the Beijing Child Legal and Research      Centre. Meetings were also held with individual lawyers,      human rights defenders, academics, and members of the      diplomatic corps and UN country team. In Lhasa and Urumqi,      the Special Rapporteur met with local officials including      from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the People's Court, the      Procuratorate, and Departments of Justice and Public      Security.       In Beijing, the Special Rapporteur visited the Municipal      Detention Centre, Prison No. 2     (twice), and the Municipal Women's Re-education Through      Labour (RTL) Facility. In Lhasa he visited Lhasa Prison,      Tibet Autonomous Region Prison (also known as Drapchi      Prison), and the recently-opened Qushui Prison. In Urumqi, he      visited Prison Nos. 1, 3, and 4, as well as the Liu Dao Wan      Detention Centre. In all facilities, the Special Rapporteur      met with prison management and interviewed detainees in      private.          Particular circumstances of the fact-finding mission       The Special Rapporteur feels compelled to point out that      some Government authorities, particularly the Ministries of      State Security and Public Security, attempted at various      times throughout the visit to obstruct or restrict his      attempts at fact-finding. The Special Rapporteur and his team      were frequently under surveillance by intelligence personnel,      both in their Beijing hotel as well as in its vicinity.      Furthermore, during the visit a number of alleged victims and      family members were intimidated by security personnel, placed      under police surveillance, instructed not to meet the Special      Rapporteur, or were physically prevented from meeting with      him.       Prison officials imposed their own working hours as limits      for interviews which curtailed the number of facilities that      could be visited and the number of detainees interviewed. The      Special Rapporteur and his team were also prevented from      bringing photographic or electronic equipment into prisons.       Furthermore, in contrast to his previous country visits,      the Special Rapporteur was unable to obtain a letter of      authorization from the relevant authorities to visit      detention centres on his own. Consequently, officials from      the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accompanied him to detention      centres in order to ensure unrestricted access. As the      authorities were generally informed an hour in advance, the      visits could not be considered to have been strictly      ``unannounced.'' Nonetheless, this practice significantly      improves upon the modalities employed in previous visits      to China of Special Procedures of the Commission on Human      Rights.       In his interviews with detainees, the Special Rapporteur      observed a palpable level of fear and self-censorship, which      he had not experienced in the course of his previous      missions. A considerable number of detainees did not express      a willingness to speak with the Rapporteur, and several of      those who did requested absolute confidentiality.       Under these conditions and taking into account the size and      complexity of China as well as the limited duration of the      mission, the Special Rapporteur acknowledges the limitations      in drawing up a comprehensive set of findings and conclusions      on the situation of torture and ill-treatment in China.                 situation of torture and ill-treatment       The Special Rapporteur recalls that over the last several      years his predecessors have received a significant number of      serious allegations related to torture and other forms of      ill-treatment in China, which have been submitted to the      Government for its comments. These have included a consistent      and systematic pattern of torture related to ethnic      minorities, particularly Tibetans and Uighurs, political      dissidents, human rights defenders, practitioners of Falun      Gong, and members of house-church groups. These allegations      have been and continue to be documented by international      human rights organizations.       The methods of torture alleged include, among others:      beatings; use of electric shock batons; cigarette burns;      hooding/blindfolding; guard-instructed or permitted beatings      by fellow prisoners; use of handcuffs or ankle fetters for      extended periods (including in solitary confinement or secure      holding areas), submersion in pits of water or sewage;      exposure to conditions of extreme heat or cold, being forced      to maintain uncomfortable positions, such as sitting,      squatting, lying down, or standing for long periods of time,      sometimes with objects held under arms; deprivation of sleep,      food or water; prolonged solitary confinement; denial of      medical treatment and medication; hard labour; and suspension      from overhead fixtures from handcuffs. In several cases, the      techniques employed have been given particular terminologies,      such as the ``tiger bench'', where one is forced to sit      motionless on a tiny stool a few centimeters off the ground;      ``reversing an airplane'', where one is forced to bend over      while holding legs straight, feet close together and arms      lifted high; or ``exhausting an eagle'', where one is forced      to stand on a tall stool and subjected to beatings until      exhaustion. On the basis of the information he received      during his mission, the Special Rapporteur confirms that many      of these methods of torture have been used in China.       Although he cannot make a detailed determination as to the      current scale of these abuses, the Special Rapporteur      believes that the practice of torture, though on the      decline--particularly in urban areas--remains widespread in      China. Indeed, this is increasingly recognized by Government      officials and reports. According to the 2005 Supreme People's      Procuratorate's (SPP) report to the National People's      Congress presented on 9 March 2005, covering the year      2004), 1595 civil servants had been investigated for      suspected criminal activity in cases involving ``illegal      detention, coercion of confessions, using violence to      obtain evidence, abuse of detainees, sabotaging elections,      and serious dereliction of duty resulting in serious loss      of life or property.'' The report goes on to note that      this is a 13.3 percent increase over the previous year's      totals and that the SPP personally investigated 82 of the      most serious cases. When compared with other national      statistics, these official figures are clearly the tip of      the iceberg in a country the size of China and demonstrate      that most victims and their families are reluctant to file      complaints for fear of reprisal or lack of confidence that      their complaints will be addressed effectively.              efforts by the government to combat torture       In recognizing the problem, the Government has undertaken a      number of measures to tackle torture. In August 2003, the      Minister of Public Security, Zhou Yongkang, issued a set of      unified regulations on the standardization of law-enforcement      procedures for public security institutions entitled,      ``Regulations on the Procedures for Handling Administrative      Cases'', including procedures defining police powers in      respect of time limits for confiscation of property, legal      means for gathering evidence, time limits on investigation      and examination of suspects, etc. In 2004, the Ministry      issued regulations prohibiting the use of torture and threats      to gain confessions. The Supreme People's Procurotorate      announced that eliminating interrogation through torture      would be a priority of their work agenda and has instructed      procurators that confessions obtained as a result of torture      cannot form a basis for the formal approval of arrests and      that prosecutors must work to eliminate illegally obtained      evidence.       In addition to initiatives at the central level, the      Zhejiang provincial Public Security Department issued      regulations on forced confessions stating that local police      chiefs will be expected to resign in any district where there      are more than two cases of forced confessions resulting in      injuries, miscarriages of justice or public order problems.      In mid-April 2005, Sichuan law enforcement and judicial      authorities issued a joint opinion that prohibits the use of      illegally obtained evidence, such as coerced confessions in      criminal trials, and requires courts to exclude coerced      statements and confessions if police cannot provide a      rational explanation of the alleged coercion or refuse to      investigate allegations of abuse.       Practical measures to combat torture have included piloting      systems of audio and video recording in interrogation rooms,      strengthening representation during the investigative and      pre-trial phase of the criminal process by placing lawyers on      a 24-hour basis in pilot police stations, designing      interrogation rooms which separate suspects from      interrogators, and placing resident procurators in places of      detention and near public security bureaux to supervise law      enforcement personnel.       The Special Rapporteur also observes positive developments      at the legislative level including the planned reform of      several laws relevant to the criminal procedure, which he      hopes will bring Chinese legislation into greater conformity      with international norms, particularly the fair trial      standards contained in the International Covenant on Civil      and Political Rights (CCPR) which China signed in 1998 and is      preparing to ratify. He also welcomes the resumption by the      Supreme People's Court (SPC) of its authority to review all      death penalty cases, particularly given the fact that the      quality of the judiciary increases as one ascends the      hierarchy. The Special Rapporteur suggests that China might      use the opportunity of this important event to increase      transparency regarding the number of death sentences in the      country, as well as to consider legislation that would allow      direct petitioning to the SPC in cases where individuals do      not feel that they were provided with adequate relief by      lower courts in cases involving the use of torture, access to      counsel, etc.        Need for further efforts to prevent and address torture       The Special Rapporteur notes that China was among the first      States to ratify the UN Convention against Torture (CAT) in      1988, which requires States parties to take measures for the      prevention of torture and to punish every act of torture with      appropriately serious penalties. Although Chinese law      prohibits gathering evidence through torture and provides for      punishment of those guilty of torture, the Chinese definition      of torture does not fully correspond to the international      standard contained in CAT. In particular, physical or      psychological torture that leaves no physical trace is      difficult if not impossible to punish with appropriate      penalties in China (indeed, the Chinese word for torture,      ``kuxing,'' principally connotes physical torture).       Combating torture in China is further impeded by the      absence of essential procedural safeguards necessary to make      its prohibition effective, including: the effective exclusion      of evidence from statements established to be made as a      result of torture; the presumption of innocence; the      privilege against self-incrimination; timely notice of      reasons for detention or arrest; prompt external review of      detention or arrest; granting of non-custodial measures, such      as bail; the right of habeas corpus; and timely access to      counsel and adequate time and facilities to prepare a      defence.       Other serious shortcomings are the lack of an independent      monitoring mechanism of all places of detention and a      functional complaints mechanism. A number of authorities have      pointed out that mechanisms exist in     China for individuals to report instances of torture,      particularly procurators, some of which are resident in      prisons and near police stations. However, the Special      Rapporteur believes that it is difficult to rely on the      vigilance of procurators whose interest in convicting      suspects as charged might compromise their ability to oversee      the police and prison guards. In addition, procurators      encounter many difficulties in practice to exercise their      supervisory role, including because detainees are afraid to      report instances of torture to them.       During his mission, the Special Rapporteur noted the      inefficiency of current complaint mechanisms. He was      informed, for example, that in Prison No. 4 in Urumqi, the      procurators have not received a single torture complaint      during the last decade. In the Tibetan Autonomous Region,      he was told that no complaint had been received since 2003      and in the Beijing Municipal Detention Centre, none were      received since its establishment in June 2004. In the      Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, two cases of torture      were established by the courts since 2000, and in the      Tibet Autonomous Region one such case had been confirmed.      The Deputy Procurator-General of the PRC informed the      Special Rapporteur that only 33 law enforcement officials      had been prosecuted for torture throughout the country      during the first nine months of 2005.       Indeed, an important element in combating torture is      judicial oversight. However, China lacks an independent      judiciary, and the judiciary suffers from relatively low      status in comparison to other State organs. Without a court      system that judges cases fairly and independently according      to law, thereby redressing grievances in a timely manner, the      problem of torture cannot be brought under effective control,      particularly in a context where police exercise wide      discretion in matters of arrest and detention and are under      great pressure to solve cases.    Forced re-education as a form of inhuman and degrading treatment       The Special Rapporteur also pointed to conceptual or      ideological constraints to the effective implementation of      the prohibition of torture. The criminal justice system is      focused on admission of culpability, and the role of      obtaining confessions continues to be central to successful      prosecutions. In fact even after persons, who have not      confessed to an offence, have been convicted and sentenced,      these persons are subject to restrictions within prison, such      as limited restricted access to telephone or visiting      privileges until they confess, or are provided the incentive      of a reduced sentence if they confess. Moreover, the system      as such places a strong emphasis on change and re-education      of the criminal, and the acceptance of punishment.       Societies that have been successful in establishing a human      rights culture differ from others in the degree of tolerance      of the majority towards those whose behavior deviates from      standard moral and social norms. This right to be different,      which finds its legal expression in the human rights to      privacy, freedom of expression, religion, assembly and      association, lies at the very heart of any democratic      society. These freedoms and political rights were not enacted      to protect conformist behavior, but non-conformist behavior.       Under international human rights law, Governments are only      permitted to interfere with the expression of political      opinions, religious convictions, moral values or minority      views when they constitute incitement to hatred or violence      or a direct threat to national security or public safety in      the country. A system of State surveillance of citizens with      non-conformist views and with severe punishments for such      ``deviant behavior'', such as Re-Education through Labour      (RTL), seems to be incompatible with the core values of a      society based upon a culture of human rights and leads to      intimidation, submissiveness, self-censorship and a ``culture      of fear'', which interferes with the right not to be      subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.       Every society has the right, and indeed is required by      article 10 of the CCPR, to assist convicted criminals during      their prison term through vocational training, education, and      measures aimed at ensuring their equal access to the labour      market in order to become law-abiding citizens. However,      efforts aimed at the rehabilitation and re-socialisation of      persons who committed crimes should be clearly distinguished      from forms of deprivation of liberty aimed at the forceful      re-education of human beings with deviant behaviour through      labour and coercion.       The system of RTL in China and similar methods of re-     education in prisons and even in pre-trial detention centres      go well beyond legitimate rehabilitation measures and aim at      breaking the will of detainees and altering their      personality. Such measures strike at the very core of the      human right to personal integrity, dignity and humanity, as      protected by Articles 7 and 10 of the CCPR, as well as      articles 1 and 16 of the CAT. RTL constitutes not only a      serious violation of the human right to personal liberty, but      must also be considered as a systematic form of inhuman and      degrading treatment or punishment, if not torture. RTL and      similar measures of forced re-education in prisons, pre-trial      detention centres and psychiatric hospitals should therefore      be abolished.              circumstances surrounding capital punishment       The Special Rapporteur also expressed concern about the      circumstances surrounding the death penalty, including the      situation of prisoners on death row. At the Beijing      Municipality Detention Centre, where the Rapporteur spoke      with prisoners sentenced to death at first instance and      awaiting appeal, he noted that these prisoners were      handcuffed and shackled with leg-irons weighing approximately      3kg, 24 hours per day and in all circumstances (Le. including      during meals, visits to the toilet, etc). Prison officials      indicated that the average length of appeal was two months.      This practice is reportedly based on a nation-wide regulation      for detention facilities. When questioned by the Special      Rapporteur on the reasons for the handcuffs and shackles      around the clock, prison officials indicated that this was      necessary for their own safety, the security of others, to      prevent them from fleeing, and to prevent suicide. However,      in the Liu Dao Wan Detention Centre in Urumqi, death row      prisoners were ``only'' shackled and not handcuffed. In the      opinion of the Special Rapporteur this practice is inhuman      and degrading and serves only as an additional form of      punishment of someone already subjected to the stress and      grievance associated with having been sentenced to death. The      Special Rapporteur also expressed concern at the high number      of crimes for which the death penalty can be applied. He      encouraged the Government to both narrow its scope and to be      more transparent towards family members and the public at      large regarding its use; including by making statistics on      the death penalty public information.              Recommendations to the Government of the PRC       Among his key preliminary recommendations to the      Government, the Special Rapporteur recommended:       Reform the criminal law by adding the crime of torture in      accordance with the definition contained in CAT (Art. 1) with      appropriate penalties.       Ensure that the reform of the criminal procedure law      conforms to ICCPR fair trial provisions, including by      providing for the following: the right to remain silent and      the privilege against self-incrimination; the right to cross-     examine witnesses and the effective exclusion of evidence      extracted through torture.       Reform the criminal justice system by transferring several      functions of the procurators to the courts, for example,      authorization of detention and supervision of the police.       Allow lawyers--particularly criminal defense lawyers--to be      more effective in representing the rights and interest of      their clients including through involvement at the earliest      stages of police custody and pre-trial detention.       Abolish Section 306 of the Criminal Law, according to which      any lawyer who counsels a client to repudiate a forced      confession, for example, could risk prosecution.       Take measures to enhance the professionalism, efficiency,      transparency, and fairness of legal proceedings; and raise      the status and independence of judges and courts within the      Chinese legal system.       Reduce the number of pre-trial detainees by enlarging the      use of noncustodial measures such as bail.
