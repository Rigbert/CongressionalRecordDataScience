 I have one last question, and I would like to place a statement in the Record. One of the refineries is located right in my area and, of course, that is Tosco in the San Francisco Bay area. Among the parties that I discussed this with, Tosco was one of them. It is clear that they had some reservations about the legislation. I did discuss this with the Senator from Alaska, and I know he mentioned this earlier on the floor. I would like him, if he would, to repeat it. It is my understanding that Tosco has been assured reasonable supplies of oil even with this agreement in place. I would very much welcome the Senator's response to this in the affirmative or negative, whichever it may be.
