I want to thank Mr. Garrett for his eloquence, but also for his faithfulness in defending the powerless and the people who need voices, unborn children and their mothers, all those who are similarly situated, the vulnerable and the weak. He is always there, and I want to thank you so much, Scott.  I'd like to now yield to the chairman of the Health Subcommittee for the Energy and Commerce Committee for the House of Representatives, Joe Pitts, and note that Congressman Pitts, Chairman Pitts, is the author of the Abortion Control Act of 1980, the legislation that established, within the framework of Roe v. Wade, a very aggressive attempt to protect, to the maximum extent possible, pursuant to that onerous decision by the Supreme Court, and it was upheld by the Supreme Court, to do investigations of clinics and to just hold to a higher standard so that, to the greatest extent possible, life would be protected.  Congressman Pitts has been leading the charge on life for his entire career, both in the State legislature and in the U.S. House of Representatives, so it is a distinct honor to yield to my good friend.
