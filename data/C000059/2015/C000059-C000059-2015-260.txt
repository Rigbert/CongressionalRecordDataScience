Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have committed community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Jim Pauly is one of these outstanding individuals. On Thursday, January 15, 2015, Jim Pauly will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Corona Chamber of Commerce Installation Dinner.  In the history of Corona, California, few individuals can match the years of devoted service Jim has given to his hometown. After attending local schools throughout his childhood, Jim enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II at seventeen years old as a senior at Corona High School. Following his service in the Armed Forces, Jim returned to attend Chaffey College. In 1947, Jim began working full time at Emerson's Men Clothes. Due to his strong work ethic and commitment to the business, Jim became a partner, changing the name to Emerson-Pauly Menswear. After thriving for over fifty years in Corona retail, Jim retired and closed the storefront in 1993.  Jim's commitment to the business community is only matched by his devotion to service and leadership. Jim regularly contributes to the community through work on the Charity Solicitation Committee as Vice Chairman of the Downtown Corona Redevelopment Project and as the Chairman of the Corona Parking Authority. Additionally, Jim is involved in several local organizations, frequently offering his guidance. Jim was a member of the 20-30 Club and acted as the president in 1959. As a fifty eight year member of Elks Lodge, Jim served as Lodge Leader in 1959. Jim also holds fifty-five years of membership with the Rotary Club and served as the organization's president in 1965. Finally, in 1966, Jim was appointed to the Corona-Norco Unified School District Board of Trustees. Due to his exceptional work, he was elected twice more to continue to build a strong foundation for the Corona-Norco Unified School District.  In light of all Jim has done for the community of Corona, it is clear he fully deserves the Corona Chamber of Commerce's Lifetime Achievement award. Jim's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations, and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
