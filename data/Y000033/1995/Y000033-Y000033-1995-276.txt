May I suggest, I see my good friend from California and I listened to my good friend from Wisconsin, and it has nothing to do with the militia or any other thing. What I am suggesting respectfully, have not seen the justification for this amount of new vehicles. Remember, this is what we call roaded areas. They may be needed. But we have not so far found out if that need is true.  Second, the aircraft, may I stress, is nothing new. Right now they have a humongous fleet of aircraft operating all across the United States at the taxpayers' cost, and very frankly cannot justify them. I have been fighting this issue for the last 15 years, as I was in the minority. And I will tell you right up front that they cannot come to this House or this committee or any other committee and say that they can truly justify the cost to the taxpayer for this fleet of aircraft. That is all I am saying.  They want two new airplanes. That is wrong. This has nothing to do with the militia or anything else. I am saying if you look at the moneys being spent, this is incorrect. You can say what you want to say.
