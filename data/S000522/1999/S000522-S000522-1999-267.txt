Mr. Speaker, in the name of combating terrorism, Russia has again launched a war against Chechnya. It is employing indiscriminate use of force against civilians, and another humanitarian tragedy is unfolding.  In August and September of this year, Islamic extremists based in Chechnya--independent of the government of Chechnya--twice staged armed incursions into the neighboring Russian Federation Republic of Dagestan. In response, the Russian Government has sent its army to reoccupy Chechnya, a region that had won de facto independence from the rest of Russia as a result of a bloody war from 1994-96 invaded.  Now the United States Government recognizes, as a standard of international law, the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, and Moscow has the legal right to bring to justice those responsible for committing crimes in the incursion into Dagestan. One should also sympathize with the victims of the recent unsolved bombings that killed almost 300 persons in Russia. But neither this terrorism nor the incursions into Dagestan, as reprehensible as they were, justify the use of indiscriminate force against the civilian population of Chechnya and causing the carnage that we are seeing now.  Last week, Russian rockets struck the Chechnen capital of Grozny, hitting a marketplace and killing scores of civilians. This was preceded by air raids and artillery shelling of non-combatant villages, homes and farms in the northern part of Chechnya. The Russian Federation Migration Service states that more than 170,000 internally displaced persons have fled Chechnya, mostly to the neighboring region of Ingushetia.  Mr. Speaker, I, along with Mr. Wolf and Mr. Forbes, am introducing today a concurrent resolution calling upon the Government of the Russian Federation to cease unprovoked military attacks on the civilian population of Chechnya and to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict, using the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which helped broker an agreement to end the 1994-96 war. The United States Government should take a stronger stand in support of these goals, as the European Union has done.  Not that the government of Chechnya has been entirely blameless. Since achieving de facto independence from Russia in 1996, Chechnya has degenerated into a morass of lawlessness and violence, with a government powerless to establish law and order. The economy, which was devastated by the war, has been sustained heavily by criminal activity. Moreover, rampant kidnapings of Russians and foreigners for ransom have caused Chechnya to lose much sympathy and support in Russia and the West.  Russia is entirely justified in using appropriate methods to combat terrorism, but not in launching a war against innocent civilians. Russia is a participating State of the OSCE, and has agreed to certain standards regarding the protection of civilians when addressing internal security matters. Yes, Chechnya is recognized by the international community as a part of Russia, but this is not merely an ``internal matter.'' The 1991 Moscow Document of the OSCE clearly states that commitments undertaken in the field of the human dimension of the OSCE are matters of direct and legitimate concern to all participating States and do not belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State concerned.  Moreover, Moscow's current policy is likely to lengthen and widen the conflict, perhaps into Russia and beyond, and it may well jeopardize democracy in Russia if Russian leaders attempt to use ``emergency'' measures as part of its war policy.  Our resolution also calls upon the Chechen government to make every appropriate effort to deny bases or other support to radical elements committed to violent actions in the North Caucasus. Furthermore, the resolution urges our own government to emphasize to all parties the necessity of resolving the conflict peacefully, under OSCE auspices, and to express the willingness to extend appropriate assistance toward such resolution, including humanitarian assistance, as needed.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to emphasize that this resolution is not ``anti-Russian'' or ``pro-Chechen.'' Many observers who wish to see a prosperous and democratic Russia have been deeply disturbed by the present campaign in Chechnya. The chairperson of the Moscow Helsinki Group, Ludmila Alexeyeva, has stated that: ``Under the pretext of fighting terrorism, a real war is being waged against Chechnya, with tragic consequences for the civilian population. In several cities in Russia, under the same pretext, the authorities are conducting a genuine campaign of ethnic cleansing. These events are no less dangerous for European security than the Kosova crisis caused by the Milosevic regime last spring. In and around Chechnya we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe which is alarming, insofar as the international community is paying very little attention.''  In a recent statement, Deputy Secretary of State Talbott called upon Russia to use restraint, ``taking action against real terrorists, but not using indiscriminate force that endangers innocents, or resuming the disastrous 1994-96 war in Chechnya.'' President Clinton should back these good words with stronger steps. If Russia does not act with restraint and pursue dialogue, then Chechnya should become the main issue at the OSCE Summit in Istanbul on November 18 and 19.  I hope that the Congress would go on record as supporting these calls, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution.                          ____________________
