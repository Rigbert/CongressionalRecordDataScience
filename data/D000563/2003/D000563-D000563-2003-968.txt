I have only been in the Senate 6 years. She has been here slightly longer. Isn't it curious some of the worst environmental provisions are included in the appropriations bill at the last minute without any hearing, without any review? One would think that the people who were supporting this--the timber industry and those who support these provisions--would not be so afraid of their positions that they have to put them in a stealthy situation where, frankly, it is a ``take it or leave it'' bill, a ``take it or leave it'' 2,000-page bill that includes this rider.  If I understand what the Senator has said, this provision, so-called stewardship contract, could open more than 70 million acres of national forest currently owned by the taxpayers of America to logging by private companies, and that until this time, we only allowed them to test this in 28 different projects, and only 10 of those projects have actually been activated and tested. So it is an untested theory which the logging industry, the timber industry has now tried to capitalize on with this anti-environment rider to open up more than 70 million acres to logging; is that the situation?
