Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  I am hopeful that we can agree on the underlying issue which led to the necessity for a CR and the temporary closing of government. That is the underlying agreement on what budget numbers will be, what our caps will be, how much discretionary funding we will have to spend both on defense and nondefense. That is at the core. When you fail to do that, you fail to pass appropriation bills, and you, therefore, have to repair to CRs, which everybody on this floor agrees is bad fiscal policy and should not be the way we do business.  Secondly, I appreciate the majority leader's leadership and engagement on the issue of solving the problem, or the challenge and the opportunity, I should say--not so much a problem, but an opportunity--of DREAMers. It is what the President, Mr. Speaker, asked us to do. Hopefully, we can, in fact, working in good faith with one another, get that done.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
