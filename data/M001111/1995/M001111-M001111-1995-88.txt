 President, the Senate voted to approve welfare reform legislation by a vote of 87-12 this afternoon. I have spent weeks thinking about my vote on this issue, and today, after listening to people on all sides of this issue, including my family and my colleagues, I reluctantly cast my vote in favor of the Dole bill, as amended. In my brief tenure here in the U.S. Senate, this was one of the most difficult votes I have cast. Mr. President, I would like to explain why.  From the beginning of the welfare reform debate, my No. 1 concern has been about finding a way to rebuild American families. I have always believed we can only do that by emphasizing real personal responsibility, providing adequate child care for both working poor and welfare families, and ensuring our children can count on help from adults.  It has been my hope that we could achieve some positive changes to the current system. If there is one thing everyone can agree on, it's that the current system is flawed. It needs fixing, and I vowed to support reform. My challenge has been to influence that reform in the most constructive direction possible.  As someone who came to the Senate during the 1992 election year, I know we cannot continue to do things the way we always have. We must take a hard look at the sum total of our Government programs, and rework them to accurately reflect society's strengths, weaknesses, and needs.  We entered the debate with two bills, the Dole version and the Daschle Work-First bill. I cosponsored and voted in favor of the Daschle bill. I supported it because I felt it was the right place to start. It reflected a genuine commitment to helping poor families move up and into the work force.  Unfortunately from my perspective, a majority in the Senate rejected the Daschle bill. But I didn't give up there. I and others began devoting our energies to improving the Dole bill.  First, we offered an amendment to require full funding, and full protection for child care and children's programs. It would have provided the full $11 billion estimated by the Department of Health and Human Services to be necessary to meet child-care needs. Again, this amendment was narrowly defeated, 50-48.  Given the closeness of this vote, Senators Dole and Daschle were able to reach a compromise that strengthened the Dole bill, but fell short of our original amendment. It includes provisions which: require States to maintain their welfare spending at a minimum of 80 percent of current levels; strike the job training title--which had no business in a welfare bill to begin with, establish a contingency grant fund to take care of States in times of economic downturns, and provide a total of $8 billion for childcare services nationwide. I support this compromise, though I feel ultimately we will have to do more.  Following the child-care debate, I cosponsored an amendment to establish greater protection for victims of domestic violence. I believe domestic violence to be the single, most destructive force against families in America today. No one, not the Senate, the President, or anyone else, can place a value on the price paid by mothers and their children attempting to survive an abusive household. This time the Senate agreed, and my amendment was adopted unanimously.  Having worked hard to improve the Dole bill, I found myself faced with a very difficult decision. I could either vote against the Dole bill based on its shortcomings for children, or I could vote to affirm the improvements we made to it.  I believe the Dole bill to be deeply flawed. I believe it draws into question the welfare of poor children throughout the Nation. But I also believe we have to start somewhere. The current system needs to be changed, and the Dole bill changes it fundamentally. Therefore, I voted yes.  Mr. President, change of any kind always involves risk. We will never know how great that risk is until we try something different. What we do know, however, is that change brings new responsibility.  We do not know whether this bill will make it into law. If it is enacted, we don't know if it will work. It may prove a fabulous success, or it may only prove to make problems worse for the poor.  But today, we have created a grave new responsibility for this Senate: to be watchdogs for our children. More than ever before, all Senators have an obligation to make the law work in favor of poor children, All Senators have a responsibility in the future to consider the successes and failures they have created this day, and to be prepared to make changes later if things don't work out.  The most unfortunate part of this debate, in my opinion, is that people don't think of children when they think of welfare. People think of dependency, complacency, poverty, and all the worst stereotypes. This troubles me because it is children who face the most difficult struggles. It is children who are most deserving of our care.  The outcome of this debate does not change one iota this basic fact: we need a national commitment to children in this country. I believe this to the very core of my being.  Children are under assault every single day in this country. In their homes, in school, on the streets, and yes, in this Congress. We see it in cuts to education and dismantling of crime prevention. We see it in Medicaid cuts, defunding of AmeriCorps, and elimination of student loans.  Today, I voted for change, to try something new. But I also took responsibility to live with that change, ad to work even harder promoting a broad, national commitment to our children. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to accept that responsibility with equal sobriety, and with equal vigor.  The outcome today was not in doubt. Nor is this the end of the debate. There will be a conference committee. We may even debate a conference report. More likely, we will see this bill again in the budget reconciliation yet to come.  I think we can change welfare for the better, and move more people into the work force. I look forward to working with you, Mr. President and all my colleagues, to this end; but also to build a stronger commitment to children. We must do this in welfare reform, and across the whole spectrum of issues we consider this session. The future is simply too important. And unlike before, it is our new responsibility.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                          ____________________
