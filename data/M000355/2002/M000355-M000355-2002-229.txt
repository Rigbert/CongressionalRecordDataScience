 President, I reiterate that it is our intention to finish the bill today, and I believe we are on a glidepath to do that. I fully support the effort of the chairman to move this along.                           Amendment No. 2927  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send and amendment on behalf of Senators Gramm and Hutchison to the desk. It has been cleared on both sides.
