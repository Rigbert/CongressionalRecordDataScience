 It is clear to me at least that we need to work together toward sensible, all-of-the-above energy policy. The good news is that the Republican-run House is set to present us with another perfect opportunity to work across the aisle and do just that this very week. The House plans to pass and send over a bipartisan legislative package that would create jobs while helping to make energy more affordable and more abundant.  Among other things, this energy package would finally approve the Keystone Pipeline. This is a project that is safe, shovel-ready, and could create tens of thousands of jobs right away. It is just unacceptable that the administration has now spent 6 years--6 years--dragging its feet on the Keystone Pipeline. I commend my colleague from North Dakota Senator Hoeven for bringing attention to that fact and for his strong vocal leadership on this issue. While some on the other side of the aisle claim to be supportive of Keystone jobs, they have failed to stand up to the majority leader who has blocked this effort time and time and time again on behalf of the Obama administration. We need to approve the House legislative package and finally get this pipeline built and these Keystone jobs created.  But the House's energy package would do a lot more than just that. It would also modernize the permitting process, allow for more energy exploration, increase exports of American energy, and it would help us fight back against the Obama administration's war on Kentucky coal jobs in several different ways.  One bill would prevent the administration from developing more job-killing coal regulations and another from Representative Whitfield would push back on the coal regulations that have already been issued.  This package is common sense. I applaud our colleagues in the House for their efforts on this issue. It presents a perfect opportunity for our Democratic friends, if they are willing to support it, to prove they are serious about real solutions for middle-class families--that they have a real agenda beyond just designed-to-fail bills.                          ____________________
