President, today, we are again voting to overcome a Republican filibuster of a highly qualified nominee for a judicial emergency vacancy on the busiest circuit court in the country. For what is already the third time this year, the majority leader has had to file cloture on one of President Obama's circuit court nominees in order to move the nomination forward. In stark contrast, the Senate confirmed 18 of President Bush's circuit nominees within a week of being reported by the Judiciary Committee.  Michelle Friedland, nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is an exceptionally talented attorney, and has an exemplary record of service in the top echelons of the legal profession. She clerked on the United States Supreme Court for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor from 2001 to 2002 and on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for Judge David Tatel from 2000 to 2001. Ms. Friedland earned her B.S. with honors and distinction from Stanford University in 1995. She studied at Oxford University from 1995 to 1996 as a Fulbright Scholar and went on to earn her J.D. with distinction from Stanford Law School in 2000.  For over a decade, Ms. Friedland has worked in private practice at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP, where she was named partner in 2010. She has taught as an adjunct professor at the University of Virginia School Law and as a Lecturer in Law at the Stanford Law School. Ms. Friedland has experience in both the trial court and appellate levels, including the United States Supreme Court. She manages an active pro bono practice and frequently represents the University of California in constitutional litigation. She received the President's Pro Bono Service Award in 2013 from the State Bar of California, and the LGBT Award from the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California in 2009. The American Bar Association unanimously awarded her their highest rating of ``well qualified.''  It comes as no surprise to me that Michelle Friedland's nomination has received significant support. Kathryn Haun, Assistant United States Attorney and Former Counsel to then-Attorney General Michael Mukasey, wrote to the Committee to express her support, saying ``Michelle and I fall at opposite ends of the political spectrum . . . Notwithstanding our political differences, I believe she would make an outstanding federal appellate judge . . . Michelle has a deep respect for legal precedent above seeking a particular result in a given case. She has a balance and a willingness to listen to all arguments before formulating a position on a particular issue. She displays, above all else, intellectual honesty and personal modesty that suit her exceptionally well for a federal appellate judgeship.''  Eugene Volokh, Professor of Law, at the UCLA School of Law, expressed his strong support for Ms. Friedland to the Committee, writing ``Michelle is a brilliant and extremely accomplished lawyer, who will make a superb judge. . . [She] has impressed not just those on her side of the political aisle, but conservatives as . . . well.''  General Counsel from multiple fortune 500 companies including Google, Cisco, and Facebook echo their support of Michelle Friedland, noting that ``Her career has been marked by energy, integrity, and legal excellence. She has represented a broad spectrum of clients in both the private and public sectors . . . The careful, unbiased approach she would bring to the types of issues that arise before the Ninth Circuit are critical to our nation's values and to its economic health.''  In their letter of support, 22 former Supreme Court Law Clerks to Justice O'Connor write, ``We have differing political views and differing careers, but we can all agree that Michelle would be an excellent federal appellate judge. We have . . . enjoyed her warm collegiality, her honesty and fairness, and her dedication to law above ideology. Michelle would be a tremendous addition to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and we urge you to confirm her nomination.''  I ask unanimous consent that a list of letters of support be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  If confirmed, Michelle Friedland would increase the gender diversity on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. She would be the seventeenth female judge to ever sit on the Circuit. In comparison, 83 men have been appointed to the Ninth Circuit over the course of its history. Her confirmation would bring the percentage of active female judges sitting on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to nearly 38 percent. Her confirmation would also mark the first time, since the 29th judgeship was added in 2007, that it has had a full complement of active judges despite having the highest number of appeals filed, the highest pending appeals per panel and the highest pending appeals per active judge of any Circuit in the country.  Yet here we are, again voting to overcome a Republican filibuster of an exceptionally talented nominee to a court that desperately needs to be operating at full strength.
