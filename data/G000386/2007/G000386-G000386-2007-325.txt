 President, I ask the Chair to please inform me when I have used 11 minutes.  Mr. President, we have a situation here where the latest argument has been that when we wrote the bill 4 years ago, providing pharmaceuticals for seniors under Medicare, we went one step too far by saying the Secretary of Health and Human Services should not interfere in plans negotiating drug prices.  Well, I want everybody to understand that we took this language from several different Democratic bills which had been introduced because I wanted this program to be as bipartisan as we could make it. So we had Senator Moynihan introducing President Clinton's bill in 1999 which had that language in it. We had a Daschle-Reid bill in the year 2001 which included that language. We had a House bill in 2001 whichincluded that language. We had aGephardt-Pelosi-Rangel-Stark-Dingell-Stabenow bill--Senator Stabenow now--which had this language in it.  So I want people to know that as to this language which they now think should not be in this legislation--the bipartisan approach--we took this language because we thought this would be one step further toward making this whole program bipartisan because we do not have enough bipartisanship in the Congress now. All of a sudden, everybody who thought this language was perfect language thinks this language--from Democratic pieces of legislation--ought to be struck out of this bipartisan bill. Obviously, as I said yesterday, and I say today, we have plans that are working. And if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Mr. President, I have always been fond of jigsaw puzzles--spinning the pieces around, figuring out how the pieces of a puzzle all fit together, until you finally see the whole picture. This debate is a lot like working a jigsaw puzzle. I would like to have you take a look at a few of the pieces.  One piece is the House bill, H. 4, passed by the House.
