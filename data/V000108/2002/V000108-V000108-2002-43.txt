Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Barbara Holder Consulting Services will be hosting a Salute to Women of Lake County, on Friday, May 3, 2002, at the Horseshoe Casino, Lakeview Room in Hammond, Indiana. Ten outstanding women from Northwest Indiana will be honored at this notable event for their dedication and hard work. A portion of the proceeds from this event will benefit the Minority Organ Tissue and Transplant Education Program (M.O.T.T.E.P.) and Project Research, a teen pregnancy prevention education program for teens ages 12-17.  Mrs. Holder, owner of Barbara Holder Consulting Services, a woman-owned business with offices in Gary and Chicago, specializes in creating community outreach programs, as well as monitoring and evaluating compliance with federal, state, and local EEO/Affirmative Action laws. She had the vision a year ago to honor the many faceless and nameless women who work tirelessly everyday but are never recognized publicly for the contributions they make in their respective fields. With the assistance of the planning committee members representing several academic, private, public, and social entities, this first annual and well-deserved salute to the women of Lake County became a reality.  This awards banquet will pay tribute to women that have excelled in the fields of art, business, education, government/law, law enforcement, health, industrial/union labor, not-for-profit leadership, religion, and volunteerism. This year's honorees include: Morning Aaronda Bishop, Sarah Givens, Captain Gloria Mitchell, Dorine Godinez, Sister Anita Holzmer, Nancy Nethery, Nancy Moore-Tiller, Dr. Danita Johnson-Hughes, Denise Dillard, and Dee Kegebein.
