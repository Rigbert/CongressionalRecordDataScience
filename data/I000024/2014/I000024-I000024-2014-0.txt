President, I will be very brief because I know we have some other things coming up before going on to the NDAA, and I will be standing here with my good friend and brother Carl at that time. I recall when I was first elected to the House of Representatives--it is hard for me to believe that was 28 years ago--and I became good friends with a guy named Levin. It was not Carl. It was his brother.
