 We are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to legislate like the Senate has long been accustomed to legislating. We are actually going to offer amendments. They are going to be related to the bill, and we are going to get started. The majority leader and I and Senator Dodd and Shelby all agree on how we ought to go forward. I hope Members on both sides who have amendments that are related to the subject matter will get them out early. Let's process them. Let's have the votes, and let's let the Senate work its will.  We also have the other items the majority leader has indicated we need to address before the recess. We will workdiligently to get passage on all those matters. There will be a lot of cooperation on this side of the aisle, and I am confident there will be on the other side of the aisle so we can have a productive workweek before the Fourth of July break.
