I thank my good friend for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage Chairman Goss in a brief colloquy on the matter of border security. The State Department has the legal responsibility to issue visas at our U.S. embassies and consulates. Over the years, we have vastly improved the process by which visas are issued. Name check systems are now computerized, allowing the consular officer at a post to have a reliable method of vetting a person's entry into the United States.  This system of name checking is only as good, however, as the information that is entered into the system. I would like to ask the chairman that in the course of the intelligence bill conference, that he work to ensure that the best cooperation is received from relevant agencies to be sure that current information is provided on a timely basis to the State Department for purposes of securing a better name check system. I would note that all 18 of the suicide hijackers were granted visas. Something is wrong and we need to fix it.
