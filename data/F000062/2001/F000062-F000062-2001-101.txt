 That is the continuing funding for the acquisition of San Francisco baylands adjacent to the Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge.  Since the early 1900s, more than 90 percent of California's interior wetlands have been lost to development and other land use changes. The property for purchase constitutes more than 13,000 acres of salt ponds at the edge of San Francisco Bay, which itself provides important habitat for more than 1 million birds per year. This purchase will increase the bay's wetland area by 50 percent.
