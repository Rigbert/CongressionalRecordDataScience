President, I rise today to speak principally on behalf of four important pieces of legislation. Two have important implications for national security, a third would help keep war criminals and those who commit atrocities abroad out of our country and the fourth would add a degree of fairness for law enforcement victims of September 11. All have been cleared on the Democratic side of the aisle.  Three are being blocked by holds placed by anonymous Republican Senators. One has passed the Senate and is being held up by the Republican leadership in the House. I appeal, again, today to our Republican colleagues to stop holding these important bills hostage, remove your secret hold, or at least come forward and identify yourself and your concern so that we may debate and make bipartisan progress on these important legislative matters.  First is S. 1974, the FBI Reform Act, which I introduced with SenatorGrassley in February, after extensive oversight hearings.  This bill would strengthen the FBI in its fight against terrorism, and was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee in April of this year.  Since the attacks of September 11, and the anthrax attacks last fall, we have relied on the FBI to detect and prevent acts of catastrophic terrorism that endanger the lives of the American people and the institutions of our country. FBI reform was already important, but the terrorist attacks suffered by this country last year have imposed even greater urgency on improving the FBI. The Bureau is our front line of domestic defense against terrorists.  Even before those attacks, the Judiciary Committee's oversight hearings revealed serious problems at the FBI that needed strong congressional action to fix. We heard about a double standard in evaluations and discipline. We heard about record and information management problems and communications breakdowns between field offices and Headquarters that led to the belated production of documents in the Oklahoma City bombing case. Despite the fact that we have poured money into the FBI over the last 5 years, we heard that the FBI's computer systems were in dire need of modernization.  We heard about how an FBI supervisor, Robert Hanssen, was able to sell critical secrets to the Russians undetected for years without ever getting a polygraph. We heard that there were no fewer than 15 different areas of security at the FBI that needed fixing.  The FBI Reform Act tackles these problems with improved accountability, improved security both inside and outside the FBI and required planning to ensure the FBI is prepared to deal with the multitude of challenges we are facing.  Just over the past month, the FBI Director has referred to the Justice Department inspector general important matters about the handling of probative information like the Phoenix report before the 9-11 attacks. The FBI reform bill expands the Justice Department inspector general's authority to investigate all allegations of misconduct at the FBI. The FBI Reform Act also strengthens whistleblower protections for FBI employees who report misconduct to Members of Congress, as Minneapolis Field Office Agent Coleen M. Rowley did.  The FBI Reform Act also puts an end to statutory restrictions that contribute to the ``double standard,'' where senior management officials are not disciplined as harshly for misconduct as line agents are. Agent Rowley complained about this double standard in her May 21 letter criticizing Bureau Headquarters about its handling of the Moussaoui case.  Just this week the Judiciary Committee held an extensive hearing with the FBI Director, the Department of Justice inspector general and Special Agent Rowley. Any doubts that this legislation is needed and needed without further delay had to be erased by their candid testimony.  The FBI Reform Act was unanimously reported by the oversight committee for the FBI and reflects our determination to make sure that the FBI is as good and strong as it can be, and, all the more today, given the higher stakes, as good and as strong as America needs the FBI to be. This reform bill is a long stride toward that goal. I urge the Republican Members who have blocked passage of this bill to come forward and identify themselves, to speak to Senator Grassley and me about the importance of this legislation, and to share any concerns they may have so that we may proceed without further delay.  Last December I introduced S. 1770 to implement two antiterrorism treaties, the Terrorist Bombing Convention and the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Convention. The antiterrorist bombing bill would bring the United States into immediate compliance with important international conventions signed by the United States under President Clinton's leadership.  The two antiterrorism treaties at issue were transmitted to the Senate for ratification by President Clinton in 1999 and 2000, but not acted upon until the Senate reorganized under a Democratic majority last summer.  The United States signed these treaties after the tragic terrorist bombings at the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Before control of the Senate changed hands, there was no action taken on these treaties in the Foreign Relations Committee. The antibombing treaty in particular sat in the Foreign Relations Committee for approximately 2 years without action during the Clinton administration when the Senate was under Republican control. Senator Biden deserves credit for acting quickly to report these treaties within weeks after he assumed chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee.  Yet even as Senator Biden was pushing to move the treaties themselves through the Senate, the Bush administration did not transmit proposed implementing legislation to the Judiciary Committee before or during the time that we were working together day and night to write the USA Patriot Act, the bipartisan antiterrorism legislation responding to the events of September 11. I remain puzzled why the administration felt that this measure should be separated from that effort.  Both treaties require the signatory nations to enact certain, precisely worded criminal provisions in their laws in order to be in compliance. That is what S.1770, the Leahy bill, does. I introduced S.1770, on December 5, 2001, shortly after passage of the USA Patriot Act, as a separate bill. This was the same day that the Senate agreed to ratify both treaties. I then tried to move the bill quickly through the Senate, but an anonymous Republican hold blocked passage.  Again this year I tried to move the bill through the Senate, but again there was an anonymous hold from the Republican side of the aisle which blocked its passage. Had there not been a hold placed on the bill last year, I am quite sure that we could have resolved any remaining issues in conference, as the Republican-controlled House was simultaneously passing its own version of my bill.  After the anonymous hold was placed on S. 1770 at the end of the last session, we received a letter from the Department of Justice in late January of this year about the bill.  The letter stated that the Department ``support[ed] the legislation but recommend[ed] several modifications.'' None of the modifications which the Department recommended dealt with issues that were necessary for compliance with the treaties, the basic purpose of the bill. The Leahy bill would bring us into full compliance with those important obligations and take away an excuse from nations that are hesitant to cooperate in the war against terrorism.  The recent spate of horrible suicide bombings around the world and the fact that the convention prohibiting terrorist financing entered into force on April 10, 2002, demonstrate the pressing need for this legislation. As if that was not enough, last month the FBI Director warned that he believes that suicide bombings in the United States are ``inevitable,'' bringing home the point that this legislation is required both to fight terrorism at home and abroad. Nevertheless, S. 1770 has been subjected to an anonymous Republican hold since December of last year.  In the post-September 11 environment it is almost beyond my understanding why any Member of this body would secretly obstruct passage of an important piece of antiterrorism legislation--yet here we are in June, blocked from compliance with two international terrorism treaties by a secret Republican hold.  The third bill is S. 864, the Anti-Atrocity Alien Deportation Act, which I introduced year and was reported by the Judiciary Committee, with bipartisan support, to close loopholes in our immigration laws that have allowed war criminals and human rights abusers to enter and remain in this country.  I have been appalled that this country has become a safe haven for those who exercised power in foreign countries to terrorize, rape, murder, and torture innocent civilians. A recent report by Amnesty International claims that nearly 150 alleged human rights abusers have been identified living here, but warns that this number may be as high as 1,000.  Observers have noted the irony that in the wake of the September 11, 2001,attacks, hundreds of foreigners have been rounded up though not charged with any terrorism-related crime.  Yet at the same time, ``hundreds, if not thousands, of foreign nationals who have been plausibly accused of the most heinous human rights crimes, including torture and assassination, either have lived or still live freely in the U.S.'' [William Schulz, ``The Torturers Among Us,'' New York Review, p. 22, April 25, 2002.]  This bill would not only add the new grounds, but also expand current grounds, for inadmissibility and deportation, by barring those aliens who have engaged, outside the United States, in ``torture'' and ``extrajudicial killing'' and removing artificial limitations on the current grounds for exclusion for aliens who commit ``genocide'' and ``particularly severe violations of religious freedom.'' This bill is important for the victims of these heinous crimes who seek refuge in this country and important for Americans to show that we will not tolerate perpetrators of genocide, extrajudicial killing and torture, living among us.  I urge the Republican Members who have blocked passage of this bill to come forward and identify themselves, to share any concerns they may have so that we may proceed without further delay.  I was pleased when the Senate did take up and pass the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002 that I sponsored with Senators Campbell, Schumer, Clinton, and Biden.  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with the New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, this legislation recognizes the invaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by allowing for their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program. Father Judge, while deemed eligible for public safety officer benefits, was survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are ineligible to receive payments through the PSOB Program. This is simply wrong and must be remedied.  Indeed, Father Judge is among 10 public safety officers who were killed on September 11, but who are ineligible for Federal death benefits because they died without spouses, children, or parents. This bill would retroactively correct this injustice by expanding the list of those who may receive public safety officer benefits to the beneficiaries named on the most recently executed life insurance policy of the deceased officer. This change would go into effect on September 11 of last year to make sure the families of Father Judge and the nine other fallen heroes receive their public safety officer benefits.  In addition, this bill would retroactively restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to specifically include chaplains as members of the law enforcement and fire units they serve, and would make these chaplains eligible for the one-time $250,000 benefit available to public safety officers who have been permanently disabled as a result of injuries sustained in the line of duty, or to the survivors of officers who have died.  This measure is strongly supported by the National Association of Police Organization, the Fraternal Order of Police, and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  Despite its Senate's passage and in spite of the fact that the House Judiciary Committee has favorably reported the House companion bill with bipartisan support to the House, the House Republican leadership has refused to follow through with passage of these measure. I urge the House Republican leadership to reconsider its decision and allow this important matter to proceed to final passage.  These bills are not alone in being blocked by anonymous Republican holds. Holds have been placed on other important bills that the Judiciary Committee has acted upon and reported favorably to the Senate. Let me just cite a couple examples: S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act, which I introduced after the Enron debacle to restore confidence in our securities; S. 2179, the Law Enforcement Tribute Act, which was introduced by Senator Carnahan to help State and local police pay for memorials to honor fallen officers; and S. 407, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, to help American businesses better protect their intellectual property in the international marketplace.  In addition to the Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers Benefit Act, many other Senate-passed are languishing in the House of Representatives. These include the Federal Judiciary Protection Act, S. 1099, which I cosponsored with Senator Gordon Smith; the James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act, S. 166, which was sponsored by Senator Feinstein; and the TEACH Act, S. 487, which I sponsored with Senator Hatch. These bipartisan measures were passed by unanimous consent through the Senate last year, but have been held hostage without action in the House for too many months.  None of these 10 matters should be partisan, yet again and again, anonymous Republican holds have stopped Senate and congressional action. I appeal to my Republican colleagues in the Senate to lift their secret holds and to the Republicans in both Houses to stop obstructing these bipartisan bills, that are intended to protect our national security, our public safety, America's borders, and American businesses.                          ____________________
