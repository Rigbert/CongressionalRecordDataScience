Mr. Speaker, I do not propose cutting off relations with China, but I simply cannot accept the situation as it is with China today. We cannot stand by while innocent people in China and Tibet are fighting and dying for democracy. Thousands of innocent Christians, Muslims, and Buddhists are dying in Chinese gulags. Millions of Chinese women are not allowed to plan their own families. They are not allowed to make the most basic, the most private decisions. The Chinese Government intrudes on families, their beliefs, their lives. They are desperate for our help. Yet we do not help. We continue business as usual. The abuse of human rights continues. And the United States renews MFN. China will not work with the community of nations to stop nuclear proliferation. And the United States renews MFN. Business as usual. Trade as usual.  We cannot accept and we must not accept what is happening in China. To quote Gandhi, ``Noncooperation with evil is as much a duty as is cooperation with good.'' We can never forget Tiananmen Square. Those students bravely stood for democracy, and they were slaughtered. I was a student once, fighting for what I believed, I was fighting for a nation free of racism, free of segregation. During the 1960's, some among us were jailed and beaten during that struggle. Some even died. Schwerner. Goodman. Chaney. Three young men gave their lives so that others could register and vote, so that others could participate in the democratic process. They did not die in vain.  Now it is the 1990s and China is on the other side of the world from us but their struggle is just as important. Their lives and their struggle must not be in vain. In a real sense, Mr. Speaker, our foreign policy, our trade policy must be a reflection of our own ideals, our own shared values.  What does it profit a great nation, a compassionate and caring people, to close our eyes and look the other way? As Martin Luther King said, ``There comes a time when a Nation and a people must stand for something or we will fall for anything.'' I feel that the spirit of history is upon us. We must make a decision today and it should be on the right side of history. We must stand with the people who are struggling for freedom, struggling for democracy. If we fail to act, no one will act. They are our brothers and our sisters.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I believe in trade, free and fair trade, but I do not believe in trade at any price. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, how much are we prepared to pay? Are we prepared to sell our souls? Are we prepared to butcher our conscience? Are we prepared to deny our shared values of freedom, justice and democracy? Today I cast my lot with the people in the streets, with the students of Tiananmen Square, and with the people of this country who understand that a threat to justice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  I urge and I beg of my colleagues to oppose MFN for China. I thank the gentlewoman from California and the gentleman from New York for yielding me this time.                          ____________________
