 President, if the Republican leader will yield for a moment, reserving the right to object. I am confident the reason why the list is growing is because no one has seen the bill. It has not been printed in the Record. There have been several of us who have seen the bill. Our colleagues have not seen the bill. Their staffs have not seen the bill.  So I am absolutely confident that a significant portion of the amendments that are being added are being added in the blind. They just want to make sure that the bill does not do what it is rumored to do in the press.  I think this is one of those cases where we should not spend a whole lot more time trying to narrow it. If we can get a list now, great, do it, but I am confident that the Senator from Utah and I, over the period of the remainder of the day and during the recess, will be able to go a long way to narrowing down that list as our colleagues get a chance and their staffs get a chance to read this bill, which is not in the Record yet.  We always spend time weighing bills around here. This is a 150-page bill that no one has seen other than me, and I have not read it yet. I got it at 6 o'clock last night. I am not being critical of anyone, but that is just by way of explanation.  I do not think amendments being added are added for any other reason than to protect some issue Members are concerned about in this legislation.  I beg your pardon, it is in the Record. I stand corrected, it is in the Record as of last night. Based on the last vote, 15 to 20 people are gone. That is the only point I make. I am sure we can work that through.
