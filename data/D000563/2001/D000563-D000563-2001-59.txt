President, I join with several of my colleagues in opposing the nomination of John P. Walters to be Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy--the Nation's Drug Czar.  As much as anyone here, I am mindful of the need to unify behind the President during these times. Let me emphasize that I share the President's goals in combating the problem of drug abuse, and I applaud his commitment of greater resources to drug treatment and prevention efforts. My fear, however, is that Mr. Walters is not the person to meet these goals.  John Walters is a seasoned veteran of the Drug War, someone with a long and established track record on many controversial issues. Too often in the past, he has adopted divisive stances on these issues. His views, and his certitude in advocating them, send a fair warning to this body as it debates his nomination. His controversial and often incendiary writings on drug-related issues have been red meat for the right-wing of the Republican Party.  Let me focus on a couple topics. Like many of my colleagues, I am very troubled by the considerable evidence that our prosecution of the drug war disproportionally targets racial and ethnic minorities. African-Americans represent 12 percent of the U.S. population, 11 percent of current drug users, but 35 percent of those arrested for drug violations, 53 percent of those convicted in state courts, and 58 percent of those currently incarcerated in state prisons. In my home State of Illinois, African-American men end up in State prisons on drug charges at a rate 57 times greater than white men. These disparities, whatever their cause, demand the attention of the Nation's Drug Czar. Aside from the injustice of this situation, there is stark evidence that drug offenders who are not minorities escape the same scrutiny and enforcement as those who are. Our war on drugs must be fair and balanced.  With the exception of the last few weeks, Mr. Walters has spent most of his career being dismissive of the subject of racial disparities in drug enforcement. As recently as this April, he characterized as ``urban myth'' the sincere concern of many, including myself, that young black men receive excessive prison terms under the current sentencing regime. He has accused the nonpartisan federal Sentencing Commission of being ``irresponsible'' for proposing adjustments to the 100-1 disparity between federal prison terms for crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses, offenses which divide starkly along color lines.  It has become a cliche for public officials to lament racial profiling in law enforcement. What matters is action, not words. But even now, when Mr. Walters has experienced a ``change of heart'' on many issues, he will only concede that there is a ``perception'' of disparate treatment in the criminal justice system. As someone committed to using the Drug Czar's office to promote criminal law initiatives, he has exhibited little sensitivity for the role that race plays in the criminal justice system. Given the important law enforcement role filled by the Drug Czar, I cannot overlook this weakness.  Another source of real concern is the nominee's record on drug treatment and prevention. Early in my congressional career, I worked to pass legislation to improve substance abuse treatment programs for pregnant and postpartum women. We know that treatment programs can work. A study by the RAND Corporation a few years ago found that for every dollar that we invest in substance abuse treatment, the American taxpayers save $7.46 in miscellaneous societal costs.  The Nation's drug crisis demands that we supplement law enforcement efforts with effective treatment and prevention programs. While Mr. Walters has voiced his support for a balanced and coordinated approach, his long paper trail belies his real intentions. He has a long record of hostility towards, as he put it, the ``notoriously under-performing drug treatment system,'' and towards those who implement it. He has criticized those who approach drug addiction as a disease as ``ideologues.'' He has condemned the Drug-Free Schools Act, which created many of the same types of prevention programs he takes credit for now.  Let me say a few brief words about the John Walters who came to visit the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judging by his answers to the Committee's questions, he has been doing a lot of reflection lately. He now believes that ``the consideration of addiction as a disease has wide application.'' A man who once defended harsh mandatory minimum sentences today professes support for ``second and third chances'' and tempering justice with mercy. A harsh partisan critic of President Clinton now wishes to ``transcend traditional political and party boundaries.'' The same person who wrote ``[t]here is no question that supply fosters demand'' stands beside President Bush's pledge that ``[t]he most effective way to reduce the supply of drugs in America is to reduce the demand for drugs in America.''  Mr. Walters assured the Committee that he has not undergone what we refer to as a ``confirmation conversion.'' That is precisely what concerns me--that he has not moderated his views at all, but has merely rethought his public relations strategy. Over the course of his career, Mr. Walters has made a conscious choice to polarize rather than advance the public debate. Accordingly, I cannot provide my support for his nomination.                          ____________________
