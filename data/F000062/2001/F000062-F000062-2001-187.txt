 President, California is the largest dairy State in the Union.  Let me read a brief quote from the Dairy Coalition of Concerned Energy Consumers.       As the number one-ranking dairy producing state in the      nation, the California dairy industry uses substantial      quantities of natural gas to run its processing plants.      Between December 1999 and December 2000 the cost of gas to      dairy plants in California increased 4,000%. Our paramount      concern is the dramatic increase in the non-commodity portion      of the price of gas.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         California Dairy Coalition of Concerned Energy Consumers,                                Sacramento, CA, February 16, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the California Dairy      Coalition of Concerned Energy Consumers, I would like to      thank you for all of your activities to date directed to      resolving the energy crisis in California.       The Dairy Coalition was formed recently due to the supply      problems and dramatic price increases seen for both      electricity and natural gas in California in late 2000. The      Coalition represents all of the major dairy producer co-     operatives in California, as well as the major proprietary      processing companies.       As the number one-ranking dairy producing state in the      nation, the California dairy industry uses substantial      quantities of natural gas to run its processing plants.      Between December 1999 and December 2000 the cost of gas to      dairy plants in California increased 4,000%. Our paramount      concern is the dramatic increase in the non-commodity portion      of the price of gas.       Again, the Dairy Coalition greatly appreciates your      attention to this critical issue.           Sincerely,                                                    Jim Gomes,                                         Executive Vice President,                                          California Dairies, Inc.
