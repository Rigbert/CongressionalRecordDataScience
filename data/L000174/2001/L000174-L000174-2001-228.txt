I know of no Senator who has a stronger commitment to our individual rights and personal liberties than the senior Senator from South Dakota, our majority leader. But I also know that were it not for his commitment and efforts, we would not be here with a far better bill than the one originally proposed by the administration. It has been because of his willingness to back us up as we try to improve that bill, to remove unconstitutional aspects of it, because of his willingness, we were able to get here.  As the Senator from South Dakota, the dearest friend I have in this body, has said, he could find parts he would do differently, and he knows there are parts I would do differently--even on this one. I have high regard for theSenator from Wisconsin, and I would have loved to have had his amendment. Actually, I would have done it probably differently than that. But we had a whole lot of places where we won and some where we lost.  I can tell you right now, if we start unraveling this bill, we are going to lose all the parts we won and we will be back to a proposal that was blatantly unconstitutional in many parts. So I join, with no reluctance whatsoever, in the leader's motion.
