 What the administration said was, we have already funded, of the 100,000 cops, 43,000 to date. When the Republicans were telling us we would not get 20,000, remember Charlton Heston, ``Moses,'' was on TV saying this is only 20,000 cops from the entire 6 years of the program.  We have already funded--who being recruited, being hired and being trained--43,000 cops already. Already. And because of the Biden crime bill, there are 17,000 of these 43,000 cops on the streets as we speak, with the remaining 26,000 having been funded and in the process of being recruited, hired and trained.  Now, in terms of administrative costs, I challenge any of my Republican friends to pick up the phone and call any one of their local police agencies and ask them about the bureaucratic morass in cost. We insisted this get down to a one-page application. All the cops need do is send in a one-page application. It has been the most stunningly successful nonbureaucratic program that has been around in the last 20 years.  No. 2, cost, administrative costs, 10-story building, whatever that was about. The 100,000 cops has administrative costs of just over 1 percent, just over 1 percent administrative cost for putting 100,000 cops on the street over the duration of the bill, which takes 6 years.  My Republican friends have come along with this brilliant idea of a block grant. You know what they factor in for the block grant? Three percent overhead. The 100,000 cops program is one-third or one-half below what the Republican proposal calls for in the block grant proposal. It is actually less than the block grant. This is, with all due respect, poppycock.  Folks, nobody thought a year after this program was underway we would have it going, the administration--any administration--would have it going as well as it is: 17,000 cops making arrests as we speak because of Federal funding for cops that did not exist a year and a half ago; at total of 43,000 funded being recruited, being hired and being trained as a consequence of the crime bill right now. Right now. We have not gotten to 100,000 yet. No one said that. It was always said it would take the duration of time to get to the full 100,000.  The last thing, in 3 years they are going to have to pay their own way--
