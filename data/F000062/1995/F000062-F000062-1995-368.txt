 President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Missing Service Personnel Act of 1995, introduced by Senators Dole and Lautenberg earlier this year.  The Missing Service Personnel Act is a significant and an appropriate piece of legislation. It would establish new methods for determining the status of missing service personnel and improving the means by which full accountability is achieved. Due in part to the handling of POW/MIA cases by the Department of Defense and the United States Government since the Vietnam war, existing procedures have been criticized as being unresponsive to the[[Page S6470]] needs of effected families. In fact, current law does not adequately address issues that have emerged over the past 25 years regarding how missing persons and their families are treated by Government officials. S. 256 would implement procedures which foster a sense of trust and credibility between the Government and families of missing personnel, while attempting to ensure fairness to all involved.  Considering the tremendous sacrifices our men and women make when facing combat, maintaining credibility and trust are crucial. Soldiers face the terrible prospect of capture and, in turn, their loved ones face the horrible possibility of intense anguish and heartache. We must assure our armed services personnel and their civilian counterparts that the United States will do everything possible to return them home safely in the event they turn up missing in action. At the same time, they must also be assured that more open and fair procedures will be established to determine their exact status. S. 256 takes concrete steps to achieve these objectives.  There are, however, some issues with the bill that I think still need to be reviewed. For instance, S. 256 restricts identification of recovered remains to licensed practitioners of forensic medicine. Utilization of personnel in disciplines other than medicine which may be appropriate are not permitted. According to DOD, such a requirement would be unreasonable during combat operations or on the battlefield. Moreover, as this legislation would be retroactive to World War II, DOD may be required to review thousands of cases. The Defense Department has indicated that it does not have the personnel or budget to handle such a workload. These are some issues that I hope the Senate Armed Services Committee will look into when reviewing this legislation.  Overall, I believe that S. 256 is an important and noteworthy bill. The Government has been perceived as being unresponsive to the needs of families whose loved ones are classified as missing in action. This legislation would safeguard the rights of missing armed service members while addressing the concerns of their effected families and the Federal Government. I am pleased to cosponsor the Missing Service Personnel Act.                          ____________________
