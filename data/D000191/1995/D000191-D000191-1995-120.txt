Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, how many times is this Congress going to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the professionals at the Pentagon? Yes, there are problems at the Pentagon, but one problem they do not have at the Pentagon is not asking for enough money to accomplish the needed goals to defend this country.  We have had scandal after scandal where we have overexpended funds, where we have had cost overruns. This is a case where we have fully funded the request of the Pentagon in the President's budget, $2.9 billion. That is an increase in ballistic missile defense, and we are up to $2.18 billion for theater missile defense. That is up by, that is almost $600 million in a mere 2 fiscal years. The funding is more than adequate.  What we are doing here, Mr. Chairman, is adding money into the budget the Pentagon did not ask for, and micromanaging the theater missile defense program, one of the most successful programs in the Pentagon. Do not mess with it.
