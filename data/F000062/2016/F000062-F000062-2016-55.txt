 President, I also strongly oppose this amendment. This would eliminate funding for our environmental infrastructure projects of the Army Corps of Engineers. Funding for these projects enables communities to solve local problems in a way that protects the environment.  Problems are being solved, such as upgrading wastewater treatment facilities, so that our drinking water and marine resources are protected, and replacing deteriorated distribution systems with efficient systems that help conserve water.  I hope we will vote this amendment down.
