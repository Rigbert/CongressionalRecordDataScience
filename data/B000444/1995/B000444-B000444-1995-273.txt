  Let us assume we pass such a bizarre law to protect the welfare of individuals and it only gathered up 10, 12 people in all America who are affected by it. If a company, if an individual, affected by that cost and the onerous burden they would have to go through to meet the law, if they thought it was a bad idea, tell the Senator from Delaware what they would be able to do under this law to get to the point where the section the Senator referred to takes control. What I mean by that is, could an individual or a company come along and say, ``OK, I demand that the EPA do a cost-benefit analysis anywhere.''
