 President, the senior Senator from Alaska knows that reform is urgently needed to modernize America's energy policies for a new era, with new challenges and new opportunities. Under her leadership, the energy committee has worked hard the past year to achieve that aim. The committee convened listening sessions, the committee held oversight hearings, the committee worked hard and worked across the aisle focusing on areas of common ground that can move our country forward.  That constructive and collaborative process ultimately resulted in a broad bipartisan energy bill, the Energy Policy Modernization Act. It cleared committee with the support of more than 80 percent of the Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, including the top energy committee Republican, the Senator from Alaska, and the top energy committee Democrat, the Senator from Washington. Both recognize the importance of preparing our country for the energy challenges of today and the energy opportunities of tomorrow.  They are also committed bill managers. I ask colleagues to continue working with them as they have amendments. Talk to the Senators from Alaska and Washington and get your amendments dealt with. This is bipartisan legislation that provides a commonsense approach to help Americans produce more energy, pay less for energy, save energy, all without raising taxes or adding to the deficit.  So let's keep working and move the process forward. Let's keep working to pass this bipartisan bill.                          ____________________
