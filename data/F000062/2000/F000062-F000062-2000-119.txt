 I think the analogy is actually a very good one. I know defendants' rights are extraordinarily privileged, and well they should be. Senator Kyl and I have discussed this. We believe that our amendment does not collide, and we understand how victims feel.  I think one of the points is that throughout all of this we have communicated with victims groups. We have been their advocates. We have tried to march to the sound of their drum.  The tragedy for me, today, is that we are so close that, if we could bridge that one gap, getting the support of the Justice Department, the President's support, the Vice President's support, perhaps we might, on our side, pick up some votes. That one inability to reach this kind of consensus within the timeframe we have, in view of the feelings of our colleagues, is really the necessity of what we are doing here this afternoon. But I think at this stage there is an impasse. Does my colleague agree?
