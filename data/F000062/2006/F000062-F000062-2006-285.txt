 I also want to thank the chairman of the committee. He has been a very good chairman. I want him to know that the only reason I offer this amendment is because when we read the bill language of Hagel-Martinez, which has not been voted on by this body, I believe it to be unworkable. I believe it will create another class of illegal immigrants in this country. I believe it is impossible to carry out the deportation requirements of the Hagel-Martinez amendment.                    Amendment No. 4087, as Modified  I send an amendment to the desk, as modified, on behalf of Senators Harkin, Kennedy, Reid, Kerry, and myself. This is a modification of my earlier amendment.
