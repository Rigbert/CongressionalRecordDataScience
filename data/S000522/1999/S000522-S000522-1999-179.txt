Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I want to commend the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spence), the chairman, and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton), the ranking member, for an excellent bill that I think should get the full support of every Member here.  I also want to especially thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley)for rejecting the Clinton administration's flawed and misguided proposal to gut administration's funding for our military construction through the Administration's phased funding scheme. Thankfully, that has been rejected. And I especially want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley) and the superb work of Phil Grone for including the super lab for Navy Lakehurst.                              {time}  1330  Nothing is launched from our aircraft carriers or recovered, the catapults and the arresting gear, unless it has first been prototyped and bugs worked out at Lakehurst.  Lakehurst means safety for our pilots and the likelihood of a successful mission.  Lakehurst has an impeccable record of success, of providing an expertise that keeps our aircraft capable. I am just so glad that this new superlab will be built and provide the synergism and take us into the next millennium.
