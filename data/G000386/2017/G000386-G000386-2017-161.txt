 President, today I come to the floor to address my colleagues about the bipartisan resolution of disapproval that I introduced on January 30, along with Senator Crapo and 24 other cosponsors. This resolution now has 32 cosponsors, and of course this resolution of disapproval is absolutely necessary.  The resolution of disapproval is a procedure, as we know, under the Congressional Review Act for repealing executive branch regulations. The regulation at issue here in this disapproval resolution was issued by the Social Security Administration under President Obama. This regulation unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. If the regulation is not repealed, it will allow the agency to very unfairly deprive Social Security recipients of their Second Amendment rights. The regulation would result in disability recipients being reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as ineligible to own a firearm and, thus, have their Second Amendment rights violated.  This is essentially a national gun ban list. The agency accomplishes this by doing two things: determining if a person has a disorder on a vague ``mental disorders'' list, and, two, appointing a representative payee to manage benefit payments.  This process has been in place for years to merely assign a representative payee. That is merely someone who is authorized to deal with the bureaucracy on behalf of that Social Security recipient to help a recipient with their finances. Now it is being used to report beneficiaries to a list so that they cannot buy or own a gun. Of course, once on that list, individuals are prohibited, as I have already inferred, from purchasing, owning, and possessing firearms, thus violating Second Amendment rights.  The regulation is flawed beyond any kind of repair. It results in reportingpeople to the gun ban list that should not be on that list at all. It deprives those people of their constitutional rights and, in a very important way, violates their constitutional rights without even due process.  Under current Federal law, one must first be deemed ``mentally defective'' before being reported to the gun ban list. However, the mental disorder list in this regulation is filled with vague characteristics that do not fit into the Federal ``mentally defective'' standard.  The disorder list is inconsistent with the Federal mentally defective standard. More importantly, the list was never designed to regulate firearms. As such, it is improper to use it for that purpose.  Many of the disorders on the list are unrelated to gun safety. For example, the disorders list includes eating disorders, disorders that merely impact sleep or cause restlessness, and even disorders that could cause ``feelings of inadequacy.''  Because the Second Amendment is a fundamental right, the government must have a very compelling reason to regulate, and the regulation must be very narrowly tailored. It unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. The government is essentially saying that a person with a disability, such as an eating disorder, is more likely to be violent and should no longer be allowed to own a gun.  There is no evidence to support that general idea and, consequently, people being denied constitutional rights without due process. And if a specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their mental illness, then the government should have to prove it. It is pretty basic constitutional law: The government should have to carry the burden before denying a constitutional right.  The National Council on Disability--and that happens to be a nonpartisan and independent Federal agency--has said this:       The rule stigmatizes a group of people who are not likely      to perpetuate the kind of violence the rule hopes to address.      Furthermore, it deprives a much broader class of individuals      of a constitutional right than was intended by Federal law.  In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union has said:       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no      data to support a connection between the need for a      representative payee . . . and a propensity toward gun      violence.  That was a quote from the American Civil Liberties Union.  The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities--and that is a coalition of 100 national disability groups--shares the same concerns about regulations, and I will quote from them:       The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate      stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent      and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of      policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those      unfounded assumptions.  In other words, those unfounded assumptions are about who might be disabled or not.  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Council on Disability,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on      behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding      the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)      released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of      the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In      accordance with our mandate to advise the President,      Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,      programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with      disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed      rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned      against implementation of the proposed rule because:       ``[t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to      manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,      possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only      unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with      disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the      stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a      representative payee[.]''       Despite our objections and that of many other individuals      and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed      rule, the final rule released in late December was largely      unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional      right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule      legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing      the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.       NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no      stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control      other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun      possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual      disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to      whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to      themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.      Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction      on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only      after the individual has been afforded due process and given      an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not      able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her      disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far      short of meeting these criteria.       Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on      the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of      SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming      it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues      SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and      difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to      beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule      creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long      noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do      the important work it is already charged with doing. With all      due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply      a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to      implement this rule may strain the already scarce      administrative resources available to the agency, further      impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.       The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory      overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In      this particular case, the potential for real harm to the      constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and      intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to      undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of      people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their      basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that      utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only      warranted, but necessary.           Regards,                                                   Clyde E. Terry,     Chair.                                  ____                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                                 February 9, 2017.     Vote YES on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.J. Res. 14          (Social Security Administration NICS Final Rule).     Vote NO on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.J. Res. 12          (Federal Acquisition Regulation/Fair Pay and Safe          Workplaces EO).       Dear Senators: On behalf of the American Civil Liberties      Union (ACLU), we urge members of the Senate to support the      resolution disapproving the final rule of the Social Security      Administration which implements the National Instant Criminal      Background Check System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007.       Additionally we urge members to oppose the resolution of      disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of      Defense, the General Services Administration, and NASA      relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that implement      the Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order 13673.   Social Security Administration (SSA)'s Implementation of the NICS    Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007 Harms People with Disabilities       In December 2016, the SSA promulgated a final rule that      would require the names of all Social Security Disability      Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)      benefit recipients--who, because of a mental impairment, use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits--be      submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check      System (NICS), which is used during gun purchases.       We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the      harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a      vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should      not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection      between the need for a representative payee to manage one's      Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward      gun violence. The rule further demonstrates the damaging      phenomenon of ``spread,'' or the perception that a disabled      individual with one area of impairment automatically has      additional, negative and unrelated attributes. Here, the rule      automatically conflates one disability-related      characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money, with the      inability to safely possess a firearm.       The rule includes no meaningful due process protections      prior to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      The determination by SSA line staff that a beneficiary needs      a representative payee to manage their money benefit is      simply not an ``adjudication'' in any ordinary meaning of the      word. Nor is it a determination that the person ``lacks the      mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs'' as      required     by the NICS. Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly state that      representative payees are appointed for many individuals who      are legally competent.       We recognize that enacting new regulations relating to      firearms can raise difficult questions. The ACLU believes      that the right to own and use guns is not absolute or free      from government regulation, since firearms are inherently      dangerous instrumentalities and their use, unlike other      activities protected by the Bill of Rights, can inflict      serious bodily injury or death. Therefore, firearms are      subject to reasonable regulation in the interests of public      safety, crime prevention, maintaining the peace,      environmental protection, and public health. We do not oppose      regulation of firearms as long as it is reasonably related to      these legitimate government interests.       At the same time, regulation of firearms and individual gun      ownership or use must be consistent with civil liberties      principles, such as due process, equal protection, freedom      from unlawful searches, and privacy. All individuals have the      right to be judged on the basis of their individual      capabilities, not the characteristics and capabilities that      are sometimes attributed (often mistakenly) to any group or      class to which they belong. A disability should not      constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any      right or privilege, including gun ownership.  Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Regulations Advance Worker Safety and                                  Rights       The rules implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces      Executive Order take an important step towards creating more      equitable and safe work conditions by ensuring that federal      contractors provide workplaces that comply with federal labor      and civil rights laws.       Employers that have the privilege of doing business with      the federal government must meet their legal obligations. The      Fair Pay and Safe Workplace regulations are crucial because      they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly      and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil      rights laws and that they are complying with federal labor      and employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act      (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil      Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and      the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law      equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from      forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the      Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and      sexual assault.       Congress should stand with workers, increase the      accountability of federal contractors and oppose any attempts      to undo the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations. These      rules will help ensure that the federal government does not      contract with employers that routinely violate workplace      health and safety protections, engage in age, disability,      race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other      labor violations.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader,     Washington, DC.       Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:      The Co-Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of      Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a      Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the      Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)      on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS      Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require      the Social Security Administration to forward the names of      all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use      a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a      mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background      Check System (NICS).       The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the      largest coalition of national organizations working together      to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-     determination, independence, empowerment, integration and      inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all      aspects of society.       Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights      Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a      letter to the Obama Administration and through the public      comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed      the rule for a number of reasons, including:       The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy      change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive      assistance from representative payees in managing their      benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public      dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people      with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there      is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed      by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.       The absence of any data suggesting that there is any      connection between the need for a representative payee to      manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a      propensity toward gun violence.       The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior      to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.      Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to      transmit the names of individuals who have been      ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own      affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication      and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly      unable to manage their own affairs.       Based on similar concerns, the National Council on      Disability, an independent federal agency charged with      advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies      regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the      Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.       We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to      disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it      inflicts on the disability community.
