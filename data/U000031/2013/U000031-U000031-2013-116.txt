Speaker, I submit the following for the Record.                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2013.     Hon. Dave Camp,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Camp: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 3350, the ``Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013.'' As you      noted, there are provisions of the bill that fall within the      Committee on Ways and Means' Rule X jurisdiction.       I appreciate your willingness to forgo action on H.R. 3350,      and I agree that your decision does not in any way prejudice      the Committee on Ways and Means with respect to the      appointment of conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives      on this or similar legislation.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 3350 on      the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Fred Upton,                                                         Chairman.                                  ____                                                                      U.S. House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                Washington, DC, November 13, 2013.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing concerning H.R. 3350, the      ``Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013,'' which may be scheduled      for floor consideration this week.       As you know, the Committee on Ways and Means has      jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Section      5000A of the Internal Revenue Code requires individuals to      maintain minimum essential coverage or pay a penalty. Section      2(b) of H.R. 3350 modifies which health care plans would meet      the requirement of minimum essential coverage. However, in      order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration,      the Committee will forgo action on this bill. This is being      done with the understanding that it does not in any way      prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment of      conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives on this or      similar legislation.       I would appreciate your response to this letter, confirming      this understanding with respect to H.R. 3350, and would ask      that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be      included in the Congressional Record during floor      consideration.           Sincerely,                                                        Dave Camp,     Chairman.                          ____________________
