Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank my distinguished colleague from Chicago, Illinois and all of the Members at the end of a very long day for having the courtesy to listen to him and these serious concerns. We certainly will take this to conference, and we will not forget that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rush) was the one who reminded us to do it.
