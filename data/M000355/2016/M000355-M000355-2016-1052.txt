 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on March 17, 2016, by the President of the United States: Treaty with Kazakhstan on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, Treaty Document No. 114-11. I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
