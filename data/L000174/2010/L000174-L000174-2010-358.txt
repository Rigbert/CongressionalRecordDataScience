Earlier this week the Senate voted to invoke cloture and end the 15th filibuster of President Obama's nominations to fill important posts in the executive branch and the judiciary. That number does not include the many others who have been denied up or down votes in the Senate by the anonymous obstruction of Republicans refusing to agree to time agreements to consider even noncontroversial nominees.  Every single Republican Senator who voted on Monday voted against cloture and to keep filibustering this well-qualified nominee. Every single Republican voted to obstruct the Senate from doing the business of the Americanpeople. Wasn't it just a few years ago that Republicans were demanding up or down votes for nominees, and contending that filibusters of nominations were unconstitutional? Not a single Republican voted for cloture and to stop the filibuster of this nomination.
