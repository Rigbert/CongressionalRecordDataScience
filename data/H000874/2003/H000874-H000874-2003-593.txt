Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to the Bowie State University men's basketball team. On March 1, 2003, the Bowie State Bulldogs defeated Virginia Union to earn their first central intercollegiate athletic association men's title.  In their first appearance in the CIAA tournament in 30 years of play, the Bulldogs were down 41-32 at half-time against a 14-time league champion. Nevertheless, the team rallied back for a neck-and-neck second half. The winning basket was a heartstopper and came with less than a minute to go, giving the Bulldogs a 72-71 victory.  Mr. Speaker and colleagues, please join me in recognizing the great accomplishment of the Bowie State University men's basketball team and wish them the best of luck in their upcoming NCAA Division II tournament.                          ____________________
