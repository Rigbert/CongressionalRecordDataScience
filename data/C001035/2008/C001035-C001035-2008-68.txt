President. I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in introducing legislation to reauthorize the U.S. Fire Administration. The bill would provide additional resources to help the agency meet its growing responsibilities. We are pleased to be joined by our fellow cochairs of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus--Senators McCain and Biden.  Since its creation in 1974, the Fire Administration and its Fire Academy have helped prevent fires, protect property, and save lives among firefighters and the public. Today, the Fire Administration is also integrated into our national, all-hazards preparations against natural disasters and terrorist attacks.  Last month marked the fifth anniversary of the Fire Administration's reorganization as part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency within the Department of Homeland Security. As both Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and as a cochair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am pleased that the bill being introduced today does much more than reauthorize the Fire Administration.  For example, the bill designates $5 million annually to support necessary technology upgrades to the National Fire Incident Reporting System. This important system helps State and local governments report and analyze fires, and allows nationwide sharing of data in standard formats. This database--the world's largest collection of fire-incident information--helps all levels of government to probe the nature and causes of injuries, deaths, and property loss resulting from fires.  Another vital component of this bill establishes a rotating position at the DHS National Operations Center to be filled by a State or local fire-service official. In our comprehensive, all-hazards approach to major disasters, it is just as important to have the fire services represented at operations center as it is military liaisons.  The bill has other important provisions, including provision for a 1.3 percent annual increase in the initial $70 million authorization through fiscal year 2012. In addition, the bill expands National Fire Academy training programs to include topics like hazardous-material fires and fire-based emergency medical services. It authorizes expanded research on fires in the urban-wildland interface and in rural areas. It encourages the Fire Administration to adopt national voluntary standards on firefighter health and safety--an important topic, considering that about 100 brave firefighters lose their lives in the line of duty each year, with many more suffering serious injuries.  My home state of Maine is keenly aware of the dangers of fire and the importance of effective fire services. Maine is one of the most rural states in the nation and most of its housing stock is wood framed. Some households rely on woodstoves for primary or supplemental heat.  According to the Maine Department of Public Safety, nearly 50 Mainers died in fires every year through the 1950s, '60s, and '70s. The average so far for this decade is 18, and 2007 produced only 12 fire-related deaths, still too many but a considerable improvement.  Maine public-safety officials attribute the decline to factors like wider use of smoke detectors and improved building codes--and fire-prevention efforts. As our national resource and clearing house for fire research, education, and training, the U.S. Fire Administration certainly deserves a share of the credit for my state's progress in reducing the pain, devastation, and death wrought by fires.  I have no doubt the Fire Administration's beneficial effects will grow. Its new campaign for preventing smoking-related home fires is a worthy effort. Its growing curriculum of online courses on topics like incident command for nursing-home fires, emergency medical service at multi-casualty incidents, and emergency response to terrorism is a valuable resource for firefighters.  The U.S. Fire Administration is a fine example of the good that can come of federal, state, and local collaboration to counter an ancient threat and to address new ones. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the reauthorization and improvement of this valuable agency.                                 ______                                       By
