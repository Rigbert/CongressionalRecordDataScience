 Chairman, the gentleman is correct, I think, in saying that polls in America support the death penalty. People want judges and juries to have the option to use the death penalty. I think the gentleman will not disagree with me that polls and studies also indicate that the public wants judges and juries to have the option to use the death penalty or not to use the death penalty to allow for life imprisonment. That is precisely what the Fields amendment is.
