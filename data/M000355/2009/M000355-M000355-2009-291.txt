 President, I rise today with sadness to honor the life of Mr. Mason Rudd, a good friend who died on July 5, 2009, at the age of 90. He was loved by many in my hometown of Louisville, KY, and he will be missed.  Mason will be remembered as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and family man who did so much to make his adopted hometown a better place.  His American dream began at the University of Minnesota, where he funded his college education with help from a tennis scholarship, participation in ROTC, and by selling doughnuts. In 1939, he graduated with a degree in geology and petroleum engineering. After college, his service in World War II led him to believe that he survived the war for one reason--tohelp others achieve and live better lives. And this he did.  Mr. Rudd spent a few years working as an engineer for Shell Oil and then selling fire engines in Iowa until 1952 when he moved to Louisville. There he established Rudd Equipment Company, which distributed heavy construction equipment. The company he built brought him a large fortune which would serve him well when he undertook his many altruistic pursuits.  Mason grew to love the city and especially the local university--the University of Louisville. He contributed $1.4 million to the creation of a neurology professorship at the University of Louisville after his first wife Mary suffered a fatal stroke. His help facilitated the $3.6 million Bass-Rudd Tennis Center at the University of Louisville as well as the endowment for the Rudd Program for Young Artists at the Kentucky Opera to train young singers.  However, more important than the money, Mr. Rudd contributed invaluable time and effort to the causes of health care and education.  Thirty years ago, this passion was clear to me when I served as Jefferson County's judge-executive and it was my responsibility to appoint someone to the county's board of health. I reappointed him to the board, just as those serving before me had and those after me did.  While serving on this board as well as in leadership positions at Louisville General Hospitals and Louisville's Jewish Hospital, his efforts provided everyone in the city with a healthier, safer life. His fellow members credit him with creating lead poisoning education programs, a hazardous-materials task force in the health department, a mandate on sewage treatment, and primary care clinics for the uninsured.  His efforts also extended to helping the Louisville Free Library Foundation during his 16 years on the board there. Because of him the library's book endowment is stronger and the children's reading program continues to grow. Most notably, in the year 2000 library fundraising efforts under his leadership made it possible to purchase computers for the library.  Mr. Rudd leaves behind his wife Peggy: his daughter Betsy; and his son Michael. The life he led in his 90 years stands out as an example of service to his community and country which all Americans should honor and strive to achieve. He will be missed.                          ____________________
