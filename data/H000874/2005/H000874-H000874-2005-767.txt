Leader, I know in the past the gentleman has been very reluctant to simply take the Senate's work product, and I am somewhat shocked that the gentleman apparently suggests that process now. I do not know whether that is going to be a precedent for the future. But may I ask the gentleman, is it his contemplation that it would come directly to the floor and not go to committee for consideration?  Mr. DeLAY. It is a new Congress and a new Senate, and the work that they are doing over there, at least the beginning of the work that they are doing over there, is pretty impressive, particularly the work they have done on this very important bill.  We have gone through regular order on this side of the House in many different steps on this class action issue; and if the Senate does what I think it is going to do, yes, we would bring it straight to the floor and consider it without committee action.
