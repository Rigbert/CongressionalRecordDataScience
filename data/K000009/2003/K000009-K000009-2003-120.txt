Speaker, I rise today to recognize Helen Hutt, joining us in our gallery, a distinguished citizen from Ohio. When Helen first began her service to the American Red Cross, Calvin Coolidge was President of the United States, a first-class stamp cost 2 cents, and the first Academy Awards were presented. That was 1928. Since that time, Helen has touched countless lives through her 75 years of service to the American Red Cross.  Helen began her involvement with the Red Cross in 1928 when she became certified to teach swimming lessons. During World War II, she worked in the South Pacific as a ``Doughnut Dolly,'' serving GIs coffee and doughnuts. In the 1950s and 1960s, she organized a ``Learn to Swim'' program for Port Clinton children and the blind. Helen worked as a local Disaster Relief Volunteer during the 1970s, and then volunteered at Magruder Hospital recruiting blood donors and sharing expertise with the Ottawa County Advisory Board. She is still an active volunteer for the Ottawa County district office of the Red Cross.  Throughout her years of volunteerism, Helen has received numerous honors, including the Volunteer of the Year Award for the Ottawa County District, and the highest local award for the Red Cross that it ever bestows, the Clara Barton Volunteer Leadership Award.  Mr. Speaker, in view of the fact that this incredible American now is over 90 years of age and she will be receiving her 75-year volunteer pin at the National Red Cross Headquarters here in Washington, D.C., I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this magnificent American.  Congratulations. We are so very, very proud of you, Helen Hutt.                          ____________________
