 President, Congress created drug courts 5 years ago in the 1994 crime law as a cost-effective, innovative way to deal with nonviolent offenders in need of drug treatment. Though authorization for this program was repealed just two years later, we wisely continued to fund this program. I am pleased to join with Senator Specter today to cosponsor the ``Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 1999.''  In just 5 years, drug courts have taken off. There are 412 drug courts currently operating in all 50 States plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and two Federal districts. An additional 280 courts are being planned.  Let me tell you why I am such an advocate for these courts. Drug courts are as much about fighting crime as they are about reducing dependence on illegal drugs.  Our Nation has about 3.2 million offenders on probation today. They stay on probation for about 2 years. Throughout those 2 years, they are subject to little, if any, supervision.  For example, almost 300,000 of these probationers had absolutely no contact with their probation officer in the past month--not in person, not over the phone, not even through the mail--none!  Drug Courts fill this ``supervision gap'' with regular drug testing, with the offender actually coming before a judge twice a week, and actually seeing a probation officer or treatment professional three times a week.  Nearly 100,000 people have entered drug court programs and the results have been impressive. About 70 percent of the drug court program participants have either stayed in the program or completed it successfully. That is more than twice the retention rate of most traditional treatment programs.  The other 30 percent of the participants went to jail. And I think that should be heralded as a success of the drug court program as well. Without drug courts, this 30 percent would have been unsupervised, not monitored, and unless they happened to be unlucky enough to use drugs or commit a crime near a police officer, they would still be on the streets abusing drugs and committing crimes. Drug courts provide the oversight to make sure that does not happen.  The Specter-Biden reauthorization bill calls for fully funding drug courts at the level the Attorney General and I called for in the 1994 crime law--- $200 million. Drug courts are effective and cost effective. Let's spend our money wisely and invest in what works.  There are a number of jurisdictions that want to open or expand their drug courts but are unable to do so because of lack of treatment capacity. We always talk about devolving power to State and local government. Let's put our money where our mouth is and give these jurisdictions the funds they need. The Specter-Biden reauthorization act includes $75 million a year to expand local treatment capacity so that no community that wants to start or expand a drug court is precluded from doing so due to lack of treatment slots.  Make no mistake, participating in the drug court program is not a walk in the park. If you use drugs while in the program, you go to jail. Period.  Rather than just churning people through the revolving door of the criminal justice system, drug courts help these folks to get their acts together so they won't be back. When they graduate from drug court programs they are clean and sober and more prepared to participate in society. In order to graduate, they are required to finish high school or obtain a GED, hold down a job, and keep up with financial obligations including drug court fees and child support payments. They are also required to have a sponsor who will keep them on track.  This program works. And that is not just my opinion. Columbia University's National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse found that these courts are effective at taking offenders with little previous treatment history and keeping them in treatment; that they provide closer supervision than other community programs to which the offenders could be assigned; that they reduce crime; and that they are cost-effective.  According to the Department of Justice, drug courts save at least $5,000 per offender each year in prison costs alone. That says nothing of the cost savings associated with future crime prevention. Just as important, scarce prison beds are freed up for violent criminals.  I have saved what may be the most important statistic for last. Two-thirds of drug court participants are parents of young children. After getting sober through the coerced treatment mandated by the court, many of these individuals are able to be real parents again. More than 500 drug-free babies have been born to female drug court participants, a sizable victory for society and the budget alike.  Let me close by saying I hope the Senate takes up this legislation as soon as possible so we can reauthorize this important, effective program.                          ____________________
