President, I rise to congratulate Coggeshall Elementary School of Newport, Rhode Island, which this year celebrates its 100th anniversary.  Coggeshall has seen much since it opened to students in 1899. It has seen the rise of the automobile, the invention of the airplane, and the emergence of the Internet. It has weathered the great hurricanes of 1938 and 1954. It was around for 5 Boston Red Sox World Series wins and all the summers and autumns of bitter defeat since the last in 1918. Coggeshall has seen its graduates serve in two World Wars. It has seen its female students earn the right to vote.  Since Coggeshall opened its doors, the sound barrier and the four minute mile were broken, Charles Lindburg traversed the Atlantic, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and Rosa Parks ignited the Civil Rights movement.  Mr. President, Coggeshall Elementary has not only experienced history, it has shaped it. Coggeshall and its teachers have had an impact on generations of Newport's students. The school's influence is certain to reach far into the future.  I want to take this opportunity to commend Coggeshall Elementary for its continuing legacy to Rhode Island--its students.  Recently, Jessica Perry, a fifth grade student at Coggeshall, penned a history of the school. I ask unanimous consent that her paper be printed in the Record, and I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Coggeshall Elementary on its 100th anniversary.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows:                History of Coggeshall Elementary School                      (By Jessica Perry, Grade 5)       Coggeshall Elementary School was built beginning 1898. It      opened to students in 1899. This year Coggeshall will be      celebrating its 100th anniversary.       When Coggeshall was first opened there was a boys and girls      entrance, boys had to go in one door and the girls had to go      in the other door. Boys and girls almost always rode their      bicycles so they had a bike room. Where the library is now is      where the boys bike room was located. Where the kitchen is      now was the girls bike room. There was no office. There were      only four classrooms each on the 1st and 2nd floor.       The school had been open for a short period of time in the      spring of 1899. June 24, 1899 was the formal dedication. The      keys were given to mayor Boyle and Superintendent of Schools      Baker. At the same time there was a graduation of Miss      Gilpan's class. The girls wore white dresses and the stage      was decorated with flowers. Lots of important people were      there. Children sang and read their essays they had written,      the newspaper said the school was the best constructed      building of its kind they had ever seen. They said it had      ``tinted walls, high ceilings and pleasant prospects.'' Mr.      Denniston and Mr. Belle donated the flag and flag pole.       From 1936-1971 there was a half-day kindergarten class as      well as grades one to six. In the fall of 1976 grade six was      moved to the Sullivan School. Now the sixth grade is located      at the Thompson Middle School. Coggeshall has always had a      kindergarten class until 1981. There was no kindergarten that      year. In 1982 the kindergarten came back. It left again in      1990 for one year. In 1996 an all day kindergarten was begun      at the school.       Throughout the years changes have been made to the school.      There are new chimneys, we added a fire escape, new school      sign, parking lot, new windows and shrubs. There are also      telephone poles, electric wires and cars that were not here      in 1899!       Since 1936 there have been 12 principals, the principal      that was here the longest is Mary Ryan. She stayed for 14      years! The principal that stayed the shortest is Dr. Mary      Koring. She worked here for only one year. In the early years      the principals Charles Carter, Irvin Henshaw, and Leo      Connerton was the principal of Sheffield School and      Coggeshall School. After the 1950's the principal was only in      charge of Coggeshall School. Mr. Borgueta is the      Superintendent of Schools now and Mr. Frizelle is the      principal.                          ____________________
