Mr. President, I say to my friend that I have a list of 18 positions which I have talked repeatedly about and which I have inserted into the Record. As I have said, I am not one who has used this term in the way some have to include individuals with broad authority across various agencies, such as the Director of National Intelligence. But that is the position that is established or recognized in law and is subject to Senate confirmation. I did not include those. In fact, in the language of my amendment, I specifically say it does not apply to positions established in law.
