President, I would like the Record to reflect that I was necessarily absent for the vote on the Byrd amendment offered to S. Con. Res. 118 on Wednesday, March 16, 2005. Had I been present for this vote, I would have voted in favor of the amendment.                          ____________________[Page S2843]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            VOTE EXPLANATION
