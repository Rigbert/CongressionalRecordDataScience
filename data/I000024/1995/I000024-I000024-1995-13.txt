McCAIN. Let me just finish if I could, and I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.  Right now, the tentative plans are to vote on H.R. 2606, which is the use of funds for troops in Bosnia. Following that, a vote on an amendment by, I believe, Senator Hutchison and Senator Nickles, and many others--Senator Inhofe, Senator Kyl--on the issue of a resolution concerning Bosnia, and that would be followed, is tentatively scheduled to be followed by a vote on the Dole amendment, the language of which has not been completely worked out.  That is subject to change. There may be amendments, additional amendments from the other side of the aisle on this issue. The Democrat side has reserved the right to propose additional amendments on that side.  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.
