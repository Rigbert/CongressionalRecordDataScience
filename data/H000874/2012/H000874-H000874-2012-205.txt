 On the Violence Against Women Act, a very important piece of legislation which we have reauthorized in the past in a bipartisan fashion, it is under a rule. Does the gentleman know whether it will be an open rule or whether there will be, perhaps, a modified open rule with amendments being printed? Will the gentleman tell us? I have a lot of folks on my side of the aisle who are very interested in dealing with certain portions of that bill, and they'd be interested to know whether or not they will be able to offer amendments.
