 President, I am pleased that last night the Senate approved S.Con. Res. 73, which emphasizes the importance of agriculture in our trade discussions with the European Union. This resolution tells the U.S. Trade Representative two things: The elimination of trade restrictions imposed on U.S. agriculture exports should be a top priority in any trade talks with the E.U. And no trade negotiations should occur, at all, if they will undermine our ability to eliminate these trade restrictions in the next round of ag talks at the World Trade Organization in 1999.  Mr. President, on Monday the president announced in London that the United States and European Union will begin negotiating a new bilateral trade agreement. While I generally applaud any initiative to further reduce barriers to trade, I was dismayed to see agriculture included on the agenda in only a very narrow sense. The many outstanding trade barriers the Europeans have erected to our agriculture exports have been left off the bargaining table.  Currently, the trade in agriculture between the U.S. and E.U. is very one-sided. The Europeans keep out our pork. They keep out our beef. They keep out our feed grains that are genetically modified. Their protectionist policies hurt our farmers. And the Europeans desperately want to keep these policies in place at the expense of our farmers.  So it's understandable why the Europeans want to avoid discussions on agriculture. But I'm surprised the Clinton Administration is willing to move forward with this trade agreement and ignore all the problems we have in agriculture. They appear so anxious to move the trade agenda forward, perhaps to account for their inability to gain fast track authority, that I'm afraid the prospect for further liberalization of agriculture trade will be damaged in the process.  In 1999, a new round of agriculture negotiations are to begin at the World Trade Organization. These negotiations will be critical to setting the rules for global ag trade for the next several years. It is a chance to build on what was begun in the Uruguay Round Agreement--which was the first major trade agreement to address agriculture tariffs, subsidies and nontariff trade barriers.  The United States has much to gain in these talks. We have the most productive, efficient agriculture system in the world. Our farmers can compete with the farmers of any other country. So if trade barriers to ag exports are removed, our farmers will export more of their production, their income levels will rise, rural communities will prosper and the trade deficit will be reduced.  The Europeans, on the other hand, fear open competition in agriculture. They continue to impose high barriers to U.S ag products and to heavily subsidize their own farmers. Many Europeans view the next round of talks as a threat to their agriculture industry. They would rather avoid the negotiations.  So we must use all available leverage to gain concessions from the Europeans. But I'm afraid we will surrender some of our leverage in this new bilateral agreement. In other words, if we give away concessions now, we'll have less leverage when we turn to the ag talks in 1999.  And that would give the Europeans, who don't want free trade in agriculture, the upper hand. And reduce the likelihood that agriculture trade barriers will be eliminated in the 1999 talks. That's what this resolution says. Do nothing that will weaken our negotiating position in 1999.  But the resolution also says something else. It says make the elimination of restrictions on agriculture exports a top priority in any discussions with the European Union. To me, this is just common sense.  The United States has a trade surplus in agriculture products. The rest of the world wants to buy the food and fiber our farmers produce. So there is no doubt that our farmers produce safe, wholesome, high-quality products. Yet the European Union does everything it can to keep these products out of their countries. Products sold all over the world are not allowed into the European Union. So doesn't it make sense that the U.S. would seek to negotiate to remove these trade barriers?  But these barriers are not on the agenda for the upcoming trade negotiations. And I think that is wrong. I think it is unfair to our farmers. It tells them that their issues aren't important. We're just going to sweep them under the rug. And go on to negotiate other trade issues.  Well, Mr. President, now the entire Senate is on record. The Senate has stated firmly: Our farmers deserve better. We will not stand by idly and let you ignore the problems of our farmers any longer.  I hope the administration takes notice of our actions here today. And I hope they immediately press the European Union to put agriculture back on the bargaining table.  Again I thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution.                          ____________________
