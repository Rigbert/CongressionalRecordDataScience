Speaker, the people of northwest Ohio lost a great man, a giant oak, this past week. Msgr. Jerome E. Schmit, who passed away on Thursday, April 10, 1997. Monsignor was born on December 4, 1910, the youngest of five children. He graduated from St. John's High School in Toledo in 1982, St. John's College in 1932, and attended the Pontifical Josephinium in Worthington, OH, where he studied theology and the Scriptures. He received his masters in social work degree from Catholic University of America in 1941.  Overcoming prejudice about a congenital disability which impaired his speaking ability, Monsignor Schmit overcame his cross and was finally ordained a Catholic priest on June 7, 1941. He received his ordination from Bishop Karl J. Alter and, over the years, gained not only the respect but love of his flock.  Early in his career, Monsignor was appointed to Catholic Charities in Toledo, and it was there that he truly made his mark--ministering to the legion of children of our community. Guiding the CYO [Catholic Youth Organization] program, Monsignor Schmit developed an entire youth program under which Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and 600 basketball teams flourished. His leadership made the CYO program a proud institution of the Toledo Catholic Diocese. Property was purchased and developed, programs were expanded ever further, and thousands upon thousands of children have now been served by his ministry. He became the cherished relative to every family whose lives he touched.  In 1942, Monsignor Schmit was asked to take over the Catholic Club, a recreational facility, and was soon named director of Catholic Charities and director of the diocesan youth department. He served the Catholic Club until retiring from the position in 1980.  Not content to limit development of local youth sports and recreation, Monsignor Schmit was a part of the Lucas County rec committee which developed the Lucas County Rec Center. Through the committee's work, the recreation center added baseball diamonds and a pool. During the 1950's, a baseball franchise was purchased, and Monsignor Schmit became the secretary-treasurer of the Toledo Mud Hens Triple A baseball team. Until his death, he was secretary-treasurer of the Lucas County Rec Center.  Elevated to papal chamberlain, he was entitled to the title Monsignor in 1954. In 1963, he was elevated to domestic prelate. Associate pastor at St. Patrick's Historic Church from 1951 until 1968, Monsignor Schmit was named the church's pastor in 1968. He retired--but only officially--from those duties in 1981.  Monsignor Schmit's achievements and recognitions are too numerous to mention. In addition to those described above, a few of these include: founder of the council of Catholic men in 1945; awarded the city of Toledo Recreation Award in 1954 for his outstanding contributions to amateur athletics; awarded the Silver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America, whom he served as chaplain, in 1952; member of the Old Newsboys Goodfellows; receipt of the American Red Cross Distinguished Service Award in 1963; St. John's Alumni 1975 Man of the Year; awarded outstanding service as chaplain of the Toledo police department for 25 years in 1980; induction into the Toledo City Athletic League Hall of Fame in 1984; board member of the Toledo Legal Aid Society; founder of the Baseball Hall of Fame in Maumee, OH; founder of the Shoe Bowl football competition; charter member of the Catholic Better Community Development Corp. which provides housing for elderly, disabled, and low-income people; and chaplain of the Catholic War Vet's Logsdon Walla Post.  A man of quiet dignity yet truly profound inspiration and with a wry sense of humor, Monsignor Schmit will be greatly missed. He left our community a magnificent legacy, perhaps best described in his obituary; ``Monsignor Schmit's energy, inventiveness, and dedication to the ideal of service has touched virtually every facet of our community's life.'' He ``inspired hundreds of young people to lead wholesome, Christian lives.''  Monsignor Schmit was preceded in death by his family: parents Henry and Minnie Schmit; brothers Rev. John Schmit, Rev. George Schmit, and Dr. Bernard Schmit; and sister Ursula Schmit. However, he leaves behind the family of our community, and we will miss his effervescence, his devout faithfulness, his humble manner. Monsignor Schmit epitomized a life well-spent. Godspeed, good and faithful servant.                          ____________________
