Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, we just heard that people with the green eyeshades downtown here in Washington, DC, reviewed the Coast Guard process and they found that it was meritorious. People with the green eyeshades in downtown Washington, DC, have never tried to cross a bar entrance in Oregon with an outgoing tide and a strong wind. It is pretty tough. In fact, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, in this bulletin of January of this year said, and I quote, this is the Commandant of the Coast Guard, the same gentleman recommending these cuts referring to the Pacific Northwest:       This area has always challenged mariners with its isolated,      storm-battered coastline, strenuous harbor entrance. From      seasoned fishermen to unwary vacationers, thousands of people      annually learn hard lessons due to suddenly changing tides      and weather.  This is the same Commandant who wants to close two lifesaving stations in my district. The last Commandant closed those two lifesaving stations in my district, and within 2 months five people drowned, five people who could have been saved.  The GAO and the people with the green eyeshades think you can tread water for 40 minutes. Well, you cannot tread water for 40 minutes, as the gentleman from Massachusetts pointed out, when it is cold in the Atlantic, not in the summertime but in other months of the year. You cannot tread water for 40 minutes while you are waiting for the helicopter in the bar entrances in my district either, not at the Coquille River, not at the Rogue River, not at the other areas scheduled for cuts.  We are talking about one-tenth of 1 percent of the operating budget of the U.S. Coast Guard. If this is an agency that does not have one-tenth of 1 percent of cuts that it can make somewhere else except in lifesaving, then this agency should be running the entire Government of the United States of America, because I cannot say that about any other agency of the U.S. Government. And I do not believe that anybody in this House, particularly Members from that side of the aisle, would make that assertion about any other agency of the Federal Government, one-tenth of 1 percent. Is that too much to save lives?  By the Coast Guard's own estimates, two people will drown this year to save one-tenth of 1 percent of their operating budget.                      [[Page H4587]] {time}  1615  You might say that is a reasonable cost, about $1 million per person. What if it is your father, your mother, your kid, just a friend, a neighbor? Do you think it was worth that cut?  Do you think it was worth abandoning the principal historic mission of the U.S. Coast Guard on 120 miles of the Oregon coast in the Northern Michigan Peninsula, in New Jersey, in Massachusetts, in other areas? Is it worth abandoning to save one-tenth of 1 percent, or so the admiral will not have to find one-tenth of 1 percent somewhere else in his budget to cut?  I do not believe so, and I do not believe it should be the judgment of this body, because if that is the judgment of this body, then the blood of the people who will drown, and they will drown, the Coast Guard says two will drown, I think maybe 10 or 20 will drown, given the experience in my district 7 years ago, people will die because of this vote.  This is a little more serious than a lot of the other votes cast here. The green eyeshades downtown do not know anything when it comes to this. The Commandant of the Coast Guard does. He says these are treacherous entrances, but he is going to abandon them and serve them from 120 miles away with a helicopter.  As the distinguished ranking member of the committee worked out, that is a pretty tough thing to do in high winds and low visibility, let alone talking about the water temperatures and survival times, none of which was factored into this great equation that the GAO said was okay. What the GAO said is they did their math right. They did not say that this makes sense for people on the ground or in the water around the United States of America.  This is an ill-intentioned cut, and this body should not let this cut be made, and we should vote for the Traficant amendment.
