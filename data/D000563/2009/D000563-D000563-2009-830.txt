President, we are currently on the Department of Defense authorization bill and an amendment that has been offered by the Democratic majority leader relative to the creation of a new Federal crime of hate crimes.  Earlier, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, came to the floor to question the wisdom of adding that kind of legislation to a bill related to the Department of Defense. Most people, when they hear that argument, would say: Why don't they do these bills separately? It turns out that under the Senate rules, oftentimes there are few opportunities to move a bill forward. It is not at all unusual for Senators to come forward and offer what appears to be, and may in fact be, an unrelated amendment to a bill that is likely to pass and be signed by the President. Too often, we pass bills that die in transit to the House or once over in the House never see the light of day.
