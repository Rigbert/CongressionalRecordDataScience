 President, yesterday this body lost one of its finest Members. I greet this day with a very heavy heart.  Paul Coverdell was not only a good Senator, he was a good and decent man. I found him to be a very nice man. I worked with him closely as an original cosponsor of his Education Savings and School Excellence Act. I found him very dedicated and very easy to work with. I found him to be above political correctness; he strived to do what he believed would work and would help people.  We shared a common interest. We worked together on many antinarcotics efforts. We debated together on certification. I was his Democratic cosponsor of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. We talked together about what was happening. We tried to plan together. I found him to have a deep and abiding knowledge about Mexico, Central America, and Latin America.  He had a kind of energy, enthusiasm, and dedication well known on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate. He was never one to seek the spotlight, but all of us here know how hard he worked. He wasn't the proverbial ``show horse''--he was a workhorse.  He was a man who served the people of Georgia and this Nation with great distinction. He worked all of his adult life in public service. Simply put, Paul Coverdell made this body a better place and a more collegial place. All one really had to do was spend time alone with him in an office and listen to him and his thoughts as he sought to frame and advance an issue.  Senator Harkin was in the elevator as I came up this morning. He said: ``It's so hard because on Friday he was alive and well in the Senate and today he simply is not here.''  There is a passage from the Book of Ecclesiastes--Chapter 5, verse 12--I will leave with the Senate: ``The sleep of a laboring man is sweet.''  Paul Coverdell, you have labored hard. Your sleep will be sweet.
