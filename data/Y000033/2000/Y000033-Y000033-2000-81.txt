Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3657 was introduced by the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Bono). This legislation will convey a little over an acre of Forest Service land to a radio station located in the San Bernardino National Forest in California for fair market value.  The bill was amended in the Senate to allow the Forest Service to use the San Bernardino County revenues derived under the Receipts Act for land acquisition.  I would like to commend the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Bono) for all her diligent work on this important legislation.  I urge all Members to support H.R. 3657.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                              {time}  1445
