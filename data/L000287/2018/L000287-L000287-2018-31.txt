Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5439. I believe that this is one of my favorite bills.  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to join my friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Renacci), in introducing this commonsense bill, and I want to thank the gentleman for it.  The gentleman from Ohio and I share a passion and a commitment to this issue. Two years ago we introduced the Stolen Identity Fraud Prevention Act. We both believe that taxpayers should receive the help and support that they need and deserve, and I am proud to join him again today in sponsoring this bill.  In recent years, I also included this commonsense policy in the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Democratic bill, the Taxpayer Protection Act.  H.R. 5439 responds to a frequent, ongoing concern of many of our citizens. This bill will help ease the frustration that victims of tax-related identity theft feel, and it addresses a top IRS casework issue in my congressional district.  H.R. 5439 establishes a single point of contact within the Internal Revenue Service for any taxpayer who is the victim of identity theft. As a result of this bill, the taxpayer will not need to start again from scratch every time they try to get an update on their case. Instead, the single point of contact would work with other IRS units to solve the taxpayer issue as quickly as possible.  This good, commonsense bill will help taxpayers across our country. For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge all of our colleagues to support H.R. 5439.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
