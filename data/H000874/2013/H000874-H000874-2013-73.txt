Speaker--and I know, again, as did the majority leader--Mr. Sanford Bishop, himself, gave such a tribute to the Capitol Police at the beginning of the last bill; but also we want to thank the Sergeant at Arms, Paul Irving, and all of those who work with the Sergeant at Arms.  Mr. Speaker, I know he may want to say a word on that as well, but I will yield to him now for the purposes of informing the Members of the majority leader's view of the schedule for the days to come.
