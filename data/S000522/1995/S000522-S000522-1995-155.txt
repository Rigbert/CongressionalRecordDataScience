Mr. Chairman, it does not help this debate one iota for the gentleman to call it softheaded to say that the screening process was influenced. The overwhelming consensus by the human rights groups is that it is flawed.  Let me just, again, remind the gentleman, and this is not a conservative human rights organization, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights Refugee Project concluded, and I quote, ``The entire screening process and review procedures remain seriously flawed.'' They went on to state: ``The process remains hostile to genuine refugees, and thousands may have been wrongly rejected.''
