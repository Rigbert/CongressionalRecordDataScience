HATCH. Absolutely. The original language passed last year expressly included rural areas, but this amendment is intended to make our intent clearer that not only can rural areas as well as urban qualify as distressed areas, but also that clubs ought be expanded into rural areas and smaller communities where needed and, in particular, into rural areas such as those in my friend's State of Vermont, my State of Utah, and other States with few Boys and Girls Clubs. I agree with the Senator that our call for 1,000 new clubs by the year 2001 should include attention to expanding opportunities for young people in our rural areas and smaller communities.
