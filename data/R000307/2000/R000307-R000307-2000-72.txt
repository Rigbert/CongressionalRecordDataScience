I will try to keep my remarks certainly more brief and more pertinent.  The point I was trying to make--I know that the same is true with regard to Texas--the Senator from Texas is here--and also Minnesota and Maine--is the time to travel great distances, many miles. Our health care providers spend an awful lot of time traveling from one patient's home to another. What happens is that the first patient may be located many miles away from the next patient. It requires the home health care nurse to work virtually nonstop to meet the deadlines required for the submission of the data to HCFA, which interferes with the personal care and the travel time. This is like 24-hour duty that is exacerbated by all of the data requirements.
