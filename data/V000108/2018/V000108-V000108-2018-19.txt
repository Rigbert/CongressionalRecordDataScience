Chairman, I simply want to follow the chairman's remarks, and associate myself with his remarks relative to the staffer who has been lost.  The chairwoman was kind enough in the general debate to mention the staff and the Members who have been so instrumental in this work product, and I would be remiss if I did not conclude by again thanking the full committee chairman, as well as Mrs. Lowey.  I can't thank Chairwoman Granger enough. This has just been a pleasant and productive experience, and I appreciate her leadership very much. I appreciate the work of all of the members of the subcommittee, as well as all of our staff. That includes our clerks, Jennifer Miller and Rebecca Leggieri, as well as Walter Hearne, Brooke Boyer, B.G. Wright, Allison Deters, Collin Lee, Matthew Bower, Jackie Ripke, Hayden Milberg, Bill Adkins, Sherry Young, Barry Walker, Jennifer Chartrand, Chris Bigelow, Johnnie Kaberle, Jonathan Fay, Joe DeVooght, and Christie Cunningham. I can't thank them enough.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
