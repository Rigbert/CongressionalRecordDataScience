President, the argument we just heard is absolutely upside-down of what that amendment is. This amendment guts the bill, it guts the straw purchasing provisions, it guts the gun trafficking provisions. It totally undermines law enforcement.  Law enforcement strongly supports the next amendment we have--the Leahy-Collins--but all this does, this substitute amendment, is aid Mexican drug cartels, eliminates the tools being used to get law enforcement investigatory leads. It undermines rather than strengthens the current background check.  We talk about do we enforce our laws. If you want to gut our laws, which this one does, don't argue they are not being enforced. This handcuffs law enforcement, helps drug cartels, helps drug syndicates. It is a bad amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator's time has expired.  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.
