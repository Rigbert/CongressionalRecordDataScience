Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) for the purposes of informing the body as to the schedule for the coming week.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under a suspension of the rules and a final list sent to Members' offices by the end of the week.  We may also consider a motion to go to conference on the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act and any votes called on these measures, though, will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday we expect to consider several additional bills under suspension of the rules, as well as S. 380, which is virtually identical to the Postal Service Reform Bill that we had scheduled for consideration tonight.  For Wednesday and the balance of the week we have several measures that we will consider under a rule. These include the gun manufacturers liability Reform Bill that was reported by the Committee on the Judiciary earlier today, the comprehensive energy policy bill, the FY 2004 Budget Resolution Conference Report, and the Conference Report on the FY 2003 War Supplemental.  I would note for Members that we plan to stay in session into the weekend if necessary in order to complete the supplemental before our spring recess.  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I am happy to answer any questions.
