 You note in the announcement of the 9/11 resolution, and I was asked by the press, were we going to do something on issues that appear to be partisan, and I said no. On September 11th, we will not be here; we will be in our home districts, and it should be a day of remembrance and resolve; remembrance of the heroism of that day and remembrance of the loss of life on that day, and resolve to defeat terrorism and to defeat those who would put our country at risk and put our people in harm's way and at risk. I believe we are united on that.  I just saw the resolution, and I have not had a chance to read the resolution, nor as I understand it have we worked with your side on the resolution.  Mr. Leader, I would hope perhaps we could come together before the resolution is finally introduced. We passed last year's resolution with over 400 votes, very few ``no'' votes. I ask if we could work on this together to ensure that we have that kind of unanimity which I think is appropriate and would help to bring us together.
