 Grassley, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Markey, Mr. Toomey, Ms. Heitkamp, Mr. Rubio, and Mrs. Shaheen) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 385       Whereas the United States abolished the transatlantic slave      trade in 1808 and abolished chattel slavery and prohibited      involuntary servitude in 1865;       Whereas, because the people of the United States remain      committed to protecting individual freedom, there is a      national imperative to eliminate human trafficking and modern      slavery, which is commonly considered to mean--       (1) the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision,      or obtaining of an individual through the use of force,      fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjecting that      individual to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage,      or slavery; or       (2) the inducement of a commercial sex act by force, fraud,      or coercion, or in which the individual induced to perform      that act is younger than 18 years of age;       Whereas the Department of Justice has reported that human      trafficking and modern slavery has been reported and      investigated in each of the 50 States and the District of      Columbia;       Whereas, to help businesses in the United States combat      child labor and forced labor in global supply chains, the      Department of Labor has identified 139 goods from 75      countries that are made by child labor and forced labor;       Whereas the Department of State has reported that the top 3      countries of origin of Federally identified trafficking      victims in 2016 were the United States, Mexico, and the      Philippines;       Whereas, to combat human trafficking and modern slavery in      the United States and globally, the people of the United      States, the Federal Government, and State and local      governments must be--       (1) aware of the realities of human trafficking and modern      slavery; and       (2) dedicated to stopping the horrific enterprise of human      trafficking and modern slavery;       Whereas the United States should hold accountable all      individuals, groups, organizations, and countries that      support, advance, or commit acts of human trafficking and      modern slavery;       Whereas, through education, the United States must also      work to end human trafficking and modern slavery in all forms      in the United States and around the world;       Whereas victims of human trafficking and modern slavery      should receive the necessary resources and social services to      escape, and recover from, the physical, mental, emotional,      and spiritual trauma associated with their victimization;       Whereas human traffickers use many physical and      psychological techniques to control a victim, including--       (1) the use of violence or threats of violence against the      victim or the family of the victim;       (2) isolation of the victim from the public;       (3) isolation of the victim from the family and religious      or ethnic community of the victim;       (4) exploitation of language and cultural barriers;       (5) shame;       (6) control of the possessions of the victim;       (7) confiscation of the passport and other identification      documents of the victim; and       (8) threats of arrest, deportation, or imprisonment if the      victim attempts to reach out for assistance or to escape;       Whereas, although laws to prosecute perpetrators of human      trafficking and to assist and protect victims of human      trafficking and modern slavery, such as the Trafficking      Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.),      title XII of the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act      of 2013 (Public Law 113-4; 127 Stat. 136), the Trade      Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (19 U.S.C.      4301 et seq.), the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of      2015 (Public Law 114-22; 129 Stat. 227), and the National      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law      114-328; 130 Stat. 2000), have been enacted in the United      States, it is essential to increase public awareness,      particularly amongst individuals who are most likely to come      into contact with victims of human trafficking and modern      slavery, regarding conditions and dynamics of human      trafficking and modern slavery precisely because traffickers      use techniques that are designed to severely limit self-     reporting and evade law enforcement;       Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of the effective date      of the Emancipation Proclamation;       Whereas February 1 is--       (1) the anniversary of the date on which President Abraham      Lincoln signed the joint resolution sending the 13th      Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to the      States for ratification to forever declare that ``Neither      slavery nor involuntary servitude . . . shall exist within      the United States, or any place subject to their      jurisdiction''; and       (2) a date that has long been celebrated as ``National      Freedom Day'', as described in section 124 of title 36,      United States Code; and       Whereas, under the authority of Congress to enforce the      13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States ``by      appropriate legislation'', Congress, through the Trafficking      Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.),      updated the post-Civil War involuntary servitude and slavery      statutes and adopted an approach of victim protection,      vigorous prosecution, and prevention of human trafficking,      commonly known as the ``3P approach'': Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate supports--       (1) observing ``National Trafficking and Modern Slavery      Prevention Month'' during the period beginning on January 1,      2018, and ending on February 1, 2018, to recognize the vital      role that the people of the United States have in ending      human trafficking and modern slavery;       (2) marking the observation of ``National Trafficking and      Modern Slavery Prevention Month'' with appropriate programs      and activities, culminating in the observance on February 1,      2018, of ``National Freedom Day'', as described in section      124 of title 36, United States Code; and       (3) all other efforts to prevent, eradicate, and raise      awareness of, and opposition to, human trafficking and modern      slavery.
