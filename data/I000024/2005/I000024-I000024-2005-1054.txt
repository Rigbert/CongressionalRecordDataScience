It is the same bill essentially that was passed last year by a margin of 76 to 21. We are anxious to get people to come down to the floor for amendments. I don't know of anyone coming down at this time. But I encourage all Members on both sides of the aisle to come down and utilize this time so we can get the amendments behind us.  I understand the Senator from Illinois has some comments he wishes to make. I yield to him some of our time at this time.
