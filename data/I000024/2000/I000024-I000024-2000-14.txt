Also I thank the ranking member, Senator Levin, who was very helpful on this whole issue. I believe we addressed it properly in this bill.  If we let an agreement go that had a financial motivation for the 9,000 residents of the island of Vieques to vote to kick out the Navy forever and lose that as a range, that had to be changed. This bill does that. We changed it so that the western land is not going to the Governor of Puerto Rico but to the people of Vieques.  A lot of people do not realize that Vieques is like a municipality in Puerto Rico, and the people of Vieques are very fond of the Navy. I am the first one to admit the Navy had some PR problems, but I say to our chairman, they have worked very hard, and I see a change in attitude there.  I was recently in Vieques meeting with a group of people. I left firmly convinced that if we have this referendum and if the referendum has a motivation for them to vote right--and that is to accept the Navy and the live firing range--then I believe they are going to do it.  The other day, I was on a talk show and someone called in. Actually, it was someone who was on the other side of this issue. They said: How would you like to have a live range in your State of Oklahoma?  I said: Let me tell you about Fort Sill.
