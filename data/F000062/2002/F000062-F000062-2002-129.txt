 President, I rise today to submit a concurrent resolution honoring flight attendants for the courage, dedication, and heroism they display on a daily basis as the first line of defense against trouble and terror in our skies.  From the events of September 11, we have all taken great pride in the heroism and courage displayed by rescue workers, firemen, and first responders. These were the men and women running into the burning and collapsing buildings to help those who were running out get to safety. Who knows what the death toll would have been that dreadful day without the help of these brave heroes.  Since September 11, the United States has rallied behind the courage and dedication of our troops abroad who are rooting out terrorism. American soldiers are protecting the United States from future terrorist attacks and as we all know, lives have been lost.  I cannot say enough about what the policemen, firemen, rescue workers, and the men and women of our armed services have done to protect all of us.  However, one group of American heroes that I also want to make sure receive their proper recognition are the approximately 100,000 men and women who serve as flight attendants in the United States today.  Flight attendants dedicate themselves to serving and protecting their passengers.  Flight attendants react to dangerous situations on airplanes as the first line of defense of airline passengers and the pilots in the cockpit.  Flight attendants evacuate passengers from the airplane in emergency situations.  Flight attendants have defended passengers against hijackers, terrorists, and abusive passengers.  Flight attendants handle in-flight medical emergencies.  And as we all know, many flight attendants lost their lives on September 11 as they fought with terrorists.  Clearly flight attendants do more than serve food and drinks on the plane.  They are the police, the fire department, the paramedics, and the bomb squad at 30,000 feet above ground. Just one of these responsibilities would overwhelm most people. Yet, flight attendants manage to balance these roles day in and day out.  Flight attendants have enormous responsibilities and they face tremendous dangers in flight.  To honor the dedication, courage, and commitment flight attendants made everyday, I am offering this resolution to: 1. Express the gratitude of Congress for the faithful service provided by flight attendants to make air travel safe; 2. Honor the courage and dedication of flight attendants; 3. Support flight attendants as they continue to display heroism on a daily basis; and 4. Send a copy of this resolution to a family member of each of the flight attendants killed on September 11, 2001.  In this resolution, we mention three specific instances where flight attendants have courageously intervened to save the lives of others.  We all know about the heroic passengers and crew of Flight 93 on September 11, 2001. The flight from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco was hijacked that dreadful morning. Yet the terrorists were prevented from crashing the airplane into its intended target by brave passengers and crew. Among the crew that sacrificed their lives were five United Airlines flight attendants.  A few months later, terrorist Richard Reid tried to blow up American Airlines Flight 63. He too was stopped with the help of flight attendants as he tried to light explosives in his shoes.  Speaking of the flight attendants aboard flight 93, one passenger said, ``There's no question that all of us on board owe our lives to them. [Reid] was fighting to the death.''  And in February of this year, flight attendants and pilots aboard United Airlines Flight 855 prevented a passenger from breaking into the cockpit while the plan was traveling from Miami to Buenos Aires.  There are only a few examples of times when flight attendants have stepped forward to risk their lives to protect others. And unfortunately there will always be a tremendous amount of risk for the men and women who work aboard airplanes every day.  I want to point out that this resolution is the result of a letter by a flight attendant in Sacramento, California who wrote to me. I would like to insert the letter into the Record and read some of it aloud.  Heather Lauter-Clay, a United Airlines flight attendant, wrote,       From the deepest part of my heart, I am asking for your      support in carrying a resolution to honor Flight Attendants.      It would mean so much to Flight Attendants to be given the      respect and support that they so deserve.  Heather, I completely agree and I am proud to offer this resolution to honor our flight attendants.  I also want to enter this note into the Record. It was given to me by Kristin Spivey, a United flight attendant, on my trip home over the weekend. I was especially touched by Ms. Spivey's note, which was written on an airplane cocktail napkin. The note reads:       ``Senator Feinstein: I am so pleased to have you on our      flight today. It has been an honor to serve you--just to meet      you. Thank you for sponsoring the bill to acknowledge flight      attendants's contributions on September 11th. It was very      difficult to lose so many flying partners to something so      senseless.       In the aftermath it was hard to go on, despite the fact      that I love my job and would not give it up, because so few      seemed to understand my sense of loss. It is also comforting      to believe that all those onboard flight 93 died for a      reason--to save many others in Washington.       You do then a great honor in remembering that. I know you      can help others understand all this. Thank you for speaking      for us. I know my fallen colleagues would be proud.       Kristin Spivey (D.C. based)  I think this note from Ms. Spivey makes it clear that this resolution is very important and I hope the Congress will pass this legislation soon.  To the flight attendants serving today and every day: Thank You.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for this resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                        Davis, CA.       Dear Senator Dianne Feinstein: I am a United Airlines      Flight Attendant. On September 11th, our United Family was      forever changed. In the weeks and months following the      tragedy, we have been mourning the loss of our colleagues and      loss of ourselves. Our world as we knew it has been forever      changed.       On that fateful day, the grief was immense for us. We lost      16 or our crewmembers in one hour, on one day. We were      stricken with feelings of sadness, fear, confusion and panic.      Many of us were stranded, away from home. As the unknown      lingered, we still held onto the thoughts of what our      colleagues faced in their last moments. Meanwhile, knowing      that we too would soon be boarding an airplane.       As a flight attendant, we have taken an oath ``to provide      comfort, care and safety'' to our passengers. On September      1th, our flight attendants were doing their job. All of the      previous protocols that were in place for hijacking      situations failed them. They died protecting their passengers      in the best way that they knew how. As we know, in the last      moments of flight, they were unselfishly caring for others.      Flight Attendants assisted in bringing down UAL 93 by boiling      water to throw on the hijackers and others were on the phones      to supervisors detailing what was transpiring on the planes.       As we approach 4 months since Sept. 11th, our flight      attendants are still continuing to be faced with sadness,      grief, and mourning. The skies as we now know them, are a      host to uncertainty. Possible terrorist threats are      continually present. Airline safety is still compromised.      United has layed off thousands of flight attendants and job      security is wavering.       Over these past months, firefighters, policemen, postal      workers and others have     been honored for their heroism and dedication to Sept 11th.      Flight Attendants have not and this hurts us. We too, go to      work each day, to serve and protect, knowing that we may not      come home to our loved ones. We too know the importance of      carrying on with our job, despite what we may encounter, even      the possibility of death. Our commitment, bravery and      dedication to the public have never ceased during and after      the events of September 11th. Our crews of UAL 93 and UAL 175      died unsung heroes.       From the deepest part of my heart, I am asking for your      support in carrying a resolution to honor Flight Attendants.      It would mean so much to Flight Attendants to be given the      respect and support that they so deserve. The crews of UAL      93, UAL 175, AA 11, and AA 77 died unsung heroes. The      countless Flight Attendants who have been flying since Sept.      11th continually display valor, gallantry, courage, and      bravery in the midst of a world that is forever changed.       Senator Feinstein, thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,     Heather Lauter-Clay.                                  ____       Senator Feinstein: I am so pleased to have you on our      flight today. It has been an honor to serve you--just to meet      you. Thank you for sponsoring the bill to acknowledge flight      attendants' contributions on September 11th. It was very      difficult to lose so many flying partners to something so      senseless.

Kristin Spivey,     D.C. based.                                  ____         Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, Air            Transport Local 556,                                         Dallas, TX, May 13, 2002.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As President of Transport Workers      Union Local 556 representing the 7000+ hard working Flight      Attendants at Southwest Airlines, I am writing in support of      your proposed resolution honoring all Flight Attendants.       Before September 11, 2001, Flight Attendants insured the      safety and comfort of airline passengers. On September 11,      2001, Flight Attendants were the first to sacrifice their      lives for the safety of the aircraft and passengers. Since      September 11, 2001, Flight Attendants have been first in      enabling airplanes and passengers to the skies. For many      Flight Attendants, their only reward since September 11, 2001      has been a ``pink slip'' as they were also among the first to      lose their jobs in cutbacks related to the ``Attack on      America''.       Thank you for your leadership and for sponsoring a      resolution which will bring well-deserved recognition to the      over 100,000 Flight Attendants in America who make me proud      to wear my wings.           Respectfully,                                                    Thom McDaniel,                                          TWU Local 556 President.
