To assert that that was a political stunt, with all due respect, Mr. Leader, is incorrect. It was a conviction, a belief, strongly held, long advocated, that we give relief to those who have lost their unemployment insurance benefits, just as it has been our belief for a long period of time that we give that child tax credit to those 6.5 million families, those 12 million children, those 200,000 service personnel who are not covered by the child tax credit.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, I have to correct the gentleman. He says a long-held belief. I do not understand what the gentleman's definition of ``long-held belief'' is. When his party was in control in 1993 and the unemployment figures were higher than they are now, the economy was not as good as it is now, his party brought to this floor the cutting off of long-term unemployment benefits. Yet now when the economy is even better, when the unemployment rate is almost to full employment, the gentleman feels very strongly, and it is not for politics, I am sure, very strongly that now we have to extend. So long-held beliefs are in the eyes of the beholder.
