Speaker, on April 24 we commemorate the massacre of Armenians in Turkey during and after the first World War. In what historians refer to as the first of this century's state-ordered genocides against a minority group, more than 1.5 million people were murdered. We mourn the dead and express our condolences to the descendants of those who perished. We must also reflect upon the meaning and lessons of their suffering and sacrifice.  In the more than eighty years since this unspeakable tragedy, the world has witnessed decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing. Civilian populations, defined by ethnic, racial or religious distinctiveness, have become the objects of persecution and genocide simply because of who they are--Armenian Christians, European Jews, Bosnian Muslims, the Tutsis of Rwanda. The range of victims--geographical, ethnic, religious and political--testifies to the universality of human cruelty and fanaticism. The response of the survivors, however, testifies to the indestructibilty and the resilience of the human spirit, even in the face of the most virulent evil.  Like the phoenix of mythology, the Armenian people survived its bleakest days and arose with renewed vigor. Independent Armenian statehood has been restored to guarantee the security and future of the nation, and serves as a beacon of hope to Armenian people everywhere. It is our fervent hope, Mr. Speaker, that future generations will not have to sacrifice as their ancestors have. It is also our hope that all parties to the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh will build on the now four-year-old cease-fire and renew their efforts through the OSCE process to reach a negotiated settlement. Nothing could honor the memory of the victims of 1915 more than an independent and flourishing Armenia living in peace with all of its neighbors, and moving and impressing the world with both the spiritual and material products of the unbreakable Armenian spirit.                          ____________________
