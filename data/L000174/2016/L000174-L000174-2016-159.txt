President, I may be dating myself when I say this, but I remember when Ruby Paone started work here as a fresh graduate from St. Andrews University. That was April of 1975, just a few months after I began my own tenure here in the Senate, and for more than 41 years, she has served in the U.S. Senate as a public servant of the highest caliber. Ruby is a remarkable woman. Throughout her Senate experience, she has befriended future Presidents and legendary legislators. The Senate permeates her family. She and her husband, longtime Senate aide and now adviser to President Obama, Marty Paone, have raised three wonderful children.  Ruby is from the small town of Bladenboro, NC, and she brings the very best of small towns to this oftenchaotic city. In true smalltown fashion, she knows everyone, never forgets a name or a face, and has a smile and a kind remark for everyone she sees. I have often said that Senators are merely constitutional impediments to their staff, and the same can surely be said for Ruby. Her steadfast service and collegiality are part of what makes the Senate work. Ruby, thank you for all that you have done for the Senate, and we wish you the best in retirement.
