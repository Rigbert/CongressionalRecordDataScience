 Any money that we appropriate could go any place. It could go to a bad place. We don't want it to go to a bad place. And I don't think any of the 19 other nations want it to go to Hezbollah or other organizations that might be negative in the use of those funds as far as we're concerned.  What we do want, however--and that's what Ronald Reagan was talking about, that's what George Bush was talking about, and that's what President Obama is talking about--we do want to see the international economy rebound as well because it impacts on us as we impact very severely on it. That is why the G-20 made this determination.  I yield back.
