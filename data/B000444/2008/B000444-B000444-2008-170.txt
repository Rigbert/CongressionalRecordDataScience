 Baucus, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Specter, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Lautenberg) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 434       Whereas recent survey data suggests that illegal drug use      among youth has declined by 24 percent since 2001;       Whereas, despite the reduction in drug use among youth, the      number of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders who use drugs remains      too high and the rates of prescription and over-the-counter      drug abuse are alarming;       Whereas the overall rate of current illegal drug use among      persons aged 12 or older is 8.3 percent, which has remained      stable since 2002;       Whereas ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA)      use among high school age youth has been rising since 2004;       Whereas, while methamphetamine use is down among 8th, 10th,      and 12th graders, many counties across the country still      report that methamphetamine is a serious drug problem;       Whereas 25 percent of youth in the 10th grade reported the      use of marijuana during the past year;       Whereas youth who first smoke marijuana under the age of 14      are more than 5 times as likely to abuse drugs in adulthood;       Whereas nearly 6 percent of 12th graders have used over-     the-counter cough and cold medications in the past year for      the purpose of getting high;       Whereas Vicodin remains one of the most commonly abused      drugs among 12th graders, with 1 in 10 reporting nonmedical      use within the past year;       Whereas teenagers' and parents' lack of understanding of      the potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it even      more critical to raise public awareness about the dangers      associated with their non-medical use;       Whereas the rates of use for any illegal drug are directly      related to the perception of harm and social disapproval;       Whereas more than 20 years of research has demonstrated      that prevention interventions, designed and tested to reduce      risk and enhance protective factors, can help children at      every step along their developmental path, from early      childhood into young adulthood;       Whereas prevention efforts should be flexible enough to      address and prevent local problems before they become      national trends;       Whereas research has demonstrated that there are 4 major      targets of prevention: youth, parents, schools (including      colleges and universities), and communities and social      environments that must be reinforced by each other to have      the greatest effect in deterring the consequences of drug      use;       Whereas a comprehensive blend of individually and      environmentally focused efforts must be adopted and a variety      of strategies must be implemented across multiple sectors of      a community to reduce drug use;       Whereas community anti-drug coalitions are an essential      component of any drug prevention and education campaign      because they are data driven, know their community      epidemiology, and are capable of understanding and      implementing the multi-sector interventions required to      reduce the availability and use of drugs;       Whereas community anti-drug coalitions help to change      community norms, laws, policies, regulations, and procedures      to create an environment that discourages the use of drugs;       Whereas school-based prevention programs should be part of      a comprehensive community wide approach to deal with drug      use;       Whereas the more successful we are at general prevention of      drug use in younger adolescents, the less we will have to      deal with the concomitant economic and societal consequences      of their use;       Whereas the total economic cost of drug, alcohol, and      tobacco abuse in the United States is more than      $500,000,000,000;       Whereas the savings per dollar spent on substance abuse      prevention rather than on substance abuse treatment are      substantial, and can range from $2.00 to $20.00;       Whereas there will always be new and emerging drug trends      that require additional prevention and education efforts;       Whereas preventing drug use before it begins and educating      the public about the dangers of drug use is a critical      component of what must be a consistent and comprehensive      effort to stunt and decrease drug use rates throughout the      country; and       Whereas thousands of community anti-drug coalition leaders      and community based substance abuse prevention, treatment,      and education specialists come to Washington, D.C. to receive      state-of-the-art technical assistance, training, and      education on drug prevention at the Community Anti-Drug      Coalition of America's Annual National Leadership Forum in      February: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates the week of February 10-16, 2008, as      ``National Drug Prevention and Education Week''; and       (2) urges communities, schools, parents, and youth to      engage in, and carry out, appropriate prevention and      education activities and programs to reduce and stop drug use      before it starts.
