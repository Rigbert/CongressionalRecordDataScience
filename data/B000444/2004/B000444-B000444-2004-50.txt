 President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2705       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Peace for      Sudan Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Government of Sudan has engaged in an orchestrated      campaign of genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and has severely      restricted humanitarian and human rights workers' access to      Darfur in an attempt to inflict further harm on the Fur,      Masalit, and Zaghawa people of Darfur and to prevent the      collection of evidence of war crimes and crimes against      humanity.       (2) As a result of this campaign, as many as 30,000 people      have been killed, more than 1,000,000 people have been      displaced within Sudan, and approximately 200,000 have been      made refugees in Chad.       (3) As many as 320,000 people may die unless humanitarian      aid is immediately delivered to the affected individuals.       (4) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights      issued a report which ``identified . . . massive human rights      violations in Darfur perpetrated by the Government of Sudan      and its proxy militia, which may constitute war crimes and/or      crimes against humanity''.       (5) The Government of Chad, under President Idriss Deby,      has served an important role in facilitating a renewable      ``humanitarian cease-fire'' between the Government of Sudan      and the two rebel groups challenging that Government in      Darfur, the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudan      Liberation Movement, and has been a crucial partner in      permitting humanitarian assistance to reach refugees who have      crossed from Darfur to Chad in the tens of thousands.       (6) The cooperation and mediation of the SPLM is critical      to bringing about a political settlement between the      Government, the Sudanese Liberation Army, and the Justice and      Equality Movement.       (7) Practical implementation of a comprehensive peace      agreement between the SPLM and the Government of Sudan is      impossible without the implementation of a peace agreement      for Darfur.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term      ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee      on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on      International Relations of the House of Representatives.       (2) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's      Liberation Movement.      SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE                    CONFLICT IN DARFUR.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United Nations Security Council should immediately      pass a resolution--       (A) condemning the actions of the Government of Sudan in      Darfur; and       (B) setting out specific actions that such Government must      take to avoid the reimposition of sanctions;       (2) the United States Ambassador at Large for War Crimes      should travel to the region to investigate allegations of war      crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide brought against      the Government of Sudan;       (3) the President should immediately name a new Special      Envoy to Sudan whose responsibilities include support for      conflict mitigation throughout Sudan;       (4) the SPLM should take advantage of the opportunity      afforded by the May 26, 2004, signing of the three protocols      to help broker a political settlement to the conflict in      Darfur;       (5) restrictions pursuant to Executive Order 13067 (50      U.S.C. 1701 note) should not be lifted unless there is peace      in Darfur; and       (6) upon implementation of a peace agreement in Darfur, the      signing of a comprehensive peace agreement between the SPLM      and the Government of Sudan, and full cooperation from the      Government of Sudan on the war against terrorism, the      Government of the United States should immediately begin      discussions of the necessary steps to normalize relations      with Sudan, including the lifting of all economic and      political sanctions.     SEC. 5. ASSISTANCE FOR SUDAN.
