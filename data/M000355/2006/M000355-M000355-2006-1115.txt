 Cloture was invoked an hour or so ago. Under an agreement that we have just entered, Senators will have up to 11 a.m. in the morning to offer first-degree amendments that qualify postcloture. Votes will occur, and we expect to finish up the lobbying bill in a reasonable time on Wednesday. That will allow us to begin consideration of the border control legislation.                          ____________________[Page S2482]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL. Today we made significant progress on the lobbying reform bill. Cloture was invoked an hour or so ago. Under an agreement that we have just entered, Senators will have up to 11 a.m. in the morning to offer first-degree amendments that qualify postcloture. Votes will occur, and we expect to finish up the lobbying bill in a reasonable time on Wednesday. That will allow us to begin consideration of the border control legislation.                          ____________________
