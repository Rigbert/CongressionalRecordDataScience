Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Asian-American Medical Society will be hosting the 25th Annual Asian-American Medical Society Gala on Saturday, November 10, 2001, at Avalon Manor in Hobart, Indiana. Each year, this society honors prominent, extraordinary residents of Northwest Indiana for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their tremendous efforts for the betterment of Northwest Indiana, they are honored at a banquet and awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award. This Saturday, Lourdes M. Dennison will be presented with the Crystal Globe Award for her dedication and devotion to her community.  Lourdes M. Dennison exemplifies the sense of selflessness that is prevalent among the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. Her dedication to improving the welfare of the citizens of Northwest Indiana is evident as one learns of the various organizations that are enriched by her involvement. As a registered nurse, Mrs. Dennison's abilities focus upon caring for individuals whose lives are affected by an illness or by a disability. Drawing upon the knowledge gleaned from this intimate patient/caregiver relationship, Mrs. Dennison has extended her commitment to others by serving on the boards of the Hospice of Calumet Region, the Lake Area United Way, the Tradewinds Rehabilitation Center, and the Saint Mary Medical Center Foundation. In addition, she served as the past president of the Lake County Medical Auxiliary.  Mrs. Dennison offers her services and time to other professional organizations as well. She has been involved with the Women's Association of the Northwest Indiana Symphony Society, with the Endowment Board of Northern Indiana Arts Association, and with the Indiana Dunes Environmental Learning Center, all of which play an essential part in the cultural development of the First Congressional District. Furthermore, in spite of her taxing schedule, Mrs. Dennison received her real estate education from Indiana University, a feat that has allowed her to be an active partner in real estate developments in both Lake and Porter counties. While the above mentioned endeavors consume a significant amount of her time, Mrs. Dennison manages to serve on the Catholic Board of Trustees. The medical, cultural, and religious communities of Northwest Indiana are all enriched by her active participation.  By recognizing the efforts of Mrs. Dennison, a native Filipino, the Asian-American Medical Society offers to the Asian-American community a role model whose achievements have contributed significantly to the betterment of Northwest Indiana. As a testament to her professionalism, she was granted the honor of being named a lifetime member of the Philippine Professionals Association. Her success is to be applauded.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Lourdes M. Dennison for receiving the 2001 Crystal Globe Award from the Asian-American Medical Society. Her service and dedication inspire us all to greater deeds.                          ____________________
