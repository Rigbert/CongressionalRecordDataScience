 President, I understand that the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has received all the necessary paperwork from the administration for Dr. Henry Foster's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General. I rise today to encourage the committee to move Dr. Foster's nomination expeditiously, and I look forward to his receiving a full and fair hearing.  Unlike some of my colleagues, I am very excited about Dr. Foster's nomination. Dr. Foster is an ob/gyn. I appreciate, and want to stress, the importance and relevance of his practice area. For far too long, women's health concerns have been neglected by our Government.  Women's health is critical to very family--every man, woman, and child--in this Nation. As a woman, and the mother of a son and a daughter, I find the selection of Dr. Foster reassuring. It is especially important at this time that President Clinton chose to nominate a physician who has dedicated his life to maternal and child health.  Dr. Foster is one of the country's leading experts on preventing teen pregnancy and drug abuse, as well as reducing infant mortality.  Dr. Foster is a very decent and dedicated physician who has been unfairly maligned. I hope my colleagues and the American public will hear the stories of some of the many people whose lives Dr. Foster has touched.  I hope they get a more complete picture of Dr. Foster and the work he has done.  For example, Dr. Foster worked tirelessly to help bring Christopher Hight into this world. Jeannette Hight and her husband Charles almost lost their baby twice during her pregnancy, but Dr. Foster helped nurse her through these crises.  Earlier this year, Jeannette and Charles Hight wrote to Dr. Foster:       Without you, there would not be a Christopher Hight. Your      talents and work have brought joy to our lives. You will be      proud to know that your extraordinary efforts resulted in us      having a son who is excelling at Rice University in      architecture. His teachers, who are nationally renown, have      told us that he has very special talents. No matter what      happens, we are with you. We will always remember your      special dedication, caring nature and skills.  Cliff and Wilda Denton from Moses Lake in my home State of Washington wrote the following to Dr. Foster:       I can say in all humility, without you we could have lost      our only daughter and first born grandson. Wilma was so very      ill and dehydrated. All I had to do was call you. You would      nourish her back to normal. This was thirty some years ago.      When you were a doctor in the Air Force at Larson Air Force      Base, her husband was away fighting a war.       That's when we got acquainted with you. After the birth and      both were well and healthy, I wrote you a letter, thanking      you for all your good care. You told me I was the first      person (white that is) to ever give you a compliment. Greg is      now over thirty years old.       We were so impressed when we visited you a few years ago      and found you had dedicated your entire life to humanity . .      . I feel confident you will be confirmed. . . .  Mr. President, these are just a few examples for Dr. Foster's great work. He has delivered many thousands of babies, and he has saved hundreds of lives.  Some of our colleagues would have the U.S. Senate exclude Dr. Foster from consideration because he has performed abortions. I disagree. Abortion should not be the determining factor in the selection of a Surgeon General. Abortion is a legal procedure, and every woman in this Nation has a constitutional right to choose whether and when to bear a child.  Whether Dr. Foster has performed 1 abortion or 1,000 abortions, he should not be disqualified from consideration.  I believe that the majority in this Nation will not allow an extremist minority to criminalize abortion through the Surgeon General nomination process. Furthermore, I believe the women in this Nation will not stand for perfunctory disqualification of candidates based on their practice areas, especially when the physician involved has dedicated his life to women's health.  Mr. President, why is no one concerned about the exact number of babies Dr. Foster has delivered in the course of his practice? Why is no one inquiring into exactly how many lives he has saved?  I am curious how many teenagers have benefited from his I Have A Future Program? I wonder how many unintended pregnancies he has prevented?  How many young people has he empowered and inspired?  Why is this man being attacked so viciously when he has dedicated his life to our well-being? Finally, how can a U.S. Senator vow to filibuster Dr. Foster's nomination before the doctor has even had a hearing?  Mr. President, I had to speak on Dr. Foster's behalf today because I cannot stand by and watch his nomination be railroaded. Senator Kassebaum has promised Dr. Foster a hearing and I believe she is committed to following through. Luckily, not everyone is rushing to prejudge this nominee.  Every day that goes by without a U.S. Surgeon General in place who can provide strong leadership for our Nation's future--is a day in which American lives can be changed.  Mr. President, having a Surgeon General in place who can speak to women's health issues is imperative. I urge the committee to move quickly on Dr. Foster's nomination. And, I look forward to consideration of Dr. Foster's nomination by the full Senate.  I yield the floor.
