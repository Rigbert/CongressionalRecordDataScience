Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our cities and county. These individuals work tirelessly to develop voluntary community action to improve the community's economy, its education, its environment and its overall quality of life. One individual, who is a member of this group, is Roy Vander Kallen.  On the 9th of March, Mr. Vander Kallen will be honored with the Ira. D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award by the Corona-Norco Family YMCA. The award is given in memory of my father, ``Cal'' Calvert, and his innumerable philanthropic gifts to the community and his efforts to encourage others to serve their community in a similar fashion. The award recognizes Roy for his exceptional devotion to developing community volunteerism.  A lieutenant in the Corona Police Department, Roy credits his upbringing and the mentors of his youth for providing an emphasis on community service for his own history of volunteerism. Losing his parents at the young age of twelve, it was through his involvement in sports programs that kept him active in school. His early love of football set the tone for the next 25 years. He was all-CIF in high school, Second Team All American in college and played fifteen years in semipro. He joined the Corona Police Department in 1978.  During regular patrols and through handling many family issues throughout his career, Roy noticed that our community includes numerous low income families. The children of these families found themselves without the financial support necessary to participate in many after school sports and organizations. Seeing a need, Roy, along with Bud Gordon, co-founded the ARC Angel Foundation to address this financial void.  Raising funds through an annual golf tournament, the program is administered by Corona police officers. Word of the foundation has spread throughout the city and it is now called upon to assist with Christmas gifts, food, clothing, funerals, after school programs and computer equipment.  Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank Roy Vander Kallen for his dedication, influence and involvement in our community. He has aided in developing and maintaining community volunteerism in the Corona-Norco area and the Inland Empire. I know that we will continue to benefit from his experience in the 43rd congressional district and deep commitment to the region. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate Roy on his outstanding career and lifelong devotion to the community.                          ____________________
