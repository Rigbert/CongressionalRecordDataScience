In the Budget Committee, this received a 21-1 vote. Suffice it to say, for an issue that has been this controversial, which generated so much discussion in the Medicare Commission, to be able to come to the Senate today with a 21-1 vote from the Senate Budget Committee and then to take the additional step that the Senator from Maine and I and many of our other colleagues have taken, like Senator Kennedy who has fought this battle valiantly for so many years--we have now taken the additional step of saying that any new tobacco tax money could be used for this program, and that strikes me as the kind of bipartisan work that the Senate ought to be doing. It would be one thing if this was a narrowly fought battle in the Senate Budget Committee. Instead, we got a 21-1 vote.  Now we come to the Senate floor and say that onbudget surpluses could be used to finance this program for the vulnerable, No. 1. The second is to say that any new tobacco tax revenue could be generated for this program. That is the kind of bipartisan approach we ought to be taking. I thank my colleague from Maine. I know my friend from Massachusetts wants to speak.
