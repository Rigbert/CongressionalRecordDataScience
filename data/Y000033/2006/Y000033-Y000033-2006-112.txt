I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, Senate Concurrent Resolution 103 clarifies the intent of the conferees that the Coast Guard review and assess the impacts of any proposed offshore energy facility on the navigation safety in Nantucket Sound and on the service's capabilities to conduct missions within and near the proposed facility.  The resolution will require the Coast Guard to establish terms and conditions that are necessary to safeguard recreational and commercial vessel traffic in Nantucket Sound before any draft environmental impact statement is made available for public review.  The resolution also provides that these terms and conditions will be incorporated into the requirements of any lease that is granted for the construction of a proposed offshore facility.  This provision will allow us to develop offshore alternative energy resources in a way that does not jeopardize the safety and security of the maritime community in Nantucket Sound.  I urge my colleagues to support this concurrent resolution and to support the underlying resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
