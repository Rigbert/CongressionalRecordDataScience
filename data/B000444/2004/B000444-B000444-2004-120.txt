 I hope this means we have listened to the sounds of voices in this administration. I say to my friend, we both know this: We have both tried to help this administration, but it is as though there is a San Andreas fault that runs down the middle of this administration, with two very different views of the world. One is held by Mr. Powell, the State Department, and the uniformed military, and the other being the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, and Mr. Wolfowitz, who are all fine, honorable, and decent men who have a very different view of the world.  The view of their world which they have been promoting has turned out not to be so accurate. I hope this is evidence of the fact the President is starting to listen to saner voices.  I facetiously said--nobody asked--if you had a baseball team and you had somebody who batted zero and it came time to put in a pinch-hitter, are you going to look at the batting averages? It is time to look at the batting averages, Mr. President. Listen to those folks in your administration. There are some very good ones who have better batting averages, and I hope this is beginning that recognition.
