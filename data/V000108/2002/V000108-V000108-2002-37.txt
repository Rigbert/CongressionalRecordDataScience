Speaker, on occasion, I am fortunate enough to come to the floor to congratulate a person who has devoted her entire life to improving the lives of others. Today, I am proud to congratulate Mrs. Alma V. White of Gary, Indiana, as she retires from her position as Assistant Director of the Lake County Department of Family and Children, after serving more than 18 years in that position and 48 years in service to the residents of Lake County. Her presence in the discipline of social services will not be easily replaced. Throughout her life, Mrs. White has helped many of the less fortunate in her community overcome their difficult circumstances.  In addition to her career in public service, Mrs. White has also been involved with numerous community organizations. She is a member of Grace United Methodist Church, as well as such noble organizations as the American Red Cross and the National Council of Negro Women, among many others. Mrs. White's commitment to her community has consistently earned the praise of her peers. She has been named ``Woman of the Year'' three times by the Gary Business and Professional Women Organization and has received numerous other awards of achievement throughout her exceptional career.  Amidst the celebration of her career, there is sadness that the services of such a great woman will be unable to be matched in the future of the Department of Family and Social Services. Not only does Mrs. White diligently work to provide for the needs of her community, but she also cares about the vital issues that she encounters on a daily basis. This combination of commitment and compassion distinguishes Mrs. White from her stellar colleagues, and the people of Lake County are fortunate to have such a devoted individual working on their behalf. Her services to the Lake County Division of Family and Social Services will be sorely missed.  But, Mr. Speaker, I am confident that Mrs. White will continue to serve her community for many years to come. It cannot be disputed that Mrs. White has improved the lives of countless people. This is the mark of a true public servant.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that you and all of my colleagues will join with me in congratulating Mrs. Alma White for her 48 years of distinguished service and wish her a happy and healthy retirement. Although she may be retiring from the Division of Family and Children, the residents of Lake County will continue to reap the rewards of her benevolent spirit.                          ____________________
