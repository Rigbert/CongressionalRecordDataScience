 I would respectfully note that so much of what he talked about was resolutions. I think resolutions clearly do state an opinion. Whether or not they have any ultimate effect is to be seen.  I think the American public, in looking at the agenda the gentleman has just gone through, probably says tothemselves, Well, we don't see the jobs in that agenda. We do see the agenda in that agenda. We do see the politics in that agenda. In any event, I am pleased, as I said at the outset, that we do have a jobs bill that I think will have an impact coming to the floor this coming week, the patent reform bill, which I think is essential.  As it relates to the precluding of America's defaulting on the obligations it has incurred, I appreciate what the gentleman has to say, but, of course, the rating agencies, three agencies now, which have said we stand at risk of losing our AAA rating, which America has always had, does not distinguish between how we get to where we have a vote of approval on allowing America to pay its bills.                              {time}  1420  I, too, like the gentleman from Virginia, want to reach an agreement on the reduction of the deficit and the substantial reduction of the debt. The gentleman indicates he wants to cut spending by trillions. However, as we all know--and I've repeated--the gentleman voted for a rules package the first day of this session which provides for $4.8 trillion in additional deficit without paying for it. That is the continuation of taxes while not cutting the spending by that amount.  You precluded our continuing to provide for statutory PAYGO applying to revenues as well as expenditures. Both obviously have an impact on the deficit that we incur. We incurred substantial expense during the Bush administration, as you know, some almost $3.5 trillion of deficit spending, or $2.5 trillion depending upon where you count some of the expenditures; but in any event, it's a minimum of $2.5 trillion which we didn't pay for, and we therefore increased the debt by 86 percent in those 8 years of the Bush administration.  Both of us agree that we have to abandon policies of buying things without paying for them and of spending beyond our means. I would hope that we could join together in accomplishing that objective. Literally, we have less than 21 days of legislative time remaining before August 2, whether or not we can reach agreement, and I hope we can reach agreement. Surely, I would hope the gentleman would agree that allowing America to default on its bills is not an acceptable alternative even if we can't get to agreement. We want to get to agreement. I want to work with the gentleman to get to agreement, but allowing America to default on its bills should not be an option.
