 President, I rise today to express my support for the Miscellaneous Tariff bill, in particular a provision granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations to Armenia.  Armenia is a critical U.S. ally in the Caucus region and PNTR will significantly strengthen bilateral relations and spur economic growth and prosperity in Armenia. It allows Armenian products continued access to the U.S. market at low tariff rates and will go a long ways towards offsetting the impact of Turkish and Azeri blockades that cost Armenia as much as $720 million annually.  Simply put, this means jobs and rising living standards for Armenians who want to stay in their country and create a better tomorrow for their children. Armenians have worked so hard to overcome the horrors of the past to build a country based on values Americans and Armenians both share: freedom, democracy, open markets, respect for human rights and the rule of law. We should stand behind those efforts.  I am proud to represent over a half million Armenian Americans in California. They are a strong, vibrant community who have enriched the culture of our State and participated in every aspect of its civic life.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting PNTR for Armenia.                          ____________________
