 President, I use morning business as a forum to discuss some of the issues that are going to be coming up tonight and tomorrow morning before we vote on the tax bill conference, the jobs bill, the growth package--whatever you want to call it. I take my opportunity to speak to the conference report that was agreed to this afternoon.  There has been a great deal of hard work that has taken place in the last few days to bring the reconciliation conference agreement to completion. I thank all of my colleagues and the House for their hard work and their cooperation in meeting our goal of getting a jobs and growth bill to the President by this Memorial Day recess.  We all agree the economy needs a shot in the arm. Although our economy is growing, it is not growing fast enough to create jobs. The difference is it has been growing for about a year and a half at 2 percent, roughly. We do not create jobs at 2 percent even though the economy is growing. It takes growth of about 3 to 3.5 percent to create jobs. We believe this bill will bring about the proper growth.  Some estimates, some versions of the growth package, although not necessarily this compromise before the Senate, is that it will create 1.4 million new jobs. A major cause of the sluggish economy is the bursting of the stock market bubble created in the 1990s. This bill will address the ailing stock market. It will help create jobs. It will grow the economy. It will put money back into the hands of families, consumers, investors, and businesses that will help fuel our economic engines that create those jobs that we hope will be created from this legislation.  It is often said that various bills before the Congress might be historic in nature, and I don't want to overplay this one, but I do want to use the term about this being an historic agreement in this sense: It will amount to the third largest tax cut in history. President Bush should be highly praised for initiating two out of the last three largest tax relief packages passed by the Congress in that period of time.  The packages before the Senate abide by the budget agreement of the Senate side limiting the overall number to $350 billion. It includes the speeding up of all rate reductions, as well as the House's innovative version of the President's dividend proposal that will not only reduce dividend tax but also reduce the capital gains rate, as well.  Capital gains and dividends will be taxed when this bill becomes law at 15 percent and 5 percent depending upon the level of income. The 5 percent eventually will be phased down to reach zero level of taxation in the year 2008.  This happens to be the lowest level of capital gains tax since 1934. Dividends will also be taxed at historic lows, and those figures would be the same rates of taxation as apply to capital gains.  We also included in this package an expenditure of $20 billion in aid to States that was in the Senate bill, which I know my fellow Senate colleagues, including Senator Rockefeller, who was a conferee, will appreciate.  In addition, the bill includes further child tax credit and marriage penalty relief. Some may argue that we did not do enough regarding the two problems. This bill will greatly improve current law. If Senators vote for this measure, they are voting to put approximately an extra $1,000 in the pockets of a family of four if that family has two children. They are going to do this for the next couple of years compared to current law. That is going to be retroactive to January 1 of this year, and it would presume a rebate of $400 per child back to any family who reported children on their income tax. That check should be in the mail later this summer or very early in the fall. So a family with two children would get an $800 rebate check from the Federal Treasury later this year.  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I certainly intend to continue and enhance improvements in marriage penalty and child tax credit in the coming years. In other words, we should get to that goal of continuingthe $1,000 credit as permanent legislation, not as temporary legislation. We should resume our goal of eliminating the paper right now rather than down the road a few years when it is slated to be phased out.  I happen to be very disappointed about an aspect of the conference report I and a lot of other people from rural States worked on, to bring some equity in Medicare reimbursement to our respective rural States. My amendment had 86 votes in the Senate. We addressed the Medicare rural equity. This is what was not included in the final agreement.  Here is where the House comes from. They did not have a similar provision in their bill. They argued in the other body that this tax relief bill and the Medicare issues should be addressed in the Medicare legislation coming up for consideration in just 2 weeks. What I heard was this is a tax bill, not a Medicare bill, and why can't this wait an additional 2 weeks and take it up in an environment very closely related to the subject of Medicare reimbursement and not isolate it in a tax bill.  My answer to that is, I know this bill before the Senate will be signed by the President. I hope later on this summer or early fall we have a Medicare prescription drug bill for the President to sign. But, obviously, I am not as sure of that as I am of this bill going to the President. There are obviously a lot of things about the reimbursement of Medicare for our health care providers in rural America that are very unequal to that of urban areas.  On this very issue of Medicare rural equity, President Bush weighed in strongly supporting my efforts in the context of the Medicare bill, and this is a continuation of things that he spoke about at two or three different events over a period of months in Iowa just in the last year. It is a continuation of discussions I have had with the President on this very same subject during the month of December, last year, and the month of April, this year, when I had very private meetings with the President on the subject of Medicare.  Given the President's strong endorsement of my proposal, and the strong support in the Congress evidenced by the 86 votes in the Senate, and the fact we will be considering Medicare very soon, and also Chairman Thomas's willingness to consider these issues, I am encouraged we will succeed before the end of summer.  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the President's letter in the Record, wherein the President speaks about support for my efforts.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  The White House,                                         Washington, May 22, 2003.     Senator Charles Grassley,     Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley, I want to congratulate you on      Senate passage of the jobs and growth bill, and also on the      passage of your amendment to that bill which increased      federal assistance to rural providers through the Medicare      program.       When we met in the Oval Office in early April, we discussed      our concerns that rural Medicare providers need additional      help, and we committed to addressing their problems. We      agreed on the need to address issues faced by rural      hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies,      and physicians.       You demonstrated your commitment by passing your amendment      last week with tremendous bipartisan support, and by pushing      hard for it in the conference negotiations on the jobs and      growth bill.       I will support the increased Medicare funding for rural      providers contained in your amendment as a part of a bill      that implements our shared goal for Medicare reform.           Sincerely,                                                      George W. Bush.
