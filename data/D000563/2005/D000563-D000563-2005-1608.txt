(g) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be      construed to require a carrier that is participating in the      program under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, to      provide health benefits plan coverage under this Act.     SEC. 4. CONTRACT REQUIREMENT.       (a) In General.--The Office may enter into contracts with      qualified carriers offering health benefits plans of the type      described in section 8903 or 8903a of title 5, United States      Code, without regard to section 5 of title 41, United States      Code, or other statutes requiring competitive bidding, to      provide health insurance coverage to employees of      participating employers under this Act. Each contract shall      be for a uniform term of at least 1 year, but may be made      automatically renewable from term to term in the absence of      notice of termination by either party. In entering into such      contracts, the Office shall ensure that health benefits      coverage is provided for individuals only, married      individuals without children, and families.       (b) Eligibility.--A carrier shall be eligible to enter into      a contract under subsection (a) if such carrier--       (1) is licensed to offer health benefits plan coverage in      each State in which the plan is offered; and       (2) meets such other requirements as determined appropriate      by the Office.       (c) Statement of Benefits.--       (1) In general.--Each contract under this Act shall contain      a detailed statement of benefits offered and shall include      information concerning such maximums, limitations,      exclusions, and other definitions of benefits as the Office      considers necessary or desirable.       (2) Nationwide plan.--The Office shall develop a benefit      package that shall be offered in the case of a contract for a      health benefit plan that is to be offered on a nationwide      basis.       (d) Standards.--The minimum standards prescribed for health      benefits plans under section 8902(e) of title 5, United      States Code, and for carriers offering plans, shall apply to      plans and carriers under this Act. Approval of a plan may be      withdrawn by the Office only after notice and opportunity for      hearing to the carrier concerned without regard to subchapter      II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.       (e) Conversion.--       (1) In general.--A contract may not be made or a plan      approved under this section if the carrier under such      contract or plan does not offer to each enrollee whose      enrollment in the plan is ended, except by a cancellation of      enrollment, a temporary extension of coverage during which      the individual may exercise the option to convert, without      evidence of good health, to a nongroup contract providing      health benefits. An enrollee who exercises this option shall      pay the full periodic charges of the nongroup contract.       (2) Noncancellable.--The benefits and coverage made      available under paragraph (1) may not be canceled by the      carrier except for fraud, over-insurance, or nonpayment of      periodic charges.       (f) Rates.--Rates charged under health benefits plans under      this Act shall reasonably and equitably reflect the cost of      the benefits provided. Such rates shall be determined on a      basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent      with the lowest schedule of basic rates generally charged for      new group health benefits plans issued to large employers.      The rates determined for the first contract term shall be      continued for later contract terms, except that they may be      readjusted for any later term, based on past experience and      benefit adjustments under the later contract. Any      readjustment in rates shall be made in advance of the      contract term in which they will apply and on a basis which,      in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the general      practice of carriers which issue group health benefits plans      to large employers. Rates charged for coverage under this Act      shall not vary based on health-status related factors.       (g) Requirement of Payment for or Provision of Health      Service.--Each contract entered into under this Act shall      require the carrier to agree to pay for or provide a health      service or supply in an individual case if the Office finds      that the employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse,      or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of      title 5, United States Code, is entitled thereto under the      terms of the contract.     SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY.

(b) Preexisting Condition Exclusions.--       (1) In general.--Each contract under this Act may include a      preexisting condition exclusion as defined under section      9801(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.       (2) Exclusion period.--       (A) In general.--A preexisting condition exclusion under      this subsection shall provide for coverage of a preexisting      condition to begin not later than 6 months after the date on      which the coverage of the individual under a health benefits      plan commences, reduced by 1 month for each month that the      individual was covered under a health insurance plan      immediately preceding the date the individual submitted an      application for coverage under this Act.       (B) Lapse in coverage.--For purposes of this paragraph, a      lapse in coverage of not more than 63 days immediately      preceding the date of the submission of an application for      coverage under this Act shall not be considered a lapse in      continuous coverage.       (c) Rates and Premiums.--       (1) In general.--Rates charged and premiums paid for a      health benefits plan under this Act--       (A) shall be determined in accordance with this subsection;       (B) may be annually adjusted and differ from such rates      charged and premiums paid for the same health benefits plan      offered under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code;       (C) shall be negotiated in the same manner as rates and      premiums are negotiated under such chapter 89; and       (D) shall be adjusted to cover the administrative costs of      the Office under this Act.       (2) Determinations.--In determining rates and premiums      under this Act, the following provisions shall apply:       (A) In general.--A carrier that enters into a contract      under this Act shall determine that amount of premiums to      assess for coverage under a health benefits plan based on an      community rate that may be annually adjusted--       (i) for the geographic area involved if the adjustment is      based on geographical divisions that are not smaller than a      metropolitan statistical area;       (ii) based on whether such coverage is for an individual, a      married individual with no children, or a family; and       (iii) based on the age of covered individuals (subject to      subparagraph (B)).       (B) Age adjustments.--       (i) In general.--With respect to subparagraph (A)(iii), in      making adjustments based on age, a carrier may not use age      brackets in increments that are smaller than 5 years, which      begin not earlier than age 30 and end not later than age 65.       (ii) Age 65 and older.--With respect to subparagraph      (A)(iii), a carrier may develop separate rates for covered      individuals who are 65 years of age or older for whom      medicare is the primary payor for health benefits coverage      which is not covered under medicare.       (iii) Limitation.--In making an adjustment to premium rates      under subparagraph (A)(iii), a carrier shall ensure that such      adjustment does not result in an average premium rate      applicable to enrollees under the plan involved that is more      than 200 percent of the lowest rate for all age groups.       (d) Termination and Reenrollment.--If an individual who is      enrolled in a health benefits plan under this Act terminates      the enrollment, the individual shall not be eligible for      reenrollment until the first open enrollment period following      the expiration of 6 months after the date of such      termination.       (e) Preemption.--       (1) Health insurance or plans.--       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),      the terms of any contract entered into under this Act that      relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or      benefits shall supersede and preempt any State or local law,      or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to the      nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits.       (B) Local plans.--With respect to a contract entered into      under this Act under which a carrier will offer health      benefits plan coverage in a limited geographic area,      subparagraph (A) shall not apply to the extent that a      mandated benefit law is in effect in the State in which the      plan is offered. Such mandated benefit law shall continue to      apply to such health benefits plan.       (C) Rating rules.--The rating requirements under subsection      (c)(2) shall supercede State rating rules for qualified plans      under this Act.
