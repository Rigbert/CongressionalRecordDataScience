President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Legal Times of August 1995 regarding Mr. Garland be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Legal Times, Aug. 7, 1995]                       Garland: A Centrist Choice                         (By Eva M. Rodriquez)       He was schooled at Harvard in administrative law by      moderate professor-turned-Justice Stephen Breyer, and took      his antitrust training from conservative Philip Areeda.       He earned his prosecutorial stripes under Jay Stephens, the      hard-charging Republican U.S. attorney in the District and      former deputy counsel to President Ronald Reagan. And he cut      his teeth in the private sector as a partner at Arnold &      Porter, one of the city's wealthiest and most influential      firms.       At first blush, Merrick Garland may seem like a solid-     judicial pick for a Republican president. But according to      two administration sources, the 42-year-old top aide to      Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick is almost certain to      be President Bill Clinton's third nominee to be the      prestigious U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.       Although Garland has his share of liberal credentials--     including a coveted clerkship with retired Supreme Court      Justice William Brennan Jr.--he is almost sure to be a much      more middle-of-the-road jurist than the man he would replace,      former Chief Judge Abner Mikva, who retired from the D.C.      Circuit last fall to take the job of White House counsel.       News of Garland's near-lock on the nomination has left a      smattering of liberals privately grumbling that he is too      conservative. But his nonideological approach and his easy      rapport with both liberals and conservatives has earned      Garland high praise from people on both sides of the aisle.       ``I think he is a very talented lawyer,'' says Garland's      former boss Stephens, now a partner at the D.C. office of San      Francisco's Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro. ``He's bright,      energetic, and he has a very balanced demeanor.''       Garland's current boss also lauds him. ``He has enormous      personal and intellectual integrity, impeccable legal      credentials, a breadth of experience in both public and      private sectors, and the personality and demeanor that you'd      expect in a judge,'' says Gorelick, who acknowledges that she      is a strong backer of Garland's but declines to discuss      whether he is definitely the administration's nominee. ``He      is very thoughtful, is good at listening to all points of      view, and makes decisions on the merits.'' Attorney General      Janet Reno also thinks highly of Garland, Gorelick says.       The widespread praise Garland garnered for his thorough and      evenhanded leadership during the critical initial      investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing also hasn't hurt      his chances for a nomination to the federal bench.       A Republican staffer on the Senate Judiciary Committee      declines to discuss Garland's chances for confirmation, other      than to say that the committee has received no opposition in      anticipation of a Garland nomination.       Garland, a 1977 magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law      School who clerked for famed 2nd Circuit Judge Henry Friendly      in addition to Brennan, declines comment. Mikva was out of      town and could not be reached for comment.       Garland's reputation as a nonideological thinker may have      helped him win the nomination over Peter Edelman, who last      fall was reportedly the White House's top pick for the D.C.      Circuit vacancy. Edelman, who is currently counselor to      Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, was a      favorite of the more liberal ranks in the Democratic Party,      but he immediately drew opposition from conservatives--     including Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee, who believed Edelman to be too radical      and too activist in his approach to the law. Opposition to      Edelman only intensified after the GOP's sweeping victory in      last fall's midterm election.       Edelman, according to two lawyers involved in the judicial-     selections process, is likely to be nominated for one of the      two vacancies on the U.S. District Court here. But D.C. Del.      Eleanor Holmes Norton, whose judicial nominating commission      has forwarded names to Clinton for previous D.C. federal      court vacancies, may have candidates of her own. The      commission will accept applications for the two vacancies      until August 11.       The two sources say Clinton is likely to nominate Garland      before Congress breaks for the August recess. The two sources      also say that the president may decide to submit a package of      D.C. nominees, including one for the appeals court vacancy      and another for one of the two open seats on the District      Court. One trial court vacancy was created in June when Judge      Joyce Hens Green took senior status; the other came open when      Judge Harold Greene followed suit earlier this month.       Others mentioned as possible contenders for a District      Court seat include Brooksley Born, a partner at D.C.'s Arnold      & Porter who is said to have very strong support among      women's groups, and U.S. Attorney Eric Holder, Jr., who is a      former D.C. Superior Court judge and at one time was      mentioned as a possible appeals court nominee.
