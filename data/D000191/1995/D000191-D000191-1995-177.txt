As a western Member, I have a real concern giving authority over State water in the Western States to a bunch of nameless, faceless bureaucrats in Washington, DC, even if they are appointed by an ostensibly Democrat President and Administration.  Really, it is not something I am particularly interested in granting to this agency, and this amendment seems to do so, and I am not interested in doing that. I am trying to understand this. The staff is furiously reading through it. If we could ask for an additional extension of time, I would appreciate the Chair doing so.
