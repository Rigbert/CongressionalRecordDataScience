Speaker, I rise to honor the legacy of an extraordinary Marylander, Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer. He died just a few weeks ago after a long time of public service.  William Donald Schaefer was one of the great American mayors. Few mayors can ever say that they transformed a city as thoroughly as did William Donald Schaefer transform Baltimore.  But over his 16-year tenure as mayor of Baltimore, he led a dramatic andhistoric turnaround. In 1971, when his mayoralty started, Baltimore was a struggling city, a city plagued by population flight, crime, and decaying urban infrastructure. When so many had given up on Baltimore, Mayor Schaefer made it his mission to stand up to that decay. And we can still see his legacy today. It is a legacy that includes physical landmarks like Camden Yards, the National Aquarium, Baltimore's Harbor Place, and an outstanding light rail system, projects that he saw through to completion as both mayor and Governor of our state.  Just as importantly, Mayor Schaefer's legacy came in thousands of gestures that showed just how deeply he cared about the people he represented and how seriously he took his work: Personally addressing illegal dumping in alleys or broken equipment at parks, driving through the city at night on the lookout for everything from potholes to crime trouble spots, and even jumping into the aquarium's seal pool, complete with a rubber ducky, when the city failed to complete the aquarium on time.  My colleague from Oregon is shaking his head because we all know that famous picture.  Above all, his colorful, passionate, and dedicated leadership added up to the change, not just in Baltimore's appearance and infrastructure, but in the mindset of the words of the Baltimore Sun when they said he ``changed the way the city felt about itself.''  How important leaders are to make that happen in the minds of their people. We have an agenda, by the way, that is Make It In America, that is trying to change that psychology as well, that we're going to make it, we're going to succeed, we're going to expand.  William Donald Schaefer brought that same dedication to his two terms as Maryland Governor. His trademark, no-nonsense style--``do it now'' was his byword--was on display in Annapolis, where he pursued an agenda focused on job creation, strengthening Maryland's schools, which, by the way, now rank number one in the country, and protecting Maryland's natural heritage, including our beloved Chesapeake Bay.  After reaching the highest point in Maryland politics, many would have ridden off into the sunset. But not William Donald Schaefer. He couldn't get enough of the work he loved, and he ran for State Comptroller, and won twice. In his last job he was one of our State's most respected voices for fiscal responsibility.  Before he died, Governor Schaefer was asked how he'd like to be remembered, and he answered, ``There are two words: `He cared.' People,'' he said, ``mock me and make fun of it. But it's the truth.''  And as someone who worked closely with William Donald Schaefer throughout his years as mayor and Governor and comptroller, I can say, without any hesitation or fear of contradiction, William Donald Schaefer cared. He was a man of the people. He listened, he acted.  It is the truth and it mattered because, at the time when so many wrote off our cities, caring took remarkable courage and strength.  A great architect, Mr. Speaker, was once laid to rest in a building he himself had designed. His tombstone read, and I quote, ``If you seek his monument, look around you.'' Those words apply just as well to William Donald Schaefer, and I hope that the people he served will bear him in mind whenever they enjoy the best of the city of Baltimore and the best of the State of Maryland.  Well done, our good and faithful servant.                          ____________________
