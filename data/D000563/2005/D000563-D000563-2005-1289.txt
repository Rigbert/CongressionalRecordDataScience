 Senator Obama and I have a public meeting every Thursday morning, and there was a real sad situation today. A group of parents brought in children with autism to talk about that terrible illness and the challenges they face. More and more of that illness, and others, are being linked to mercury. Whether it is in a vaccine, I do not know; whether it is in the air, most certainly it is. If we can reduce emissions by reducing the amount of fuel that we burn, would my colleagues not believe we would be a healthier nation? Maybe there would be fewer asthma victims. Maybe some of these poor kids who are afflicted with respiratory problems would be spared from them.  I cannot believe people can rationally stand on the Senate floor and say what we need is to give Americans a choice of driving a car that burns gasoline and gets 6 miles per gallon; boy, that is the American way. Well, that is selfish. It really is. We ought to be looking at national goals that bring us, as an American family, together to do the responsible thing.
