 President, today I wish to introduce the America's Cup Act of 2011. This legislation will enable foreign ships to compete for the 34th America's Cup, scheduled to begin in November.  I am happy to be joined by Senators Barbara Boxer, Jack Reed, and Sheldon Whitehouse as original cosponsors.  The America's Cup is one of the oldest global sporting competitions. Its economic impact is surpassed only by the Olympics and the World Cup of soccer.  The event will begin in San Diego on November 12th. Next year the events continue in Italy and Newport, Rhode Island, and they conclude in San Francisco in September 2013.  But the events in San Diego, Newport and San Francisco cannot take place unless we waive certain laws that prohibit foreign vessels from operating in U.S. waters.  My legislation waives the Jones Act and the Passenger Vessel Services Act for all vessels participating in or supporting the America's Cup events.  However, this waiver is limited and narrow. It was carefully crafted to protect our domestic industry and passenger service operators. The legislation specifically states that the authority to operate in U.S. waters is strictly limited to activities that occur during and related to America's Cup Events.  The vessels are prohibited from transporting more than 25 individuals or from receiving compensation for transportation.  The vessels are prohibited from transporting merchandise between ports.  I understand that Jones Act waivers can be sensitive subjects for many, but I want to assure my colleagues that this is a noncontroversial bill.  The waiver is widely supported by local governments and business groups in California and Rhode Island.  Equally important, it is not opposed by the American Maritime Partnership, AMP. Like many of us, the AMP's neutrality was critical to me before I decided to pursue this legislation.  As many of my colleagues know, the American Maritime Partnership, formerly called the American Cabotage Task Force, is the voice of the U.S. domestic maritime industry. The group represents more than 450 member organizations ranging from vessel owners and shipboard unions to shipbuilders and equipment manufacturers.  These diverse interests recognize the importance of a strong domestic maritime industry and share my belief that the continued success of this industry is critical for America's economic security and independence.  Needless to say, Jones Act waivers are not an issue the AMP takes lightly, so I thank them for their willingness to work with me to bring this great event back to the United States.  The reason the American Maritime Partnership and so many other organizations support this legislation is that it will create jobs and stimulate the economy.  As I mentioned, the first event in the America's Cup World Series will occur in San Diego. This event alone is expected to bring $20 million to local businesses.  When the larger America's Cup Finals take place in San Francisco, the economic impacts are expected to be far greater. According to a recent study by Beacon Economics and the Bay Area Council the increase in economic activity in San Francisco could be nearly $1.4 billion. This is three times the estimated impact of hosting a Super Bowl, $300-$500 million.  The event could create as many as 8,840 jobs in San Francisco.  Local Governments could generate an additional $85 million in revenue.  Nationwide, the event is expected to increase domestic economic activity by $1.9 billion and create 11,978 jobs.  The economic impacts of these events are significant.  The waiver is widely supported by labor, business and members of both parties.  This is straightforward, common sense legislation that will facilitate international participation in a globally recognized sporting event.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1759       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
