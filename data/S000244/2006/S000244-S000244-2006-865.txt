Speaker, 16 years ago, a bipartisan Congress took significant steps to break down the physical and societal barriers that for far too long kept disabled Americans from fully participating in all aspects of American life. Prior to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, commonly known as the ADA, disabled Americans were subjected to false stereotypes, experienced discrimination in almost all aspects of society, and were relegated to a form of second class citizenship.  The ADA changed this by restoring the full meaning of equal protection under the law and all the promises that our Nation has to offer. Through the ADA and its broad protections from discrimination in employment, State and local government programs and services, places of public accommodation and services provided by private entities, transportation, and telecommunication services, disabled citizens have experienced increased opportunities, higher graduation rates, higher employment rates and lower rates of poverty. Because of this landmark civil rights law, disabled American citizens no longer live in isolation but live as independent, self sufficient members of our communities.  However, beginning in 1999, through a trilogy of cases beginning with Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., the Supreme Court has slowly chipped away at the broad protections of the ADA and has created a new set of barriers for disabled Americans. An oversight hearing held by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution revealed that certain decisions of the Supreme Court have actually worked to exclude millions of disabled Americans from the ADA's protections, the very citizens that Congress expressly sought to include within the scope of the Act in 1990.  The impact of these decisions is such that disabled Americans can be discriminated against by their employers because of their conditions, but they are not considered disabled enough by our Federal courts to invoke the protections of the ADA. This is unacceptable.  The bipartisan legislation that I am introducing today will enable disabled Americans utilizing the ADA to focus on the discrimination that they have experienced rather than having to first prove that they fall within the scope of the ADA's protection. With this bill, the ADA's ``clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination on the basis of disability'' will be properly restored and the ADA can rightfully reclaim its place among our Nation's civil rights laws.                          ____________________
