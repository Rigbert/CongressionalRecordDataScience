Speaker, I learned this week of the passing of Alija Izetbegovic, formerly the President of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As a former Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I knew President Izetbegovic and followed the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina closely and with great concern.  Under Izetbegovic's early leadership in 1990 and 1991, Bosnia-Herzegovina sought to cope with the disintegration of the former Yugoslav federation of which it was a part, a particularly difficult task given the republic's very multi-ethnic population which had benefitted greatly under that federation. Eventually, Izetbegovic led Bosnia-Herzegovina to respond by asserting independent statehood in early 1992, an act used immediately as a pretext by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic in neighboring Serbia to wage a war of aggression and genocide. Seeing the international community take little action to stop well-armed Serb militants from seizing more than two-thirds of the country, the regime of Franjo Tudjman in Croatia, another neighbor, later joined the fray. In the next three years, the ethnic cleansing associated with this conflict would cause the forced displacement of millions, the death of hundreds of thousands and the rape or torture of tens of thousands of innocent people.  By 1995, the international community was essentially shamed into taking more decisive action by atrocities like that which occurred in Srebrenica and fresh attacks on civilians in Sarajevo. The international community also recognized that not doing so had definite implications for the future of post-Cold War Europe. The result was NATO intervention and the negotiation of the Dayton Agreement, which preserved Bosnia territorial integrity on the one hand but hampered its recovery and development by legitimizing internal division on the other. Alija Izetbegovic, ethnically a ``Bosniak'' or Muslim Slav, retained power, but shared the presidency in a new arrangement with Bosnian Serb and Croat counterparts.  Given these circumstances, it is difficult to assess Izetbegovic's legacy. As a dissenter in Tito's Yugoslavia and as a politician during the emergence of multi-party politics, Izetbegovic expressed devoutness to the Islamic faith and pride in Bosnia's Muslim heritage. The conflict, however, denied Izetbegovic the chance to prove his claimed desire to respect the religious beliefs of others, to embrace Bosnia'scultural diversity and to become part of Europe. While Sarajevo was under siege, he correctly asserted that international principles of tolerance and respect were as threatened as that city's population. As the feckless United Nations and Europe failed to stop the conflict quickly, Izetbegovic's Bosnia became increasingly vulnerable to militant Islamic infiltration as well as corruption, both of which plague the country to this day.  From his hospital bed in late September, however, Alija Izetbegovic was quoted as saying to the media that Bosnia will survive as a state if ``Serbs stay Serbs, Croats stay Croats, and [Muslims]stay [Muslims], but they also should all be Bosnians . . . Nobody should seek revenge but rather justice, because revenge starts a chain of evil that has no end,'' adding that people ``should not forget the past but not live in it. They should turn toward the future.''  As I note the passing of Alija Izetbegovic, Mr. Speaker, and we express our condolences to his family, friends and supporters, we should also recall with equal sadness the troubled times he and the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina faced a decade ago.                          ____________________
