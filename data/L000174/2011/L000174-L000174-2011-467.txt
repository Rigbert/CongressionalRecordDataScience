 billion for global health programs, which is $633 million below the request and $884 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. These funds support programs to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, polio and neglected tropical diseases, and to support voluntary family planning and reproductive health.  The total to combat HIV/AIDS is $5.35 billion through the Department of State, which is $145 million below the request and $509 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. H.R. 1 would deny life-saving HIV/AIDS drugs to some 400,000 people. I wonder how many House Members even know that.  The Senate CR provides $750 million for the Global HIV/AIDS fund, which is equal to fiscal year 2010 and $150 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. At the House level, approximately 3.7 million people would not be tested for HIV, more than 10 million mosquito nets for malaria would not be provided, and 372,000 testing and treatments for tuberculosis would be halted. Malaria, which is preventable and curable, is a leading killer of African children.  The Senate CR provides $879 million for international disaster assistance, which is $449 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. These funds support aid to people displaced by war, famineand natural disasters, such as the earthquake in Haiti and floods in Pakistan. The House would decimate our ability to respond to those catastrophes. That is not the America I know.  Likewise, the Senate CR provides $1.68 billion for refugee assistance, which is equal to fiscal year 2010 and $662 million above the amount provided in H.R. 1. At a time when the number of refugees and other displaced persons in the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan is skyrocketing, and protracted refugee crises exist from Burma to Iraq, the House would turn its back on these people.  There are many other examples. The point should be lost on no one. The House CR would cause lasting, unprecedented damage to our global leadership and our security, and cost thousands of American jobs, at the same time that it would have no appreciable impact on the deficit.  The amounts in the House CR or the Senate CR represent only 1 percent of the Federal budget, but it is a critical investment in our security that the House treats as a luxury we can do without. I challenge them to find a single current or former President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, National Security Advisor, or, frankly, anyone with expertise in this area--Republican or Democrat--who would agree with that shortsighted, dangerous view.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2011]                      Peace-Building That Pays Off                         (By Anthony C. Zinni)       Williamsburg, Va.--In voting last month to eliminate      financing for the United States Institute of Peace, members      of the House of Representatives did not do their research.      You will find the institute's competent work behind      practically every American success in Iraq and Afghanistan.      It has undertaken missions from the Balkans and Sudan to the      Philippines and Somalia, where I supported the institute's      efforts to mediate conflicts, promote the rule of law and      encourage democracy.       This week, as the Senate considers alternatives to the      House budget bill, we should remember that the stakes for      national security and peace-building are high. The institute      was created in 1984, when the cold war was still at its      height. Congressional leaders guided by Senator Spark M.      Matsunaga, a Hawaii Democrat, saw the need for an institution      that would strengthen the nation's ability to limit      international violence and manage global conflict. President      Ronald Reagan signed the act creating the institute. A      bipartisan majority of Congress has supported it since--until      now.       The Institute of Peace is like the Marine Corps or special      forces for foreign affairs and peace building. When others      are fleeing conflict around the world, you'll usually find      institute staff members going in. They were working in      Afghanistan before 9/11 and were among the first nonmilitary      personnel on the ground after the invasion of Iraq in 2003.      The institute's headquarters in Baghdad has twice been      damaged by rocket and mortar attacks. At the height of the      Iraq insurgency, when virtually every other American and      international group pulled out their personnel, the State and      Defense Departments requested that the institute stay. Under      fire regularly, it was the only United States organization      outside of those departments that did not flee Baghdad.       But the institute's value goes beyond the bravery and      commitment of its staff. In 2007, when the Army's loth      Mountain Division arrived in Mahmudiya, a city of half a      million in the ``triangle of death'' dominated by Al Qaeda      south of Baghdad, officers asked the institute to mediate      between Shiite civil authorities and the Sunni sheiks who      controlled the area. Institute-trained negotiators convened      warring Iraqis to consolidate security, restore services,      develop the local economy, enhance local governance and      improve the rule of law. Gen. David H. Petraeus called it a      turning point in the war.       In the six months before the institute's intervention,      there had been 93 attacks on American forces in the area with      homemade bombs; in the six months after, just one. Mahmudiya      became a cornerstone of peace in the district, allowing the      Army to reduce its strength from a brigade combat team of      3,500 soldiers to a battalion of 650, with corresponding      savings and reductions in casualties.       In Afghanistan, the institute conducts mediations on issues      from refugees to property and water disputes. In the last      year, these operations have resolved 18 tribal disputes      throughout the country, mostly involving the abuse of women,      and included 30 training programs for government officials,      lawyers, mullahs, tribal councils and community leaders. The      network is even supporting dialogue along the Afghanistan-     Pakistan border, the earth's most dangerous frontier--home to      Taliban and Qaeda attacks and a wellspring of religious and      political extremism.       Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does      more with less. The institute's entire budget would not pay      for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of      a fighter plane, and wouldn't sustain even 40 American troops      in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building      is financed as part of national security programs, and is      recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense      spending and diplomacy. The institute's share of the proposed      international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less      than one-tenth of 1 percent of the State Department's budget,      and one-hundredth of 1 percent of the Pentagon's.       The idea that eliminating the United States Institute of      Peace would benefit taxpayers is extremely shortsighted and      ill informed. America deserves better from Congress than      eliminating something that saves American lives and taxpayer      dollars.
