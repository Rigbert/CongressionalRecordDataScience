President, I was happy to yield to the Senator from Colorado. He and I have had discussions of the terrible events that took place in Colorado. The distinguished Senator from Colorado and I wrote legislation on another area of law enforcement, relying on his experience and my experience in law enforcement. That was the bulletproof vests legislation which is now working very, very well.  I mention this while the distinguished Senator from Colorado is still on the floor because we have had many discussions about law enforcement matters--most recently an event at the White House. It has been my experience, time and time again, the Senator from Colorado has given pragmatic and realistic solutions to law enforcement problems at a time when we can all get carried away by philosophical arguments. I found most law enforcement people tell me to save the philosophy for them to read in their retirement years--give them the pragmatic solutions today when they have to uphold the law.  So I thank the Senator from Colorado.                                 ______                                       By
