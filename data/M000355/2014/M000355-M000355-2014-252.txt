 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an accomplished educator from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dr. Frank Cheatham is the senior vice president for academic affairs and professor of math and computer science at Campbellsville University. His impending retirement in December will conclude a career of over 40 years devoted to Christian higher education. Campbellsville University is an acclaimed university in central Kentucky with more than 3,600 students that prepares them as Christian servant leaders for life-long learning, continued scholarship, and active participation in a diverse, global society.  No more than 20 miles of country road separates Frank's birthplace of Merrimac, KY, from the campus on which he has spent the majority of his life as both a student and a professor. Dr. Cheatham was born on February 3, 1943, to Gladys and the late Jeff Cheatham. Of his eight siblings, four went on to become teachers, including his brother, Don, who also teaches at Campbellsville.  Dr. Cheatham wields an impressive arsenal of post-secondary degrees. After completing his undergraduate studies at Campbellsville in 1965, he continued to earn a master of science from Tennessee Technological University, his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Kentucky, and a second master of science in computer science education from the University of Evansville.  Dr. Cheatham began his career teaching math and biology at Taylor County High School in 1965. He then served as a teaching assistant at Tennessee Tech and the University of Kentucky and as an assistant professor at Campbell College in North Carolina before landing at Campbellsville University in August of 1973. Ever since then, save for a single year of leave during which he taught at Western Kentucky University, Dr. Cheatham has taught math and computer science at Campbellsville. In 1999, he was offered and accepted the position of senior vice president for academic affairs. The university's president, Dr. Michael V. Carter, recalls that it was ``the very first decision I made after becoming president.''  Dr. Cheatham's excellence as an educator needs no validation aside from the many successes and accomplishments of his students. Nevertheless, he has been honored for his service at Campbellsville University time andtime again. He has twice been named Campbellsville/Taylor County Chamber of Commerce Educator of the Year, in 1992 and 2000. He was awarded the Sears-Roebuck Foundation Teaching Excellence and Campus Leadership Award in 1989 and the Campbellsville University Student Government Association Challenger Award a year later. In 1996, he received the Board of Advisors Academic Excellence Distinguished Professor award, and in 2002, he became a Campbellsville University Distinguished Alumnus.  Despite his tireless devotion to teaching, Dr. Cheatham has also found time to pursue his passions outside the classroom. Among his many extra-curricular pursuits, he led the discussion on bringing the internet to Campbellsville University in 1994, and served as president for the Consortium for Computing in Small Colleges. He also served as the national president of Sigma Zeta, the science and math honor society, and is on the board of directors at Taylor Regional Hospital.  Those who have crossed paths with Dr. Cheatham--whether as one of his students, as a colleague, as a fellow member of Frank's Campbellsville Baptist Church, or as a friend--know just how much he will be missed at Campbellsville University. His lifelong commitment to education and his devotion to bettering the lives of his students deserve the praise of this body.  Thus, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commending Dr. Cheatham for an exemplary career and wishing him nothing but the best as he enjoys retirement with his wife, Shirley, his daughter, Tammy, and his grandson--a junior at Campbellsville University--Drew.                          ____________________
