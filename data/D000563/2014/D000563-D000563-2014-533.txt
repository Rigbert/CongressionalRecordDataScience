President, I congratulate Jean Manning on her retirement from the Senate and thank her for her 21 years of dedicated service. Her wise counsel will be missed in the Senate. That is why the Senate recently passed S. Res. 391 designating Jean Manning as Chief Counsel for Employment Emeritus of the United States Senate.  Jean grew up in the heart of Chicago and received three degrees from the University of Illinois--a B.A., an M.B.A., and a J.D. While pursuing her law degree, Jean was a member and the articles editor of the University of Illinois Law Review and was awarded the Rickert Award for Excellence in Legal Writing. Not forgetting where she came from, today Jean remains very active at the University of Illinois, where she is a member of the University of Illinois Foundation and of the College of Law Board of Advisors, serving as president at one time.  In the early 1990s, Congress as a workplace underwent a sea change when all major employment laws became applicable. In 1993, following a nationwide search, Jean was tapped to establish and manage the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment. She and her staff helped guide Senate offices as these employment laws were implemented and has continued to assist our offices to this day. Jean has counseled Senate offices to ensure compliance with the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and many other laws. It was her responsibility to see that Senate offices understood and followed employment laws so that Senate employees have the rights and protections the laws provide.  To Jean's credit, the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employmenthas earned a stellar reputation throughout the Senate. Her office provides impartial and discreet legal advice, training, and representation to Senate committees, support services, and the 247 Senators who have served in this body since Jean's hiring. Jean and the attorneys under her supervision have resolved countless administrative matters within the Senate and have always been ready to assist with any question a Senate office may have on employment matters. Considering the Senate is comprised of some 150 offices--Member, committee, and support services--this is no small task.  Jean also has represented Senate offices at all levels of the Federal court system, including the U.S. Supreme Court. And since its inception 21 years ago, the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment has never lost a case.  I thank Jean for her exceptional service to the Senate. The Senate is losing a great legal advocate, educator and source of institutional knowledge. We will miss her, though I will be among the many who will gladly welcome her back when she returns to Illinois.                          ____________________
