President, I am delighted that the Senate has agreed to my amendment to restore funding for the United States Sentencing Commission. I am pleased that Senator Kennedy joined me as a cosponsor of this amendment in support of the Commission.  Our amendment to S. 1217 transfers $5 million from the Bureau of Prisons account to the U.S. Sentencing Commission account. As a result, the Commission will be funded at $9,743,000 for FY 2000 instead of the current level of only $4,743,000. This new funding is an increase of $300,000 compared to the Commission's FY 1999 appropriation of $9,487,000 but still substantially below the President's request of $10,800,000 for the Commission.  I understand the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee reduced funding for the Commission in part because of their frustration over the vacancy of all seven Commission members since October 31, 1998. I share that frustration, but I am happy to report that the President announced last month his intent to nominate seven highly-qualified individuals to serve as Members ofthe Commission--Judge Diana E. Murphy, Judge Ruben Castillo, Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr., Judge Joe Kendall, Professor Michael O'Neill, Judge William K. Sessions, III, and Mr. John R. Steer. I am proud to note that Judge Sessions is a Vermonter and dear friend.  The Senate should act promptly to consider and confirm the nominees to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This Commission has been struggling without a full slate of commissioners for more than a year. We should not only put the Sentencing Commission back into business but we should restore full funding so the Commission is able to fulfill its statutory mandate.  The Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill had significantly cut funding for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. In reducing funding for this important commission, the Appropriations Subcommittee stated in its report that ``the carriage of justice has continued unabated in the absence of commissioners.'' However, that is in direct contradiction to what the Chief Justice of the United States recently stated in his year-end report for the federal judiciary. He stated, ``the fact that no appointments have been made to fill any one of these seven vacancies is paralyzing a critical component of the federal criminal justice system.''  The Sentencing Commission is such a critical component of the federal criminal justice system because it establishes and maintains mandatory sentencing guidelines for over 51,000 criminal cases sentenced in the federal courts each year. The Commission's most critical responsibility today is to adjust the guidelines to implement the important crime legislation we enact every year. Let me emphasize this point: when we enact legislation that calls for increased criminal penalties, it is the Commission's job to make sure that convicted defendants suffer the impact. With no Commissioners since last year, the Commission has been unable to do this job, nor will it next year without new Commissioners and sufficient funding.  Let me give you a few examples of increased penalties we enacted that, to this day, have not caused even one convicted defendant to stay in jail even one more day. Last year, in the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act, we required increased penalties for heinous sex abuse against our nation's young. To date, not one sexual predator has been imprisoned for even one day longer. Why? Because the Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new commissioners and sufficient funding.  Last year, we also passed legislation that required increased penalties for fraudulent telemarketers who prey upon another vulnerable segment of our population, the elderly. Although the outgoing Commission did enact some temporary measures, they are scheduled to expire this Fall. If they do, fraudulent telemarketers, once again, will escape the intended consequences of our legislation. Why? Because the Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new Commissioners and sufficient funding.  Last Congress, we also passed legislation that required increased penalties for copyright and trademark offenses to protect affected industries from the rampant piracy that threatens job creation and continued economic growth. Once again, not one convicted offender has suffered any increased punishment. Why? Because the Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new Commissioners and sufficient funding.  So long as the Commission cannot do its job, convicted defendants will also escape the impact of criminal laws we have enacted to combat other serious crimes: methamphetamine trafficking, firearms, phone cloning, and identity theft, just to name a few.  Recently, the Senate approved the juvenile justice legislation, S. 254, that would require the Sentencing Commission to develop comprehensive guidelines for juvenile offenders, so that we can stem the rising tide of juvenile crime. How can the Commission accomplish this vital and historic undertaking without Commissioners and sufficient funding?  We face other unintended, and potentially very costly, consequences of not getting the Commission fully operational soon. I understand that defendants across the country are beginning to mount challenges to the legality of the guidelines in the absence of Commissioners. Regardless of the merits, one can only imagine the paralyzing effects on the criminal justice system if 51,000 defendants start raising this issue. There are better ways to spend limited judicial and prosecutorial resources in fighting crime and enforcing the law than in defending against these claims.  Even in the absence of Commissioners, we should ensure that the Commission is fully funded so that the staff of the Commission may continue to perform its important work. The Commission has an ongoing statutory obligation to amend the sentencing guidelines as necessary to respond to enacted crime legislation, court decisions, and other developments coming to its attention. While the Commission cannot vote to promulgate amendments to the guidelines without commissioners, even in their absence it is essential that Commission staff systematically continue to prepare all supporting material necessary so that incoming commissioners may act to implement the will of Congress in short order.  Apart from the policy decision-making that only Commissioners may perform, the Commission has numerous routine statutory obligations on which Commission staff typically take the lead even when there is a complete slate of Commissioners. The Commission has an ongoing statutory obligation to receive--and federal judges have a corresponding statutory obligation to send--a report from the sentencing court with respect to every sentence imposed under the guidelines, to analyze and share the data in those reports, and use that data to improve the guideline system. Commission staff analyze and enter into our comprehensive database over 50,000 of such cases and extract more than 260 pieces of information from each case annually. Next year, more than 50,000 cases that contain valuable information regarding sentencing practices, offenders, and deterrence will go without analysis if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000.  The Commission also has an ongoing statutory obligation to serve as the lead instrumentality for training newly appointed judges and probation officers, as well as prosecuting and defense attorneys, regarding application of the sentencing guidelines and related sentencing issues. Similarly, the Commission has an ongoing responsibility to provide needed continuing education for all those who use the sentencing guidelines to ensure that they are sufficiently informed of recent amendments to the guidelines and significant court decisions. Commission staff served as lead trainers to more than 2,500 individuals at 47 training programs across the country in fiscal year 1998. Next year, this need for training will go unmet if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000.  The Commission also has an ongoing statutory obligation to serve as a clearinghouse of information on sentencing-related topics and to stay current on advancements in the knowledge of human behavior and the degree to which the guidelines are achieving the purposes of sentencing such as deterrence and rehabilitation. Ongoing research on important topics such as federal sentencing for crimes involving firearms, associations between federal appellate decisions and offender race, trends in sentences and offender characteristics in drug trafficking cases, and differing sentencing practices of federal immigration offenders by judicial district will not be completed if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000.  Finally, I would like to emphasize what the Chief Justice said. If we are going to have guidelines and require federal judges to impose guideline sentences, the Sentencing Commission must be empowered to do its work. And that means it needs both Commissioners and sufficient funding to fulfill its critical role in the federal criminal justice system.  I appreciate the support of my colleagues to restore funding for the U.S. Sentencing Commission for the next fiscal year.                           amendment no. 1352 (Purpose: To modify the circumstances under which attorneys' fees in                 Federal capital cases can be disclosed)       On page 73, between line 12 and 13, insert the following:       Sec. 306.--       (A) Section 3006A(d)(D)(vi) of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by adding after the word ``require'' the      following: ``, except that the amount of the fees shall not      be considered a reason justifying any limited disclosure      under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3006A(d)(4)''       (B) Effective Date.--       This Act shall apply to all disclosures made under 3006A(d)      of title 18, United States Code, related to any criminal      trial or appeal involving a sentence of death where the      underlying alleged criminal conduct took place on or after      April 19, 1995.                                  ____                           amendment no. 1353  (Purpose: To ensure that current Federal family violence prevention programs are sensitive to the needs of all Americans including seniors                            and the disabled)       At the appropriate place, insert the following:     SEC. __. PROTECTION OF SENIORS AND THE DISABLED IN FEDERAL                    FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and      over who are victims of family violence each year, at least      \2/3\ are women;       (2) national statistics are not available on the incidence      of domestic or family violence and sexual assault against      disabled women, although several studies indicate that abuse      of disabled women is of a longer duration compared to abuse      suffered by women who are not disabled;       (3) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse      and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member, and adult      children of the victims are the largest category of      perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of      perpetrators;       (4) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United      States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is      expected to continue increasing;       (5) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's      elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the      rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;       (6) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5      cases being reported in 1980 and only 1 in 8 cases being      reported today;       (7) many older and disabled women fail to report abuse      because of shame or as a result of prior unsatisfactory      experiences with individual agencies or others who lack      sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older or disabled      individuals;       (8) many older or disabled individuals also fail to report      abuse because they are dependent on their abusers and fear      being abandoned or institutionalized;       (9) disabled women may fear reporting abuse because they      are fearful of losing their children in a custody case;       (10) public and professional awareness and identification      of violence against older or disabled Americans may be      difficult because these persons are not integrated into many      social networks (such as schools or jobs), and may become      isolated in their homes, which can increase the risk of      domestic abuse; and       (11) older and disabled Americans would greatly benefit      from policies that develop, strengthen, and implement      programs for the prevention of abuse, including neglect and      exploitation, and provide related assistance for victims.
