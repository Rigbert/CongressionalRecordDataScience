 President, I rise today in order to reiterate my concerns over the Export Administration Act of 2001.  There is little doubt that this bill will pass. The writing is on the wall. However, with all due respect to the administration and to my colleagues on the Banking Committee, I have and will continue to oppose S. 149.  Neither I nor Senators Thompson, Kyl, Helms or McCain desire to impede American business entities in their pursuit of new markets. I for one tend to agree with President Calvin Coolidge, who said that, ``The chief business of the American people is business.'' Every Senator here today is an advocate for enhanced trade and for helping U.S. industry to export its goods and services. Exports bring prosperity to this Nation's companies and work to its citizens. If my advocacy for the U.S. technology industry were the sole basis upon which my decision on this legislation was to be based, I could easily change my past position and support passage of the Export Administration Act, or EAA as it is known. However, the other basis upon which the EAA should be measured is its effect upon the national security of the United States.  Earlier this summer, I was inspired when I listened as one of my colleagues, who had not previously supported my position on the EAA, publicly and emphatically stated, and I paraphrase, that when it comes to the difficult question of promoting trade or preserving national security, we must err on the side of national security.  That balance is the crux of this week's debate. We should not support a measure that could, as written, result in harm to Americans by technology developed and sold by Americans.  The pending bill addresses the control of ``dual use'' technology, that is, technology that has both commercial and military applications. Most commonly, our current export controls entail a licensing process for the export of most dual use technologies. Rather than prohibit exports outright, we generally ensure that we can determine which countries are receiving technology and keep track of anomalies in exporting so that we can measure whether technology is being put to military use. The EAA also regulates which countries will be permitted to import U.S. dual-use technologies. Generally, U.S. companies are not permitted to export dual use products to countries like Iran and Iraq.  This bill is an attempt to rewrite our export control laws to make them more rational. I too believe that this nation needs new export laws to meet today's trade realities. However, this effort must not open the floodgates for our dual use technology to be exported, without the ability for the U.S. Government to follow where that technology goes and its ultimate application.  For an export control regime to function properly, it must provide for a balancing of the commercial benefits involved--which are generally obvious, easily-quantified, concentrated, and immediate--with the national security concerns, which are typically shrouded in secrecy, difficult to quantify, diffuse, and long-term in nature. In this equation, national security can easily get the short end of the stick.  Not everything is shrouded in secrecy. In accordance with Section 721 of the 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act, twice a year the Director of Central Intelligence submits a report on trends in the proliferation of weapons technologies. Part of the report is unclassified. The report identifies key suppliers of dual use missile, nuclear, and conventional arms technologies, as well as dual-use biotechnology and chemical technology. Nations such as China and Russia are identified as key suppliers. They export their technology to the likes of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria, Sudan, Pakistan and India. The report received last winter detailed a continuing and significant problem.  Regarding Iran, the report states, and I quote:       Tehran expanded its efforts to seek considerable dual use      biotechnical materials, equipment, and expertise from      abroad--primarily from entities in Russia and Western      Europe--ostensibly for civilian uses. We judge that this      equipment and know-how could be applied to Iran's biological      warfare program. Outside assistance is both important and      difficult to prevent, given the dual-use nature of the      materials, the equipment being sought, and the many      legitimate end uses for these items.  Regarding Iraq, the report indicates that Saddam Hussein is utilizing all means to acquire dual-use technology. The report states:       Iraq has attempted to purchase numerous dual-use items for,      or under the guise of, legitimate civilian use. This      equipment, in principle subject to UN scrutiny, also could be      diverted for weapons of mass destruction purposes. In      addition, Iraq appears to be installing or repairing dual-use      equipment at chemical weapons related facilities.  With respect to India, ``India continues to rely on foreign assistance for key missile and dual-use technologies where it still lacks engineering or production expertise in ballistic missile development.'' The report goes on to cite Russia and Western Europe as the primary conduits of India's missile related technology.  As stated in the Report, Pakistan received significant assistance from Communist China for its ballistic missile program in the early part of last year. As recently as this past weekend, the administration was forced to impose sanctions on the China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation for selling missile technology to Pakistan. The corporate entity in Pakistan which received the technology was also sanctioned. I know this has been and continues to be an issue of great concern to Senator Thompson. I commend him for his efforts to publicize Communist China's blatant disregard for its pledge not to support foreign nuclear missile programs.  The report did contain one note of optimism, which I believe is also directly applicable to today's debate. Nations such as Libya and Iran continued to attempt to acquire needed materials for weapons of mass destruction in Western Europe. They had some success in the first half of 2000, but the CIA report states that, ``Increasingly rigorous and effective export controls and cooperation among supplier countries have led the other foreign WMD programs to look elsewhere for many controlled dual-use goods.'' The point is, that while we cannot stop all proliferation, a rigorous export control regime can be effective in diffusing the spread of potentially threatening dual-use technology.  Mr. President, the problem is real. I believe it is a significant statement when the Chairmen and now Ranking Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Intelligence Committee, the Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism and Government Information, have serious issues with the protections this legislation provides our national security. I am deeply disappointed that the new administration was not able to support reasonable amendments which would address the national security equities which we have highlighted. I am concerned that the interests of the high tech business community have replaced reasonable consideration of our dual use export control regime.  Technologies which are exported today can and will have to be dealt with by this Nation's national security apparatus. Consequently, I urge my colleagues to support the amendments of Senators Thompson, Kyl, Helms, and others, which will strengthen S. 149 with respect to national security. They are only a handful of the changes which should be made to this bill but they will serve to give the Defense Department and the State Department a more level playing field in the export control process from which to protect national security.  There is a proper balance between promoting business and preserving the national security. This bill does not strike that balance. As a conferee, I am hopeful that in conference, I can work with the members of the House, especially Chairman Hyde and continue these efforts to tilt the balance in favor of national security.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record entitled ``Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weaponsof Mass Destruction and AdvancedConventional Munitions, 1 January through 30 June 2000.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology    Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional                Munitions, 1 January Through 30 June 2000       The Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) hereby submits      this report in response to a Congressionally directed action      in Section     721 of the FY 97 Intelligence Authorization Act, which      requires:       ``(a) Not later than 6 months after the date of the      enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter, the      Director of Central Intelligence shall submit to Congress a      report on       (1) the acquisition by foreign countries during the      preceding 6 months of dual-use and other technology useful      for the development or production of weapons of mass      destruction (including nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, and      biological weapons) and advanced conventional munitions; and       (2) trends in the acquisition of such technology by such      countries.''       At the DCI's request, the DCI Nonproliferation Center (NPC)      drafted this report and coordinated it throughout the      Intelligence Community. As directed by Section 721,      subsection (b) of the Act, it is unclassified. As such, the      report does not present the details of the Intelligence      Community's assessments of weapons of mass destruction and      advanced conventional munitions programs that are available      in other classified reports and briefings for the Congress.                         Acquisition by Country       As required by Section 721 of the FY 97 Intelligence      Authorization Act, the following are summaries by country of      acquisition activities (solicitations, negotiations,      contracts, and deliveries) related to weapons of mass      destruction (WMD) and advanced conventional weapons (ACW)      that occurred from 1 January through 30 June 2000. We      excluded countries that already have substantial WMD      programs, such as China and Russia, as well as countries that      demonstrated little WMD acquisition activity of concern.     Iran       Iran remains one of the most active countries seeking to      acquire WMD and ACW technology from abroad. In doing so,      Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous capability to      produce various types of weapons--chemical, biological, and      nuclear--and their delivery systems. During the reporting      period, the evidence indicates reflections of determined      Iranian efforts to acquire WMD-and ACW-related equipment,      materials, and technology focused primarily on entities in      Russia, China, North Korea, and Western Europe.       Iran, a Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) party, already      has manufactured and stockpiled several thousand tons of      chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking      agents, and the bombs and artillery shells for delivering      them. During the first half of 2000, Tehran continued to seek      production technology, training, expertise, equipment, and      chemicals that could be used as precursor agents in its      chemical warfare (CW) program from entities in Russia and      China.       Tehran expanded its efforts to seek considerable dual-use      biotechnical materials, equipment, and expertise from      abroad--primarily from entities in Russia and Western      Europe--ostensibly for civilian uses. We judge that this      equipment and know-how could be applied to Iran's biological      warfare (BW) program. Iran probably began its offensive BW      program during the Iran-Iraq war, and it may have some      limited capability for BW deployment. Outside assistance is      both important and difficult to prevent, given the dual-use      nature of the materials, the equipment being sought, and the      many legitimate end uses for these items.       Iran sought nuclear-related equipment, material, and      technical expertise from a variety of sources, especially in      Russia. Work continues on the construction of a 1,000-     megawatt nuclear power reactor at Bushehr that will be      subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)      safeguards. In addition, Russian entities continued to      interact with Iranian research centers on various activities.      These projects will help Iran augment its nuclear technology      infrastructure, which in turn would be useful in supporting      nuclear weapons research and development. The expertise and      technology gained, along with the commercial channels and      contacts established--even from cooperation that appears      strictly civilian in nature--could be used to advance      Iran's nuclear weapons research and development program.       Beginning in January 1998, the Russian Government took a      number of steps to increase its oversight of entities      involved in dealings with Iran and other states of      proliferation concern. In 1999, it pushed a new export      control law through the Duma. Russian firms, however, faced      economic pressures to circumvent these controls and did so in      some cases. The Russian Government, moreover, failed to      enforce its export controls in some cases regarding Iran.       China pledged in October 1997 not to engage in any new      nuclear cooperation with Iran but said it would complete      cooperation on two nuclear projects: a small research reactor      and a zirconium production facility at Esfahan that Iran will      use to produce cladding for reactor fuel. As a party to the      Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), Iran is required to      apply IAEA safeguards to nuclear fuel, but safeguards are not      required for the zirconium plant or its products.       Iran claims that it is attempting to establish fuel-cycle      capabilities to support its civilian energy program. In that      guise, it seeks to obtain turnkey facilities, such as a      uranium conversion facility that, in fact, could be used in      any number of ways to support fissile material production      needed for a nuclear weapon. We suspect that Tehran most      likely is interested in acquiring foreign fissile material      and technology for weapons development as part of its overall      nuclear weapons program.       During the first half of 2000, entities in Russia, North      Korea, and China continued to supply the largest amount of      ballistic missile--related goods, technology, and expertise      to Iran. Tehran is using this assistance to support current      production programs and to achieve its goal of becoming self-     sufficient in the production of ballistic missiles. Iran      already is producing Scud short-range ballistic missiles      (SRBMs) and has built and publicly displayed prototypes for      the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). In      addition, Iran's Defense Minister in 1999 publicly      acknowledged the development of a Shahab-4, originally      calling it a more capable ballistic missile than the Shahab-3      but later categorizing it as solely a space launch vehicle      with no military applications. Iran's Defense Minister also      has publicly mentioned a ``Shahab 5,'' although he said that      development had not yet begun. Such statements, made against      the backdrop of sustained cooperation with Russian, North      Korean, and Chinese entities, strongly suggest that Tehran      intends to develop a longer range ballistic missile      capability.       Iran continues to acquire conventional weapons and      production technologies from Russia and China. During the      first half of 2000, Iran received five Mi-171 utility      helicopters from Russia under a 1999 contract, and it began      licensed production of Russian Konkurs (AT-5) antitank guided      missiles. Iran also claims to be producing a new manportable      surface-to-air missile knows as Misagh-1, which resembles      China's QW-1 MANPAD system. Tehran also has been able to      keep operational at least part of its existing fleet of      Western-origin aircraft and helicopters supplied before      the 1979 Iranian Revolution and continues to develop      limited capabilities to produce armor, artillery, tactical      missiles, munitions, and aircraft with foreign assistance.     Iraq       Since Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, Baghdad has      refused to allow United Nations' inspectors into Iraq as      required by Security Council Resolution 687. In spite of      ongoing UN efforts to establish a follow-on inspection regime      comprising the UN Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection      Commission (UNMOVIC) and the IAEA's Iraq Action Team, no UN      inspections occurred during this reporting period. Moreover,      the automated video monitoring system installed by the UN at      known and suspect WMD facilities in Iraq is no longer      operating. Having lost this on-the-ground access, it is more      difficult for the UN or the US to accurately assess the      current state of Iraq's WMD programs.       We do not have any direct evidence that Iraq has used the      period since Desert Fox to reconstitute its WMD programs,      although given its past behavior, this type of activity must      be regarded as likely. We assess that since the suspension of      UN inspections in December of 1998, Baghdad has had the      capability to reinitiate both its CW and BW programs within a      few weeks to months. Without an inspection monitoring      program, however, it is more difficult to determine if Iraq      has done so.       Since the Gulf war, Iraq has rebuilt key portions of its      chemical production infrastructure for industrial and      commercial use, as well as its missile production facilities.      It has attempted to purchase numerous dual-use items for, or      under the guise of, legitimate civilian use. This equipment--     in principle subject to UN scrutiny--also could be diverted      for WMD purposes. Since the suspension of UN inspections in      December 1998, the risk of diversion has increased. Following      Desert Fox, Baghdad again instituted a reconstruction effort      on those facilities destroyed by the US bombing, including      several critical missile production complexes and former      dual-use CW production facilities. In addition, Iraq appears      to be installing or repairing dual-use equipment at CW-     related facilities. Some of these facilities could be      converted fairly quickly for production of CW agents.       UNSCOM reported to the Security Council in December 1998      that Iraq also continued to withhold information related to      its CW program. For example, Baghdad seized from UNSCOM      inspectors an Air Force document discovered by UNSCOM that      indicated that Iraq had not consumed as many CW munitions      during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s as had been declared by      Baghdad. This discrepancy indicates that Iraq may have hidden      an additional 6,000 CW munitions.       In 1995, Iraq admitted to having an offensive BW program      and submitted the first in a series of Full, Final, and      Complete Disclosures (FFCDs) that were supposed to reveal the      full scope of its BW program. According to UNSCOM, these      disclosures are incomplete and filled with inaccuracies.      Since the full scope and nature of Iraq's BW program was not      verified, UNSCOM assessed that Iraq continues to maintain a      knowledge base and industrial infrastructure that could be      used to produce quickly a large amount of BW agents at any      time, if needed.       Iraq has continued working on its L-29 unmanned aerial      vehicle (UAV) program, which involves concerting L-29 jet      trainer aircraft originally acquired from Eastern Europe. It      is believed that Iraq may have been conducting flights of the      L-29, possibly to test system improvements or to train new      pilots. These refurbished trainer aircraft are believed to      have been modified for delivery of chemical or, more likely,      biological warfare agents.       We believe that Iraq has probably continued low-level      theoretical R associated with its nuclear program. A      sufficient source of fissile material remains Iraq's most      significant obstacle to being able to produce a nuclear      weapon.       Iraq continues to pursue development of SRBM systems that      are not prohibited by the United Nations and may be expanding      to longer range systems. Authorized pursuit of UN-permitted      missiles continues to allow Baghdad to develop technological      improvements and infrastructure that could be applied to a      longer-range missile program. We believe that development of      the liquid propellant Al-Samoud SRBM probably is maturing and      that a low-level operational capability could be achieved in      the near team. The solid-propellant missile development      program may now be receiving a higher priority, and      development of the Ababil-100 SRBM and possibly longer range      systems may be moving ahead rapidly. If economic sanctions      against Iraq were lifted, Baghdad probably would increase its      attempts to acquire missile-related items from foreign      sources, regardless of any future UN monitoring and      continuing restrictions on long-range ballistic missile      programs. Iraq probably retains a small, covert force of      Scud-type missiles.     North Korea       P'yongyang continues to acquire raw materials from out-of-     country entitles needed for its WMD and ballistic missile      programs. During this time fame, North Korea continued      procurement of raw materials and components for its ballistic      missile programs from various foreign sources, especially      through firms in China. We assess the North Korea is capable      of producing and delivering via munitions a wide variety of      chemical and biological agents.       During the first half of 2000, P'yongyang sought to procure      technology worldwide that could have applications in its      nuclear program, but we do not know of any procurement      directly linked to the nuclear weapons program. We assess      that North Korea has produced enough plutonium for at      least one, and possibly two, nuclear weapons. The United      States and North Korea are nearing completion on the joint      project of canning spent fuel from the Yongbyon complex      for long-term storage and ultimate shipment out of the      North in accordance with the 1994 Agreed Framework. That      reacher fuel contains enough plutonium for several more      weapons.       North Korea continues to seek conventional arms. It signed      a contract with Russia during this reporting period.     Libya       Libya has continued its efforts to obtain ballistic      missile-related equipment, materials, technology, and      expertise from foreign sources. Outside assistance is      critical to its ballistic missile development programs, and      the suspension of UN sanctions last year has allowed Tripoli      to expand its procurement effort. Libya's current capability      remains limited to its aging Scud B missiles, but with      continued foreign assistance it may achieve an MRBM      capability--a long-desired goal.       Libya remains heavily dependent on foreign suppliers for      precursor chemicals and other key CW-related equipment.      Following the suspension of UN sanctions in April 1999,      Tripoli reestablished contacts with sources of expertise,      parts, and precursor chemicals abroad, primarily with Western      Europe. Libya still appears to have a goal of establishing an      offensive CW capability and an indigenous production      capability for weapons. Evidence suggests Libya also is      seeking to acquire the capability to develop and produce BW      agents.       Libya continues to develop its nascent nuclear research and      development program but still requires significant foreign      assistance to advance to a nuclear weapons option. The      suspension of sanctions has accelerated the pace of      procurement efforts in Libya's drive to rejuvenate its      ostensibly civilian nuclear program. In early 2000, for      example, Tripoli and Moscow renewed talks on cooperation at      the Tajura Nuclear Research Center and discussed a potential      power reactor deal. Should such civil-sector work come to      fruition, Libya could gain opportunities to conduct weapons-     related R       Following the suspension of UN sanctions, Libya has      negotiated deals--reported to be worth up to $100 million,      according to Russian press--with Russian firms for      conventional weapons, munitions, and upgrades and      refurbishment for its existing inventory of Soviet-era      weapons.     Syria       Syria sought CW-related precursors and expertise from      foreign sources during the reporting period. Damascus already      has a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin, and it would appear      that Syria is trying to develop more toxic and persistent      nerve agents. Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for      key elements of its CW program, including precursor chemicals      and key production equipment. It is highly probable that      Syria also is developing an offensive BW capability.       We will continue to monitor the potential for Syria's      embryonic nuclear research and development program to expand.       During the first half of 2000, Damascus continued work on      establishing a solid-propellant rocket motor development and      production capability with help from outside countries.      Foreign equipment and assistance to its liquid-propellant      missile program, primarily from North Korean entities, but      also from firms in Russia, have been and will continue to be      essential for Syria's effort. Damascus also continued its      efforts to assemble--probably with considerable North Korean      assistance--liquid fueled Scud C missiles.       Syria continues to acquire ACW--mainly from Russia and      other FSU suppliers--although at a reduced level from the      early 1990s. During the past few years, Syria has received      Kornet-E (AT-14), Metis-M (AT-13), Konkurs (AT-5), and      Bastion-M (AT-10B) antitank guided missiles, RPG-29 rocket      launchers, and small arms, according to Russian press      reports. Damascus has expressed interest in acquiring Russian      Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters and air defense systems, but its      outstanding debt to Moscow and inability to fund large      purchases have hampered negotiations, according to press      reports.     Sudan       During the reporting period, Sudan sought to acquire a      variety of military equipment from various sources. Khartoum      is seeking older, less expensive weapons that nonetheless are      advanced compared with the capabilities of the weapons      possessed by its opponents and their supporters in      neighboring countries in the long-running civil war.       In the WMD arena, Sudan has been developing the capability      to produce chemical weapons for many years. In this pursuit,      it has obtained help from entities in other countries,      principally Iraq. Given its history in developing chemical      weapons and its close relationship with Iraq, Sudan may be      interested in a BW program as well.     India       India continues its nuclear weapons development program,      for which its underground nuclear tests in May 1998 were a      significant milestone. The acquisition of foreign equipment      could benefit New Delhi in its efforts to develop and      produce more sophisticated nuclear weapons. India obtained      some foreign assistance for its civilian nuclear power      program during the first half of 2000, primarily from      Russia.       India continues to rely on foreign assistance for key      missile and dual-use technologies, where it still lacks      engineering or production expertise in ballistic missile      development. Entities in Russia and Western Europe remained      the primary conduits of missile-related technology transfers      during the first half of 2000. New Delhi Flight-tested three      short-range ballistic missiles between January and June      2000--the Prithvi-II in February and June, and the Dhanush in      April.       India continues an across-the-board modernization of its      armed forces through ACW, mostly from Russia, although many      of its key programs have been plagued by delays. During the      reporting period, New Delhi continued negotiations with      Moscow for 310 T-90S main battle tanks Su-30 fighter aircraft      production, A-50 Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS)      aircraft, Tu-22M Backfire maritime strike bombers, and an      aircraft carrier, according to press reports. India also      continues to explore options for leasing or purchasing      several AWACS systems from other entities. India has also      received its first delivery of Russian Krasnopol laser-guided      artillery rounds to be used in its Swedish-build FH-77 155-mm      howitzers, negotiated the purchase of unmanned aerial      vehicles form Israel, and considered offers for jet trainer      aircraft from France and the United Kingdom.     Pakistan       Chinese entities continued to provide significant      assistance to Pakistan's ballistic missile program during the      first half of 2000. With Chinese assistance, Pakistan is      rapidly moving toward serial production of solid-propellant      SRBMs. Pakistan's development of the two-state Shaheen-II      MRBM also requires continued Chinese assistance. The impact      of North Korea's assistance throughout the reporting period      is less clear.       Pakistan continued to acquire nuclear-related and dual-use      equipment and materials from various sources--principally in      Western Europe. Islamabad has a well-developed nuclear      weapons program, as evidence by its first nuclear weapons      tests in late May 1998. Acquisition of nuclear-related goods      form foreign sources will remain important if Pakistan      chooses to develop more advanced nuclear weapons. China,      which has provided extensive support in the past to      Islamabad's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs,      in May 1996 pledged that it would not provide assistance to      unsafeguarded nuclear facilities in any state, including      Pakistan. We cannot rule out, however, some continued      contacts between Chinese entities and entities involved in      Pakistan's nuclear weapons development.       Pakistan continues to rely on China and France for its ACW      requirements. Pakistan received eight upgraded Mirage III/V      fighters from France and continued negotiations to purchase      an additional 50 F-7 fighters from China.     Egypt       Egypt continues its effort to develop and produce ballistic      missiles with the assistance of North Korea. This activity is      part of a long-running program of ballistic missile      cooperation between these two countries.                             Key Suppliers     Russia       Despite overall improvements in Russia's economy, the      state-run defense and nuclear industries remain strapped for      funds, even as     Moscow looks to them for badly needed foreign exchange      through exports. We remain very concerned about the      nonproliferation implications of such sales in several areas.      Monitoring Russian proliferation behavior, therefore, will      remain a very high priority.       Russian entities during the reporting period continued to      supply a variety of ballistic missile-related goods and      technical know-how to countries such as Iran, India, China,      and Libya. Iran's earlier success in gaining technology and      materials from Russian entities accelerated Iranian      development of the Shahab-3 MRBM, which was first flight-     tested in July 1998. Russian entities during the first six      months of 2000 have provided substantial missile-related      technology, training, and expertise to Iran that almost      certainly will continue to accelerate Iranian efforts to      develop new ballistic missile systems.       Russia also remained a key supplier for civilian nuclear      programs in Iran, primarily focused on the Bushehr Nuclear      Power Plant project. With respect to Iran's nuclear      infrastructure, Russian assistance enhances Iran's ability to      support a nuclear weapons development effort. By its very      nature, even the transfer of civilian technology may be of      use in Iran's nuclear weapons program. We remain concerned      that Tehran is seeking more than a buildup of its civilian      infrastructure, and the Intelligence Community will be      closely monitoring the relationship with Moscow for any      direct assistance in support of a military program.       In January, Russia's cabinet approved a draft cooperative      program with Syria that included civil use of nuclear power.      Broader access to Russian scientists could provide      opportunities to solicit fissile material production      expertise if Syria decided to pursue a nuclear weapons      option. In addition, Russia supplied India with material for      its civilian nuclear program during this reporting period.      President Putin in May amended the presidential decree on      nuclear exports to allow the export in exceptional cases      of nuclear materials, technology, and equipment to      countries that do not have full-scope IAEA safeguards,      according to press reports. The move could clear the way      for expanding nuclear exports to certain countries that do      not have full-scope safeguards, such as India.       During the first half of 2000, Russian entities remained a      significant source of dual-use biotechnology, chemicals,      production technology, and equipment for Iran. Russia's      biological and chemical expertise make it an attractive      target for Iranians seeking technical information and      training on BW- and CW-agent production processes.       Russia continues to be a major supplier of conventional      arms. It is the primary source of ACW for China and India, it      continues to supply ACW to Iran and Syria, and it has      negotiated new contracts with Libya and North Korea,      according to press reports.       The Russian Government's commitment, willingness, and      ability to curb proliferation-related transfers remain      uncertain. The export control bureaucracy was reorganized      again as part of President Putin's broader government      reorganization in May. The Federal Service for Currency and      Export Controls (VEK) was abolished and its functions assumed      by a new department in the Ministry of Economic Development      and Trade. VEK had been tasked with drafting the implementing      decrees for Russia's July 1999 export control law; the status      of these decrees is not known. Export enforcement continues      to need improvement. In February 2000, Sergey Ivanov,      Secretary of Russia's Security Council, said that during      1998-99 the government had obtained convictions for      unauthorized technology transfers in only three cases. The      Russian press has reported on cases where advanced equipment      is simply described as something else in the export      documentation and is exported. Enterprises sometimes falsely      declare goods just to avoid government taxes.     North Korea       Throughout the first half of 2000, North Korea continued to      export significant ballistic missile--related equipment and      missile components, materials, and technical expertise to      countries in the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa.      P'yongyang attaches a high priority to the development and      sale of ballistic missiles, equipment, and related      technology. Exports of ballistic missiles and related      technology are one of the North's major sources of hard      currency, which fuel continued missile development and      production.     China       During this reporting period, the Chinese have continued to      take a very narrow interpretation of their bilateral      nonproliferation commitments with the United States. In the      case of missile-related transfers, Beijing has repeatedly      pledged not to sell Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)      Category I systems but has not recognized the regime's key      technology annex. China is not a member of the MTCR.       Chinese missile-related technical assistance to Pakistan      continued to be substantial during this reporting period.      With Chinese assistance, Pakistan is rapidly moving toward      serial production of solid-propellant SRBMs. Pakistan's      development of the two-stage Shaheen-II MRBM also requires      continued Chinese assistance. In addition, firms in China      provided missile-related items, raw materials, and/or      assistance to several other countries of proliferation      concern--such as Iran, North Korea, and Libya.       Chinese entities have provided extensive support in the      past to Pakistan's safeguarded and unsafeguarded nuclear      programs. In May 1996, Beijing pledged that it would not      provide assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. We      cannot rule out some continued contacts between Chinese      entities and entities associated with Pakistan's nuclear      weapons program. China's involvement with Pakistan will      continue to be monitored closely.       With regard to Iran, China confirmed that work associated      with two remaining nuclear projects--a small research reactor      and a zirconium production facility--would continue until the      projects were completed. The intelligence Community will      continue to monitor carefully Chinese nuclear cooperation      with Iran.       Prior to the reporting period, Chinese firms had supplied      CW-related production equipment and technology to Iran. The      US sanctions imposed in May 1997 on seven Chinese entities      for knowingly and materially contributing to Iran's CW      program remain in effect. Evidence during the current      reporting period shows Iran continues to seek such assistance      from Chinese entities, but it is unclear to what extent these      efforts have succeeded. In June 1998, China announced that it      had expanded its CWC-based chemical export controls to      include 10 of the 20 Australia Group chemicals not listed on      the CWC schedules.     Western Countries       As was the case in 1998 and 1999, entities in Western      countries in 2000 were not as important as sources for WMD-     related goods and materials as in past years. However, Iran      and Libya continue to recruit entities in Western Europe to      provide needed acquisitions for their WMD programs.      Increasingly rigorous and effective export controls and      cooperation among supplier countries have led the other      foreign WMD programs to look elsewhere for many controlled      dual-use goods. Machine tools, spare parts for dual-use      equipment, and widely available materials, scientific      equipment, and specialty metals were the most common items      sought. In addition, several Western countries announced      their willingness to negotiate ACW sales to Libya.                                 Trends       As in previous reports, countries determined to maintain      WMD and missile programs over the long term have been placing      significant emphasis on insulating their programs against      interdiction and disruption, as well as trying to reduce      their dependence on imports by developing indigenous      production capabilities. Although these capabilities may not      always be a good substitute for foreign imports--particularly      for more advanced technologies--in many cases they may prove      to be adequate. In addition, as their domestic capabilities      grow, traditional recipients of WMD and missile technology      could emerge as new suppliers of technology and expertise.      Many of these countries--such as India, Iran and Pakistan--do      not adhere to the export restraints embodied in such supplier      groups as the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Missile      Technology Control Regime.       Some countries of proliferation concern are continuing      efforts to develop indigenous designs for advanced      conventional weapons and expand production capabilities,      although most of these programs usually rely heavily on      foreign technical assistance. Many of these countries--unable      to obtain newer or more advanced arms--are pursuing upgrade      programs for existing inventories.
