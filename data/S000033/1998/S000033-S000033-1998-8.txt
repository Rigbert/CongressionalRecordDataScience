 Speaker, the war has been over for 7 years. The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and I and other people have attended numerous hearings. We have reached conclusions. Tens of thousands of veterans are ill from Gulf War illness, and they are ill as a result of exposure to a wide variety of toxins. They need to be treated.  We should presume that if illness strikes them, the reason is that they suffered from exposure in the Gulf War and they should be compensated accordingly. This bill goes a little way and only a little way to addressing those problems.
