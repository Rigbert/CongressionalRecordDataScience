 President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This bill, which I am introducing with Senator Durbin, will restore the stenographic preference for depositions taken in Federal Court. Under our system of government, Congress has the duty and responsibility to scrutinize carefully all of the rules of Civil Procedure promulgated by the Judicial Conference and transmitted to us by the Supreme Court for review--and to make modifications or deletions when appropriate. Indeed, when many changes to the rules were proposed in 1993, some were to be modified in legislation which was passed by the House. Unfortunately, the crush of the end-of-session legislation that year made it impossible for the Senate to act on this bill to modify these changes and they took effect in December of that year.  Many of us in this body wanted to bring the bill forward, but opponents of the proposed modifications were able to delay any Senate consideration until after the effective date required by the Rules Enabling Act. Because of our responsibility to review these rules, I want to bring one of the modifications back before the Senate. This modification concerns rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  From 1970 to December 1993, rule 30 permitted depositions to be recorded by non stenographic means, but only upon court order or with the written stipulation of the parties. The change in rule 30(b) altered that procedure by eliminating the requirement of a court order or stipulation and affording each party the right to arrange for recording of a deposition by non stenographic means.  Testimony at hearings conducted by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practice in the 103d Congress raised concerns about the reliability and durability of video or audio tape alternatives to stenographic depositions. There was also information submitted suggesting that technological improvements in stenographic recording will make the stenographic method more cost-effective for years to come.  Depositions recorded stenographically have historically provided an accurate record of testimony which can conveniently be used by both trial and appellate courts. In addition, the certification of accuracy by an independent and unbiased third party is a significant component of trustworthy depositions. Studies undertaken by the Justice Research Institute confirm the fact that a stenographic court reporter is the qualitative standard for accuracy and clarity in depositions, and a court reporter using a computer--aided transportation is the least costly method of making a deposition record.  Even now, 5 years after the rule change, court reporters associations contend that mechanical recording frequently produces unintelligible passages and is laden with other dangers such as the inability to identify speakers. Rather than becoming the way of the future, electronic recording has been faulted by judges and attorneys as an error-prone system where tapes are often untranscribable because of inaudible portions, machines frequently fail, and recorders pick up every background sound, including papers rustling, coughing, and attorney sidebar conferences which then must be edited out before use by jurors or for the appeal process.  The case was never made for unilateral decisions on the use of nonstenographic recording of depositions. The legislation that I am introducing today with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, would restore the rule that nonstenographic recording of depositions is authorized only when permitted by court order or stipulation of both parties.  This version of the rule worked very effectively for over 23 years. In fact, I am not aware of any instance where an attorney or party was denied the ability to use an alternative method when it was requested. However, the most important factor was that the prior incarnation of the Rules recognized the potential for errors from methods other than stenographic means and thus established the safeguards of stipulation or court order. In fact, the notes to accompany the 1970 version of the Civil Rules said it best:       In order to facilitate less expensive procedures, provision      is made for the recording of testimony by other than      stenographic means--e.g., by mechanical, electronic, or      photographic means. Because these methods give rise to      problems of accuracy and trustworthiness, the party taking      the deposition is required to apply for a court order. The      order is to specify how the testimony is to be recorded,      preserved, and filed, and it may contain whatever additional      safeguards the court deems necessary.       (Notes to accompany the 1970 Revisions to the Federal Rules      of Civil Procedure)  Mr. President, this legislation gives us the chance to do what we should have done 4 years ago and restore the rule in order to maintain the high standard of justice for which our legal system is known.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1352       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled, That      paragraphs (2) and (3) of Rule 30(b) of the Federal Rules of      Civil Procedure are amended to read as follows:       ``(2) Unless the court upon motion orders, or the parties      stipulate in writing, the deposition shall be recorded by      stenographic means. The party taking the deposition shall      bear the cost of the transcription. Any party may arrange for      a transcription to be made from the recording of a deposition      taken by nonstenographic means.       ``(3) With prior notice to the deponent and other parties,      any party may use another method to record the deponent's      testimony in addition to the method used pursuant to      paragraph (2). The additional record or transcript shall be      made at that party's expense unless the court otherwise      orders.''.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Inouye, Mr.         Daschle, and Mr. Dorgan):  S. 1354. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for the designation of common carriers not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission as eligible telecommunications carriers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.     the communications act of 1934 technical amendment act of 1997  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 on behalf of Senators Dorgan, Daschle, Inouye, Campbell, and myself. This amendment enables the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to designate common carriers not under the jurisdiction of a State commission as eligible recipients of universal service support.  Universal Service provides intercarrier support for the provision of telecommunications services in rural and high-cost areas throughout the United States. However, section 254(e) of the 1996 act states that only an eligible carrier designated under section 214(e) of the Communications Act shall be eligible to receive specific federal universal support after the FCC issues regulations implementing the new universal service provisions into the law. Section 214(e) does not account for the fact that State commissions in a few states have no jurisdiction over certain carriers. Typically, States also have no jurisdiction over tribally owned companies which may or may not be regulated by a tribal authority that is not a State commission per se.  The failure to account for these situations means that carriers not subject to the jurisdiction of a State commission have no way of becoming an eligible carrier that can receive universal service support. This would be the case whether these carriers are traditional local exchange carriers that provide services otherwise included in the program, have previously obtained universal service support, or will likely be the carrier that continues to be the carrier of last resort for customers in the area.  Mr. President. This simple amendment will address this oversight within the 1996 act, and prevent the unintentional consequences it will have on common carriers which Congress intended to be covered under the umbrella of universal service support.                                 ______                                       By
