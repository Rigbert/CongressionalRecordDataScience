 I report to the Senate as the lone Republican Senate negotiator.  Yesterday's Roll Call quotes numerous Democratic Senators as saying Senate Democrats won't agree to any stimulus deal unless the package has the support of two-thirds of the Democratic caucus. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From Roll Call December 6, 2001]     Democrats Set Stimulus Hurdle; Senators Require Supermajority                             (By Paul Kane)       Setting a high threshold for negotiating an economic-     stimulus package, Senate Democrats have decided they will not      accept any deal unless roughly two-thirds of their caucus      agrees to support the final product.       Before agreeing to begin bipartisan, bicameral negotiations      on a final stimulus plan, Majority Leader Thomas Daschle      (S.D.) told his caucus last week that Democratic Senators in      the House-Senate conference would not agree to a stimulus      deal if there was significant opposition from within      Democratic ranks.       ``They're not going to agree to anything unless a      significant majority of the caucus agrees with it,'' said      Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Budget Committee      and a Finance Committee member. ``It's got to be a      significant majority, two-thirds of the caucus.''       Other Democratic Senators confirmed that the high bar for a      stimulus deal was set around a two-thirds majority, although      some said Daschle left wiggle room in case he feels the deal      is good and he doesn't have precisely that much support.       ``I don't think it's a hard-and-fast number,'' said Sen.      John Breaux (D-La.), a senior Finance member.       Breaux said he remained hopeful that a deal could be      reached that would gain enough Democratic support for a final      package, but added, ``It's going to be tough.''       Asked about the threshold for reaching a deal, Sen. Jim      Jeffords (I-Vt.) said, ``It's a high one.''       Negotiations continued yesterday among six key lawmakers      trying to hammer out a stimulus deal: Senate Finance Chairman      Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va) and      Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member on Finance; House      Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (R-Calif.); House      Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas); and Rep. Charlie Rangel      (D-N.Y.), ranking member on Ways and Means.       Although some progress was reported on those talks, Senate      Republicans worried that the Democrats were setting an      impossible bar for reaching a deal and openly questioned      whether Baucus' caucus colleagues trust the Montana Senator,      who helped Grassley write a $1.3 trillion tax cut last      spring.       ``I would hope we would not put [in place] this artificial      threshold that is almost impossible to achieve,'' said Sen.      Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), a key moderate on Finance. ``Why do      that? To set up failure? I hope not.''       Snowe said the narrow margin in the Senate gave neither      side the right to predetermine how many votes would come from      their caucus, but rather mandated that negotiators shoot for      a deal that cobbles together 51 votes, or 60 if needed to      break a filibuster. ``That is the essential marker here,''      she said.       An aide to Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)      indirectly suggested that Daschle and Democrats simply don't      trust Baucus. ``Senator Lott has said this before and he'll      say it again: He has every confidence in Senator Grassley's      ability to negotiate a real economic security package on      behalf of Senate Republicans,'' said Ron Bonjean, Lott's      spokesman.       Baucus drew the ire of many Democrats when he and Grassley      co-wrote the Senate tax package, most of which became law. On      final passage, the bill was supported by just 12 Democrats.      In the process, Baucus received numerous tongue lashings from      colleagues at Democratic caucus meetings, including one      exchange in which Daschle told Baucus he did not have ``the      authority'' to negotiate a deal with Grassley.       Conrad acknowledged that requiring a caucus supermajority      for the stimulus deal was ``unusual'', but said the      circumstances in this negotiation--not the party's faith in      Baucus--necessitated setting the high threshold. Conrad      recalled Senate Democrats setting similar bars for approval      of year-end budget deals in the early 1990s, including the      1990 compromise struck with the first Bush administration.       ``We've not had an ending to a session quite like this      one,'' Conrad said, noting that the Sept. 11 attacks, anthrax      letters and a worsening recession have contributed to leaving      Congress months behind in finishing up its business. ``It's      important that the caucus be behind any deal. We're not going      to sign up to anything unless a substantial majority agree.''       Conrad noted that it was both Daschle and Baucus who made      the pledge to the caucus that a two-thirds majority would be      required for a deal--a promise made at a caucus meeting held      last Thursday to discuss the stimulus negotiations.       Jeffords, who caucuses with Democrats, said the feeling was      that the stimulus plan was so crucial that everyone agreed a      wide consensus was needed, not that the Senators needed any      check on Baucus. ``Max is doing a good job. I haven't heard      anybody complaining.''       Aides to Baucus agreed that the caucus is unified in this      approach, noting that his plan to expand unemployment and      health care benefits and reduce some business taxes had      unanimous support in the body.       ``We're hopeful that the package we negotiate is one that      reflects the solid core principles we've been talking about      since the beginning of this debate,'' said Michael Siegel,      Baucus' spokesman.       Other Democrats contended that the bigger problem with      negotiations is trying to forge a compromise with the House      Republican plan, which is primarily titled toward business      taxes. Digging in for a fight, Senate Democrats from both      wings of the caucus said they would rather kill the stimulus      plan than give away too large a corporate tax break.       ``The better alternative may be no bill at all,'' said Sen.      Robert Torricelli (N.J.), one of the 12 Democrats to support      the tax-cut bill in the spring. ``I would rather see that      money stay in the treasury.''       ``I would rather see no stimulus than that,'' said Sen.      Dick Durbin (Ill.), an assistant floor leader to Daschle.       Durbin said it was increasingly doubtful that a stimulus      plan would pass, considering there are just two weeks left      before the Christmas break. He noted it took a week to lay      the ground rules for the conference and determine who would      take part.       ``Do the math. We took a week to set the table and say who      would sit where,'' he said.       Not a negotiator himself, Daschle has set up a system to      monitor the talks, including Breaux, a key moderate, in      postconference meetings in his office with Baucus,      Rockefeller and possibly Rangel.       Before substantive talks began this week, Rockefeller      signaled that he intended to take a very hard line on the      package. ``I'm not much of a compromiser,'' he said.       But Baucus believes that moves by Thomas this week to offer      unemployment extensions were a sign of compromises to come,      Siegel said. ``It's clear that we're making progress.''       The entire Democratic caucus, however, will be the final      jury on that outcome. ``It was a commitment people wanted to      hear,'' Torricelli said of the two-thirds majority decision.
