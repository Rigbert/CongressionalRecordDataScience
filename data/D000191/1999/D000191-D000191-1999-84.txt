  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, after the high school shooting in my district last year, in my hometown of Springfield, Oregon, I talked to hundreds of residents. We had an incredible community dialogue about the causes and the possible solutions for youth violence. Everyone agreed it was complex. They had a long list of things they would like to see done. They would like to see something done about violence in the media.  After 66 amendments and dozens of hours of staying in session until 2 o'clock in the morning, this House has done nothing about violence in the media. After a day and a half on the very sensitive issue of gun control, this House has done nothing to extend instant check and background checks to people who purchase guns at gun shows. After 66 amendments and dozens of hours and late into the night, we have done nothing to add to the services to serve at-risk youth and their families and prevent them from getting into violence. Nothing. Zero.  Mr. Speaker, I hope my constituents and I hope my colleagues' constituents were watching. What we did here does not even meet the common-sense laugh test. It was a disgrace for this House of Representatives.                          ____________________
