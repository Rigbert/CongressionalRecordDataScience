Speaker, it is my distinct privilege and honor to recognize and congratulate five United States heroes. Mr. Raymond Fary, Mr. Donald Erwin, Mr. Albert Fehlberg, Mr. Adalbert Wszolek, and Mr. Ernest Latta are World War II Army and Army Air Force veterans who risked their lives for the freedom of our great country. These dedicated and brave men will be honored on Sunday, November 2, 2003 at the Salute 2003 Ceremony at Munster High School in Munster, Indiana.  Raymond Fary joined the United States Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison on March 23, 1943. Raymond quickly earned his glider badge and participated in the Rhineland, Central Europe, Normandy, and Ardennes campaigns as a Glider Trooper with the 82nd Airborne. He earned many prestigious honors throughout his career including the American Theater Ribbon, Holland and Belgium Fourragere, as well as the Victory Medal, just to name a few.  Donald Erwin entered into the United States Army on October 23, 1942 at Camp Atterbury in Indianapolis, Indiana. During his campaigns in New Guinea, Leyte, and the Philippines, Donald served with Company C of the 19th Infantry Division. During his time of service, Donald received the Purple Heart, the Asiatic Pacific Theater Ribbon with two Battle Stars, the Philippine Liberation Ribbon with one Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, as well as many other honorable medals.  Albert Fehlberg, on December 1, 1942 also joined the United States Army at Camp Atterbury in Indianapolis, Indiana. Albert's three major campaigns were in North Africa, Salerno-Cassino, and Rome, Italy. Due to his extensive understanding of the German language, he was advanced into the 143rd Infantry. He received the Purple Heart with Four Oak Leaf Clusters, after being wounded five different times during his 15 months in combat. Among his many prestigious awards for his service were the EAME Theater Ribbon and the Bronze Star Medal.  Adalbert Wszolek entered into active service on June 9, 1941 in Chicago, Illinois as the bottom ball turret gunner on a B-17 Bomber for the United States Army Air Force. While on his 4th mission in Germany, Adalbert was seriously wounded on June 21, 1944 but continued to fire upon the enemy. His valiant and selfless efforts inspired his crew to join together to return their damaged aircraft to safety. Adalbert received many awards for his bravery and courage including the Good Conduct Medal, Purple Heart Medal, Air Medal, Silver Star Medal, and countless others.  Ernie Latta joined the United States Army at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, Indiana on October 2, 1940. He was first stationed at Scoffield Barracks in Hawaii during the attack on Pearl Harbor. He was awarded the Silver Star for his brave rescue of one of his comrades as they were heavily under fire. Sergeant Latta received the Asian Pacific Theater Ribbon with three Bronze Stars, the American Defense Service Medal, Good Conduct Ribbon, along with many other awards for his courage.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and thanking these five brave men, as well as all the former and current members of the United States military for their courageous and selfless dedication to the American people. These men have put their own lives in danger to protect our way of life, and for that they should be applauded and revered.                          ____________________
