Women and children who are fleeing domestic violence make up a significant portion of the homeless population. According to the United States Conference of Mayors, 57 percent of cities surveyed identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.  These women and children are homeless because in their desperate attempt to leave their abusers they find themselves with few, if any, funds with which they can support themselves. Victims of domestic violence have a tough time finding room at emergency homeless or domestic violence shelters, and often fail to find adequate housing because affordable, long-term housing is not available in so many communities. If housing is available there are often long waiting lists. Victims face unique causes of their financial hardships due to the fact that batterers frequently harass their victims at work, and survivors are often fired or cannot maintain steady employment resulting in losing the ability to pay for housing. Faced with the lack of stable housing, finances and services, victims must choose between life with an abusive partner and life on the streets.  Our amendment would provide leniency for women and children who are affected by domestic violence and would, in fact, help victims to move forward and start new lives. Without the threat of losing their housing, women and children who are survivors of domestic violence will not be forced to a situation where they are homeless or returning to their abuser.  This amendment would modify the bankruptcy code to ensure better protection for victims of domestic violence by granting them relief from summary eviction from their rental housing. Relief may be granted only under the condition that the debtors certify under penalty of perjury that they are victims of domestic violence whose physical well-being or whose children's physical well-being would be threatened through eviction. our amendment would not allow families to take advantage of the system, but it will be a life-saver for those who would face danger if they lost their homes.  This amendment is supported by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the National Network To End Domestic Violent and the Family Violence Prevention Fund. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters from those groups voicing that support.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 7, 2005.       Dear Senator: As national organizations working to address      the varied needs of victims of domestic violence, we urge you      to support Senator Leahy's proposed amendment to the      Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of      2005, S. 256. This provision is essential for the many      victims of domestic violence whose physical well-being or      whose children's physical well-being would be threatened by      summary eviction as a result of filing for bankruptcy.       Economic abuse is an integral part of domestic violence.      Abusers often assert economic control by forbidding their      victims from working, giving them little or no access to      family finances, or destroying their credit. Many battered      women have current or former partners who actively interfere      with their efforts to work, harass them at work, threaten      them and their children, withhold transportation or      childcare, or beat them so severely that they cannot work.      These victims are sometimes pushed into filing for bankruptcy      as a result of this abuse.       Evicting these victims from their homes not only      exacerbates an already difficult situation, but also puts      many families in direct danger. On average, it takes six to      ten months to secure housing. During this time, victims would      be forced to stay at emergency homeless or domestic violence      shelters. Unfortunately, those shelters are often full; in      2003, 32% of the requests for shelter by homeless families      went unmet due to the lack of emergency shelter beds      available. Even when space is available, most shelters limit      the length of stay to 30 days.       Faced with this lack of housing and services, victims must      choose between life with an abusive partner or life on the      streets. Studies indicate that victims of domestic violence      often return to their abusers because they cannot find long-     term or transitional housing. At the other extreme, more than      50% of homeless women and children are homeless because they      are fleeing domestic violence. Once homeless, women are at      high risk for experiencing further violence. Many studies      have found that 90-100% of homeless women have been      physically or sexually assaulted.       The tremendously negative impact of such evictions becomes      greater when victims with children are forced out of their      homes. Children without a home are in fair or poor health      twice as often as other children, and     have higher rates of asthma, ear infections, stomach      problems, and speech problems. Homeless children are also      more likely to experience mental health problems, such as      anxiety, depression, and withdrawal. They are twice as likely      to experience hunger, and four times as likely to have      delayed development. School-age homeless children face      barriers to enrolling and attending school, including      transportation problems, residency requirements, inability to      obtain previous school records, and lack of clothing and      school supplies.       Individuals claiming relief under this provision would be      required to testify, under penalty of perjury, that they were      victims of domestic violence and that they or their children      would be in physical jeopardy if they were evicted. Thus,      this amendment will not allow families to take advantage of      the system, but will be life-saving for those who would be in      danger if they lost their homes.       We urge you to support Senator Leahy's amendment and      provide this much needed assistance to domestic violence      victims.           Sincerely,     Allison Randall,       National Network to End Domestic Violence.     Jill Morris,       National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.     Kiersten Stewart,       Family Violence Prevention Fund.                                  ____                                        National Coalition Against                                            Domestic Violence,                                                  February 28,2005     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: It is with great support that I write      to you on behalf of the National Coalition Against Domestic      Violence and the more than 3,000 local shelter programs that      we represent to thank you for your efforts to assist those      individuals that are or have been impacted by the vast      epidemic of domestic violence. '       Women fleeing domestic violence make up a significant      portion of the homeless population. According to The United      States Conference of Mayors (December, 1999) 57 percent of      cities surveyed identified domestic violence as a primary      cause of homelessness. Therefore, amending the bankruptcy      code, as proposed in S. 256, with a provision that provides      leniency on persons who are affected by domestic violence      would, in fact, help victims to move forward and start new      lives. Without the threat of losing their housing victims      will not be forced to a situation where they are homeless or      returning to their abuser.       Victims of domestic violence often cannot find adequate      housing. One very important--reason is that affordable, long      term housing is not available in their communities. If      housing is available there are often long waiting lists or      the abuser is able to quickly locate and begin abusing the      survivor at her new residence. Secondly, due to the fact that      batterers frequently harass their victims at work, survivors      are often fired or cannot maintain steady employment      resulting in loss ability to pay for housing. Lastly victims      of domestic violence are forced to remain in abusive      relationships because of financial dependency and the lack of      stable housing. The amendment to S. 256 recognizes that      victims of domestic violence are in a dangerous situation and      should not be forced from housing due their financial      difficulties.       We commend you on your efforts to ensure that those who are      affected by domestic violence are taken into consideration      when the Senate reviews this legislation.           Sincerely,                                                      Jill Morris,                                           Public Policy Director.
