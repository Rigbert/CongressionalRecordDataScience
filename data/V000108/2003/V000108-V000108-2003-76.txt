Speaker it is my distinct honor to commend one of Northern California's most distinguished citizens and a great friend of mine, Mayor Clark Thompson of Petaluma, California. He has served the people of Petaluma for 25 years, culminating over the last 4 years with his service as Mayor of that fine city. His leadership and pursuit of excellence will be sorely missed as he steps down from a career of public service.  A longtime resident of Petaluma, Mayor Clark Thompson began his career in public service by serving the city on the Parking and Business Improvement Area Committee. From there, he served on the Committee to study and initiate bicycle paths and access, as a member of the Petaluma Valley Hospital Foundation Board, and as a member of the Petaluma Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce Board. He is still a lifetime member of the Casa Grande Boosters Club.  At a time when his beloved city faced many challenges Mayor Thompson brought a broad vision to lead the citizens of Petaluma into the future. His determination is unwavering; his pride in his city is unequaled. I have had the pleasure to work with Mayor Thompson on a professional level, and witnessed his abilities as a leader when he solved Petaluma's long standing flood control issues. He has the uncommon ability to work with people of different beliefs in order to do what is right. The city of Petaluma and its people have benefited greatly from Clark Thompson's years as a public servant.  Although he has been a devoted public servant, Mr. Thompson has always held his family as a to priority. He and his wife, Sue Ellen, originally settled in the community of Petaluma to raise their two daughters, Molly and Abigail. Clark's retirement will allow him to spend more time with his family, something he will greatly cherish.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mayor Clark Thompson on his retirement after 25 years of diligent service to the city of Petaluma, California. Clark has been a valuable member of the community for which he cares so deeply, and his service will be greatly missed. I wish him the best of luck in future endeavors, and I know he will enjoy his retirement for many years to come.                          ____________________
