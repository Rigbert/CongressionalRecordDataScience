 Candidly, I do not understand the wording of the amendment. Let me read it. You have read it, and I appreciate that. It does not make sense to me. Here is how it reads.       None of the funds made available by this Act may be      obligated for the purpose of departments or agencies funded      by this Act--  So none of the funds may be obligated for the purpose of departments or agencies funded by this act--     and lead--  It says ``lead'' but led, I think that is a misspelling--     by Senate-confirmed appointees, implementing policies of the      Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change.  I don't know what that means on its face.
