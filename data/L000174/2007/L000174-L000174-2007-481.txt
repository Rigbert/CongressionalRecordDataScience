President, this amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator Specter, irons out a few remaining technical and jurisdictional issues relating to our Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. We are offering a managers' amendment that contains a few technical fixes, including grammatical changes and proper references to ``magistrate judges.''  This bipartisan amendment will make clear that additional protection provided to the Tax Court by the Marshals Service shall be reimbursed by the funds allocated to the Tax Court. We also clarify the construction of which officers qualify as ``judges'' so that all Federal judges are treated the same with regard to life insurance.  Senator Lieberman raised an objection with regard to section 505, which provided for the reauthorization of the Ethics in Government Act. I understand that Chairman Lieberman is currently working to reauthorize that legislation, so Senator Specter and I have agreed to remove it from our court security bill.  I note for my colleagues that no major policy changes relating to improving the security that our Federal judges receive appear in this managers' package. I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for working with me on this important legislation.  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.
