President, will the Senator yield for a question through the Chair?  I came on the floor late. I heard Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley talk about this bill. I want to try to bring it down to the most basic information, so if someone misses the debate, they will understand what we are talking about.  This is generally what we are trying to do. We are taking people who are displaced out of their homes, out of their jobs, out of their communities because of the hurricanes--people who, frankly, are going through a lot of personal and family hardship at this moment--and saying that one thing weare going to help you with immediately is to make sure that you have health care. If you qualify, you would have Medicaid--that is for people in the lower income categories--or if you had private health insurance where you used to work in a business that has gone away, we are going to step in here for 5 months and say, We are going to give you this peace of mind. You will know that you have health insurance.  Is that what this bill does?
