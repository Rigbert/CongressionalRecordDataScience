President, I am pleased that the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO has added its name to the long list of supporters of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that their letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Building and Construction Trades Department, American            Federation of Labor--Congress of Industrial            Organizations,                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2007.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the twelve international unions      of the Building and Construction Trades Department, I      respectfully urge you to vote in favor of S. 1248, the Water      Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA).       After seven long years it is time to end the impasse over      the passage of a WRDA bill because our nation cannot afford      further delay of this desperately needed legislation. Because      of the limited opportunities, in an extremely crowded Senate      agenda, the time to act is now.       We believe the enactment of a robust WRDA bill will enhance      the environment, help grow our economy and help ease our      Nation's growing congestion problem. Additionally, this bill      has tremendous jobs creation potential that will create or      sustain thousands of good paying American construction jobs.      Studies have proven that for every $1 billion expended on      water resources development activities, approximately 40,000      direct and indirect jobs are created.       The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 will finally      restore the regular process of meeting the nation's water      resource needs as they arise. So, we urge you to vote YES for      final passage of S. 1248 and we ask Congress to swiftly      conference and enact this legislation so that our nation's      acute and unmet water infrastructure needs are addressed as      soon as possible.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                               Edward C. Sullivan,                                                        President.
