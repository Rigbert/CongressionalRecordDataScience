 President, I would like to start out this morning by saying I am glad we are turning to the bipartisan jobs bill that passed the House last week by such a lopsided margin. Here is a chance not only to help entrepreneurs build their businesses and create jobs but to show we can work together around here to get things done on a bipartisan basis.  Unfortunately, some of our friends on the other side do not seem to like that idea very much. Apparently, they would rather spend the time manufacturing fights and 30-second television ads than helping to create jobs.  First, they tried to even keep us from bringing up this jobs bill for debate in the Senate. Now we read they are trying to figure out ways to make this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill controversial.
