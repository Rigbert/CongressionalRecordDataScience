 President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will give tangible relief to the families of the five federal firefighters killed in the devastating Esperanza fire in southern California this October.  The Esperanza fire tragically claimed lives, homes and other buildings, while burning more than 40,000 acres. No one has felt the pain of this heartbreaking disaster more than the families of Mark ``Lotzie'' Loutzenhiser, Jess McLean, Jason McKay, Daniel Hoover-Najera, and Pablo Cerda.  These five men served honorably while exhibiting the utmost bravery in the name of helping others. They gave the ultimate sacrifice, and so have their families, who must now go on without a father or a son, a brother or a husband.  Now, in an outpouring of generosity and compassion, a United Way chapter in Riverside County, together with the surrounding community has raised more than $1 million to help the families of our fallen heroes as they move forward from this tragedy.  This serves as a testament to what these men meant to the community, the State of California and the Nation.  Unfortunately, in what seems to be a cruel twist, IRS rules do not allow this generosity to be passed on to the families of these brave firefighters.  Tax-exempt charitable organizations are prohibited from raising money for small, targeted, groups, such as the families of the fallen firefighters. In fact, if this memorial fund is passed on to the families, it could endanger the tax-exempt status of the Central County United Way and other charitable organizations trying to help these families in their hour of need.  In the wake of this disaster, our Government should be providing assistance to these families, not increasing their burden.  This much-needed legislation provides exemptions to allow this moving gesture to be realized. The United Way will preserve their tax exempt status, those who made these donations will receive the tax deductions they expected, and most importantly the families of the five fallen firefighters can receive individual donations, penalty free.  This legislation encourages the kind of generosity and kindness that we should all commend, not discourage.  We came together to pass similar legislation in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy and we should do so again today.  While this simple measure only makes a minor tax code clarification, the impact of this legislation will be profound for the families of these fallen heroes.  Let us not forget the heroism of these men and the sacrifice of their families. The time to act is now, so that these funds raised will not be withheld during the upcoming holiday season, when this relief is most needed.  I urge my colleagues to join me in doing what is right to help the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect their communities.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 4112       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Firefighters      Assistance Tax Clarification Act of 2006''.     SEC. 2. PAYMENTS BY CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS WITH RESPECT TO                    CERTAIN FIREFIGHTERS TREATED AS EXEMPT PAYMENTS                    AND EXCLUDED FROM GROSS INCOME OF THE                    RECIPIENTS.

(b) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to payments      made on or after October 26, 2006.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Smith, Mr. Baucus,         Mr. Feingold, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Boxer,         Mr. Grassley, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Dorgan):  S. 4113. A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of1968 to clarify that territories and Indian tribes are eligible to receive grants for confronting the use of methamphetamine; considered and passed.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Bingaman, Grassley, Smith, Baucus, Feingold, Johnson, Salazar, Wyden, Boxer, Reid, Feinstein, and Cantwell in introducing and passing a bill to amend the Omnibus Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to clarify that Indian tribes and U.S. territories are eligible to receive grants for confronting the use of methamphetamine.  The amendments that this bill makes to section 2996(a) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 would make U.S. territories and Indian tribes eligible to receive grants from the Department of Justice to address the scourge of methamphetamine use, sale, and manufacture. The terrible business of methamphetamine use, distribution, and manufacture has impacted communities all over the country, in urban and nonurban areas alike, and our territories and Indian reservations have not been spared. This bill will make much needed resources available to territorial and tribal governments to help bring the methamphetamine epidemic under control. However, I understand there are some questions about the intent of this bill in respect to a provision in this bill.
