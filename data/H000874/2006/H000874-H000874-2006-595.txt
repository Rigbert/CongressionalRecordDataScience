Speaker, today I rise to honor Diana Goldberg, one of my closest friends. Diana is stepping down as Chairman of the Board, a post that she has held since 2002, for the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC, one of the finest pediatric institutions in the Nation.  The leadership, work and generosity of Diana and her husband, Stephen, have helped to make our Nation's Capital a stronger, healthier community. Diana has been heavily involved with Children's Hospital for the past 20 years. She has served on the Child Health Center Board, of which she was president from 1994 to 1996, and the boards of Children's Hospital Foundation, of which she was chairman from 1999 to 2001, Children's Hospital, and, eventually, Children's National Medical Center. However, her dedication to the health of children in the Washington Metropolitan region extends far beyond her leadership positions. Diana has taken a hands-on approach to volunteering and given countless hours of her time to ensuring that the patients receive the care that they need, while Diana herself has continued to be personally involved with many of the organization's operations.  Furthermore, Diana has truly been a philanthropic leader in Washington, DC, especially for Children's where Children's School Services, a child health data lab, and Jazzmatazz, which is a major benefit to raise money for Children's, are among the programs and fundraising events that she has generously supported. However, Mr. Speaker, most laudatory are Diana's efforts to set up health centers across the city. In 2001, Diana and Stephen donated an astounding $25 million to Children's National Medical Center for the Diana L. and Stephen A. Goldberg Center for Community Pediatric Health. This significant gift allows the Center to maintain community-based health centers in Shaw, Adams Morgan, and Anacostia and three mobile vans. The Center provides immediate healthcare needs, with special attention given to primary care, HIV and AIDS, asthma, sickle cell disease, child abuse, childhood injuries, lead poisoning, and violence prevention. The Goldberg Center is also focused on the greater neighborhood by sponsoring programs like the Adolescent Employment Readiness Center, which prepares disabled adolescents and young adults to enter the workforce.  The Goldbergs' benevolence also includes work with the Edmund Burke School, the Black Student Fund, the Washington AIDS Partnership, a scholarship for the Frederick B. Abramson Memorial Foundation, the National Kidney Foundation of the National Capital Area, Arena Stage, and numerous other worthy causes and organizations. Notably, when the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, was forced to cut its funding for important HIV prevention programs in the District, Diana stepped in and made a sizeable financial gift to make up for the shortfall. Diana Goldberg is a shining model for the good that can be accomplished through the power of giving and a passionate dedication to public service.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the thousands of children that Diana has helped over the years as a member of the greater Washington community, I would like to congratulate and thank Diana Goldberg for her leadership as the Chairman of the Board of Children's National Medical Center and for all her projects. I look forward to seeing what exciting new challenges Diana will undertake next. Undoubtedly, she will continue to give back to the community and help make Washington, DC a better place for all its citizens.                          ____________________
