President, it is a sad reality that with the proliferation of over 200 million guns in America, more and more children who, in my generation, would be the schoolyard bullies are now the kids bringing guns to school, and other children know it. They know about the easy access to these weapons. The kid who used to go out in the schoolyard and punch somebody in the nose now turns out to be the kid who brings the gun to school. It is a sad reality, one that every family in America faces.  I don't care if you live in California, Illinois, or Michigan; there is not a school district or a child we can be sure is safe today until we take measures to restore sanity to the classrooms across America, to protect not only the kids but the teachers and all of the parents who share, as we do, the love for these children.  I thank the Senator from California for her leadership.
