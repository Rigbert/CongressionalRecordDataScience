  I want to speak rather personally about health care reform, why I support the bill that has been signed by the President, why I support the reconciliation bill, and why I will oppose any amendment no matter how good that amendment may appear to be.  I am a doctor's daughter, and I am a former doctor's wife. So I have lived most of my life in a medical family. I have had very good health care. My father, who was chief of surgery at the University of California Medical Center, never operated on anyone he did not make a house call on. He was well respected by his students and a great surgeon.  My husband who died was a neurosurgeon, and his practice was spent in stereotactic surgery with respect to people who had abnormal movements and could not control their movements. So I came to believe that we had the best medical system in the United States of America.  It was only in the last few years that I began to see how much medicine had changed in America. We walked into a doctor's office, and it was not like one secretary in my father's office; it was a bank of files and pressure and lines waiting to be seen. I realized that there were so many people who did not have good health care, who worried about losing their health care, and, in fact, were losing their health care; that this kind of reform suddenly was open to me.
