 President, the cloture motions I just filed will ripen on Thursday. This will be the sixth cloture vote on the Estrada nomination and the second on the Owen nomination. I am compelled to file these motions because we have been unable to reach a time certain for an up-or-down vote on these two highly qualified nominees.  The record will reflect the many times we have asked unanimous consent for a debate limit on the Estrada and Owen nominations, only to have an objection from the other side of the aisle.  As has been said previously, we will not give up hope that the Senate will be able to work its will on these judicial nominees. Senators can vote for them, Senators can vote against them, but these people deserve a vote.  Stalling and not allowing an up-or-down vote is an indication that the system is broken. I commend Senator Cornyn and others in their efforts to begin a dialog regarding the ramifications for the Senate of these judicial filibusters.  I will notify all Members as to the exact timing of the cloture votes on Thursday.                          ____________________
