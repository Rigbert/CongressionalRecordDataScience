  Mr. President, we have a savers credit, an incentive for low-income savers. It is covered in the budget number. Deduction for college tuition: It is covered in the budget number. Extension of research and development tax credit--it is important to lots of States--it is covered in the budget number. Extension of wind and alternative energy tax credit: It is covered in the budget. I know that is important to a lot of people, a lot of people who are critics of this budget.  So you cannot have it both ways. If you exclude room in the budget for tax relief, you cannot say you support that same tax relief.
