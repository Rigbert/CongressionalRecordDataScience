The amendment we offer facilitates restoring these CDBG funds by increasing the budget cap by closing tax loopholes that the Senate has already supported closing, in previous votes. This, in turn, makes real money available to the Appropriations Committee to be able to spend for next year.  Increasing the cap is important because the budget resolution we are considering assumes domestic spending will be capped at the same level as the President's request. Simply put, the budget resolution assumes that funding for CDBG will be reduced by the same amount as the president has proposed, which would be a cut of $1 billion from fiscal year 06 levels.  A separate amendment offered by our colleagues, Senator Santorum and Senator Coleman, also supports an increase of funding for CDBG, but it would do so by asking the Appropriations Committee to impose across-the-board cuts on all other domestic programs.  Speaking as an appropriator, I can tell you that all their amendment will do if it passes is to tell the Appropriations Committee that the Senate supports CDBG. But that will not be enough to guarantee that the committee will hear and provide the Transportation-Treasury-HUD, TTHUD, Appropriations Subcommittee with a higher allocation to increase funding for CDBG.  My colleagues should note that the Santorum-Coleman amendment is the same as the CDBG amendment that passed last year. However, because it provided no additional funding to the Appropriations Committee, the TTHUD Subcommittee received an allocationthat was inadequate to fund all of the programs within its jurisdiction. CDBG was the program that was on the chopping block, suffering cuts of more than $400 million.  So if my colleagues want to simply signal their support for CDBG funding to the Appropriations Committee, then they should vote for the Santorum-Coleman message amendment. Unfortunately, if they choose to do that and that amendment passes at the expense of our amendment, they will find that when it comes time to write the TTHUD appropriations bill, they will have failed to protect this important program from further cuts.  The choice is clear. Those who want to vaguely express support for the CDBG Program can support the other amendment, which is a nice sentiment, like a Candygram. But for those who also really want to get the job done, I urge support of our amendment.  I challenge each Member to go back to their States and to take stock of the benefits that communities have reaped through CDBG investments. I challenge each Member to visit with their local community action groups and hear how they use the community services block grant to support the neediest in their communities. These programs fill a real need and have proven results.  A cut of $1 billion in Federal funds, which is proposed in this budget resolution, will result in the loss of at least $9 billion in matching funds from local and State governments and nonprofit and private sector investments. I fail to see the wisdom in dismantling programs that are so vital to our communities.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of the Murray-Sarbanes-Leahy amendment and express their real support for these important programs.                               Exhibit 1                                                   March 14, 2006.       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations thank you for      joining 52 of your colleagues in signing a letter (attached)      to the Budget Committee leadership in support of a budget      allocation sufficient to fund the Community Development Block      Grant (CDBG) program at $4.3 billion for FY 2007. The      resolution approved by the Senate Budget Committee last      Friday would not allow for such a funding level. In fact it      adopts the funding level proposed in the President's FY 2007      budget, which cuts CDBG formula grants by an additional $1      billion over this year's $3.71 billion. Today the Senate will      consider alternative amendments to the budget resolution to      increase CDBG funding. We support a Murray/Leahy/Sarbanes      amendment to increase funding for the CDBG program by      increasing the overall discretionary cap. It is offset by      closing corporate tax loopholes, an approach that has had      overwhelming support by a bipartisan group of Senators. This      is the only way that the Appropriations Committee can      increase CDBG funding because it means additional dollars.      Reluctantly, we cannot support an amendment by Senators      Santorum and Coleman that increases funding for CDBG paid for      by an across-the-board cut in other domestic programs      (Function 920). This amendment is similar to an amendment      offered by Senator Coleman last year that passed the Senate.      In spite of this, the final FY 2006 appropriations bill cut      CDBG formula grants by 10 percent.       We strongly urge you to vote for the Murray/Sarbanes/Leahy      amendment that would allow appropriators to restore the CDBG      formula amount to the FY 2004 funding level. Thank you for      your continued support of the CDBG program and the good work      it does in our nation's urban, suburban and rural areas.           Sincerely,       National Association of Counties.       National League of Cities.       National Conference of Black Mayors.       National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies.       National Association for County Community and Economic      Development.       National Association of Housing and Redevelopment      Officials.       Council of State Community Development Agencies.       Enterprise.

Hon. Judd Gregg,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,     U.S. Senate.     Hon. Kent Conrad,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad: As you near      consideration of the FY 2007 Budget Resolution, we urge the      Budget Committee to oppose the budget proposal to cut funding      for the Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) Program by      nearly $1 billion, or 25 percent. Instead, we urge the Budget      Committee to maintain the Federal government's commitment to      community development programs at the Department of Housing      and Urban Development (HUD) and support a budget allocation      of $4.3 billion in Function 450 for CDBG.       The communities that have benefited from CDBG will be      devastated if the HUD proposal to cut funding is enacted.      CDBG serves more than 1,100 entitlement communities, urban      counties and states, and more than 3,000 rural communities      nationwide. It is the centerpiece of the Federal government's      efforts to help states and localities meet the needs of low-     income communities. The Program funds vital homeownership,      housing rehabilitation, public improvements, public services      and economic development projects in communities nationwide.      It also supports community-based organizations and the      crucial work they do to deliver human services and rebuild      neighborhoods.       CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs      to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results. Over 95      percent of the FY 2005 CDBG funding went to activities      principally benefiting low- and moderate-income persons.      Twenty-eight percent of CDBG funds supported housing      activities in distressed communities, 24 percent supported      public improvements, 15 percent went to the provision of      public services, and 7 percent supported economic development      activities. In FY 2005, CDBG housing projects assisted over      166,000 households, including financial assistance to new      homeowners and rehabilitation assistance to the elderly and      other existing homeowners. Economic development programs      benefiting from CDBG last year created or retained over      91,000 full-time jobs. CDBG also has a strong record in      business retention: CDBG has ensured that over 80 percent of      the businesses assisted through the program were still in      operation after three years.       The CDBG formula allocation was funded at $4.41 billion in      FY 2001. Since then, the formula allocation has decreased by      $670 million, or 15.2 percent, with a five percent cut in FY      2005 and a 10 percent cut in FY 2006. The FY 2007 HUD budget      would reduce the formula funding by an additional 25 percent,      cutting the formula allocation by over a third in just      three years.       In light of these drastic cuts, communities have struggled      to continue their programs and have discontinued critical      projects for low- and moderate-income persons. We therefore      ask you to reject the proposed cut and ask you to support      $4.3 billion in funding for the CDBG Program.       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to      working with you to ensure that communities across the      country can provide good jobs, affordable housing, and public      services to meet the needs of all Americans.
