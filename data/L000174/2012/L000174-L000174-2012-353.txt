The affordable care act will protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. The law eliminates discriminatory practices by health insurers, ensuring that a patient's gender is no longer a pre-existing condition, reduces the cost of prescription drugs for our Nation's senior citizens, and helps parents continue to cover their kids on their health insurance until they are 26. The law also provides necessary resources to help law enforcement recover millions of taxpayer dollars lost to fraud and abuse in the health care system.  If the Supreme Court overturns the affordable care act now, it will be devastating to kids, families, and senior citizens. I hope the Court does not undo the progress we have made. Doing so depends on legal theories so extreme they would turn back the clock even farther to the hardships of the Great Depression and strike down principles that have helped us build the social safety net over the last century with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  The affordable care act builds on some of the cornerstones of American economic security built over the last century. I believed when it passed, and still believe today, that Congress acted within its constitutional authority to enact laws to help protect all Americans, I hope the Court does not overstep the judiciary's role by substituting its own policy preferences and denying a century of progress.                               Exhibit 1               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2012]               Why Ryancare and Obamacare Look so Similar                            (By Ezra Klein)       Let's play a game. I'll describe a health-care bill to you.      Then you tell me if I'm describing President Obama's      Affordable Care Act or the budget released this week by Rep.      Paul Ryan (R Wis.).       The bill works like this: The federal government subsidizes      Americans to participate in health insurance markets known as      ``exchanges.'' Inside these exchanges, insurers can't      discriminate based on pre-existing conditions. Individuals      can choose to go without insurance, but if they do so, they      pay a penalty. To keep premium costs down, the government      ties the size of the subsidy to the second-least-expensive      plan in the market--a process known as ``competitive      bidding,'' which encourages consumers to choose cheaper      plans.       This is, of course, a trick question. That paragraph      describes both the Affordable Care Act and Ryan's proposed      Medicare reforms. The insurance markets in both plans are      essentially identical. And for good reason.       The Affordable Care Act was based on two decades of      Republican thinking about health care. The basic structure      was first proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation in      1989, first written into a bill by Senate Republicans in      1993, and first passed into law by a Republican governor by      the name of Mitt Romney in 2005.       About 2008, Democrats decided they could live with a system      based on private health insurers, federal subsidies and an      individual mandate as long as it produced universal coverage.      A year later, Republicans decided they couldn't live with      such a system, at least not if a Democratic president was      proposing it.       The problem for the Republicans, however, is that they      don't have a better--or even alternative--idea. Since the      passage of the Affordable Care Act, ``repeal and replace''      has been a reliable applause line at tea party rallies and an      oft-uttered incantation on the floor of the House of      Representatives. But while Republicans have united around      ``repeal'' of health-care reform, they haven't managed to      come up with a policy for ``replace.''       Instead, they've opted to apply their old policy      framework--the one the Democrats stole--to Medicare. That has      left the two parties in a somewhat odd position: Democrats      support the Republicans' old idea for the under-65 set but      oppose it for the over-65 set. Republicans support the      Democrats' new idea for the over-65 set but oppose it for the      under-65 set.       This isn't quite as incoherent as it seems. Democrats say      they would prefer Medicare-for-All for the under-65 set, but      they'll take whatever steps toward universal health insurance      they can get. Republicans say they would prefer a more free-     market approach for the over-65 set but that a seniors'      version of ``Obamacare'' is nevertheless a step in the right      direction. For both parties, it's the direction of the      policy, rather than the policy itself, that matters.       There's an added complication for Republicans. They have      assumed huge savings from applying the exchange-and-subsidies      model to Medicare. But they don't assume--in fact they      vehemently deny--that those same savings would result from      the identical policy mechanism in the Affordable Care Act.      The Democrats haven't assumed significant savings from the      exchange-and-subsidies model in either case.       If the concept works as well as Ryan says it will, then the      Affordable Care Act will cost far, far less than is currently      projected. There's no compelling reason to believe      competitive bidding will cuts costs for seniors but fail      among younger, healthier consumers who, if anything, are in a      better position to change plans every few years and therefore      pressure insurers to cut costs.       The discrepancy highlights another difference between      Republicans and Democrats right now. Republicans have put all      their eggs in the competitive-bidding basket. If that doesn't      work to control costs--and versions of it have failed in the      past--they're sunk.       Democrats, on the other hand, are promoting a slew of      delivery-system reforms in the Affordable Care Act. They're      hoping competitive bidding works, but they're also trying      comparative-effectiveness review, pay-for-quality,      accountable-care organizations, electronic health records,      penalties for excessive readmissions and medical errors, and      a host of other experiments to determine which treatments and      processes actually work and how to reward the doctors and      hospitals that adopt them.       It's unlikely that the model in the Republican budget will      prove sustainable. That legislation would repeal the      Affordable Care Act, cut Medicaid by a third and adopt      competitive bidding for Medicare. The likely result? The      nation's uninsured population would soar. In the long run,      and quite possibly in the short run, that will increase the      pressure for a universal system. Because Republicans don't      really have an idea for creating one, Democrats will step      into the void.       As a result, Republicans' long-term interests are probably      best served by Democratic success. If the Affordable Care Act      is repealed by the next president or rejected by the Supreme      Court, Democrats will probably retrench, pursuing a strategy      to expand Medicare and Medicaid on the way toward a single-     payer system. That approach has, for     them, two advantages that will loom quite large after the      experience of the Affordable Care Act: It can be passed with      51 votes in the Senate through the budget reconciliation      process, and it's indisputably constitutional.       Conversely, if the Affordable Care Act not only survives      but also succeeds, then Republicans have a good chance of      exporting its private-insurers-and-exchanges model to      Medicare and Medicaid, which would entrench the private      health-insurance system in America.       That's not the strategy Republicans are pursuing. Instead,      they're stuck fighting a war against a plan that they helped      to conceive and, on a philosophical level, still believe in.      No one has been more confounded by this turn of events than      Alice Rivlin, the former White House budget director who      supports the Affordable Care Act and helped Ryan design an      early version of his Medicare premium-support proposal.       ``I could never understand why Ryan didn't support the      exchanges in the Affordable Care Act,'' Rivlin says. ``In      fact, I think he does, and he just doesn't want to say so.''                          ____________________
