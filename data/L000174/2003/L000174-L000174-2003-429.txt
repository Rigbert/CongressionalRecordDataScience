President, there is no offense. I know no offense was meant and none was taken.  As the distinguished senior Senator from New Mexico knows, he and I consulted at some length on this nomination, and I was happy to move forward. In fact, while the Senator is still on the floor, why don't we go ahead and pass the nomination. Then I will address the Senate.
