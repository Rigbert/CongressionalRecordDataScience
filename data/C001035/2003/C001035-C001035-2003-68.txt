President, I rise today to express my congratulations to the town of Gray, Maine, as it celebrates its 225th anniversary. This charming town of 7,000 people boasts the first woolen mill in the United States. But even more important is Gray's contribution to our country during the Civil War. Gray sacrificed a greater percentage of men to this cause than any other town in the State of Maine. The Gray Celebration Days festival begins today, and I am pleased to acknowledge this special event, which celebrates the history of this outstanding Maine community.                          ____________________
