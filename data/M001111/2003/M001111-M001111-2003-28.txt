  The rapid expansion of the Washington wine industry has raised concerns that new vineyards will use non-certified, diseased rootstock that could economically devastate the Washington wine industry.  I recently learned that ARS did not dedicate all of the fiscal year 2003 funding to this project, but other research projects as well.  The fiscal year 2004 Agriculture Appropriations bill provides $150,000 to ARS to continue this project. The intent of this project is clear and not subject to interpretation by ARS. I ask that the record reflect that this funding is to develop a wine grape foundation block. In addition, I ask that the conference report accompanying the agriculture bill include language directing ARS to allocate this funding in a manner consistent with congressional intent.  Senator Kohl, do you agree with the intent of this project?
