Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time. I urge a ``yes'' vote when this bill finally gets to the floor on the Magnuson Act, the renewal of the fisheries conservation bill.  I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.  The motion was agreed to.  Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Foley) having assumed the chair, Mr. Goodlatte, chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 39) to amend the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act to improve fisheries management, had come to no resolution thereon.                          ____________________
