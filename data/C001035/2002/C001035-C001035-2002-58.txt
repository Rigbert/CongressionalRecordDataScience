I understand however, that the group life business has also been impacted by the tragic events of September 11. Group life insurance covers nearly 160 million Americans and represents 40 percent of all life insurance in force in the United States, or, $6 trillion of protection to Americans--most of whom are average working Americans. Group life insurance is a highly efficient and inexpensive way to deliver much needed security to people who might otherwise have little or no coverage. This product is inexpensive because it is sold as a single contract between an insurance company and a corporate buyer, the employer, and covering a great number of lives. This greatly simplifies and reduces costs of marketing and administering of the product. It is typically a staple of the employee benefits package provided by employers to their employees.  While I support the terrorism insurance bill that we consider today, I am concerned that it fails to address issues that threaten the continued vitality of group life insurance providers. And so I am pleased to have the opportunity to engage in a colloquy on this issue with the Senator from Nebraska, a true expert on insurance matters, the senior Senator from Maine, and three key members of the Senate Banking Committee.  I understand that the primary problem, both for the property and casualty insurers, as well as the group life insurers, is the difficulty in obtaining reinsurance after the disaster. Am I correct?
