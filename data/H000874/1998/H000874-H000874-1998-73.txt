Speaker, I said earlier today that this was a sad and solemn occasion for us all. Obviously, it is. The discussions have led to that conclusion. Some knew these two brave men better than others. Let me suggest, however, all of us know their comrades in the defense of freedom and defense of our safety and the defense of civil order, without which democracy and freedom cannot flourish.  I see my very close friend on the floor, Curt Weldon from the State of Pennsylvania. He and I are honored to cochair the effort we know as the Fire Service Caucus. It honors men and women who respond to emergency, at time of crisis, not just to fire but to flood and to earthquake and to the cat in the tree, all types of emergencies that confront us.  As I sat here thinking of those who had spoken of these two brave officers, one who frankly was unable to make an immediate decision because the assailant did not give him that time, the other who had to make instantaneous decisions and responded in the best traditions, with the highest courage of men and women who serve in the police forces of our Nation. But as I thought further, each one of them made a decision that required courage and commitment to their fellow men and women in this country. That was a decision daily, as the minority leader has said, to get up, put on the uniform or their plainclothes gear and to put on a badge, a badge of honor, a badge of commitment, a badge indicating their courage in making that daily decision to defend civil order and democracy.  J.J. Chestnut was not given the opportunity by this assailant to make a decision of exactly how to respond. But J.J. Chestnut had already made that decision. He was at that door, he was at the perimeter, he was at risk voluntarily, placing himself in harm's way. That decision was a brave and honorable and courageous decision.  Detective John Gibson also had made a decision earlier that morning to be in harm's way. And when harm came, he was not found wanting. In fact, he was found to have the full measure of devotion and courage that he had pledged to give, not solely to Tom DeLay, not solely to the Congress of the United States, not solely to this building, this hallowed citadel of freedom and democracy, perceived by all the world to be the center of freedom and justice. He was there to defend that very idea, that torch of freedom.  Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg indicated that we had all, as we have all come to honor those two men and their colleagues in the police forces of America, one of whom dies every other day in America, it is a real risk that they undertake, a knowledgeable risk that they undertake. Abraham Lincoln said it well, that we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate this field beyond that which those two brave men and their colleagues have done.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my colleagues in honoring the memory of J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson and honoring their decision to show the kind of courage and commitment necessary to maintain our democracy, our freedom, our civil society.                              {time}  1800
