President, I urge my colleagues to consider all the work that has gone into the crafting of this legislation including the specific provisions I have highlighted in this statement making it absolutely clear that the Federal Government is simply not liable under this legislation.  The Judiciary Committee received extensive testimony from economists and experts in claims projections. All of this process and expertise was considered as part of the Congressional Budget Office official estimate.  The CBO has testified that the FAIR Act is not predicted to add to the Federal debt; therefore, it should not suffer from the budget point of order raised against it. I urge my colleagues to waive the point of order. The victims of asbestos exposure will not benefit from this latest tactic to stop this legislation.
