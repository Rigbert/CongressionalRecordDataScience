Speaker, it is an honor today to rise and pay tribute to Doctor Clarence Romero, associate professor of psychology, at Riverside Community College upon being named the 2001 United States Professor of the Year. My congressional district is privileged to have Dr. Romero teaching our young adults as he is one of only four awardees recognized each year for extraordinary dedication to undergraduate teaching.  Skillful, enthusiastic and innovative teachers change the lives of countless students for the better by encouraging curiosity and understanding and by contributing to the development of mind and spirit.  The United States Professors of the Year program, presented by The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and directed by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, is the nation's most highly respected program to recognize outstanding faculty. The Professor of the Year represents the thousands of dedicated university and college instructors throughout the nation who serve their students, their community and their state with vigor and talent.  Mr. Speaker, the United States has long supported excellence in undergraduate teaching through competitively funding faculty salaries and other initiatives making our system of higher education the envy of many nations.The quality of life and the scope of opportunity for many future citizens will be determined by the quality of teaching in the classroom.  Therefore, I join with all of the citizens in my district in thanking and congratulating Dr. Clarence Romero as he is honored for his devotion to teaching the young minds of our future generations.                          ____________________
