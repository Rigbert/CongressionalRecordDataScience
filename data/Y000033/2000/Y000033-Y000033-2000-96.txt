Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2300, the Coal Market Competition Act of 2000. Today, half of our Nation's coal supply comes from the west side of the Mississippi River, where the vast majority of that coal is mined in States with significant Federal ownership of the mineral estate, including the ownership of the coal resource.                              {time}  1430  The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended, governs the disposition of the right to mine such coal.  Currently, the act limits an entity to no more than a cumulative total of 100,000 acres nationally under federal coal leases, and no more than 46,080 acres in any one State. Congress has increased coal acreage limitation three times since the passage of the original act, most recently in 1976. But the Statewide limitation has not been changed in 36 years, despite significant changes in the coal mining industry. S. 2300 would increase the acreage limit to 75,000 acres per State and 150,000 acres nationwide.  These changes are necessary if our coal industry is going to remain competitive in the production of energy resource which is so important to domestic energy needs. The Coal Market Competition Act of 2000 will better serve America's energy needs by helping our coal industry plan for the future.  Thus I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
