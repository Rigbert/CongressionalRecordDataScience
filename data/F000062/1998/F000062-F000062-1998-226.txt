  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Boxer and I, I think this one statistic irrefutably points out the need for this amendment. I did not support the welfare reform bill. The reason I didn't support the welfare reform bill was exactly this. The way the bill is weighted, the targets that need to be met in the State of California increase with time. We estimated that we had to develop in California 600,000 additional child care slots a year just to keep up with the need.  What the Senator has just revealed to me indicates that within this first year we already see a waiting list of 200,000. I expect in the next 2 years this waiting list to increase threefold, up to 600,000 families waiting for adequate child care.  If we want Americans to leave welfare behind as a way of life, if we want to see Americans entrepreneurial and working, then we must see there is adequate child care available for the children of these families. A great bulk of the people involved here are single parents with children. They need to earn a living. They have no choice. They must find child care.  This amendment creates in the reserve fund some moneys to be able to help the State create the slots. Let me say how difficult this is in California, an earthquake-prone State, tough building codes, tough individual county and city codes. Therefore, these facilities are expensive to build. This amendment provides an opportunity to try a number of different approaches, including employer-based child care, child care that is shared, chambers of commerce working with schools, working with college districts to provide teachers for these child care facilities. All of this can be done. You cannot do it without money. Therefore, I think this reserve fund is certainly small to begin with but certainly necessary.  It is with great pride that I thank the Senator for his leadership and that both Senator Boxer and I are delighted to support this amendment.
