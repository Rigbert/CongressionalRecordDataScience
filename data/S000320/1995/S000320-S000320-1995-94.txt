 President, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Kerrey for working with me on this bill. We have a good relationship. We have worked hard on the bill, and I think we have accomplished much.  I also wish to thank Patty Lynch, who has worked with our staff day in, day out. I thank Chuck Parkinson who has put in hours and hours of work, and also my legislative director, Stewart Hall.
