President, I rise today to bring to the attention of the Senate the retirement of Dr. John F. McCarthy, Vice President, Global Scientific and Regulatory Affairs, for the American Crop Protection Association. He is retiring after 13 years of service with ACPA where he served as the chief advisor on scientific and technical matters. He was named Vice President in 1988.  Prior to joining the American Crop Protection Association, Dr. McCarthy spent 23 years with the Agricultural Chemicals Group of FMC Corporation. At FMC he was involved in all aspects of agricultural chemicals research and development, starting as a synthesis chemist and rising to the position of Director of Product Development and Registrations.  John testified many times before the House Agriculture Committee when I served as chairman. He was always available to provide technical expertise when our Committee was considering amendments to FIFRA. He also testified in the Senate answering endless questions about difficult scientific and policy issues. John was always able to put the issues in perspective and kept the protection of public health at the forefront of his presentation. His retirement will leave a void in the agricultural crop protection community which can not be easily filled.  He received his B.S. degree in Pharmacy from the Albany College of Pharmacy in 1958 and his Ph.D in Medicinal Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin in 1962. Previous to joining FMC, he did research at Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.  John is very family oriented and his wife, Ann, should also be recognized for her willingness to loan John to us for all these years. Without her commitment and understanding, those long hours and late evenings would not have been possible. Please join me in wishing John the best for a well deserved and fulfilling retirement.                          ____________________
