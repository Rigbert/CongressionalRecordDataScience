Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate Calumet Township Trustee, Dozier T. Allen, Jr., on his 30-year anniversary as an elected public official. Dozier will be honored for his years of dedicated service to the communities of northwestIndiana at an anniversary celebration, which will be entitled ``Tribute to a Statesman.'' The event will be held on Thursday evening, November 20, 1997, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, IN. Dozier's family and friends, as well as many prominent community leaders, will attend this special event.  A native of Gary, IN, Dozier Allen began his political career in 1967, with his election to the post of Gary City councilman-at-large. With this election, he earned recognition for being the first Gary-born African-American to serve as councilman-at-large, and during his 5 years in this position, Dozier faithfully served several council committees, including Ordinance, Building and Grounds, Public Welfare, Police and Fire, and Housing and Urban Planning. Through his active participation in these committees, Dozier was instrumental in passing many important city ordinances and resolutions. Some such initiatives resulted in securing more money from the State of Indiana for education in Gary, securing Federal assistance for drug rehabilitation initiatives, and the annexation of Calumet Township to Gary.  While still a councilman-at-large, Dozier won the 1971 election for Calumet Township Trustee. Since then, he has been elected to seven consecutive 4-year terms, during which he has hired and managed over 500 employees, and effectively administered over $300 million to assist more than 1.4 million impoverished families. During Dozier's 25-year stewardship, the Township Trustee's office has had an impeccable record. As township trustee, Dozier has also devoted much of his time to serving on several prestigious councils and committees, including: the Indiana Township Association's Metro Committee; the Governor's Indiana Metropolitan Poor Relief Council; the Lake County Welfare Board; the Lake County Mental Health Board; and the Indiana Township Trustee Association, of which he is still a member. During his distinguished political career, Dozier has earned the distinction of being elected to a major executive public office longer than any African-American citizen in the history of Indiana.  Dozier expressed his devotion to public service long before his election to office, however. He first served his country in combat during the Korean war. For his outstanding service in the National Guard, Dozier received a Bronze Star, a United Nations Service Medal, a National Defense Service Medal, a Good Conduct Medal, and an honorable discharge. Upon returning from the war in 1954, Dozier immediately became involved in the Gary young adult branch of the NAACP, and he actively participated in the elections of countless black public officials. In 1960, Dozier was one of the founders of Muigwithania, the first local African-American organization to have an independent impact on electing black public officials. Since that time, he has probably supported more campaigns for Gary citizens to become elected officials than any other person.  Dozier's humanitarian efforts have also positively impacted the community he serves. Over the years, Dozier has served as a board member or officer in countless organizations, always making a serious effort to contribute in a productive manner. In 1972, as a charter board member of the National Association for Sickle Cell Disease, Dozier successfully raised over $18,000 locally. Sensitive and compassionate in the face of human suffering, health and human service initiatives have always been a priority for Dozier. Other successful fundraising efforts in which Dozier participated, including raising over $12,000 for the National Civil Rights Hall of Fame in 1982-83, and over $10,000 for the Poor People Hunger Revival in 1985, which replenished exhausted township funds. In recognition of his outstanding community service efforts, Dozier has received many awards, including: the Serenity House Appreciation Award; the Martin Luther King Jr. Drum Major Award; the Indiana Township Trustees' Association's Distinguished Service Award; the Indiana Department of Mental Health Outstanding Service Award; the American Red Cross Outstanding Service Award; the John F. Kennedy Leadership Award; and the NAACP Humanitarian Award.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Dozier T. Allen on his years of outstanding service to the communities of northwest Indiana. The hard work and leadership he has displayed, while positively impacting the lives of many, is truly admirable.                          ____________________
