 President, I am pleased to join Senator Kerry in introducing the ``Aviation Safety Protection Act of 1999.'' This legislation will grant whistleblower protection to aviation workers, thus helping to increase the safety of the aviation industry and the traveling public.  I have long been a supporter of whistleblower protection for government workers. This act will extend that protection to aviation workers. Airline employees play a vital role in the protection of the traveling public. They are the first line of defense when it comes to recognizing hazards and other violations which can threaten airline safety. These dedicated employees should not have to choose between saving the public or saving their own jobs. The extension of whistleblower protection will eliminate that unfair choice and will allow them to do what is right. What is right is to be able to tell airline management of aviation safety problems without fear of retaliation or losing their job.  I have been working with Senator Kerry and flight attendants on this vital legislation for the past several years. It was included in the last Congress in the FAA reauthorization bill. Unfortunately that bill was not passed into law. We are looking forward to working closely with Senator McCain and Congressman Shuster this year as the FAA reauthorization legislation moves through the Congress.  The traveling public expects and deserves the safest air travel system possible. Granting aviation employees whistleblower protection will fill a gap in the air travel system.  I join with Senator Kerry in urging my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.                          ____________________
