 President, I rise to introduce the Targeting Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2011 with my colleagues and friends, Senator Charles Grassley, Senator Charles Schumer, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Senator Tom Udall, Senator Robert Casey and Senator Ron Wyden.  This bill will support the Obama Administration's recently released Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime by providing the Department of Justice with crucial tools to help combat the international drug trade. As drug traffickers find new and innovative ways to avoid prosecution, we must keep up with them rather than allowing our laws to lag behind.  This legislation has three main components. First, it puts in place penalties for extraterritorial drug trafficking activity when individuals have reasonable cause to believe that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the United States. Current law says that drug traffickers must know that illegal drugs will be trafficked into the United States and this legislation would lower the knowledge threshold to reasonable cause to believe.  The Department of Justice has informed my office that with increasing frequency, it sees drug traffickers from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru who produce cocaine in their countries but leave transit of cocaine to the United States in the hands of Mexican drug trafficking organizations such as the Zetas. Under current law, our ability to prosecute source-nation traffickers from Colombia, Ecuador and Peru is limited since there is often no direct evidence of their knowledge that illegal drugs were intended for the United States.  Second, this bill ensures that current penalties apply to precursor chemical producers from other countries. This includes those producing pseudoephedrine used for methamphetamine who illegally ship precursor chemicals into the United States knowing that these chemicals will be used to make illegal drugs.  Third, this bill will expand conspiracy liability when controlled substances are destined to the United States from a foreign country. This means that members of any conspiracy to distribute controlled substances will be subject to U.S. jurisdiction when at least one member of the conspiracy intends or knows that illegal drugs will be unlawfully imported into the United States.  As Chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control and as a public servant who has focused on law enforcement issues for many years, I know that we cannot sit idly by as drug traffickers find new ways to circumvent our laws. We must provide the Department of Justice with all of the tools it needs to prosecute drug kingpins both here at home and abroad.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1612       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Targeting Transnational Drug      Trafficking Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PURPOSES                    OF UNLAWFUL IMPORTATIONS.
