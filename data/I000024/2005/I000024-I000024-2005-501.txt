President, this has been a good debate. I would like to have the same debate of 3 hours, 4 hours as we talked on the McCain-Lieberman amendment on this amendment because it should be essentially the same thing. As I said before, it is not.  One point I neglected to mention, since they talk in the findings about what is happening in the Arctic, one of the reports we used specifically said that the temperature in the Arctic during the late thirties and early forties was greater than it is today.  In this brief time, I only repeat what the National Academy of Sciences stated in their written report--not in any kind of press release but their written report:        . . . there is considerable uncertainty in current      understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and      reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. . . .        . . . a casual linkage between the buildup of greenhouse      gases and the observed climate changes in the 20th century      cannot be unequivocally established.
