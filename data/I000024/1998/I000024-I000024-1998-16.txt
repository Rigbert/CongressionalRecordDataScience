President just a few years ago we went through the same thing with the civil penalties of the FAA Act, so there would be someone other than the FAA involved. Prior to that time, the FAA was the judge, the jury, and the appellate court. They made all the decisions and they were protecting their own, because every bureaucracy does this--EPA, IRS, FDA and all the rest of them.  We changed the regulation so the NTSB, then, would be the appellate court for civil penalties, and it has worked very well. The junior Senator from Texas served on the NTSB, and I yield her whatever time she needs.
