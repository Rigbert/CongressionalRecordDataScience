 I think the Senate Finance Committee has a reputation for doing things in a very bipartisan way and moving a lot of important legislation. For example, we moved a bill out of committee to, hopefully, get consideration on the floor. It is a very bipartisan bill that reduces the cost of prescription drugs. We did that on a 19-to-9 vote.  There are a lot of other things we are working on, including some trade legislation. We want to consider, hopefully, in a bipartisan way the U.S.-Mexico agreement. We also have an agreement out on encouraged savings and things of that nature.  I want to respond to my friend by reminding him how our committee works. Last night was the first time that I heard there was an interest in moving Senator Durbin's bill. The bill has not been through the committee process, and, therefore, there has been no opportunity to weigh in with what we know and to determine what we need.  There are a number of programs focused on reducing maternal mortality, and it is unclear how this bill coordinates with those efforts. This bill makes a number of long-term changes to Medicaid, and the policy and budgetary impacts are unknown.  I am offering a counterproposal in the Medicaid Program to address maternal health and identify underserved areas. Additional funding is provided for existing Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grants. This focus is fully offset by a policy that saves money by focusing our limited resources on moms and babies, rather than spending on prisoners at a higher percentage in our most vulnerable populations.  I am going to offer Senator Durbin this proposal that I just described. I ask the Senator to modify his request to include my amendment, which is at the desk.  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
