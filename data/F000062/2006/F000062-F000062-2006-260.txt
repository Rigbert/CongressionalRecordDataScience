 President, I wish to offer my sincere congratulations, commendation, and gratitude to Ms. Jean Picker Firstenberg, who announced last week that she will be stepping down as chief executive officer of the American Film Institute after 26 years of dedicated and exceptional leadership.  During a tenure lasting nearly three decades, Jean's vision and leadership has placed AFI at the forefront of national recognition with respect to the history of film in this country. Her efforts dramatically widened the scope and magnitude of AFI's activities, and she has proven instrumental in moving the organization through times of tremendous change at AFI and in the film world as well.  Founded in 1967, AFI was established to educate the next generation of American filmmakers and preserve the Nation's film heritage. Jean not only fulfilled this vital need but worked to greatly expand AFI's mission. Thanks to her efforts, AFI now stands as the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the country, represents a preeminent voice celebrating excellence in American film and television, and has proudly championed new film and television media.  Perhaps Jean's greatest challenge came when the National Endowment for the Arts funding which had been AFI's primary source of financial support since the organization's inception disappeared virtually over night. But thanks to Jean's firm dedication to our Nation's film heritage and her boundless energy, she transformed AFI into the self-sufficient entrepreneurial organization it is today with a strong and diverse financial foundation.  Beyond placing AFI on firm financial grounding, Jean's tenure has also seen myriad accomplishments that will forever cement her legacy at AFI and in the film and television world. Under her direction, AFI acquired the beautiful campus in Los Angeles it calls home, greatly expanded its educational opportunities, and opened the Silver Theater and Cultural Center in nearby Silver Spring, MD.  Jean Firstenberg is an American treasure, and her presence as head of AFI will be sorely missed. It is truly a pleasure to honor and thank her for all she has done for film in America, and I am deeply proud to call her my friend. She plans to spend more time now traveling and writing, but she will always be the strongest of advocates for America's rich artistic heritage.                          ____________________
