 President, I am pleased to announce to our colleagues and obviously the leader that we have reached an agreement that will allow us to wrap up the foreign operations bill in relatively short order in the next day or two. I am about to propound a unanimous consent agreement that has been agreed to by the other side.  I ask unanimous consent that the only first-degree amendments remaining in order to the Foreign Operations bill be the following, and that they be subject to second-degrees which are relevant to the first: DeWine No. 1966; Feinstein No. 1977; McConnell No. 1970; one McConnell technical, and two McConnell relevants; a Frist relevant; Allard-Feingold-Leahy, Indonesia; Durbin on AIDS; Bingaman on AIDS; two Leahy relevant; Daschle relevant; McConnell-Leahy cleared managers' amendment.  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above listed amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate. Further, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, which will consist of the subcommittee plus Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd.
