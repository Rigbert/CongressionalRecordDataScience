 President, I wish to recognize a remarkable Vermonter, Rebecca Haslam, who is the recipient of Vermont's 2015 Teacher of the Year Award.  This award is a testament to Rebecca's dedication to her students' academic success and her work to promote the ideals of tolerance and diversity throughout the Burlington School District. Rebecca's leadership in education has helped encourage intellectual and personal growth in so many students. She has earned the respect of the community through her diligence in the classroom and for her innovative approach to learning.  Ms. Haslam's commitment to her students is unwavering, ``They have such a love of learning and they are joyful when they come to school,'' she explained recently. Rebecca provides a welcoming environment for students to learn, fostering their social, academic, and emotional development.  Ms. Haslam sets high expectations and provides the guidance needed in the classroom to ensure the success of all her students. Rebecca is committed to providing both a rigorous curriculum and a nurturing environment. Her academic expectations inspire students of all backgrounds and learning abilities to thrive.  Over the last few decades, Burlington's schools have welcomed students from all over the world, and for such a small city, the district's classrooms are among the most diverse in the country. Rebecca has drawn from her own childhood experiences in an effort to build bridges of understanding between students, faculty, and community members from different backgrounds. Rebecca serves as the Burlington School District's social studies and equity coach and works with teachers from around the district to incorporate the values of cultural competency in their lesson plans. These professional development sessions have served as valuable tools in capturing the interests of students and preparing them to be engaged citizens who prize equality in our increasingly diverse society.  Rebecca is a role model for all Vermonters. She uses her experiences to forge goals and serve as motivation for her students. The work that Rebecca does to create an atmosphere that is conducive to learning is commendable, and I would like to offer her warm congratulations on her award.                          ____________________
