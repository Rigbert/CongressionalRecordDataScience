President, I was a little bit delayed getting to the floor this afternoon because I was in tears, literally, when I heard the news about John. I think of my last long conversation with him just a few weeks ago. I will speak more on the floor about him later.  I came to the Senate with John Glenn. I enjoyed traveling with him, with the anonymity it gave me when people said: there is Colonel Glenn. It was not Senator Glenn, it was Colonel Glenn, even after having been sworn in. We traveled, he and Annie, Marcelle and I, all over the world, but the time I remember the most was the weekend we spent at our old farmhouse in Vermont because they wanted to see the foliage.  We used a seaplane and went flying around, landing in little ponds; taking off, then landing in another one. We went to a trappers convention where everybody was saying, ``It is Colonel Glenn and some bald guy with him,'' and that was me, of course. We went there and then flew back to Montpelier where Marcelle and Annie had been traveling around. John landed the plane in a stiff crosswind. Of course, the pontoons did not help. He had to bring it in sideways. I did not worry. It was John Glenn. Then he turned to me with a big wink and said: I have never been so frightened flying anything in my life. I do not think John ever was frightened at anything, but my heart did stop.  I will speak more about him on the floor, and I appreciate my friend from Iowa yielding so I could speak.  John was one of the best people I ever served with. When I speak of what it was like coming here as a brand new Senator, every time I am asked about that, I talk about the fact that I came here and was sworn in with John Glenn.
