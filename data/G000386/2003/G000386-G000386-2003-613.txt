 President, I rise today to pay tribute to SP James Kiehl, who gave his life for his country as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and to express my deepest sympathy to his family. SP Kiehl was part of the 507th Ordnance Maintenance Company, which was ambushed in southern Iraq. While we still don't know for sure what happened that day, U.S. forces later recovered his body during an operation in which they rescued another member of James's company, PFC Jessica Lynch. My prayers are with James's father in Comfort, TX and James's wife, Jill, Des Moines, IA. Since James left their home in Texas to go to war, Jill has been staying with her parents in Iowa where she is expecting their first child. I can only imagine how difficult this time must be for her. Although their child will never meet James, the child can take comfort knowing that SP Kiehl died a hero and a patriot.  James Kiehl will be missed by a great many people who were a part of his life. I know I join all Iowans in expressing my support for Jill in her time of loss. Just as she will keep James's memory alive, it is our duty to recognize and remember James's sacrifice. In fact, I understand that James Kiehl spoke to his father about his military service saying that he did not want to raise his son in a world of terrorism; and so his service has helped to make us all safer. We must not forget those who have paid the immeasurably high price in the name of freedom. Liberty-loving Americans like James Kiehl deserve our unending gratitudes.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
