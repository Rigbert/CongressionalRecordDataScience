Chairman, I would just make a few comments. One is, I do not believe that Mr. Hobson was on the floor when I thanked him for his sage advice.  As he mentioned in his opening remarks, as I did in mine, he has chaired eight times and has brought bills to the floor eight times on appropriation subcommittees. He has been a great friend and a great teacher. I would suggest that the mistakes I make are my own and not a failure of Mr. Hobson or the ably trained staff on the committee.  I would also simply point out in all seriousness that the differences, so to speak, between Mr. Hobson and myself on MOX are marginal and at a matter of degrees. We are agreed as far as the failure of the Department of Energy and their management practices. We are agreed that they are forewarned that they had better not make one mistake in South Carolina on this project. And I would very strongly emphasize that the moneys for MOX are where they should be and where I certainly want them to remain, and that is within the energy programs of the Department of Energy because MOX no longer has anything to do with proliferation, and if left in that account, would have eaten half of that very important program alive from a monetary standpoint.                              {time}  1115  I would emphasize this is not simply an issue of money, but keeping that money in its appropriate account, and that is in the energy account at the Department of Energy. Again I would thank the gentleman for his words on this project on this House floor.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), the chairman of the full committee.
