 President, I say to my friend, the majority leader, I couldn't agree more. This is a classic example of bipartisanship in the Senate at its very best. We had good bipartisan support last year when we passed a similar bill 90 to 8. This year, I think we are going to finish the job.  I particularly wish to recognize, on this side of the aisle, the extraordinary work of Senator Gregg in achieving his goal on the next bill up to get an important vote that is important not only to him but to many Members on our side of the aisle.  I extend my congratulations to my good friend, Bob Bennett, the ranking member on our side, who has been involved on this from beginning to end and has done an extraordinary job of managing a very complex and difficult bill; to Senator Susan Collins, who has been a leader on the Collins-Lieberman amendment on which we will be voting shortly; to Senator Vitter, Senator Coburn, Senator DeMint, who have been extremely active on this bill, and each of them has an imprint on this final passage measure that we will be dealing with shortly.  Mr. President, I congratulate all Senators for an extraordinary accomplishment, under very difficult circumstances on a broad, bipartisan basis. The patience that was exhibited to allow us to get to this point, I remind everyone, is what produced an opportunity to have no votes tomorrow and no votes on Monday. I think this was worth the wait.  I congratulate the majority leader.  I yield the floor.
