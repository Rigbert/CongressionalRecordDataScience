 I want to ask the Senator from Washington, as I read this, the 1872 mining law put a limitation of five acres on those who mine on our Federal lands to use as a dump site for their mill tailings. If I understand this environmental rider, this says there is no limitation whatsoever--that if this is enacted, these mining companies paying $2.50 an acre and literally taking millions of dollars of minerals out of our land and not paying us for it can then turn around and dump their waste in every direction with no limitation on the number of acres they can cover with this waste.
