Bob was laid to rest this past week. A proud son and representative of the Thumb region of Michigan, including Saginaw, and his hometown of Bay City, please let me extend my deepest sympathies to his devoted wife, Jean, his daughter Sarah and son-in-law Christopher, his two stepchildren Greg and Caroline, and to his nine grandchildren.  Bob was born and raised in 1931 in Kawkawlin, Michigan. He earned his undergraduate degree from Michigan State University in 1953 and subsequently his law degree from the Detroit College of Law in 1959. Ever the public servant, he served in the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955. After his military service, he began his law career as the assistant prosecutor in Bay County from 1960 to 1962. He demonstrated his skill and knowledge of the law and soon thereafter was elected to the Michigan House ofRepresentatives, where he served from 1962 to 1974. During this tenure, he served as the Majority Leader of the House from 1965 to 1966. It was during this time he began to pursue a bill that helped establish the Michigan Lottery. And with this legislative action, so came his nickname ``Bingo Bob''.  Bob was elected to the United States Congress after winning a special election in April of 1974. He arrived in Washington, D.C. in the midst of the Watergate scandal that was shaking the nation. I believe that as a witness to such a troubling time in our republic; it resulted in his development into a successful Congressman. He recognized that the purpose of Congress was to represent and help his fellow constituents, to echo their voices so the concerns of all were heard throughout the halls of Congress.  During his eighteen-year tenure in the House of Representatives, Bob tirelessly served the people in his district. He loved interacting with them whenever he was home to the point where it was not work for him. His example is one from which all in Congress could learn. He rose through the Committee ranks, gaining respect from House Leadership and colleagues, and eventually served on the exclusive House Appropriations Committee as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. Through his work on the Committee, he was able to advance projects in his district such as the EPA research vessel named the ``Lake Guardian''. His wide ranging interests asserted that NASA had a champion for the Hubble Telescope, that veterans were cared for, that local communities received back from the federal government their community development allocations, and that Michigan State agricultural interests were defended in the Farm Bills. After years of dutiful service, Bob retired in 1993.  As his colleague for ten years, I learned a great deal from Bob. He took the time to illustrate what the position entailed and how very important it was to remember who sent a Member to Congress. He often reflected on the power imbalance in U.S. society and worked to give a greater voice for people of ordinary means. After retirement, Rep. Traxler went on to support his alma mater by serving on the Michigan State University Board of Trustees and the Mackinac Island Park Commission. Though Bob was an MSU Spartan and I, a Wisconsin Badger and Michigan Wolverine, he and I were dear colleagues and more importantly, dear friends. He tutored me in the intricacies of the appropriations process, for which I shall always be grateful. Particularly because our region has a tougher lift when competing for federal attention.  I hope it is of some comfort to his loved ones, and to the people that he represented, that his being and indefatigable spirit are now freed from Earth's binds; may his soul rise high and shower our precious world with peace, justice, and good humor from sea to shining sea.  With a heavy heart, golden memories, and abiding appreciation, may I extend my deepest gratitude for the life of Congressman Bob Traxler of Bay City, Michigan, and to his family and the people of Michigan he loved and treasured so dearly, for sharing him with our nation.                          ____________________
