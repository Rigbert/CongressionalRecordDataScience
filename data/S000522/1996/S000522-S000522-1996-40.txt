Mr. Chairman, I yield myself just 10 seconds to respond.  Cheap shots like calling us extreme just do not have any place on this floor. If opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion is extreme then 72 percent of the American public, according to the CBS poll who are against Federal funding for abortion, our extremists. Virtually every poll where it is asked, people overwhelmingly say they do not want their tax dollars used to kill unborn babies.
