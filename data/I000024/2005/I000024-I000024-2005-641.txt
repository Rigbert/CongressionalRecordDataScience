President, I am very happy we finally got to this point. We are operating under unanimous consent at this time.  We will have for the next 45 minutes a discussion and then a vote on the Allen amendment at 12 o'clock. We will have this 45-minute period of time to talk about the highway bill, and hopefully we can confine arguments to that, with the exception of 5 minutes for Senator Landrieu right before the vote takes place.  I yield the floor.
