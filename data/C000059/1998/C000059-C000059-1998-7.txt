Speaker, there is a difference between fact and opinion. I think any objective observer would look at the facts and agree with this conclusion: We have a part-time President and a full-time fund-raiser.  Just consider the facts: Yesterday the President's New York City fund-raiser was his 100th of the year, yesterday, the 100th fund-raiser of the year. Meanwhile he has had only two cabinet meetings. For those of us who have not had higher math, who were raised on whole math, rain forest math or other liberal nonsense, that works out to approximately one cabinet meeting for every 50 fund-raisers. Of course, we are not sure exactly how much important business was discussed at those two cabinet meetings aside from denials, retractions and half apologies.  This Congress has put aside $1.4 trillion for Social Security, passed a balanced budget, IRS reform and tax cuts, making it perhaps the most successful Congress in a generation. Meanwhile the part-time President allows Saddam Hussein to thumb his nose at us, North Korea to threaten its neighbors and a national missile defense system to remain on the shelf.                          ____________________
