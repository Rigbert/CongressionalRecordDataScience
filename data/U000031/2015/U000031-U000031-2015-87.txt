Chairman, this bipartisan bill would strengthen our hand in foreign diplomacy at a time when America has lost its standing on the global stage. By exporting our excess crude oil, we can help our allies seeking a safe and secure supply of energy. Instead of being beholden to OPEC and Russia for their energy needs, they can instead rely on their friends, the United States of America.  Creating jobs, keeping energy affordable, boosting energy production, and improving our energy security--that is what this bill does. I would urge my colleagues to support the Barton bill in a vote later on this morning.
