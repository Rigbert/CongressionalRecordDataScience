President, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by Senator Menendez.  While the Senator from New Jersey no doubt has the best of intentions in working to increase grant funding for high population areas, I do not believe that reducing funding for the majority of States in our great Nation is a viable way to protect against terrorism.  If we, as a country, are going to be adequately prepared for another terrorist attack, we must not forget that we are vulnerable on all fronts. The 36 States that would be negatively impacted by this proposal contain some of our Nation's most valuable assets.  In reducing funding to States such as Kansas, this amendment tosses aside the risks to agriculture that supports our Nation's food supply, the oil and petroleum facilities that provide invaluable energy in this time of need, and the many Federal buildings and places of national significance that are scattered throughout our great Nation.  We cannot let ourselves believe that if we only protect large cities and high population states, we will be safe from the devious and calculating minds of those who wish us harm. One need only to look to Oklahoma City in this regard. Rather, preparing for what we expect in densely populated areas is a surefire way to be shocked and horrified should the inexplicable and unthinkable happen again.  This legislation has been considered in this Senate before, and it was defeated soundly. To add it now as anamendment disregards the hard work many have done to negotiate a funding formula that most benefits our entire country. We cannot afford to compromise the security of an entire Nation for the benefit of a few areas.
