 Mr. McCARTHY. So you know the importance.  What I would say to the gentleman is: let's work with this administration.  As we sat in our meeting this week with leaders of other countries, I thought their advice to us was good advice: let's not say what this is not, because we may get political points with one another, but it puts them in harm's way, and they know what the truth of this is.  I think you and I agree on a lot of different things, and we are cordial with one another when we disagree, and I think this is an area in which sometimes we may disagree, but sometimes we have shown we could agree.                              {time}  1115  I know you want to keep America safe, and I know we want to keep America safe.  I also know it is a brand new administration. I also know that when I go down to that White House--you have been there with me--there is not a lot of staff there. I know there are going to be a few hiccups along the way. I am going to work with them. I am going to help them, and I want you to help us help them as well.
