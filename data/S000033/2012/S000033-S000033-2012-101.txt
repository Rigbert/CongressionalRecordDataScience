 The issue we are talking about now is not only trying to reverse global warming and save the planet, what we are talking about is creating, over a period of years, millions of good-paying jobs.  We may not know it from some media reports, but the fact is the solar industry in this country is exploding. All over this country, we are seeing more and more installations of solar panels, we are seeing the production of solar. One of the issues I think Senator Udall is referring to is whether the United States of America will be a leader in sustainable energy or are we going to give that whole enormous economic area over to China.  I know the Senator and I are in agreement that we believe American workers can manufacture those panels. We think American workers can install those panels.  We also understand it is not just solar, it is wind; that these industries need some of the help that the fossil fuel industry has been receiving for years. I think we will also be talking about the whole issue of energy efficiency and weatherization, which in my State is enormously important. We are creating jobs, saving consumers money, as we retrofit their homes and cut back on their use of fuel.  So, yes, I say to the Senator, we are talking about a major jobs issue.
