There are two reports included in this legislation designed to address those specific problems. The first report will examine the status of amendments to NFPA 58 thatwill provide to local emergency response personnel information concerning the off-site effects of accidental releases of those substances exempted from listing by section 3 of this legislation. We strongly encourage all the parties involved in this NFPA amendment process to work together in good faith and in a timely manner. The second report is designed to examine the sufficiency of the information local emergency response personnel receive to help them respond to chemical accidents. Specifically, the report will address the level of compliance with all federal and state requirements for submission of this information to emergency response personnel. Also, the report will examine the adequacy of the methods for delivering this information to emergency response personnel.
