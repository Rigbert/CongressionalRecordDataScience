Chairman, I am glad the gentleman from Indiana brought up these points. I thought I would come on down as a person who was in the restaurant business or used to be in the restaurant business before I came to this body.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The time of the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder) has expired.  (By unanimous consent, Mr. Souder was allowed to proceed for 3 additional minutes.)
