Speaker, today I commend Kindergarten Teacher Susie Haas, oneof only five, who will be inducted into the National Teachers Hall of Fame in 2000. I am particularly proud, because Susie teaches at one of my own hometown elementary schools in Corona, California--the John Adams Elementary School. In fact, I went to school with Susie. Susie, I promise not to tell any stories if you'll do the same for me!  Susie says, and I quote, that her ``philosophical beliefs concerning how children make sense of the world around them are the foundation of the instructional program I have created for my students. I believe all children deserve to be taught in an environment that will promote, value, and nurture their natural desire to learn.''  Susie's own teaching philosophy seems like common sense--straightforward and easy. However, it is the hands-on practice of her philosophy that has made such an incredible impact on all of the children and parents with whom she has come into contact. As a result, Susie has been recognized numerous times by her students, colleagues, community, state and nation. In 1999 alone, Susie was a Disney American Teacher of the Year Honoree, California Teacher of the Year, one of the Inland Empire Magazine's ``Teachers Making a Difference,'' Walmart Teacher of the Year, Riverside County Teacher of the Year and Corona-Norco Unified School District Teacher of the Year.  And Susie has not stopped her work at the door of her own classroom. She has written a variety of documents and books and given seminars across the United States to share her expertise in teaching, most significantly in literacy instruction. The Lap-Reading program created by Susie has educated thousands of parents across the nation on how they can boost their own child's school performance by offering monthly ideas on how parents can increase reading at home. For her students, she has created Spot, a stuffed classroom mascot, who travels home with each child two nights each year. Spot has done almost everything from birthday parties to dentist visits. All of the adventures have been recounted in drawings and writings by each child into Spot's personal journal.  Mr. Speaker, as we debate the need to reform our education system this year and years to come, I ask my colleagues to look in their own backyard for advice from teachers, parents and students. They are living and breathing the adventures of literacy, the key to success for all future generations. To Susie Haas, I offer my deepest appreciation. Her passion and commitment to teaching America's next generation is truly awesome and inspiring.                          ____________________
