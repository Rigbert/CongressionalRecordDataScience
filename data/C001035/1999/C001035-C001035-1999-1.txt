President, for the information of all Senators, a cloture vote will occur at 12 noon on Tuesday, January 25, 2000, on the pending bankruptcy bill, in an effort to keep the remaining amendments to the bill germane to the issue of bankruptcy. Other legislation and executive calendar items could be considered during the session of the Senate on that Monday. However, votes are not expected to occur.  I deeply thank all of my colleagues for their patience and cooperation in the final hours of the first session of the 106th Congress. I think we are very fortunate to have the leaders that we have in the Senate. On their behalf, and on my own behalf, I wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season.                          ____________________
