Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Dr. Geraty is one of these individuals. On June 7, 2007, he will be honored as the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce's Citizen of the Year at a celebration dinner.  Dr. Larry Geraty has led an impressive and interesting life. As a child he traveled with his missionary family who lived and worked in China, Burma, Hong Kong, Lebanon, England, Germany, France, Israel, California, Maryland, Michigan and Massachusetts. After his young travels, he obtained his bachelors degree from Pacific Union College and went on to the Theological Seminary at Andrews University. Larry served as a pastor before being invited to join the Andrews Theological Seminary faculty. He studied Hebrew Bible and biblical archaeology at Harvard where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree. Dr. Geraty then returned to Andrews Theological Seminary as Professor of Archaeology and History of Antiquity where he taught for 13 years. He also led a series of major archaeological expeditions to the Middle East.  In his distinguished academic career, Dr. Geraty has received many honors including a Fulbright Fellowship and serving as advisor on archaeology to former Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan. Dr. Geraty has served as a leader on several societies such as the Vice President of the American Center of Oriental Research in Amman, Jordan. He has lectured all over the world and is a contributing author to several publications.  In 1985, Dr. Geraty became President of the Atlantic Union College in South Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he earned the reputation as a progressive academic administrator. For over 14 years, Dr. Geraty has served as President and Professor of Archeology at La Sierra University in Riverside, California. During his time in Riverside, Dr. Geraty has become a staple of the community through his leadership and generosity. He served on several boards including the Greater Riverside Chambers of Commerce, United Way of the Inland Valleys, Mayors Higher Education/Business Council, Raincross Club, Monday Morning Group, World Affairs Council of Inland Southern California, Riverside Arts Council and the Riverside Youth Action Executive Policy Board.  In 2000, Dr. Geraty received the P.E. MacAllister Award for Excellence in Field Archeology from the American Schools of Oriental research, and in 2001, he received the Charles Elliott Weniger Award for Excellence at Pacific Union College.  In light of all Dr. Geraty has done for the community of Riverside, including serving as the 2006-2007 Chairman of the Board, the Riverside Chambers of Commerce has named Dr. Geraty their Citizen of the Year. Dr. Geraty's tireless passion for community service, education and faith has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
