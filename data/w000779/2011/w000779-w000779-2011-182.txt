President, my state of Oregon is blessed with a tremendous number of generous and philanthropic individuals. But I would like to take a moment today to single out one of them and recognize her years of dedication to helping others.  Vickie Beaver of Lebanon, OR, has been elected president of the International Association of Rebekah Assemblies by her fellow members. The town of Lebanon and the State of Oregon have benefited greatly from Vickie's civic and philanthropic work. Now, in her position as president, she can do the same for people all across the U.S. I am honored to know of such an exemplary leader in the State I proudly serve.  This is nothing new for our State. Vickie is the fifth Oregonian to serve as national president of the Rebekahs, and the second Lebanon, OR, native.  The Rebekahs, along with their partners the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, are a 192-year-old service organization with more than 10,000 lodges spanning over 25 countries around the world. The aim of the Rebekahs and Odd Fellows is the simple but awe-inspiring goal of making the world a better place to live. It is a daunting goal that both organizations take very seriously. Members are involved in a variety of different relief projects, including the Educational Foundation which provides scholarships and loans for students aspiring to go to college, the SOS Children's Village which is an orphanage project in Cambodia and the Living Legacy project which plants trees and enhances the environment of neighborhoods. The organization's philosophy is that friendship, love and truth, can create peace and harmony in the world.  Vickie has been active in the Rebekahs for more than 30 years, continuing a family legacy of service that goes back four generations. Within Rebekahs, Vickie is known for her commitment to the community and hard work in support of the Rebekah initiatives. It is this dedication that led to her election to various leadership positions in the organization over the years, and, finally, as president. During her tenure as the guiding spirit of the Educational Foundation, she worked closely with the Lebanon School District as well as with nationally recognized organizations such as the Boys and Girls Club. Through its grants, the foundation provides deserving young men and women the opportunity to attend college, something they otherwise would not be able to do because of financial limitations. Since its creation in 1927 with the goal of educating future generations, the foundation has provided loans and grants to over 3,500 college-bound students. The Rebekahs believe that education is the foundation of a more enlightened community, and has made it their mission to offer that gift to deserving young men and women around the country.  Vickie's genuine concern for the well being of the young adults in her community certainly strengthened the Educational Foundation's outreach to the students. I am sure Vickie will bring the same dedication to her new position as president of the Rebekah Assemblies.  I would like to once again congratulate Ms. Vickie Beaver, an inspiring leader from the town of Lebanon in my State of Oregon. Vickie's work clearly embodies the Rebekah Assemblies' and Odd Fellows efforts to make the community a better place for America's youth to live, grow and prosper. I know that she will take her new role in the Rebekah Assemblies very seriously, and I have no doubt in my mind that she will do an exceptional job.                          ____________________
