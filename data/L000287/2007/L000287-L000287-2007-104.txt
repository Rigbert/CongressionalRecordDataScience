Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Taxpayer Protection Act of 2007.  I would like to commend Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for bringing this bill to the floor and for working to simplify our tax policies.  Today's Tax Code has become so complex that it takes more than 25 hours to complete an itemized tax return. That is about 10 hours longer than in 1988.  Small business owners will also benefit significantly from this legislation by streamlining the process that married couples use to file returns.  Our reliance on technology and the openness of the Internet is greater than ever, and we should improve security to defend American taxpayers from identity theft.  I am pleased that provisions in the Taxpayer Protection Act increase on-line security for individuals and allow them to have better recourse in the event of a crime.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1677.
