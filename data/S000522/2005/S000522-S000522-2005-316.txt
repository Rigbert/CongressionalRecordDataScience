Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, H. Res. 195 is a resolution introduced by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) which recognizes the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Western Bohemia by American forces.  I strongly support the resolution which recognizes the extraordinary sacrifice by American soldiers to free Western Bohemia from Nazi control. This was the last major offensive undertaken in Europe during World War II. The campaign was led by General George Patton and involved 18 divisions and approximately 500,000 men. It resulted in the liberation of Pilsen, which was then located in what was known as Czechoslovakia on May 5, 1945.  The liberation of Western Bohemia was decisive in leading to the ultimate surrender of Nazi forces and a quick end to World War II in Europe.  The resolution also recognizes the continued friendship between the people of the United States and the peopleof the Czech Republic. In fact, in honor of the liberation of their city, the citizens of Pilsen will be dedicating a statue of General Patton on the 60th anniversary of the liberation of their city and all of Western Bohemia.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
