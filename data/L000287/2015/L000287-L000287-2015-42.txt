Speaker, I rise today in memory of Howard Calvin Edwards. Mr. Edwards served his country in the United States Army, was respected in his community, and dedicated his life to his family.  Mr. Edwards was born on April 24, 1928, the youngest of John and Cora Edwards' 10 children, and he grew up in Woodland, North Carolina. He loved everything about school and thrived as a student and an athlete. He played basketball and ran track, but he found the most success on the football gridiron.  Mr. Edwards continued his education at Virginia State University and Howard University. A proud soldier, Mr. Edwards served his country in the United States Army and loved the experience of traveling the world. After completing his tour, he relocated to the Washington, DC, area to be near to his older sister, Mabel. It was here that he met his wife, Mary, who was one of his sister's best customers. Their love story was one for the ages. He succeeded in his tireless pursuit to earn her hand in marriage, and their 53 years of marriage produced three children, Kenny, Robert, and Yvette.  Mr. Edwards retired after many years of working as a guard at the National Gallery of Art here in Washington. He also worked for several years in security at the YWCA. He will be remembered within the community as a man of great dignity and generosity to all who had a need. In his signature hat and tie, he stood tall, walked straight, and greeted everyone with a broad smile and the love of God. He passed from this life on February 10, 2015 at age 86.  I offer my sincerest condolences to Mr. Edwards' beloved wife, Mary Edwards; his son, Bobby; three grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; his nieces and nephews; and a host of friends and neighbors. They are all in my thoughts during this very difficult time.                          ____________________
