 President, yesterday Democrats voted once again to protect politicians by blocking Homeland Security funding. I do not understand why they would want to block the Senate from even debating a bill to fund Homeland Security. It really does not make sense. You would think our Democratic friends would at least want to give the Senate an opportunity to make improvements to the bill, if they want to make such improvements. Why would our friends want to stand tall for the ability of politicians to do things President Obama himself has described as ``unwise and unfair''? Why would our friends go to the mat to protect the political class from the consequences of ``overreach'' that President Obama himself has referred to as ``ignoring the law''?  Well, here is the good news. There is a way forward. There is a way to end this Democratic filibuster. All it requires is a little common sense and a little Democratic courage. Remember, several Democrats previously indicated unease with the idea of overreaching in ways President Obama has seemed to imply would ``violate the law.'' So now is the time to back up those words. Now is the time for our friends on the other side of good conscience to vote with us to break this party's filibuster of Homeland Security funding and help us protect American democracy.  I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed to H.R. 240 be agreed to and that it be in order for the managers or their designees to offer amendments in alternating fashion, with the majority manager or his designee being recognized to offer the first amendment.
