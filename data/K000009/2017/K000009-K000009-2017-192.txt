Speaker, Julius Evola has been described as one of the most influential Fascist racists in Italian history, admired by the Nazi SS, its commander, Heinrich Himmler, and Benito Mussolini. Nazi SS Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler was most certainly responsible for the Holocaust.  Hitler's madness obsessed over creating an Aryan nation. Joseph Stalin's depraved dream of conquest knew no bounds. Stalin even conscripted Jews to lead hunts to exterminate other ethnic groups, and then killed the Jews when the mission was completed. The level of Stalin's depravity is difficult for sane people to understand.  Violent anti-Semitism and hatred did not end with the defeat of Nazi Germany and the ultimate collapse of the Communist Soviet Union. We can observe a resurgence in certain places in Europe and, sadly, even in isolated incidents here in the United States.                              {time}  1930  History tells us that the rising anti-Semitic violence is not just a threat to civil society today, but the future of free people everywhere. The recent anti-Semitic terrorist incidents in Paris at the Bataclan, Jewish-owned enterprises, or Nazi symbols appearing in hateful situations here in our own beloved country demand that decent people find peaceful means to stare down hate.  Timothy Snyder's masterful book ``Bloodlands'' documents the 6 million souls of the Holocaust and 8 million souls of martyrdom and murder. The Nazis established killing centers for efficient mass execution. These killing centers, also referred to as ``extermination camps'' or ``death camps,'' were almost exclusively ``death factories.'' German Schutzstaffel and police murdered nearly 2.7 million Jews in these killing centers either by asphyxiation with poison gas or by shooting.  For the non-Jewish populations of Europe, the 8 million non-Jewish victims of Nazi and communist campaigns of mass murder include Romas, Soviet prisoners of war, Aktion T4 patients, Ukrainian Holodomor famine victims, Serbs, the disabled, the LGBTQ communities, and others known only to God.  There were also unfathomable crimes against entire nations, as Poland and Belarus were both slated for complete extinction. Poland lost an astounding 20 percent of its entire population, with 6 million killed in the war, and Belarus, though smaller in population, lost 25 percent of its population.  In Poland, leaders were annihilated. Many members of the Catholic clergy were either threatened with deportation, kept in custody, or sent to camps. The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed, for nearly a fifth of all priests--over 3,000--were killed between 1939 and 1945, most in concentration camps.  From 1932 to 1933, Joseph Stalin's forced famine engulfed much of present-day Ukraine and its eastern flank. The heaviest losses were in Ukraine--which is struggling for its freedom today--which had been the most productive agricultural area of the Soviet Union. Stalin was determined to crush all evidence of Ukrainian pride. As with Poland's leadership, the famine was accompanied by a devastating purge of all of Ukraine's intelligentsia.  Millions of peasants were condemned to death by starvation. Troops and secret police units waged a merciless war against peasants who refused to give up their grain. Any man, woman, or child caught taking even a handful of grain from a collective farm could be, and often were, executed or deported to work camps. Stalin's system of internal passports and brutal secret police forced collectivization of the land to Communist-run production.  After a long search through history and recordkeeping, I can personally give testimony and even learned that the Catholic Church located in today's Ukraine, in which our maternal grandparents were married, held a dark secret. Joseph Stalin's secret police, the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the NKVD, killed 168 people in its basement as Stalin's Black Raven trucks drove the innocents to their death.  Historians continue to seek truth even until today about what happened. Their painstaking research includes information from the Soviet archives. Though some people try to erase history or ignore it, others work diligently to record it and learn from it.  I recall how fondly our grandmother spoke of Jewish storekeepers in the region from which she emigrated, welcoming her before and after church on Sunday and telling her to change into her church shoes there before attending mass and after her 5-mile hike from her village and the 5-mile hike back. The Jewish storekeeper would always give her a piece of candy.  There are other Members here tonight that wish to speak. I am so grateful for their presence here tonight because we are the bearers of liberty's torch.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, (Mr. Crowley), the great leader of the Democratic Caucus, and I thank him for taking time from his busy schedule to be here with us.
