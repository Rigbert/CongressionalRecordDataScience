Valerie Hill, a 31-year veteran of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, was recently awarded the 2010 ``ATHENA'' Award of the Inland Valley for being a valued role model who represents excellence in her profession, extensive community service, and generous mentoring. The ATHENA Awards program, which was created in 1982 and is an extension of local Chamber of Commerce's, recognizes outstanding professional and business women in the community.  Valerie is the first woman to be undersheriff of Riverside County. Prior to this appointment, she received a bachelor's degree in business management and went on to be a female hostage negotiator field training officer and assistant sheriff. She has served in Lake Elsinore, Jurupa, Moreno Valley, and Riverside, where she has mentored many women in the department.  Valerie has received a number of awards recognizing her accomplishments. In 2006, she was president of the Southern California Jail Managers Association, and in 2007, she received the lifetime achievement award from the Law Enforcement Appreciation Committee. In 2002, she was a YWCA Woman of Achievement, in 2004 she was recognized as Inland Empire Magazine's Woman Who Makes a Difference, and in 2005 received the Gold Key Award from Soroptimist International.  She was president of Operation Safe House and the Riverside Area Rape Crisis Center and also served as chair for the YWCA's Evening of Achievement event. Additionally, Valerie makes time with her family to serve hot meals to the homeless and is an active member of Kiwanis of Riverside.  Valerie Hill's tireless passion for community and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Valerie a fellow community member and American.
