Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to recommit.  Good oversight is done by congressional leadership, not by sunsets. There has been good oversight over the PATRIOT Act right from the beginning. The Committee on the Judiciary has spent a lot of time overseeing the Justice Department, with oversight letters, questions that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and I have sent jointly to the Justice Department, Inspector General reports, and this is the result of it: Almost two feet of responses.  And what have these responses said? First of all, there has been no provision, of the 16 sunsetted provisions, that have been found unconstitutional by any Federal court in the Nation. The Inspector General's report has found no civil liberties violations under the PATRIOT Act, and I think that the question we ought to ask ourselves today is whether we should weigh the potential for abuse of this law against the actual record of abuse. There is no actual record of abuse with all of the oversight that we have been doing.  Now, we have had 12 hearings on the PATRIOT Act, the 16 sunsetted provisions. Thirteen of the 16 provisions are noncontroversial. There have not been witnesses that have appeared before the committee that have said that there are problems, and that includes the provision that tore down the wall after 9/11 that prevented the CIA and the FBI from exchanging intelligence information. This motion to recommit will bring that wall back up in 2009. I think we ought to look at the record. We ought to look at the actual record of abuse. There has been none.  Only 5 percent of our legislation is sunsetted. Why sunset legislation where there has been no actual record of abuse and there has been vigorous oversight?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).
