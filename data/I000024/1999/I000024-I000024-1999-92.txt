It totally contradicts what the Senator from California is saying. They recommend:       Action by Congress to remove the current 2 percent oxygen      requirement to ensure that the adequate fuel supplies can be      blended in a cost-effective manner, while quickly reducing      usage of MTBE.  What she is trying to do is actually fill that 2 percent with ethanol.  Another recommendation says:       Accelerate air and water affects research on other fuel      components likely to take MTBE's place such as . . .  It names ethanol, aromatics, and alkylates. It says don't do it until we do the research.  That is the recommendation of this blue-ribbon committee.  Last, it bothers me when people use scare tactics. This blue-ribbon committee said:       The great majority of these detections to date have been      well below levels of public health concern with approximately      1 percent rising to levels above 20 parts per billion.  I certainly concur with the recommendation of the Senator from Texas. Let Members have a chance to hold hearings on the results of the blue-ribbon committee. Nothing would be lost.
