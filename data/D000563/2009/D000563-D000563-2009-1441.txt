 As the Senator from North Dakota indicated, it has been debated at length and passed unanimously, for the most part--Democrats and Republicans--without objection, voting for all the contents. And now there is objection from the Republican side of the aisle.  The obvious question is, What has changed? What is different? Well, there is only one thing different. We have a new President, a new President and a new administration, facing an economic struggle, a President who is asking for help from both sides of the aisle that we should give. We need to work together. He was not successful in finding House Republicans to support him in the efforts for the stimulus package. Only a handful voted for this measure when it came up in the House on the Republican side. We are hoping that at least some will finally step forward on the Republican side to pass this bill to keep the Government operating.  What good does it do for us to shortchange the Securities and Exchange Commission at this moment in history, when we all know our savings, our retirement investments, 401(k)s, IRAs, are in peril because of a descending stock market, where there is question about the confidence that consumers, investors have in this agency? I put additional funds in there, through my appropriation, to make certain we have the integrity which we deserve in this marketplace; the same for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Those who would argue, as Senator McCain does in his continuing resolution amendment, that we do not need additional resources in these key agencies that protect investors and savers, they are just plain wrong. A vote for the McCain amendment is a vote to go back further to those days when these agencies were not up to the challenges they face. Some of that was conscious, where they ignored demands and warnings related to Mr. Madoff and others. Some was inadvertent in the CFTC, where they did not have the people and the equipment and the computers and the technology to follow these trades.  How in the world can we, in good conscience, say we are not going to adequately fund these agencies, while millions of American families count on us to do that? They make the choice on investments. They trust us to make certain those investments are transparent and there is accountability.  I would say to my friend from North Dakota, when we went through this, month after month, week after week, day after day in the committee, we had bipartisan support all the way. Now that we have a new President of a different political party, the other side of the aisle is raising questions--questions they did not raise for 8 months. Now they are being raised. That is unfortunate. But we are prepared to answer those questions.                          ____________________
