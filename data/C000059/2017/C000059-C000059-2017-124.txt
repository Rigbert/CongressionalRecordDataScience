Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Crossroads Christian Church, located in my hometown of Corona, California, as it celebrates a major milestone in the church's history. On this date in 1892, a small group of about ten people joined together to worship in a small building in Corona, establishing the Crossroads Church. Now, 125 years later, Crossroads Christian Church continues to be a house of worship in Corona, though the church has grown a little larger than that original group of ten in 1892.  In fact, Crossroads has seen tremendous growth since its founding. Within its first year, the church was already in need of a larger space and looking for a new building. The growth experienced in those early days of Crossroads would become a trend over the next 125 years. Crossroads experienced moves and the building of larger churches in the 1960s under the leadership of Pastor Ted Smith, in the early 1980s under the leadership of Pastor Tim Coop, and most recently in 1993 under the leadership of Pastor Barry McMurtrie.  Today, the Crossroads Christian Church and the Crossroads Christian School are located at a beautiful site, where Kellogg Avenue meets Ontario Avenue in Corona. Together, the church and the school are integral parts of the Corona community and touch the lives of families far beyond those who attend them. Crossroads continues to take an active role reaching out to young people throughout the region and encouraging them to touch the lives of others with simple acts of care and kindness.  Mr. Speaker, over the past 125 years Crossroads Christian Church has made an invaluable impact in the lives of a countless number of members of our community. I join with everyone at the church in celebrating this remarkable anniversary and I look forward to the next 125 years. May God continue to bless Crossroads Christian Church and all of the people who worship there, and may God bless America.                          ____________________
