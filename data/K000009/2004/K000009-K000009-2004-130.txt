Speaker, I am submitting the following article for the Record.       Significant irregularities and improprieties have been      found in the on-going presidential campaign in Ukraine by an      election monitoring delegation of former Members of Congress      in the Kharkiv, Poltava, and Sumy oblasts.       Five former U.S. Congressmen--John Conlan (R-AZ), Arlen      Erdahl (R-MN), Jack Hightower (D-TX), Gregory Laughlin (R-     TX), Andrew Maguire (D-NJ), and Tom Sawyer (D-OH)--traveled      to Ukraine on July 25-31, 2004 to monitor presidential      election campaign activities in the region. The communities      visited were: Kupiansk, Merefa, and Vovchansk in the Kharkiv      oblast; Chutove, Dykanka and Karlivka in the Poltava oblast;      and Lebedyn, Okhtyrka and Trostianets in the Sumy oblast.      These former congressmen were registered by the Central      Election Commission (CEC) of Ukraine and accorded all the      rights and privileges provided to foreign observers by      Ukraine's law on presidential elections.       Ukraine is a signatory of the Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and therefore welcomes      international observers to help secure a free and fair      election. The congressmen's election monitoring activities      included meetings with representatives of the main political      parties, Ukrainian government officials, Central Election      Committee, and U.S. officials in Kyiv. In the regions, the      congressmen met with local government officials,      representatives of NGOs, political parties, the media, and      citizens, who shared their views and experiences of the      political process in their respective communities.key findings of the first delegation to the Kharkiv, Poltava, and Sumy                                 oblasts       Generally, in the communities visited, local officials were      very cooperative and generously shared their time and      opinions with the delegation. Local officials provided space      for meetings and assisted in extending invitations to      representatives of political parties, media, and NGOs to meet      with the delegation. The delegation does note, however, that      there were occasions when opposition parties were not      informed of the meetings and, thus, were denied an      opportunity to express their views and have their respective      cases heard.       In conversations with participants in the meetings attended      and in conversations with ordinary Ukrainian citizens, the      delegation was appalled to find that an overwhelming number      do not expect the outcome of the election to be fairly      decided. Those that hold this view often reply that the      outcome has already been determined and that the vote count      will support that determination. Independent polls verify      that around 70 percent of the population believes this. That      reinforces the view that every effort must be made by      observers to ensure that the vote count is accurate and fair.       While the delegation cannot investigate the allegations      made, it does note with deep concern the repeated allegations      of the systematic use of the government's administrative      resources to bring pressure upon voters to support the      candidate endorsed by government authorities. These reports      are too numerous, consistent, and from too many different      locations to be set aside; in fact they appear to the      delegation to constitute a pattern of officially sanctioned      political activity by government employees that is in      violation of Ukraine's law on presidential elections.       The delegation is very concerned about these reports and      appeals to the Ukrainian government to ensure that all local      government officials strictly adhere to the law. Allegations      include: threats regarding loss of jobs predominate; police      preventing buses and automobiles from traveling to opposition      rallies; forcing government workers, teachers, and hospital      workers to sign petitions for pro-government candidate,      Viktor Yanukovych; forcing regional councils to pass      resolutions in support of Yanukovych; teachers and      agricultural workers given quotas to collect signatures for      Yanukovych, under threat to lose vacation time or jobs;      students pressured to distribute Yanukovych literature; even      patients have been threatened with discharge from hospitals      and denial of medical services if they fail to sign and      pledge to vote for Yanukovych.       In every community the delegation visited, they were      greeted with hope and anticipation of a brighter tomorrow.      They welcomed contact with the wider world and were anxious      to host foreign visitors to show off their country and its      potential. They deserve an opportunity to go to the polls and      freely express their views and to be secure in the knowledge      that all their votes are counted accurately in accordance      with the law of Ukraine.       The delegation is a fact-finding mission and will report      its findings to Ukraine's Central Election Commission, the      U.S. Government, European governments, international      organizations and the public through release to the mass      media. The delegation does not support any candidate or      political party and is only interested in helping ensure that      the presidential election is free and fair.       Programming is organized by the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation      (USUF), in partnership with the U.S. Association of Former      Members of Congress (USAFMC) and is funded by the United      States Agency for International Development (USAID).       The Foundation's second delegation traveled in August to      the Cherkasy, Kyiv, and Kirovohrad oblasts and also included      parliamentarians from Spain and the Netherlands. The third      delegation, comprised of congressmen and a former member of      the German Bundestag, traveled to the Kherson region during      the week of September 19-25, 2004 to observe election      campaign activities in the Kherson, Mykolayiv, and      Zaporizhzhya oblasts.                          ____________________
