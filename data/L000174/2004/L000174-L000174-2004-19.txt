President, I rise today to pay tribute to a legend of a man who has spent his career dedicated to working for the great people of South Carolina. There is nothing small about Senator Hollings. From his height, to his storied career, to his large booming voice and southern drawl you can always hear calling ``yea'' or ``nay'' during rollcall votes, Senator Hollings is a giant. A reporter once said that if you sent to central casting for a Senator, you got Fritz Hollings. I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Hollings for all 30 of my years in the Senate and during that time he, and his wife Peatsy, have been dear friends.  Before setting foot in this Chamber, Senator Hollings had amassed a career that any man would be proud of. He attended the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina, and upon his graduation in 1942 accepted a commission in the U.S. Army. He served our country honorably in the campaigns in North Africa and Europe during World War II, and received a Bronze Star for his valor. Senator Hollings began his political career when he was 26 as he was elected to the South Carolina House of Represenatives. During his second term he was voted Speaker pro tempore and a short 4 years later he was elected lieutenant governor. In 1958 at age 36 was elected as Governor, the youngest Governor of South Carolina in the 20th Century.  Senator Hollings was first elected to Senate in 1966 and has subsequently been re-elected to six additional terms, making him the ninth longest serving Member of this body. Throughout his entire career the Senator has been a leader, fighting to protect our ports, our neighborhoods and American manufacturing jobs. He has been an outspoken advocate for fiscal responsibility, civil rights and against hunger.  In 1974, he led the creation of the Women, Infants and Children--WIC--nutritional assistance program. In 1978, he sponsored legislation and helped secure funding for South Carolina's first National Park, Congaree Swamp. He has stood tall in protecting our oceans and coasts, he authored the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Oceans Act of 2000, which created the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.  Since 1967 Senator Hollings has been a member of the Commerce Committee and from his coauthorship of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that deregulated the telecom industry to his work on the FTC ``Do Not Call List,'' he has consistently looked out for the best interest of consumers. In 2000, Senator Hollings and I, along with Senators Sarbanes and Wyden, were successful in beating back the wholesale federal preemptions of State consumer protection laws during negotiations of the E-Commerce bill which I sponsored.  Senator Hollings is the longest serving Democrat on the Budget Committee, and is the only Democrat to have served on the committee every year since its creation. In 1984 Senator Hollings collaborated with Senators Phil Gramm and Warren Rudman to establish the Gramm-Hollings-Rudman deficit reduction legislation that helped reduce the deficit by $70 billion in its first year of enactment.  I have had the pleasure to serve with Senator Hollings on the Appropriations Committee, where he has served since 1971, and is currently 3rd highest ranking member. From this position he has helped important initiatives both in South Carolina and nationally, such as a cause I have always strongly supported, the battle against cancer. Senator Hollings helped create a nationwide program to screen women for breast and cervical cancer and worked to establish a cancer center at the Medical University of South Carolina that bears his name.  Earlier this fall more than 600 friends came together to celebrate Senator Hollings's career in the Senate, an event that raised $2 million for the Hollings Cancer Center. We toasted his accomplishments and his incredible career of public service that has spanned more than five decades in State and national politics. I joined this body in 1974 and I immediately learned that Senator Hollings is a man that always speaks his mind. His straightforward manner, dynamic personality and unwavering integrity are qualities that make me proud to call him my friend. I have valued his friendship and his camaraderie over these past 30 years, and I wish Fritz and his wife Peatsy the best of lives in their beloved South Carolina.                              john breaux  Mr. President, the State of Louisiana has a proud history of sending remarkable public figures to serve in the Senate. Louisiana has elected leaders that have been influential in guiding the direction of our country. Our colleague John Breaux is a man from this same mold. For more than 30 years the senior Senator from Louisiana has represented his State in Washington, with 18 years as a Member of this body, and 14 years of service in the House of Representatives. In that time, he has always been willing to reach across the aisle to bring our colleagues together and his leadership has produced a list of impressive legislative accomplishments.  As chairman and then as ranking member of the Special Committee on Aging, Senator Breaux has fought tirelessly for the rights of older Americans, working to reform and protect both Social Security and Medicare. The senior Senator from Louisiana has also provided strong leadership within the Senate during his 8-year tenure as deputy chief whip. His repeated election to this position speaks to the respect that our colleagues have for Senator Breaux's ability to routinely bring together Members with differing opinions to build a consensus.  One of Senator Breaux's lasting legacies will be the leading role he has taken with regard to environmental conservation. In 1990, the Senator authored the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act, which provides for the restoration of the vital coastal wetlands of Louisiana and has since become known as the Breaux Act. This legislation was passed during his first term in the Senate and has since been renewed. More recently, Senator Breaux has supported legislation that would help protect coastal regions from the impact of offshore oil and gas exploration.  In our many years of service together, Senator Breaux and I have had the opportunity to work closely on a wide range of issues. We both have been actively involved in telecommunications legislation, and collaborated on legislation that authorized reform of the telephone industry. I am particularly appreciative of Senator Breaux's unwavering support for legislation opposing the use of antipersonnel landmines, an issue of great significance to me personally and to the safety of millions of people around the world.  I am proud of the body of legislation that Senator Breaux and I advanced together throughout our shared time in the Senate. I commend Senator Breaux for his dedication to being a watchdog for American seniors, for his legacy of environmental protection in Louisiana, and for his record of public service on behalf of his fellow Louisianans. The Senate and the people of Louisiana are losing a dedicated public servant and exceptional leader. I congratulate the Senator on a remarkable congressional career and wish him continued success in his future endeavors.  On a personal level, John and Lois Breaux are good friends. Marcelle and I share the joy of telling grandchildren stories--and even of borrowing Mardi Gras costumes. I quickly realized in wearing one that you needed the special Cajun flavor of Louisiana to carry it off. John can do that one day at a Mardi Gras party and the next day handle on the floor the most complex issue facing the Finance Committee. He is a Senator's Senator.
