  Mr. DeFAZIO. In his last year, George Bush has constructed a monument to his Presidency that will last for generations to come. He not only doubled our national debt in 8 short years; as he goes out the door, he'sleaving America with a $1.2 trillion deficit. That means we will borrow $3.2 billion a day, $2.2 million a minute. It's unfathomable. That legacy of profligacy based on trickle down and bailouts has brought our economy to its knees.  It would have been one thing if he borrowed the money to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, to build new schools to educate our kids, to give us a sustainable energy future. But, no, the money has been squandered in bailouts for Wall Street and an unnecessary war in the Middle East.  And now it's up to us, this Congress, the Democrats, to give us a recovery package that will put Americans back to work and rebuild our country. We have to reject the policies of the Bush years. No more tax giveaways. Let's rebuild the infrastructure of this country, put people back to work, borrow the money for a purpose, not more waste.                          ____________________
