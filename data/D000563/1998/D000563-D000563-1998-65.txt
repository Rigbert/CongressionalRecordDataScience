Neither our Republican colleagues in the House nor the credit card companies are likely to be as enthusiastic as he or I about the efforts at cooperation and compromise that went into crafting the Senate bill.  We will, indeed, have to be vigilant in regard to the consumer-oriented provisions in S.1301, and I hope that we will be joined in this effort both by our Senate Republican colleagues, who have agreed to accept most of these provisions without any debate, as well as by the White House, which has indicated the importance of preserving the Senate managers' amendment to its own consideration of bankruptcy reform legislation. We have our work cut for us, but I commit to my colleague from Maryland that I will do my utmost to ensure that the bankruptcy conference report contains the vital consumer protections we worked so hard to add to the Senate bill.
