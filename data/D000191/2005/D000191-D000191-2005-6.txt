Speaker, earlier tonight, I was asked by a reporter if perhaps I and other Members were upset that this close to Christmas and on a weekend night that the House was still working and the year was dragging on. And I said, no, that did not bother me a bit; I would be happy to work all night and through the holidays. But what bothered me was the substance of what we are working on and why we are still here.  It can be distilled down to three simple reasons: We are here because the Republicans have a package of mean-spirited cuts they want to make just before Christmas. They want to hack $14 billion out of student financial aid; billions of dollars out of food assistance, school lunch, food stamps; dump the Medicaid burden for underinsured or uninsured people back onto the States; cut foster care; and cut long-term care. And they say they have to do that because of the deficit.  But then they have bated it with tax cuts for the wealthy. That is the present they want to put under the tree before we leave. They want to push through, after the $50 billion in cuts in student financial aid, food assistance, medical assistance, foster care and long-term care, they want to give tax cuts to the wealthiest among us.  Disproportionately, their cuts will go to people who invest for a living and earn over $300,000 a year. They have a theory that values investors over wage and salary earners. It is called trickle-down economics. What they say is, if we enrich those people, those who earn over $300,000 a year, particularly those who earn over $1 million a year, if we give them more tax cuts and if we borrow money to give them tax cuts, they will trickle down on the rest of America and put people to work. They will float their yachts on a sea of red ink, and they will hire people to wash the yachts and cut the lawn, and therefore, America benefits.  Unfortunately, they would increase the deficit even after their mean-spirited cuts. So that is their pre-Christmas agenda: To stick it to the working families and the struggling and the young in America so that the wealthiest among us, who are already doing quite well, will have yet a merrier Christmas.  And then they have one last thing: They want to drill in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The entire Congress is being held captive by one Senator from Alaska. He is going to stick that on one bill or another before he lets Congress go home.  Substitute for a comprehensive energy policy for the United States of America, something that might free us from the oil companies and OPEC, something that might break through into the 21st century in terms of new technologies, they want to push through drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge.  So that is their troika: Cuts to Americans in need and Americans trying to make better of their lives; tax cuts for those who are already doing phenomenally well; and then, finally, yet another gift to the oil industry, on top of the subsidies they provided in the energy bill.  It is a pretty sad policy, but perhaps they will at least give a lump of coal to every American to put in the fireplace to try to keep warm because they cannot afford their natural gas or electric heat or their oil for their furnace this year.                          ____________________
