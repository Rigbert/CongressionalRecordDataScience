Mr. Speaker, after nearly 4 years of war, the leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia have made a tangible commitment to peace. The Dayton peace agreement is, as Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic stated, an unjust peace, but less unjust than the continuation of war. We can be hopeful, though, that the peace can be more just if there is international resolve to keep the signatories to the agreement in line with the commitments they have undertaken, not only in Dayton but, more broadly, in the OSCE and in international law.  Most of us recognize that the chief concern in this regard will be the adherence to the agreement on the part of the Serb militants who have engaged in aggression and genocide against non-Serbs, and have undertaken a massive propaganda campaign to garner support from the Bosnian Serb population. However, there is a real cause for concern regarding the recent policies and actions of Croatia, and the Bosnian Croats over whom it exercises control.  For example, since retaking last summer territory occupied by Serb militants, Croatian authorities have tolerated and even encouraged the harassment of fleeing Serbs, the looting and burning of their property, and the killing of dozens of Serbs--many elderly--who remained behind, in their homes. I commend my colleague and fellow Helsinki commissioner, Frank Wolf, for taking the lead in raising this issue here in Congress.  Croatia held elections in October of this year in an effort to capitalize on military successes. By severely cutting back the representation of the Serb community in the parliament, the electoral process sent departed Serbs the message that they are not welcome back. At the same time, they sought to sway the loyalties of Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina by giving them large representation in parliament. While observers concluded the elections to be free, controls on the media and other subtle manipulations of the electoral process made them less than fair.  Croatia states its readiness to cooperate with the International Tribunal in the Hague where alleged war criminals from the former Yugoslavia are to be tried, but in reality the Croatian Government has refused to do so. One indicted Bosnian Croat general, Tihomir Blaskic, was transferred to the Croatian Army rather than surrendered to the court, while Ivica Rajic, a Bosnian Croat commander indicted for his role in the slaughter of civilians at the village of Stupni Do; was just released from custody by Bosnian Croat authorities who were holding him for unrelated reasons.  Last Sunday's newspaper reported on the massive burning and destruction of property in Croat-controlled parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina that are to become parts of the Serb entity under the Dayton agreements.  These actions, Mr. Speaker, are an outrage. As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, and as a Member of Congress who condemned the Serb aggression to which the international community allowed Croatia to be a victim, I nevertheless find these acts in violation of Helsinki principles to be inexcusable. Tactically, they do more to validate the fears of the average Serb than the most efficient propaganda machine, and damage Croatia's image abroad. Strategically, they feed on a cycle of hate, and ensure that Croats will again someday be the victims of that cycle. Morally--above all, morally--they are reprehensible, and deserve our condemnation.  Beyond this expression, we should consider, for the new year, the implications of these policies on our relations with Croatia. If the burning, looting, and killing go on; if the indicted are not surrendered; if intolerance continues to dominate Government policy; then we cannot maintain the good, friendly relations with Croatia that we may nevertheless want. Our State Department may want to consider diplomatic action, such as the recalling of ambassadors, and possible economic actions as well.  Let there be no mistake about it, Serb aggression remains the main problem in the former Yugoslavia. That does not mean we can turn a blind eye to the violations of others.                          ____________________
