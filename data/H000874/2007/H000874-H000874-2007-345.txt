There has been a change in the July schedule in part because of the moving of three of the appropriations bills to July. So they will not be considered in June. It was always the intent, however, that there would be an announcement prior to July 4 of component parts of an energy policy, not necessarily one bill but an energy policy prior to July 4. We always contemplated energy bills being on the floor in July. As far as I know, that is still the plan.
