I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, I have never been one to stand silent in the face of injustice. Today, I see before us one of the greatest betrayals in American history--the betrayal of our seniors and the disabled who rely on Medicare for their health care. We have made a social compact with our seniors, and the Republican budget breaks that compact. It is a disgrace and a shame.  Where is our sense of fairness? Where is our outrage? We can and we must do better.  Republicans head down a very dangerous path. We cannot, we must not, and we will not balance our budget on the backs of people who can least afford it. Our seniors, the disabled, the poor, the hungry--they have done nothing wrong. They do not deserve to bear the burden of these budget cuts.  Support and vote for the people's budget. It is the right budget, it is fair, and it is just.
