 President, I remain concerned about the high levels of exposure Americans have to Bisphenol-A, BPA, an endocrine-disrupting chemical. BPA is a synthetic estrogen, which means that it mimics this hormone when in the body. Scientific studies continue to show cause for concern, especially for the health effects on babies, children, and expectant mothers. While these studies continue to examine the exact effects that BPA has on humans, consumers deserve more information.  BPA is most commonly found in food products, such as the lining of canned goods like string beans, but consumers have no clear way of knowing this. The BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act is a simple solution to fix this problem. This legislation requires that food packaging that uses BPA include a clear label that reads, ``This food packaging contains BPA, an endocrine-disrupting chemical, according to the National Institutes of Health.'' This is basic information that consumers have the right to know so they can make informed decisions about the products they wish to purchase.  This legislation also directs the Department of Health and Human Services to do a safety assessment of food containers that use BPA to determine if there is reasonable certainty that no harm will come from exposure, including from low doses over the long term. This safety standard would also apply to the evaluation of alternatives to BPA to ensure that replacement chemicals are not simply causing the same harm by a different name. The legislation calls specific attention to the effects of exposure on vulnerable populations, such as infants, children, pregnant women, and workers who are exposed through production practices or handling of final products.  I am particularly concerned about the negative health effects to children who are exposed to chemicals both while they are developing in the womb and in the first few years of their lives. Children are particularly susceptible to toxins while their bodies are developing at such a rapid pace.  According to Dr. Heather Patisaul, a biologist at North Carolina State University, when pregnant women are exposed to BPA and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals, three generations are impacted: the mother, the fetus, and the reproductive cells in the fetus. She cites that nearly 100 studies have shown an association between BPA exposure and negative health effects in humans. These include reproductive disorders, behavioral problems in children, and heart disease. In addition, there are over 1200 published animal studies on effects of BPA that show potential links to cancer, tumors, and brain development disorders.  A recent study published in Hypertension, a journal by the American Heart Association, found that individuals who drank beverages from containers made with BPA had an acute increase in their blood pressure, compared with individuals who drank the same beverage from containers that did not use BPA. This shows the potential for an increased risk for heart disease.  Another recent study, published in Endocrinology, a journal by the Endocrine Society, shows a link between fetal exposure to BPA and increased oxidative stress--an imbalance in the body's ability to protect against and repair cell damage.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 93 percent of Americans have BPA in their bodies. As a society we are constantly exposed to low doses of this chemical over a long timeframe. Consumers deserve the opportunity to have more control over their own exposure and at the least should be provided information about if BPA is in the food products that they purchase.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the BPA in Food Packaging Right to Know Act and stand up for the rights of consumers to have this basic information.                                 ______                                       By
