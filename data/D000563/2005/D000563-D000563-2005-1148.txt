To reiterate for my side of the aisle and yours, if you have a pending amendment on this bill, there is a window from about 3:30, 3:45 until 5 o'clock, if the UC is adopted, to come to the floor and speak to your amendment and have it pending or at least considered.  I think what I am hearing from the chairman is what we would give as advice to all, and that is waiting until tomorrow or the next day is not the wisest course.
