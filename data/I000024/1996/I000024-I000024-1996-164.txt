President, first of all, let me stand up and be the first one to officially accept the challenge made by the distinguished Senator from Arizona. He is absolutely correct in his analysis as to what is happening in the country right now. It is refreshing to listen to someone who can look at historical data and come to a decision that is really incontrovertible.  The Senator from Arizona quoted the Kemp report as to what can happen in order to stimulate the economy and actually result in increasing revenues by reducing marginal tax rates. If we think back and look at what happened in 1980, the total revenues derived from our marginal tax rates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. And during that 10-year period, we had a greater reduction in marginal rates, including capital gains. Obviously, what happened is exactly what the Senator is suggesting would happen in the future if we would we do this now.  I have heard so many times on this floor people say look what happened in the 1980's when we had a President who was reducing tax rates and the deficit went up. The deficit went up not because revenues were not coming in. Clearly they were coming in at a much more rapid rate as a result of giving the free enterprise system a chance to breathe by reducing marginal rates.                          ____________________
