 At the time, Marcus's mom was a working mother of two. She worked as a part-time dental assistant. She didn't receive health insurance through her job and her family did not qualify for Medicaid, which is health insurance for poor people.  For 3 years, Marcus tried to get medical care without success. He was repeatedly told that more tests couldn't be done. He was told they were just too expensive, and he was basically told nothing was wrong. In fact, something was very wrong. Marcus Evans was suffering from t-cell lymphoma, a form of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. Do you know how he received the diagnosis? After Marcus's aunt called 911 because her nephew literally couldn't breathe, he was rushed to an emergency room where he received, finally, an MRI--his first MRI after years of visits to doctors with no diagnosis. That test revealed a significant malignant tumor pressing on his esophagus, which explained the symptoms he had been complaining about for more than 3 years.  Marcus said:       I nearly died before I got the proper health care. It took      a lot for them to actually do the test.  Well, that is the situation that is familiar to millions of Americans--people who either don't have insurance or don't have much insurance.
