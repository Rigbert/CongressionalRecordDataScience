 I found it almost laughable today as I sat there and I listened to the Federal Reserve talk about taking our taxpayers' dollars to prop up Mexico in this little mechanism that they have set up when the very same Federal Reserve testified up here in Congress last week and said to every senior citizen across this country, ``One way we can save money here in America and balance the budget is give you $10 less in your Social Security this next year.''  Now I find it amazing that the same words could come out of the same institution's mouth in the same week; in other words say to our people, and believe me I have a lot of seniors in my district. They like to be close to their family. They did not move away. They depend on that Social Security check. Sure, there may be some at the top that earn a lot of money, but the average Social Security recipient in my district receives $400 to $600 a month. It is not a whole lot of money.  [[Page H294]] So, we have a lot of need among our seniors, and yet the Federal Reserve can so--it just shows me how far away they are from the public that they could actually come up here and say to our seniors, ``We want to take $150 billion from you, but then out of this pocket we're going to put up $40 billion of your dollars for Mexico.'' It was appalling to me.
