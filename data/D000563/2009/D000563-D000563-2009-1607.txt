I wish to see far fewer abortions. But let's be honest. How do you reach that goal? You reach that goal by educating women and giving them opportunities to avoid unintended pregnancies. I think that is why this amendment is inconsistent with the sponsor's goal. If you want fewer abortions, give women an option, let them control their bodies and their lives, and let them make family decisions that are right for them, instead of being at the mercy of a situation they cannot control.
