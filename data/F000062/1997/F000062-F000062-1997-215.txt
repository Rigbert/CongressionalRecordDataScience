 President, today Senators Mack, D'Amato, Reid, and I are introducing a bill to give citizens two ways to contribute to the Nation's cancer research program. In connection with their annual tax return, taxpayers could make a tax deductible contribution for cancer research of not less than $1 and could check off or designate a contribution of not less than $1 from their tax refund owed them by the Government.  The bill establishes a Cancer Research Trust Fund and directs the National Institutes of Health to use the funds for research on cancer. It prohibits expenditures from the fund if appropriations in any year for the NIH are less than the previous year so that these funds do not supplant appropriated funds.  In fiscal 1997, the National Cancer Institute could only fund 26 percent of grants received with appropriated funds. This approval rate dropped from 29 percent in 1996 and 32 percent in 1992. Under the President's budget request for fiscal 1998, the success rate is estimated to drop again, to 25 percent.  While we do not have a specific estimate for how much our bill for cancer research would raise, a Federal tax checkoff for health research could raise $35 million in revenues for health research, if the average contribution were $2, according to Research America. If taxpayers gave $10, it would raise $410 million. Their study shows that the average contribution would be $23 and at that rate, $1.1 billion could be raised. In 1994, U.S. taxpayers contributed $25.7 million through State checkoffs.  I believe Americans would be very willing to make a contribution to health research and using the tax return is a very easy way. Sixty percent of Americans say they would check off a box on the tax return for medical research. The median amount people are willing to designate is $23.  Virtually everyone is touched by disease and has had some experience with incurable diseases. We all fear dreaded diseases. A May 1996 California poll found that 59 percent of my constituents would pay an extra dollar a week in taxes to support medical research. An overwhelming 94 percent of Americans believe it is important that the United States maintains its role as a world leader in medical research and medical research takes second place only to national defense for tax dollar value.  Cancer mortality has risen in the past half-century. By the year 2000, cancer will overtake heart disease as the leading cause of death of Americans. Over 40 percent of Americans will develop cancer and over 20 percent of us will die from cancers. Cancer iscausing twice as many deaths as in 1971. Cancer's total economic costs in 1995, according to the National Institutes of Health, came to $104 billion.  In my own State of California, in 1996, 125,800 new cases of cancer were diagnosed and 51,200 people died. The incidence of certain cancers, specifically cervical, stomach, and liver, is higher than national rates. The San Francisco area has some of the highest rates of breast cancer in the world. There are areas in my State, such as Alameda County, where prostate cancer incidence exceeds the national rate. In my State, African-American women have a 60-percent higher risk of developing cervical cancer than white women. Hispanic women have the highest risk of cervical cancer in my State. Asian-Americans in California are twice as likely to develop stomach cancer and five times more likely to develop liver cancer than whites.  We have made great strides in understanding cancer, particularly the genetics of cancer and what makes a normal cell become a cancer cell. Because of research, cancer survival rates have increased for some cancers. But we cannot rest until we find a cure.  The National Cancer Institute's bypass budget identifies five promising areas of research and with 74 percent of grants going unapproved, the scientific talent is there. As the National Cancer Advisory Board said in its 1994 report to Congress, ``Current investment is insufficient to capitalize on unprecedented opportunities in basic science research.'' Clearly additional funds can be well used by some of the world's leading cancer researchers.  By introducing this bill, I do not believe giving taxpayers an opportunity to contribute to cancer research will or should be the mainstay of funding for our national war on cancer. Congress needs to continue increasing appropriations and I am disappointed that the President's fiscal year 1998 budget for the National Cancer Institute represents only a 2.5-percent increase over fiscal 1997. I hope we can do better and I pledge my help in doing that. To insure that these taxpayer contributions generated by this bill do not supplant Congressionally appropriated funds, the bill includes a provision that prohibits expenditures from the cancer research fund if appropriations in any year for the NIH are less than the previous year.  Twenty-six years of research since the 1971 passage of the National Cancer Act has brought great progress, but some say that the war on cancer has really only been a skirmish. We must escalate that war, we must launch an armada of scientists, we must push vigorously ahead, we must find a cure for cancer. I hope this bill will help to escalate that battle.                                 ______                                       By
