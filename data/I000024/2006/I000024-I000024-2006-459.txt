There are some.  First of all, there are some exceptions. Our language says ``except where otherwise provided in law.'' There are some exceptions. For example, before the Court Interpreters Act, passed in 1978, defendants did not have the right to an interpreter. It was up to the court's own discretion. In 1978, they said that they did. This has not changed that. This leaves that in place. We also have the bilingual ballots requirement, Voting Rights Act. That is not changed by this. Maybe it should be changed, but that should take special legislation that addresses the Voting Rights Act.  The national disaster emergency evacuation provides if you had something in California, for example, where there was a tsunami, you could use the Chinese language in Chinatown, in places where it is appropriate. It leaves those common sense things in place.
