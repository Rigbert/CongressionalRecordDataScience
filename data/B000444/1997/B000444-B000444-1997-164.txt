 If I may say, Madam President, to the distinguished leader, that in a November 25, 1996, memorandum for Alan J. Kreczko, Special Assistant to the President and Legal Adviser to the National Security Council, from Christopher Schroeder, Acting Assistant Attorney General, there is this phrase on page 14 of that memorandum. It says:       Because the Senate took the view that such ``common      understandings'' of a treaty had the same binding effect as      express provisions of the treaty for the purposes of U.S.      law, the Biden condition logically supports the proposition      that the President may be authorized to accept changes in      treaty obligations either by further Senate advice and      consent or by statutory enactment.  The next paragraph:       In light of these judicial and historical precedents, we      conclude the Congress may authorize the President, through an      executive agreement, substantially to modify the United      States' international obligations under an arms control (or      other political-military) treaty.  So the purpose, again, was to make it clear what you and I, as we understood at the time that condition was added--I might add, I get credit for it being called the Biden-Byrd condition, of which I am very proud, but the truth of the matter is, after having suggested such a condition early in the ratification process, I spent the next 7 months in the hospital during the remainder of the whole ratification process, and it was the distinguished leader, the Senator from West Virginia--it really should be the Byrd-Biden condition. Nonetheless, that is the reason. You and I never thought a majority vote in both Houses as a simple piece of legislation would be sufficient to approve an amendment to a treaty, and that was the concern expressed by the majority that it be memorialized, if you will, in condition (8).
