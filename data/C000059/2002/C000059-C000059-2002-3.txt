Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003. This bill provides our armed forces with the resources to fight terrorism and strengthens military quality of life, readiness, infrastructure and modernization programs. I would like to commend Chairman Lewis, Ranking Member Murtha and their staffs for their bipartisan work in putting this bill together.  The bill also includes funding for 12 new C-17 airlifters along with other acquisitions and improvements for our cargo and tanker fleet. Combat forces cannot fight, peacekeepers cannot keep the peace and humanitarian aid cannot be distributed without an effective, rapid global mobility force. Continuing to build up our cargo and tanker fleet will help ensure that the United States military can continue to effectively deliver both guns and butter anytime, anyplace.
