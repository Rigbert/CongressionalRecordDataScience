 President, if the Senator is asking me that question, I will tell him that he is absolutely right, not based upon what I say or what the Senator says, but every spring the trustees of Social Security and Medicare look ahead 75 years and they predict what the income and the outlays are going to be based upon the population and the projected growth of the economy and all that stuff. Right now, they are projecting $37 trillion of shortfall over that 75-year period of time. They already told us, and it has materialized, that in the year 2008 we started paying more money out of Medicare than was coming into Medicare, and by the year 2017, as the Senator correctly stated, the trust fund will be out of reserves.
