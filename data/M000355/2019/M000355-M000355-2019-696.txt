 President, this weekend saw a brazen attack by Iran on a critical oil facility in Saudi Arabia. This is not just an isolated drone strike with the prospect of regional escalation but an attack with significant repercussions for the entire global energy market.  We are fortunate that advances in U.S. oil and gas production have made the United States more energy independent and have added capacity to global markets, but the impact of this attack could still be substantial. For this reason, I welcome the administration's preparations to potentially release oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, to stabilize global markets. I hope our international partners will join us in imposing consequences on Tehran for this reckless, destabilizing attack.                          ____________________
