This legislation will provide our National Guard and Reserve personnel with expanded educational opportunities at a reasonable cost. Endorsed by the 52-member Partnership for Veterans Education, the bill provides assistance and equity that is logical, fair, and worthy of a Nation that values both higher education and those who defend the freedoms that we all enjoy. Under the total force concept of our military services, a large number of Selected Reserve personnel are now on active duty to support the war on terrorism at home and abroad.  The original G.I. bill, known as the Servicemen's Readjustment Act, was enacted in 1944. That bill provided a $500 annual education stipend as well as a $50 subsistence allowance. As a result of this initiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of post-service education and training opportunities, including more than 2.2 million veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those veterans who volunteered for the war, fought bravely, and then returned to college with assistance from the G.I. bill.  Since that time, various incarnations of the G.I. bill have continued to assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of educational opportunities they put on hold in order to serve their country. New laws were enacted to provide educational assistance to those who served in Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served during the period in-between. Since the adoption of the total force concept and the change to an all-volunteer service, additional adjustments to these programs were made, leading up to the enactment of the Montgomery G.I. bill in 1985. It is a two-part program, one for active duty personnel and veterans and another for members of the Selected Reserve.  The value of the educational benefit assistance provided by the Montgomery G.I. bill, however, has eroded over time due to inflation and the escalating cost of higher education, making it harder for service members and veterans to achieve their educational goals. Last year, military recruiters indicated to me that the program's benefits no longer were as strong an incentive to join the military; nor did they serve as a retention toll valuable enough to persuade men and women to stay in the military, either on active duty or in the Selected Reserve. Perhaps most important, the program has been losing its value as an instrument to help our National Guard and Reserve personnel to maximize their productivity and contributions to their families and the coummunities of which they are a part by furthering their education and training.  In fact, in constant dollars, with one exception, the current G.I. bill up until January of this year provided the lowest level of assistance ever to those who served in the defense of our country. The basic benefit program of the Vietnam Era G.I. bill provided $493 per month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Twenty years later, a veteran in identical circumstances received only $43 more, a mere 8 percent increase over a time period when inflation had nearly doubled, and a dollar bought only half of what it once purchased.  During the first session of the 107th Congress, we were successful in addressing some of these problems. Public Law 107-103 greatly improved educational assistance benefits available under the part of the Montgomery GI bill for service members and veterans, Chapter 30. This part of the G.I. bill now provides nine monthly $800 stipends per year for four years. The total benefit is $28,800. On October 1, 2002, the monthly amount will increase to $900, producing a new total benefit of $32,400 for the four academic years, a considerable improvement that Senator Johnson and I worked hard to accomplish.  Now is the time to bring educational assistance program for members of the Selected Reserve, Chapter 1606, in line with Chapter 30. Current full-time assistance for the Selected Reserve is $272 per month for a total benefit of $9,792, only 34 percent of the monthly amount currently received under the Chapter 30 program. The bill that we are introducing today would raise the monthly amount of assistance for our Selected Reserve to $428, for a new total benefit of $15,408 and be comparable to the increases that have and will occur in the Chapter 30 program. The increase would be effective October 1, 2002.  The legislation that we are proposing would fulfill the promise made to our Nation's service members, help with recruiting and retention of men and women in our military, strengthen the State and national economies, and partially reflect the current costs of higher education. Now is the time to enact these modest improvements to the benefit program of the Montgomery G.I. bill for members of our National Guard and Reserve forces.  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me in support of the Selected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2002.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Reserve Officers Association                                         of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2002.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins, I write today on behalf of the nearly      80,000 members of the Reserve Officers Association of the      United States. I understand that you intend to introduce the      Selected Reserve Educational Assistance Act of 2002,      legislation that would not only increase educational payments      to members of the Selected Reserve, but would also tie      proportional increases in the Reserve GI Bill (Chapter 1606)      to increases in the active duty (Chapter 30) provisions of      the bill.       ROA believes that these changes are both appropriate and      timely in as much as they recognize the increased      contributions and responsibilities of the Reserve components      within the Total Force. Since Operation Desert Shield/Desert      Storm, Reserve component support of contingency operations      has increased twelve hundred percent, to the point that it      now averages nearly 13,000,000 mandays per year. That figure      does not include the nearly 85,000 Reservists currently on      active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.      Moreover, there is no indication that this tempo of      operations is likely to decrease anytime soon.       Your bill is a landmark in the realm of Reserve education      benefits in as much as it contains provisions for automatic      increases in payments that keep pace with inflation and with      Active component usage. This is a great improvement to a very      significant recruiting and retention program, and will      doubtless, make it all the more popular and valuable to the      military and to the nation as a whole in the years to come.       Again, let me thank you for support of the Reserve      components of our Armed Forces and their people. If we here      at ROA can be of any assistance on this matter, please do not      hesitate to contact us.           Sincerely,                                                Jayson L. Speigel,                                               Executive Director.                                 ______                                       By
