Speaker, consumer confidence, capital investment and growth are down. Layoffs, energy prices, and concerns are up. Tax relief is critical to giving a boost to the economy and putting the brakes on runaway Washington spending. Americans are more than aware that surplus money that stays in Washington is spent to perpetuate Washington bureaucracies.  H.R. 3 intends to put taxpayers' money first. We have walled off over $3 trillion for Social Security, Medicare and further debt relief. Since 1997, Republicans have paid down $363 billion of debt. Uncle Sam's fiscal house is not only in order, it is in the best shape it has been in generations. H.R. 3 works under a simple principle, that no one should be paying more than one-third of their income to the IRS. It helps lower-income Americans by making tax relief retroactive to January 1 of this year providing tax relief for working Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can all support the rule for H.R. 3 and put money back into the pockets of American taxpayers instead of pouring in the abyss known as Uncle Sam's bank account.
