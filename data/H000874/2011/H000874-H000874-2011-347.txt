Speaker, I rise to honor Dr. Fayaz Shawl, who has been widely recognized as one of the world's foremost interventional cardiologists. He currently serves as Director of Interventional Cardiology at Washington Adventist Hospital in Takoma Park, Maryland, and as Professor and Director of Interventional Cardiovascular Medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, DC.  Dr. Shawl, who immigrated to the United States from Kashmir, has performed more than 18,000 cardiac interventional procedures and has written more than 150 important articles, abstracts, editorials, and books. He is also the founder of the ``Dr. Fayaz Shawl Philanthropic Foundation,'' which he founded to treat impoverished patients.  Dr. Shawl's life has been dedicated to restoring to good health those who suffer from cardiovascular disease; he has saved countless lives and improved the quality of life for many more. He has our sincere gratitude for all that he has done to preserve his patients' health and longevity.                          ____________________
