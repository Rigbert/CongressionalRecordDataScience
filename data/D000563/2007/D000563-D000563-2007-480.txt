President, today I rise to speak about the proposed expansion of a British Petroleum refinery in Whiting, IN. BP Amoco has requested, and received, a permit to increase the pollution it dumps into Lake Michigan.  Under this new permit, BP's expanded facility will release 54 percent more ammonia and 35 percent more suspended solids which contain heavy metals, including mercury, into Lake Michigan. Expanding refinery capacity is an important goal and a project with many benefits, but we shouldn't do this at the expense of one of our most precious natural resources.  Congress passed the Clean Water Act to restore and maintain the integrity of our Nation's waters. The express goal of the law is to reduce the amount of pollutants entering the Nation's waterways. The Clean Water Act went so far as to set a very specific target of reaching zero pollutants going into the waters by 1985. Zero discharges. We certainly have not met that target.  But we have been trying to move toward it. Now, BP wants to increase its pollution into Lake Michigan. BP has spent millions and millions of dollars to ``green'' its image. This company has effectively changed its name from ``British Petroleum'' to ``Beyond Petroleum.''  Yet with this ``green'' image, BP turns around and asks for a permit to dramatically increase the amount of pollutants it dumps into Lake Michigan. BP has worked very hard to make the American public think that the company is an environmental steward, that it is a responsible and sustainable company. And it does have some very good initiatives, but BP stands to lose this image by insisting on dumping more pollution into Lake Michigan.  A Chicago Sun Times article this week referred to BP as ``Big Polluters.'' I don't think that is what the company wants.  The CEO of BP met with me last week. I asked him to take another look at the technology that is currently available to decrease the amount of ammonia and total suspended solids that will be introduced into Lake Michigan. I encouraged BP to find a better solution.  I am calling on BP to live up the standard it has set for itself as a corporate steward of the environment and to stop any additional pollution from being discharged into Lake Michigan.  The Great Lakes are a tremendous and valuable resource. The lakes are a largely closed ecosystem that has a very long water retention time. It takes 106 years for water to be completely flushed through Lake Michigan. Pollutants that are introduced into the lake are likely to stay there for a long time.  The Great Lakes contain more than 20 percent of the Earth's surface fresh water and are a necessary drinking water source for nearly 40 million Americans. Increasing pollution going into the Lakes should worry us all. Twenty-five percent of the U.S. and Canadian populations are within the watershed of the Great Lakes.  Congress appreciates the value of this resource. More than 30 Federal laws have been enacted that specifically focused on restoring the Great Lakes basin.  Government at all levels is working to prevent industrial pollution, sewage discharges, invasive species and water diversion. These efforts are to ensure that future generations will enjoy the beauty of our magnificent Great Lakes.  Dumping more pollution into one of our most important sources of fresh water is a bad idea. The people in my State recognize that. They are willing to forgo the modest increase in refinery expansion to protect Lake Michigan.  At a time when fresh water sources are threatened here and around the globe, we should demand more especially from corporate leaders who flash public relations campaigns about moving ``beyond petroleum.'' BP is not a struggling small business. In the past three years, BP Corporation has earned net profits of over $60 billion. If anyone has the resources to find alternatives, it is BP Amoco.  We respectfully ask BP to live up to the image it has worked so hard to create and use some of the resources they have to prevent additional pollution from entering our drinking water. Please protect our natural resource, don't degrade it.                          ____________________
