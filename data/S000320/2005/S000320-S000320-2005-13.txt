 President, I rise in opposition to the Reed amendment. In the Banking Committee, as part of the reconciliation process, we save, in this instance, $270 million. This proposal simply makes the FHA's use of rehab grants and below-market sales subject to appropriations.  If these programs are, in fact, beneficial--some of them are--appropriations can still be granted in the future, and using the appropriations process allows the Congress to better oversee the use of these dollars and to ensure that our resources are well spent.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. This $270 million is a lot of savings that we can put forth today.
