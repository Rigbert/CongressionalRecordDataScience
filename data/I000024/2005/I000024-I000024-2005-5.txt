President, both subcommittee Chairman Thune and I recognize the importance of oversight of the Superfund program. To that end, and consistent with Senator Boxer's request, Senator Thune's subcommittee will be holding an oversight hearing of EPA's Superfund program once Susan Bodine, the President's nominee to head EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, is confirmed by the Senate with Ms. Bodine testifying on behalf of EPA. After Ms. Bodine is confirmed, we will begin to work on scheduling this hearing with a targeted time frame of the first quarter of 2006, but no later than the Memorial Day recess. Senator Thune will work closely with Senator Boxer in scheduling the hearing.  I expect EPA to be forthcoming in this hearing about the program and look forward to Ms. Bodine's confirmation so that she may help ensure that the EPA is responsive to the Senator's requests for information about the management of the program and the impacts on communities throughout the country.
