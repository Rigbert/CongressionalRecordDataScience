Speaker, it is with great sadness but profound respect that I take this time to remember one of Northwest Indiana's finest citizens, and a true champion of workers' rights, Wallace ``Wally'' Evans, Jr. Wally dedicated his life to serving the needs of members of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), and he was tremendously successful in his efforts to improve the quality of life for workers in Northwest Indiana and across the nation. Mr. Evans passed away on Friday, November 29, 2013, but his legacy will forever be remembered in the hearts and minds of the many people whose lives he touched.   Wally began his career in 1961 as a frozen foods manager at Burger's Supermarket in Munster, Indiana. In 1974, he became a full-time organizer and business representative for Local 1460 of the Retail Clerks Union, Lake County. Throughout the years, the UFCW began to grow and merge with other locals. Wally held numerous positions within the UFCW, including president of Local 1460, secretary/treasurer of Local 1550, and executive vice president and director of collective bargaining of Local 881. He also served as a union trustee for the UFCW Calumet Insurance Fund as well as the Chicago Midwest Pension and Health Funds, and as vice president of the Northwest Indiana Federation of Labor AFL-CIO.   Mr. Evans also dedicated much of his time to many organizations and committees throughout his lifetime. Wally served as a Democratic precinct committeeman in Highland, was a member of various boards for the state of Indiana, served as a youth commissioner in Lansing, Illinois, and was a member of Trinity Lutheran Church in Lansing.   Wally leaves behind a loving family. He is survived by his wife, Sheila, his adoring sons, Steven and Jason, and their wives, Rachel and Andrea. Wally was also blessed with nine beloved grandchildren. He also leaves to cherish his memory many other dear friends and family members, as well as a saddened but grateful community.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in remembering the great life of Mr. Wally Evans. His remarkable contributions to the Labor Movement, both locally and across the nation, are worthy of our deepest admiration. His life of service is to be commended, and his legacy serves as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
