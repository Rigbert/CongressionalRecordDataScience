 679, the Schumer/Alexander Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act. This bill would eliminate the Senate confirmation process for approximately 200 positions. Many of the positions proposed to be eliminated from the Senate process are officers dealing with transparency matters, such as positions dealing with public and congressional affairs, as well as officers dealing with budgetary matters, such as positions dealing with finances and grant administration.  In general, I am concerned that the legislation will eliminate the Senate's ability to provide its constitutional duty of advice and consent for individuals tasked with performing important government functions, and would allow these positions to become more like czars that are unaccountable to the people.  In addition, I am concerned that the legislation will impede the Senate's ability to conduct oversight of certain department programs, as well as reduceSenators' ability to compel executive department and agencies to testify before Congress or answer written questions. For example, DOJ has a policy of not allowing line attorneys to testify before Congress, and the Obama Administration will not allow its czars to testify--a policy that could potentially apply to these individuals.  Further, often the only tactic a Senator has for compelling an agency to produce documents or provide answers to questions is to block a nominee until documents or answers are produced. This is especially true when the member seeking to conduct oversight is in the minority party. I have frequently employed this tactic to get documents/information from agencies, and generally have been successful when I've used this method in helping me with my oversight efforts.  As the current ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would like to address the positions under Judiciary Committee jurisdiction proposed to be eliminated. Specifically, S, 679 would eliminate the Senate confirmation process for these 10 positions under Judiciary Committee jurisdiction:     Assistant Attorney General, Legislative Affairs, DOJ     Director, Bureau of Justice Assistance, DOJ     Director, Bureau of Justice Statistics, DOJ     Director, National Institute of Justice, DOJ     Administrator, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency          Prevention, DOJ     Director, Office for Victims of Crime, DOJ     Deputy Director, National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP     Deputy Director, Demand Reduction, National Drug Control          Policy, ONDCP     Deputy Director, State and Local Affairs, National Drug          Control Policy, ONDCP     Deputy Director, Supply Reduction, National Drug Control          Policy, ONDCP  In addition, the Senate resolution would provide an expedited process for these positions under Judiciary Committee jurisdiction:     Members (2), Foreign Claims Settlement Commission     Members (11), Board of Directors, State Justice Institute  I believe that all these positions be removed from the legislation. Specifically with respect to the Judiciary Committee positions, I am concerned that several of these positions deal with policy implementation, grant administration and funding, statistics and data collection, as well as transparency and accountability.
