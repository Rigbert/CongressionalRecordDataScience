I know the Senator from Maine is experiencing the same thing I am experiencing in Kansas and all Senators are experiencing when they go back home. Every hospital board--beleagured hospital boards--every hospital administrator, all of the rural health care delivery system--it is not only applicable to rural areas but all over--have been questioning me and our colleagues about when are we going to do something with regard to the Medicare reimbursement.  The Senator has indicated--I underlined it in the Senator's remarks:       It is also critical that Congress take action this year to      address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced      Budget Act of 1997. . . .  We should have done it this spring. The Senator from Maine and I talked about it. We should have done it last year. We did certainly provide that assistance. I wish we could have done that earlier. We are going to do that.  Then the Senator also said:       . . . [and also some problems] which have been exacerbated      by a host of ill-conceived regulatory requirements imposed by      the Clinton administration--  And the folks at HCFA.  That is a marvelous acronym, HCFA. I will tell you what, if that is not a four-letter word in the minds and eyes of people who have to provide health care services throughout our country, I do not know what is. Asking HCFA for help, if you are a hospital board or a hospital administrator, is like asking the Boston strangler for a neck massage. It just does not work.  My question is this: as I recall, there was strong bipartisan support for these provisions, but haven't they produced cuts in home health care spending far beyond what Congress ever intended? It is my understanding--and I want people to understand this--home health care spending dropped $9.7 billion in fiscal year 1999, just about half of the 1997 amount; is that correct?
