 CBO estimates that the recreation fee program will result in $27 million in estimated outlays for 2005 and $13 million in estimated outlays for 2006, at which point CBO assumes that the outlays become a $7 million annual revenue. The recreation user fee program established in the bill, creates a program to directly fund the operation and maintenance needs associated with recreation at Corps reservoirs. The committee reported bill amends section 225 of WRDA 1999. That particular section of WRDA 99 provides the Secretary of the Army a temporary authority under the Land and Water Conservation Fund, to withhold a limited portion of recreation user fees and provides authority to spend those revenues on the operation and maintenance of recreation facilities at Corps reservoirs. The committee bill further amended this authority to allow the Corps to withhold 100 percent of the recreation fees, on a permanent basis and directed the Corps to establish a progrm to facilitate the efficient collection of revenues. The CBO interpretation of this section assumes that the Corps will withhold the recreation fees it currently collects and spend them directly on O However, when the Corps implements the program for fees CBO assumes that the agaency's authority for withholding such fees disappears, and the agency will blithely turn them over to the General Treasury leaving their O budget in shambles. Such an outcome is in direct contravention of the obvious purpose of the entire section. And while such an interpretation of the section is possible, I have yet to encounter a situation where an agency turned funds over to the Treasury when they were authorized to withhold and spend them directly.  Section 1006 authorizes the Corps to deposit revenues collected in conjunction with operations at Corps reservoirs. With respect to the generation of hydro-power, the Corps does not currently collect any fees from the Power Marketing Administrations, PMAs. In the case of PMA revenue, the PMAs send a portion of their revenue to the Treasury. In order to provide direct funding for the Corps, the committee bill provides for a 0.22 cent charge per kilowatt of electricity produced. Bonneville Power Administration is specifically exempt from the 0.22 cent per kilowat hour fee. Despite this exemption, CBO assumes that Bonneville Power will ignore it's other authorizing statutes and turn over more than $800 million a year to the Corps. I would point out that the 0.22 cent per kilowatt fee, was the committee's best estimate at the size of a fee that would be required to directly fund $150 million for O, which was the amount recommended in the president's budget. Excluding Bonneville Power Administration, CBO estimated that the 0.22 cent per kilowatt hour would result in $173 million in direct O outlays. I believe that CBO erroneous included Bonneville Power Administration in the estimate of direct spending. Bonneville Power Administration receipts, if collected by the Corps, would total $7.1 billion over a 10-year period.  While CBO erroneously overestimates, the direct spending associated with O at Corps reservoirs, it completely underestimates the direct spending that will likely be required should the Fish and Wildlife mitigation provision become enacted. Section 1011 establishes a new standard for fish and wildlife mitigation for Corps of Engineers projects. Because the standard specifically amends WRDA 1986 with changing the dates specified in WRDA 86 with respect to the applicability of the standard to completed and on going projects, a strict reading of the new standard makes it applicable to all projects authorized after November 17, 1986. Moreover, the standard sets a very high bar by requiring the Corps to ``acquire and restore the same number of acres of habitat'' to fully replace the hydrologic and ecological functions of ``each acre of habitat adversely affected.'' While on its face such a requirement may seem innocuous, there is no deminimus level for the determination of an adverse effect. Strictly speaking, even relatively minor changes to land use or hydrology would trigger the requirement for the Corps to acquire an equal number of acres as those that are modified, and restore all of those acres. The liability that this imposes on the Corps for mitigation of projects to this standard for everything since 1986 is likely substantial. Given that most non-Federal sponsors are local and State governments, this potentially represents a significant unfunded mandate as well.                          ____________________
