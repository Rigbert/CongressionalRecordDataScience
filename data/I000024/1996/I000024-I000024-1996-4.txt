President, I would like to enter into a brief colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Treasury, Postal Service Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, concerning funding for the proposed relocation of the Federal Communications Commission [FCC]. Mr. Chairman, the Senate version of the fiscal year 1997 Treasury, Postal appropriations bill contained a provision that would allow the Administrator of the General Services Administration [GSA] to pay a portion of the costs associated with a proposed relocation of the FCC. It this correct?
