Is this a question of fairness? Are the Democrats in the Senate treating this Republican President unfairly by only giving him 98 percent of the people he has nominated? Is it fair to conclude when there was a Democratic President, the Republicans in control gave that President 100 percent of his judicial nominees? Does the Senator feel the Republicans are going through a display for 30 hours because we are fundamentally unfair in treating them in a fashion that they did not treat President Clinton?
