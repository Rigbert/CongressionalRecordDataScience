REID. I say to my friend that the direct answer to the point is yes. But talking about 200 pilot layoffs, the last time I flew to Las Vegas was right before the July 4 break. I got on the plane and the pilot said to me, the captain: Senator, good to have you on our plane. He said: You know, there are 950 of us going to be laid off--950 pilots were given notice less than a month ago. Now we have 200 more.  The Senator said in a side remark that these people likely felt like jumping out of that window of that high-rise. My comment to that is, that is fairly valid. They are desperate. These are companies which are the largest companies in America--United Airlines, Delta, Northwest. These companies have been around for a long time and have employed hundreds of thousands of people.  The State of Nevada has two population centers. It is a huge State areawise, some 700 miles tall and some 400 miles wide at its widest part. But the population, 90 percent of the people, live in Reno and Las Vegas. If you want to go to Elko or Ely, you have to drive. It used to be that from Salt Lake to Elko you had a flight every hour. Now there is one a day. There used to be a number of flights from Reno to Elko. None.  Rural America is going to be in deep trouble. We have become an airplane society. We go places in airplanes. That is going to come to a screeching halt unless something is done quickly, because these airlines are cutting the flights as we speak. I repeat, every hour there was a flight from Salt Lake to Elko. Now there is one a day.
