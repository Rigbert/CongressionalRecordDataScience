President, it is going on two years since I first submitted comments to the Federal Communications Commission regarding their proposed rules to preempt State and local governments in the placement and construction of telecommunications towers. Close to two years later, I am still working to ensure that the voice of States and local governments are heard in the continuing fight over telecommunications tower construction.  I am proud to be joined by Senators Jeffords, Hutchison, Feingold, and Moynihan in introducing legislation which will mandate that states and towns cannot be ignored in the spread of telecommunications towers. This bill recognizes that states and towns do have choices in this cellular age.  I became greatly alarmed two years ago, when the Federal Communications Commission proposed rules which would preempt State and local governments in the siting of telecommunications towers. This rule is still pending, and it has been by no means the only or final attempts to minimize the role of State and local governments in the clamor to erect telecommunications towers.  For instance, some may recall the ```E-911'' bill that was introduced last Congress which would have prohibited State and local governments from having any say over the placement or construction of telecommunications towers on federal lands. Keep in mind that federal courthouses and post offices are included in this category.  I continue to be very concerned that the rights of citizens are being jeopardized by the interests of telecommunications companies.  As I have said before, I do not want Vermont turned into a pincushion, with 200 foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and in every valley.  The state of Vermont must have a role in deciding where telecommunications towers are going to go. Vermont citizens and communities should be able to participate in the important decisions affecting their families and their future.  Twenty-nine years ago, Vermont enacted landmark legislation, known as Act 250, to carefully establish procedures to balance the interests of development with the interests of the environment, health and safety, resource conservation and the protection of Vermont's natural beauty. I do not want Act 250's legacy to be undermined by the interests of telecommunications companies.  Another factor that should remain at the forefront of this debate is the existence of alternative communication technologies.  For instance, some companies are working to offer phone service throughout the United States that is based on low-earth-orbit satellites. Over time, this will provide a satellite communications link from any place in the world, even where no tower-based system is available. Emergency communications--911 and disaster assistance--will be greatly aided with this development.  In addition, I have previously discussed how the towerless PCS-Over-Cable and PCS-Over-Fiber technology provides digital cellular phone service by using small antennas rather than large towers. These small antennas can be quickly attached to existing telephone poles, lamp posts or buildings and can provide quality wireless phone service without the use of towers. This technology is cheaper than most tower technology in part because the PCS-Over-Cable wireless provider does not have to purchase land to erect large towers.  Since there are viable and reasonable alternatives to providing wireless phone service through the use of towers, I think that towns should have some say in this matter. And I think that mayors, town officials and local citizens will agree with me.  Also, consider this: the Federal Aviation Administration presently has limited authority to regulated the siting of towers, and because of this, airport officials work with local governments in the siting of towers. Silencing local governments will have a direct effect on airline safety, according to the representatives of the airline industry that we have heard from.  In fact, in a comment letter responding to the FCC's 1997 proposed rule at preemption, the National Association of State Aviation Officials stated that preemption ``is contrary to the most fundamental principles of aviation safety * * * the proposed rule could result in the creation of hazards to aircraft and passengers at airports across the United States, as well as jeopardize safety on the ground.'' I cannot think of anyone who would want towers constructed irrespective of the negative and potentially dangerous impacts they may have on airplane flight and landing patterns.  There is also a growing concern about potential health hazards associated with using cellular telephones. Though there was a major push by the U.S. federal government to research effects of electric and magnetic fields on biological systems, as is evidenced by the five-year Electric and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information Dissemination Program, there has been no similar effort to research potential health effects of radio frequency emissions associated with wireless communications and wireless broadcast facilities. This omission should no longer be overlooked.  As I have said before, I am for progress, but not for ill-considered, so-called progress at the expense of Vermont families, towns and homeowners. Vermont can protect its rural and natural beauty while still providing for the amazing opportunities offered by these technological advances.  I am proud to continue in my commitment to the preservation of State and local authority over the siting and construction of telecommunications towers. I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be printed the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1538       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The placement of Telecommunications Facilities near      residential properties can greatly reduce the value of such      properties, destroy the views from such properties, and      reduce substantially the desire to live in the area.       (2) States and local governments should be able to exercise      control over the placement, construction, and modification of      such facilities through the use of zoning, planned     growth, and other land use regulations relating to the      protection of the environment and public health, safety and      welfare of the community.       (3) There are alternatives to the construction of      facilities to meet telecommunications and broadcast needs,      including, but not limited to, alternative locations,      colocation of antennas on existing towers or structures,      towerless PCS-Over-Cable or PCS-Over-Fiber telephone service,      satellite television systems, low-Earth orbit satellite      communication networks, and other alternative technologies.       (4) There are alternative methods of designing towers to      meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the      use of small towers that do not require blinking aircraft      safety lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree      canopies and that are camouflaged or disguised to blend with      their surroundings, or both.       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications      Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182,      which would preempt the application of State and local zoning      and land use ordinances regarding the placement, construction      and modification of broadcast transmission facilities. It is      in the interest of the Nation that the Commission not adopt      this rule.       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the memoranda      opinions and orders and proposed rules of the Commission with      respect to application of certain ordinances to the placement      of such towers (WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62,      RM-8577, and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified in order      to permit State and local governments to exercise their      zoning and land use authorities, and their power to protect      public health and safety, to regulate the placement of      telecommunications or broadcast facilities and to place the      burden of proof in civil actions, and in actions before the      Commission and State and local authorities relating to the      placement, construction, and modification of such facilities,      on the person or entity that seeks to place, construct, or      modify such facilities.       (7) PCS-Over-Cable, PCS-Over-Fiber, and satellite      telecommunications systems, including low-Earth orbit      satellites, offer a significant opportunity to provide so-     called ``911'' emergency telephone service throughout much of      the United States.       (8) According to the Comptroller General, the Commission      does not consider itself a health agency and turns to health      and radiation experts outside the Commission for guidance on      the issue of health and safety effects of radio frequency      exposure.       (9) The Federal Aviation Administration does not have      adequate authority to regulate the placement, construction      and modification of telecommunications facilities near      airports or high-volume air traffic areas such as corridors      of airspace or commonly used flyways. The Commission's      proposed rules to preempt State and local zoning and land-use      regulations for the siting of such facilities will have a      serious negative impact on aviation safety, airport capacity      and investment, and the efficient use of navigable airspace.       (10) The telecommunications industry and its experts should      be expected to have access to the best and most recent      technical information and should therefore be held to the      highest standards in terms of their representations,      assertions, and promises to governmental authorities.       (11) There has been a substantial effort by the Federal      Government to determine the effects of electric and magnetic      fields on biological systems, as is evidenced by the Electric      and Magnetic Fields Research and Public Information      Dissemination (RAPID) Program, which was established by      section 2118 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law      102-486; 42 U.S.C. 13478). This five-year program, which was      coordinated by the National Institute of Environmental Health      Sciences and the Department of Energy, examined the possible      effects of electric and magnetic fields on human health.      Despite the success of this program, there has been no      similar effort by the Federal Government to determine the      possible effects on human health of radio frequency emissions      associated with telecommunications facilities. The RAPID      program could serve as the excellent model for a Federally-     sponsored research project.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local      authority regarding the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless service facilities and      related facilities as such limitations arise under section      332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.      332(c)(7)).       (2) To permit State and local governments--       (A) in cases where the placement, construction, or      modification of telecommunications facilities and other      facilities is inconsistent with State and local regulations,      laws or decisions, to require the use of alternative      telecommunication or broadcast technologies when such      alternative technologies are available;       (B) to regulate the placement, modification and      construction of such facilities so that their placement,      construction and or modification will not interfere with the      safe and efficient use of public airspace or otherwise      compromise or endanger public safety; and       (C) to hold applicants for permits for the placement,      construction, or modification of such telecommunication      facilities, and providers of services using such towers and      facilities, accountable for the truthfulness and accuracy of      representations and statements placed in the record of      hearings for such permits, licenses or approvals.     SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF                    TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.       (a) Repeal of Limitations on Regulation of Personal      Wireless Facilities.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is      amended--       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that      follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not      unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally      equivalent services.'';       (2) by striking clause (iv);       (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and       (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``30 days after such      action or failure to act'' and inserting ``30 days after      exhaustion of any administrative remedies with respect to      such action or failure to act''; and       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the      following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to      place, construct, or modify a telecommunications facility is      a party, such person shall bear the burden of proof,      regardless of who commences the action.''       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Preemption of      State and Local Authority Over Broadcast Transmission      Facilities.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the      Federal Communications Commission may not adopt as a final      rule or otherwise the proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption      of State and Local Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on      Siting, Placement and Construction of Broadcast Station      Transmission Facilities'', MM Docket No. 97-182, released      August 19, 1997.       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and      Modification of Other Transmission Facilities.--Part I of      title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et      seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 337. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF                    TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this Act, no provision of this Act may be interpreted to      authorize any person or entity to place, construct, or modify      telecommunications facilities in a manner that is      inconsistent with State or local law, or contrary to an      official decision of the appropriate State or local      government entity having authority to approve, permit,      license, modify, or deny an application to place, construct,      or modify a tower, if alternate technology is capable of      delivering the broadcast or telecommunications signals      without the use of a tower.       ``(b) Authority Regarding Production of Safety and      Interference Studies.--No provision of this Act may be      interpreted to prohibit a State or local government from--       ``(1) requiring a person or entity seeking authority to      place, construct or modify telecommunications facilities or      broadcast transmission facilities within the jurisdiction of      such government to produce--       ``(A) environmental studies, engineering reports, or other      documentation of the compliance of such facilities with radio      frequency exposure limits established by the Commission and      compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing the      effects of the proposed facility or the health, safety and      welfare of the local residents in the community; and       ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such facilities      with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety      standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects      effecting navigable airspace; or       ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to locate      such facilities within the jurisdiction of such government if      such person fails to produce any studies, reports, or      documentation required under paragraph (1).       ``(c) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be      construed to prohibit or otherwise limit the authority of a      State or local government to ensure compliance with or      otherwise enforce any statements, assertions, or      representations filed or submitted by or on behalf of an      applicant with the State or local government for authority to      place, construct or modify telecommunications facilities or      broadcast transmission facilities within the jurisdiction of      the State or local government.''.
