Speaker, I thank my fellow dean, my bipartisan dean on theother side. I have so many stories to tell, so I am going to watch the clock here a little bit. I am going to ramble. I don't have a prepared speech.  I am delighted to be here. I am delighted that you were able to get this time for some of us to speak and honor a legend. And when you think about this last year, man, we have lost some really terrific ones: President Bush, John McCain, others. Certainly, John Dingell joins those ranks as a distinguished American who really made a mark on everyone's life in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I include into the Record an article written by editor Nolan Finley of The Detroit News.                 [From the Detroit News, Feb. 9, 2019]               John Dingell Knew How to Live, How To Love                           (By Nolan Finley)       I was up to my waist and cork tight in what I can only      describe as quicksand when I looked up and saw John Dingell      squinting down at me with that familiar, satisfied grin.       ``How in bloody hell did you get in there? And more      important, how in blue blazes are you going to get out?''       We were hunting ducks on Maryland's Eastern Shore. I'd      winged a goose that came down running, and was in hot pursuit      when I stepped into the hole of muck and quickly sank.       John pulled me out, and then finished off the goose.       I never know how to answer when someone asks how a      conservative, Republican-leaning newspaperman could become      such fast friends with a New Deal Democrat who shaped the      liberal politics and policies of the second half of the 20th      century.       I never occurred to either of us that we could be anything      else.       John didn't choose the people he loved based on political      compatibility. Certainly, he had strong opinions, and so do      I, and we engaged often in intense discussions. Not once in      25 years did we exchange angry words, nor ever part with hard      feelings.       We were more than our politics. When together, our      conversation quickly moved to our common loves--guns and      hunting. It was what drew us together in the first place.       John was a great hunter, a dead-eye with a shotgun. I was      with him when he shot the last duck he ever killed. Four of      us were settled into a blind on a brisk but sunny January      morning, and the ducks were coming in fast and furious. Three      of us were blasting away like a trio of Elmer Fudds, shooting      a lot of birds, but burning up a case of shells in doing so.      Not John.       Barely able to stand, he shouldered his shotgun just three      times that day. And all three times a duck fell from the sky.      Not a shell wasted.       John's great passion was his wife, Debbie. After that, it      was a toss-up between a duck blind and the House chamber for      his next greatest love. I recall an afternoon when we were      returning to Washington, and as we crested a hill the      gleaming white Capitol dome came into view. ``I never get      tired of seeing that,'' he said softly.       And obviously he never did. John spent nearly 60 years in      Congress, serving longer than anyone else. And better. John      was a parliamentarian; he cherished the traditions and      processes of the House.       And while he was a bare-knuckled negotiator who relished a      fight, he was ultimately a pragmatist. When the time came to      compromise, John set down his club and made the deal.       His decision to retire was based mostly on his waning      physical condition. But he was also disgusted with the      poisonous partisanship and gridlock ruining Congress. He      couldn't stand to watch what was becoming of the institution      he joined as a teen-aged page during World War II.       Still, he hated to leave. The night before he announced his      retirement, he called me to have dinner with him and Debbie.      John had made his decision but hadn't accepted it. He was      looking for assurance that he wasn't letting down the people      of his district by leaving, that he'd done his best for them,      that they'd understand his reasons.       At the same time, he was offering counsel to Debbie, who      had a quick decision of her own to make. He wanted her to      succeed him, as he had his father, to continue a Dingell      legacy in Congress stretching back to 1935. It was a poignant      moment between the past and future.       When I'd visit him after retirement, the questions were      always the same. Did I make a difference? Do my people      remember me? Would Pop be proud?       I was always stunned that he could harbor such doubts,      given his enormous accomplishments. But John Dingell never      took the obligations of public service lightly. He always      felt there was more he could do for the people who placed      their trust in him.       He was a man in the best sense of the word. A man of the      Greatest Generation. A man of courage, confidence,      compassion. A man who did his duty. A man who took care of      his own business, and of the people he loved.       And he sure did know how to love. He and Debbie shared an      epic love affair that never waned. You couldn't be around      them more than five minutes without hearing him say, ``I love      you, Fox.'' The fire in his eyes when he looked at her burned      until his last breath.       She was fiercely protective of him, and kept him alive      years longer than he should have expected by the sheer force      of her will.       Our friendship may have been unlikely, but it was one I      cherished. I loved him, and hate to see him go.       But if life's a game, John Dingell won it. Nearly 93 years,      and every minute of it lived honorably and with passion and      purpose.       Goodbye, good friend. I hope wherever you are this morning,      the ducks are coming in fast and low.
