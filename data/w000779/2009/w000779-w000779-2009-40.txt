President, I wish to spend a few minutes this morning talking about some of the positive developments that are taking place right now on this issue of health care reform. For example, this morning, the President is out talking to workers who already have insurance about how health care reform will work for them. He is spending his political capital. He is using the bully pulpit that is the White House. It is clear that this is a priority for the President of the United States.  A second positive development is in the Senate Finance Committee. We have a bipartisan group of six Senators.
