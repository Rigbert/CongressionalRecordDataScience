Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to Gerald A. Bowles for his 30 years of exemplary service to the House of Representatives. Each of us here in the House have benefited from Jerry's talent, professionalism and congenial manner. In the 30 years that Jerry has served with the office supply service, he has seen many changes. From the limited scope of office equipment in the early seventies to the high tech demands of today, Jerry has managed to assure that each member's office has all of their supply needs ready and at hand.  Jerry started working for the office supply service on August 1, 1971, as a stock clerk. He was promoted to special orders clerk then to inventory control specialist, sales floor supervisor, assistant chief and then director of office supply service. Jerry will be retiring from office supply service on August 31, 2001.  Jerry was born on May 26, 1951, to John Ignatius Alberta Ellis Bowles of Compton, Maryland. Jerry is the fifteenth child out of sixteen children, having nine sisters and six brothers. Growing up in a family of this size, Jerry learned the importance of working hard, getting along with everyone and being able to figure things out. These skills have helped him to be an effective manager--well liked, yet able to get the job done. There never was any problem which didn't have a solution in Jerry's mind. He has always been able to find an available resource, offer an alternative fix and make the customer happy.  Staff from all around the Hill and particularly his colleagues from the office supply service will miss his smile, his willingness to listen and his ``can do'' attitude. Jerry has served the House well. His loyalty, determination and professionalism will long be remembered.  As Jerry retires to enjoy his home in St. Mary's County where he will fill his days with fishing and crabbing in the Patuxent River as well as working at the Drift Inn Crab House, we wish him well and a long happy retirement.                          ____________________
