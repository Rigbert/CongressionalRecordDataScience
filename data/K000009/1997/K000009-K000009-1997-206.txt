Chairman, I just wanted to ask a question. Assuming that happened to an inventor and he or she were published and that information were taken by some other interest in another nation, knowing some of the inventors that I know, if they had to sue, many of them do not have deep enough pockets. In fact, 80 percent of the inventors are small inventors and, if they had to take a case, would it not be extremely difficult for many inventors to try to protect their property rights internationally?
