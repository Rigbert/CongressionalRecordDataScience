 With cheaper labor it becomes a better investment in the maquiladoras, and we can expect more American companies to be going down there.  The gentleman and the gentlewoman raised interesting points a while ago. I am a member of the Banking Committee that dealt with the S&L fiasco, and as my colleagues will recall the concept ``too big to fail.'' Do my colleagues remember that concept? What too big to fail means is that the taxpayers of America were obligated to bail out very, very large banks because if they failed, the repercussions of that failure were supposedly so great that it would have been worse than bailing them out.  I would like my colleagues to comment on this thought. It seems to me that that is precisely what is happening with regard to Mexico. We are now asked, well, not asked, but the President is proposing to put $40 billion of loan guarantees into Mexico. Maybe the President is right and we do not know. Maybe, in fact, this will improve the Mexican economy, everything will work out well, and there will not be a loss of taxpayer money. That may be true.  But let us look at the other side of the story. Maybe in fact the Mexican economy will not improve and we will lose that $40 billion. What I would like to ask my colleagues is this: Is it not possible that a year from now or 2 years from now a President will come back and say we have got to provide even more loan guarantees to Mexico because we already have $40 billion in the hopper there; we cannot afford to lose that. We have to protect that investment and, therefore, we need to put even more money into Mexico?                              {time}  2110  And I think the implications of that are very, very frightening. This Congress and this President are having a difficult enough time running the American economy that we know something about on behalf of American workers. We are not doing very well at that.  The idea that we have the knowledge or the ability to sustain the Mexican economy, upon which we are dependent, is really quite beyond me.  But I am afraid that we are going to have this too-big-to-fail concept once again. Then we are going to have to pump more and more money into Mexico, because if it fails, then we have lost all the money we put into them last year.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I guess to bring it down to something smaller than billions, I think I heard very early on in my life and the old saw, you know, ``If you owe the bank $1,000 and you cannot pay, you have got a problem. If you owe the bank $100,000 and you cannot pay, the bank has got a problem.'' That is where we are at here.  It is not only ultimately an obligation of the economic stabilization fund, and it does admit in here that losses can be incurred, and those losses would have to be made up, but also the interest earnings, gains or losses of the economic stabilization fund are reflected in the budget of the United States of America. So if the economic stabilization fund loans to Mexico, $20 billion or so to Mexico go bad, then suddenly we are told that not only do we have to come up with the money but that counts as $20 billion more deficit for the United States of America.
