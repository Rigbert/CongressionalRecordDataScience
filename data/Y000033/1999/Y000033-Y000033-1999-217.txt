Mr. Speaker, it is with deep regret that the Committee on Resources bids farewell to Marcia Stewart, Legislative Assistant to the Chief Counsel of the Committee. Marcia has been not only the right hand of the Chief Council's office, but often the heart, head and both feet.  Marcia Stewart is one of those staffers often seen but seldom heard. Her job was not a glamorous one, but one which was integral to the efficient and effective operation of the Committee on Resources. With her help, the Resources Committee has been one of the most productive in the House and she had a hand in every bill we moved (and we have moved hundreds so far). Her presence in markups, in hearings and on the Floor ensured that all would go well. In fact, her very first time staffing a bill on the Floor, the vote was unanimous, probably because no one could bear to disappoint her.  Marcia came to the Committee from the former Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, where she served as a staff assistant. Even then, her extraordinary skills were apparent, and she was a clear choice for the demanding duties of the Chief Counsel's office when I became Chairman of the Resources Committee in the 104th Congress. Her expertise and organizational skills have kept our legislative and oversight trains running on time. That is why I am not surprised thatMarcia Stewart is known as the ``Martha Stewart of legislation.'' Not bad for a woman who was a toddler when I began my career in Congress.  Marcia and her two-year-old daughter, Abigail, will be joining Marcia's husband Tim Stewart in Salt Lake City, where they will be giving up the white columns of the Capitol for the wide open spaces of the West. All I can say is Congressman Jim Hansen district's gain is our loss.  We will miss you, Marcia Stewart, and wish you and your family a wonderful life in Utah. I thank you for your service to me, to the Committee on Resources, to the Congress and to America.                          ____________________
