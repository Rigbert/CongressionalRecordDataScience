President, I want to take a moment to recognize the outstanding work of Clear Path International, a nongovernmental organization based in Dorset, VT. Since 2000, they have worked to locate and remove landmines and other unexploded ordnance in Vietnam, Cambodia, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, and more recently have focused on helping the innocent victims of these indiscriminate weapons with medical, rehabilitation, and vocational assistance. As someone who has fought for years to rid the world of landmines, I am proud that Clear Path is based in my home State.  Clear Path recently expanded its work to Afghanistan. I ask unanimous consent that a September 15, 2007, article in the Rutland Herald about Clear Path's work be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Rutland Herald, Sept. 11, 2007]   CPI Continuing To Grow Its Reputation as a Force for Humanitarian                                  Relief                          (By Patrick McArdle)       Dorset.--Clear Path International is continuing to grow its      reputation as a force for humanitarian relief with new      developments this year in Afghanistan and Slovenia.       For the first time, Clear Path is operating a program in      Afghanistan in partnership with an American company and the      Department of State.       Clear Path, which has offices in Dorset and Seattle, has      also received a promise of almost a quarter million dollars      from a nonprofit organization in Slovenia which will allow it      to continue and expand their work in Vietnam.       Martha Hathaway, the executive director of Clear Path, said      it was important for the organization to get the kind of      wider recognition that leads to expansions like the one it      has recently undertaken.       But Hathaway is much more interested in talking about the      work Clear Path is doing and the need in the countries it      operates than in congratulating Clear Path on its efforts.       In Afghanistan, Clear Path will be creating victims'      assistance programs which has been part of its mission for      some time.       Hathaway founded Clear Path in 2001 with her husband,      James, Kristen Leadem of Dorset, and Imbert Matthee of      Washington, as a land mine removal organization. Now, the      group works primarily in assisting victims and raising      awareness.       In Afghanistan, Clear Path will be working as a      subcontractor to DynCorp International which has a contract      with the Department of State's Office of Weapons Removal and      Abatement. Hathaway said the Clear Path office in Kabul,      which has been operatig since April, is staffed partially by      Americans, working to engage Afghanis in the process.       The State Department is worried about projects that are not      self-sustaining,'' Hathaway said.       Hathaway said because the government of Afghanistan already      had a national strategy for helping victims of land mines,      who not only have to deal with their injury but access issues      and loss of income, Clear Path would look for ways the State      Department can assist the local agencies. That is likely to      include things like organizing a national workshop on      victims' assistance or creating a system for building      ramps and making schools accessible.       While Clear Path has already had some success with similar      programs in Cambodia and along the Thailand-Burma border,      Hathaway said that didn't necessarily make things easier when      they expanded into a country like Afghanistan that has      suffered greatly from the use of land mines.       ``Every country impacted by land mines is different but we      can take the bits and pieces of institutional knowledge we've      gained over the years and apply it where it makes sense,''      she said.       According to Clear Path, an average of 90 people are      injured by land mines or explosive remnants in Afghanistan      every month and about half die before they can be treated.       The grant from the Slovenia-based International Trust for      Demining and Mine Victims Assistance also presents new      opportunities for Clear Path.       Under the agreement, the trust will raise $230,000 from      among its 27 government and private-sector donors to match      what Clear Path raises from the United States government and      donors.       Hathaway said this is the first time Clear Path has      received funds from the trust and marks the trust's first      efforts in Southeast Asia.       The trust was founded about 10 years ago to assist people      in the Balkans but Hathaway said as land mines became less of      a threat in Europe, charitable organizations there have begun      to look at ways they can help victims in other places.       According to Hathaway, Clear Path will use the money to      assist ongoing efforts in Vietnam through capital purchases      and the hiring of new staff rather than to create new      programs.       Despite Clear Path's successes, which have led to more      contracts and funding, the need is still great and money      remains an issue.       The problem of land mines, especially those which remain      after a war is over and injure civilians, gained      international attention more than 10 years ago through the      support of several well-known figures, primarily England's      Princess Diana.       Land mine removal is expensive, however, and organizations      like Clear Path, which assist with rehabilitation and the      development of resources so victims can earn their own      living, are in it for the long-term.       ``Donor fatigue is a real problem,'' Hathaway said.       While Clear Path is raising more money than it has in the      past, it comes from fewer donors, primarily the large      donations like     the ones from the trust, rather than the numerous pledges of      $50 or $100 they received in the past.       Clear Path also has the disadvantage of being based in      Seattle and out-of-the-mainstream Dorset, far from the      significant donors based in New York City or Washington, DC.       Clear Path has raised money through benefit concerts and a      music CD. Its next concert will be on Oct. 13 at the Long      Trail School in Dorset with performers Sarah Lee Guthrie and      Johnny Irion, introduced by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.                               ____________________
