President, the Senator from Idaho has indicated we worked late last evening to craft a unanimous consent that will allow several important amendments to be debated today, and continuing on through Tuesday. It represents a recognition that there are serious issues to discuss. Now we are at the stage of not only discussing those issues but also taking amendments up and voting on them. I know Senator Daschle will be here in a moment.
