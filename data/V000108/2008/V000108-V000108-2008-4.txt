 Well, in northwest Indiana on July 8, three people died in a crossing accident in Gary, Indiana. On July 25, in northwest Indiana in the community of Griffith, there was a rail accident where three additional people were injured. In Portage, Indiana, this month, on September 3, another woman was killed in Porter County. There is one person getting killed at a train accident in the 1st Congressional District every 21 days since July 8.  I support the chairman's legislation that says let's think about people for a change. Let's have some equity in this so that people and communities are protected, just like the railroads are.     [From the Northwest Indiana and Illinois Times, July 8, 2008]                     Three Dead in Car-Train Crash                            (By Dan Hinkel)       Gary.--Three people died when a freight train blasted      through a car that drove around crossing gates Monday      afternoon in Gary's Miller neighborhood, police said.       The victims were Marvin Alvarez, 20, of Gary, and Nicole      Thomas, 21, and Rosie Godines, 18, both of Hobart, according      to a spokeswoman from the Lake County coroner's office.       The busy scene at Miller Avenue and Lake Street devolved      into turmoil in the hours following the 5 p.m. wreck. Irate      mourners scuffled with police officers and attacked cameramen      from television news crews. An officer appeared to fire a      Taser on a sobbing, shrieking man who joined a group of      people fighting with a man who appeared to be a police      detective.       All three died at the scene after the southbound Ford      Taurus pulled around the gates into an eastbound CSX train's      path, police said. None of the victims wore seat belts, and      two of them were thrown from the car, said Gary police Cpl.      Agnes Roberts. The bodies were covered with sheets near the      car as firefighters cut the third body from the vehicle's      wreckage in front of witnesses and bystanders gathered along      the commercial strip.       ``I still can't believe it and I'm standing right here      looking,'' said Sandra Mays, of Gary.       Mays drove the first northbound vehicle in line behind the      gates before the wreck. She was prepared for a long wait      before the Taurus came ``out of nowhere'' around the gates,      Mays said. She called 911 after the train plowed into the      car's passenger side and pushed it about 50 feet east down      the tracks. Mays said she could see that all the victims were      dead.       ``It happened so fast, like something you see on TV,'' she      said.       Shirley Taylor, of Merrillville, was in the nearby Chase      bank when she heard the train's horns blowing and its brakes      screeching, she said. The bank manager ran outside to help,      but he returned with shock on his face, Taylor said.       ``He came over and told everyone there was nothing he could      do,'' Taylor said.       The victims' relatives descended on the scene about 6 p.m.      A small group of furious men alternated between sobbing      inconsolably and bellowing profane threats at police,      firefighters, clergy, bystanders and news reporters. A man      who identified himself as Alvarez's brother struggled with      officers. A man threw a rock at a television cameraman.      Another man was arrested after a fight in the Chase bank      parking lot. He was handcuffed and apparently stunned with a      Taser. Gary police were not available Monday night to comment      on the fights after the crash.       The train's nine cars and two locomotives were headed from      Chicago to Columbus, Ohio, said CSX spokesman Gary Sease. No      one on the train was hurt, Sease said.                                  ____     [From the Northwest Indiana and Illinois Times, July 26, 2008]                    Train Hits Truck, Injures Three                         (By Vanessa Renderman)       Griffith.--Three people suffered minor injuries Friday when      a train hit a tractor-trailer, knocking a 20-ton piece of      construction equipment off the truck bed and forcing the      truck into two occupied vehicles.       ``I've never seen anything like this,'' Griffith Cpl. Ryan      Bottiger said.       The accident occurred early in the afternoon at the      intersection of Main Street and Wiggs Avenue.       The front of an eastbound Canadian National train struck      the back end of a Grimmer Construction tractor-trailer that      was crossing the tracks. The crossing has no gates, but the      lights were working, Bottiger said.       A westbound train on parallel tracks had just gone through      the crossing.       The driver of the tractor-trailer, who declined to give his      name, said the car in front of him crossed the tracks, and he      started to cross. Because of the angle, he didn't see the      eastbound train coming. By the time he did, it was too late,      and the back end of his truck got clipped, he said. The      driver suffered an abrasion to his chin.       The force shook loose a 20-ton piece of construction      equipment that was chained to the rear of the tractor-     trailer. The equipment rolled, gouging chunks of asphalt from      the street. It landed on a grassy residential corner and      leaked diesel fuel and hydraulic fluid, which crews cleaned      up, Bottiger said.       The tractor-trailer hit two vehicles that were in the      oncoming lane, including the gray Mercury Montego that      Merrillville resident John Holliday was driving.       Holliday said he was waiting for a westbound train to pass.      When it did, a vehicle in the oncoming lane crossed the      tracks. Holliday then heard a train whistle and saw the      tractor-trailer cross the tracks and get hit, before      barreling toward his car.       ``At that point, all I could see was a truck coming head      first, straight on,'' he said. ``It's kind of a bad feeling,      seeing a truck coming right at you.''       Holliday's car was hit on the front passenger side. The      airbag deployed, which burned his hand. He saw the 20-ton      piece of construction equipment roll off the truck.       ``It looked like out of a movie,'' he said.       Although Holliday was alone in his car, the other vehicle      that was struck had four occupants, three of whom were      children. The driver was transported to a hospital with      nonlife-threatening injuries and a relative picked up the      children, Bottiger said.       Bottiger said Friday afternoon he didn't know whether any      citations would be issued.                                  ____        [From the Northwest Indiana Post-Tribune, Sept. 4, 2008]               Portage Woman, 43, Dies When Hit by Train       Portage.--Police are continuing to investigate the death of      a Portage woman who was killed Tuesday night when a train hit      her.       Linda Evola, 43, of 5075 Lincoln St., was declared dead at      11:04 p.m. Tuesday from massive blunt force trauma, Porter      County Coroner Victoria Deppe said.       Evola was hit by an eastbound CSX train near Don's Motel,      5500 U.S. 20, around 10 p.m. Tuesday, according to a Portage      Police Department release.       Sgt. Keith Hughes said two engineers on the train saw Evola      walking west on the tracks and sounded the train's horn. The      engineers said Evola looked up, Hughes said, but she did not      move off the tracks.       ``At this time it's still unknown whether she intended to      do it,'' Hughes said.       Deppe said that right now her office is ruling the death an      accident.       ``She did live near the train,'' Deppe said. ``That was a      place people cut through.''       She also said that it does not appear drugs or alcohol      played a part, although her office is running toxicology      tests.                              {time}  1245
