The Clerk read as follows:                                S. 1509       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,      TITLE I--INDIAN EMPLOYMENT, TRAINING, AND RELATED SERVICES                       DEMONSTRATION ACT AMENDMENTS     SEC. 101.

(a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--       (1) Indian tribes and Alaska Native organizations that have      participated in carrying out programs under the Indian      Employment, Training, and Related Services Demonstration Act      of 1992 (25 U.S.C. 3401 et seq.) have--       (A) improved the effectiveness of employment-related      services provided by those tribes and organizations to their      members;       (B) enabled more Indian and Alaska Native people to prepare      for and secure employment;       (C) assisted in transitioning tribal members from welfare      to work; and       (D) otherwise demonstrated the value of integrating      employment, training, education and related services.       (E) the initiatives under the Indian Employment, Training,      and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 should be      strengthened by ensuring that all Federal programs that      emphasize the value of work may be included within a      demonstration program of an Indian or Alaska Native      organization;       (F) the initiatives under the Indian Employment, Training,      and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992 should have      the benefit of the support and attention of the officials      with policymaking authority of--       (i) the Department of the Interior;       (ii) other Federal agencies that administer programs      covered by the Indian Employment, Training, and Related      Services Demonstration Act of 1992.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are to      demonstrate how Indian tribal governments can integrate the      employment, training, and related services they provide in      order to improve the effectiveness of those services, reduce      joblessness in Indian communities, foster economic      development on Indian lands, and serve tribally-determined      goals consistent with the policies of self-determination and      self-governance.
