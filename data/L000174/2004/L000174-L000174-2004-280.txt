He was concerned about the 20-year penalty to which this might subject some of these contractors. Obviously, thousands of contractors are not going to be subjected to that. It is only going to be the most grievous ones.  He is proposing, if I am correct, a statute that would subject overseas contractors to a 30-year penalty. I thought I was a tough prosecutor. The Senator from Virginia complains about my 20-year penalty; he is proposing 30 years. I don't mean to get into a bidding war on penalties, but if my 20 years is too Draconian, 30 years sounds even more so.
