President, first of all, I congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee for the excellent work they have done and for bringing a bipartisan bill before the Senate.  Shortly, Senator Patty Murray and I will do our opening statements on the fiscal year 2012 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
