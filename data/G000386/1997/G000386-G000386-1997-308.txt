 President, would you please notify me when I have used 14 minutes, because I want 1 minute on the Hollings issue as well.  Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Ms. Charlene Barshefsky as United States Trade Representative. Ms. Barshefsky has served as acting USTR since April 1996. So we are all familiar with her work. I have personally worked with her and her staff on several issues in the past year. And I had the opportunity to watch her in Singapore, at the WTO ministerial, negotiate the Information Technology Agreement. Based on her job performance and her international reputation as a strong advocate for U.S. interests, I am prepared to support her nomination today.  Mr. President, the next 4 years will be crucial for U.S. trade policy. We are beginning our fourth year under the North American Free-Trade Agreement and third year under the World Trade Organization. The U.S. Trade Representative must closely monitor the implementation of these agreements to ensure they are working to open markets to American exports.                        Fast-Track Negotiations  The USTR will also serve as President Clinton's point person in several key negotiations. First, she will have to negotiate with Congress on fast track authority. As you know, Mr. President, fast track means that Congress grants to the administration its authority to negotiate trade agreements. Once an agreement is reached, it must be ratified by Congress within a specified period of time and is not subject to amendment.  Fast track is necessary because Congress, alone, has the constitutional authority to enter into trade agreements. But as a practical matter, other nations are reluctant to negotiate agreements with the President, that may later be modified by Congress. So I do believe it's necessary that Congress grant fast track authority to the President.  But fast track is a significant delegation of power. So its crucial that Congress carefully tailor this delegation in order to accomplish its goals. And it's important that the President, in carrying out this delegation, negotiate within the parameters of the authority granted to him.  Herein lies the problem. Congress and the President often have different ideas of what should be included in trade agreements. This administration has made it clear that they want the authority to negotiate on labor and environmental issues under the fast track process. But most of us Republicans don't believe that these issues should be part of trade agreements.  So Congress has not given the President fast track authority since 1994. And our foreign trading partners now doubt the desire of the United States to lead on trade issues. We are being left by the wayside. For example, after 3 years of NAFTA we are beginning to see very positive results. Through the third quarter of 1996, for instance, exports to Mexico just from my State of Iowa are up over 34 percent. The three NAFTA nations are now the world's largest trading bloc. And it's time to begin looking at expanding this free trade area to other nations in the Western Hemisphere.  But this cannot happen without fast track. So I implore Ms. Barshefsky to negotiate with Congress in good faith to achieve fast track. Let's put aside our partisan differences. And let's remember that trade is the focus of these agreements. The United States cannot continue to insist on addressing other issues within the context of trade agreements.  Issues such as environmental and labor standards are very important. But there are avenues other than trade agreements that ought to be pursued to influence the behavior of other countries. And the expansion of trade, itself, with another country can be an effective inroad for making change.  So let trade agreements stand on their own. They are difficult enough to negotiate without taking on the weight of these other issues. I'll have more to say on fast track as negotiations progress with the administration.                       China's Entry Into the WTO  Mr. President, I hope that Ms. Barshefsky does not have to spend all of her time negotiating with Congress. She also faces very critical negotiations on admitting China as a member of the World Trade Organization. These negotiations could affect the U.S. trade balance for decades. I am reminded of Japan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the 1950's. It seems that we are still paying for lowering the standards to let Japan into the GATT.  In the area of agriculture trade, which is very important to my State, these negotiations may determine whether China becomes our largest export market or our biggest competitor. The stakes are extremely high for American farmers.  That's why I'm concerned that some members of the Clinton administration want to let China into the WTO at any cost. So I took the liberty of asking both Secretary of State Albright and Ambassador Barshefsky about the terms of China's entry. I want to quote from their answers in order to get their opinions on the public record.  Secretary Albright said,       We have requested that China make significant commitments      to liberalize its agricultural trading regime, including      reforming its state trading system, making substantial tariff      cuts, eliminating unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary      measures, and binding its subsidy levels.  She also stated:       If China is to join the WTO, we will need to have a      commercially acceptable protocol package of commitments by      China to open its markets in-hand before we will agree to      China's accession. That means real market access for U.S.      goods and services, including agriculture.  Then I asked Ms. Barshefsky to comment on Secretary Albright's statements. She said,       I fully agree with the two above statements. China's WTO      accession can only occur on commercially meaningful terms.      And, just as you quote Secretary Albright, that means market      access for our goods, services and agriculture to the fastest      growing economy in the world.  Mr. President, I am pleased with the way that both Ambassador Barshefsky and Secretary of State Albright responded to my questions. I hope this will continue to be the policy of their agencies.  I understand that it is very important to integrate China into these multilateral organizations. I have always believed that we can encourage change in China more effectively if we engage them economically. But we cannot sacrifice the interests of American workers and farmers by allowing China to subsidy their industries while keeping their markets closed.  So I will continue to monitor very closely the ongoing negotiations with China. And I encourage Ms. Barshefsky to continue to take a hard line on this issue. I'm reminded of a meeting that I had with Ms. Barshefsky in Singapore when we were attending the WTO ministerial meeting. Since it was reported in the local press, I don't think I'm breaching any confidences by repeating it here in the Senate.  There was a meeting of the Quad nations, which is the United States, Canada, Japan, and the European Union, concerning China's entry into the WTO. The local Singapore newspaper reported that Minister Leon Brittan of the European Union argued that bringing China into the WTO was so important that conditions of entry should be relaxed. The Japanese minister disagreed very strongly with this position. And apparently Ms. Barshefsky concurred with the Japanese minister.  I repeat this incident just to point out that there are different views on this issue. Many nations will seek to treat China with ``kids gloves.'' So it is crucial that the United States play a leadership role in assuring that our interests are protected.                            NAFTA Expansion  A third area of negotiations that could be significant in the next 4 years is the expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. President Clinton promised back in 1992 that Chile would become a part of the NAFTA. But the lack of fast track authority has undermined this promise. Now, Chile has moved ahead and signed a free trade agreement with Canada. And they have also become an associate member of Mercosur.  This is a good example of what happens when Washington fails to lead. The rest of the world moves on without us. And the consequences are very real in terms of U.S. jobs and standard of living.  Let's just take Chile, for example. Chile has the potential to become a very important market for United States agricultural exports. Over the last 10 years, the Chilean economy has grown at an average rate of 6.5 percent and real per capita income is up 50 percent. And since 1984, poultry consumption has risen 60 percent, pork consumption over 45 percent and beef consumption over 30 percent.  The United States currently supplies most of the feed grain Chile uses to support their livestock production. But this market could be put in jeopardy. Chile is increasingly turning to neighboring countries with whom they have preferential trade agreements to supply agricultural products. So the United States' failure to lead on trade has a real impact in terms of lost markets and lost opportunities.  I also ask the President and Ms. Barshefsky to begin taking a hard look at other nations in the Western Hemisphere for NAFTA expansion. Brazil and Argentina have already moved ahead and formed their own customs union, the Mercosur, with Paraguay and Uruguay. And the economies of the Caribbean nations have been hard hit by the increased trade between Mexico and the United States So they would like to enjoy NAFTA status.  This administration needs to articulate its vision of how free trade should proceed in the Americas. Soon. Or it will be the United States who is left out in the cold.                              Agriculture  One last issue I would like to discuss, Mr. President, is agriculture. In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton mentioned that the United States is now exporting more goods and services than at any other time in its history. I am glad he did that, because those of us in Washington need to articulate the benefits of free trade. I was disappointed, however, that the President failed to acknowledge the contribution of agriculture, which is the ``shining star'' of our trade balance.  As most sectors continue to run trade deficits, our farmers continue to produce food that the entire world wants to buy; 1996 was another record year for agricultural exports, totaling over $60 billion. This resulted in a trade surplus in agriculture goods of $26.8 billion. Which is the largest surplus of any sector. Since our total trade in merchandise suffered a $187.6 billion deficit in 1996, agriculture is truly a shining star.  But that isn't to say we can't do better. The Uruguay Round agreement, ratified by Congress in 1994, was really the first step in opening up global trade for agriculture. That agreement not only lowered tariffs and quotas for ag products. It also addressed nontrade barriers, such as unjustified health and safety concerns.  The agreement's sanitary and phytosanitary provisions mandate the use of sound science when setting health and safety standards for imports. No longer is protectionist government policy or politics supposed to decide whether a certain product is allowed into a country. Sound, scientific standards must be used.  Not surprisingly, these provisions are the subject of several current disputes. The European Union's ban on U.S. beef and their failure to certify our meat packing plants for export are just two examples. And there are many more. The Clinton administration must vigorously enforce these important provisions with our trading partners. We can't continue to allow other nations to breach their trade agreements in order to keep out our agricultural goods.  The stakes have never been higher. Our farmers have become more dependent on world markets for their income. The revolutionary farm program enacted last year begins to lessen the Government's role in agriculture. The result is that, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, up to 31 percent of all farm income will come from foreign markets by the end of the decade. I don't know too many farmers who can afford to give up 31 percent of their income.  Beyond our current disputes, the next round of agricultural negotiations at the WTO are set to begin in 1999. Ms. Barshefsky will be a key player in these negotiations. That is why I was concerned about recent staffing decisions at the U.S. Trade Representative's office.  On the morning of Ms. Barshefsky's confirmation hearing at the Finance Committee, the Journal of Commerce ran a very disturbing article. The article pointed out that the top two agriculture staffers at USTR had been replaced with a political appointee with no agriculture experience.  I had a telephone conversation and an exchange of letters between Ms. Barshefsky. She is convinced that these decisions will make her office more responsive and effective on ag issues. So I am willing to defer to her judgment and her right to hire her own staff. I will, however, be overseeing her performance on these issues.                               Conclusion  Mr. President, I have discussed several issues that I believe President Clinton and his nominee for USTR, Charlene Barshefsky, must lead on in the next 4 years. The last 2 years were a disappointment for those of us who believe in the benefits of international trade. The likes of Pat Buchanan and the AFL-CIO called the shots on trade for the 1996 Presidential candidates. The focus was on lost jobs and companies moving offshore.  The press ignored the multitude of stable, high-paying jobs that trade has created in this country. And they ignored the benefits of free trade to the consumers of this country. Let's not forget that tariffs are simply a tax imposed on goods that consumers buy.  The President and Ms. Barshefsky must use their positions as leaders to articulate the benefits of free trade. Tell the American people how workers and farmers benefit from free trade policies. Tell them how much consumers save on their groceries and clothing bills because of free trade. Articulate your vision for expanding economic opportunity in this country by selling our products overseas. Leadership is sorely needed.  President Clinton, I believe you have chosen the right person in Charlene Barshefsky. But you will ultimately be measured by your willingness or failure to lead the American people toward a brighter future in a global economy.  Mr. President, I would also like to say a brief word on the Hollings amendment. It seems to me that Senator Hollings is really concerned with a fundamental question that we all must answer. That is, what is the relationship between Congress and the President in making trade policy. In other words, does the President have the authority to enter into international agreements, that change U.S. law, without congressional consent?  Despite the debate that you will hear today, the answer to this question is relatively simple. Under our Constitution, the President only has the authority that Congress has granted to him. During the fast track debate, which I hope we'll have this year, Congress will define the limits of the Presidential authority on trade matters.  But let's be clear about one thing. The President does not have the authority to change U.S. statutory law without congressional action. That is why Congress had to approve implementing legislation after the President signed the NAFTA agreement and the Uruguay round agreement in recent years. The President did not have the authority to unilaterally consent to these significant changes in U.S. law.  That is why I believe this amendment is unnecessary. But I also think it could be dangerous. The amendmentis drafted so broadly that it could subject an agreement to congressional approval every time it affects a minor regulation or administrative practice. In my opinion, this would result in very few trade agreements being consummated. Our trading partners would never have the assurance they were negotiating an agreement that would be recognized by Congress.  Look at just what we have accomplished in the last few months, negotiating the Informational Technology Agreement and the Telecommunications Agreement. These landmark agreements will result in thousands of high-paying jobs being created in the United States. I don't believe these agreements would have been possible given the chilling effect of the Hollings amendment.  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Hollings amendment and then vote to confirm Charlene Barshefsky. It's time to focus on moving this country ahead by negotiating new agreements and opening new markets to U.S. exports.
