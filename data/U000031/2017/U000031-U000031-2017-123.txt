Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 446 authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, upon request, to extend by 6 years the time period during which construction must commence on the Gathright Hydroelectric Project located in Alleghany County, Virginia. Additionally, FERC may reinstate the construction license if it is expired.  A similar bill was passed under suspension of the rules in the 114th Congress in a bipartisan way, and I would hope that we can do it today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 446, a bill to extend the deadline for commencement of construction of a hydroelectric project, introduced by Mr. Griffith.  On March 13, 2012, FERC licensed the Gathright Hydroelectric Project to be located at the Army Corps of Engineers' Gathright Dam on the Jackson River in Alleghany County, Virginia. The licensee for the Gathright project was not able to commence construction by the already-extended deadline in March 2016.  The bill would, therefore, authorize FERC to extend for up to three consecutive 2-year periods the date by which the licensee is required to commence construction. Similar legislation passed the House of Representatives by voice vote twice during the last Congress.  I hope everybody will support passage of H.R. 446. I hope we can get this thing built.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
