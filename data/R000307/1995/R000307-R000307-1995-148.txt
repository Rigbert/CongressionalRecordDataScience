Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution offered today by the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas]. Most of it has been said before by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Boehner], the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Pastor], and my other colleagues, but it bears repeating because it is such good news. It is progress. It is something that has been done that we can all be proud of, and I want to thank all the Members on both sides of the aisle for their participation and their cooperation, but especially the gentleman from California [Mr. Thomas], our chairman, and also the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] on the minority side, but more especially, Bill.                              {time}  1130  The chairman of the committee has persevered time after time after time. We have been present during the process of the Subcommittee on Accounts and tried to institute reform and real cuts and bring sunshine into the process. The chairman has approached it in a professional manner, and lo and behold, this year we have been able to achieve true bipartisan reform.  The gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] has also illustrated the same school of thought and leadership all throughout our hearings.  We have a resolution before us that, as I said, represents real progress. Since the opening day of the 104th Congress, the House has been really working to fulfill our pledge that we made to the American people. We have cut the committee staff by one-third. For the first time we are consolidating the committee spending or the funding into a single 2-year funding resolution. That is reform. This new process includes both statutory and investigatory funds, as well as below-the-line costs, the hidden costs, the costs that were always hidden before. I am talking about office supplies and long-distance telephone charges that have never before been included in the committee budgets.  This resolution represents a total of a 30-percent cut in committee funding. That is a real cut. That is compared to the 103d Congress, from $223 million down to $156.3 million. That is a real cut.  In previous years the committees were funded on a yearly basis, 1 year, not 2, and they received funds from two sources--as I said before, statutory and investigative. I know that is an inside-the-Beltway term, and it is an inside-the-House Administration Committee term, but the statutory budgets, which total over 50 percent of the committee costs, what we are spending on committees, were allocated through a nonpublic process. It was behind closed doors. It was administered by the Finance Office. The investigative sources, which total only 45 percent of the total, were the only funds authorized through a public process, and that is where Chairman Thomas, when he was the ranking minority member, and Yours Truly labored so long trying to institute the reforms. It included hearings, as I have indicated, before the previous House Administration Committee.  In addition, the committees received funding from other sources for such things as legislative office supplies, long-distance phone calls, and franked mail. These cost a total of 4.1 percent, but they were not available. The new majority in the Congress has finally shed the light of public disclosure on this process. House rules adopted at the beginning of the 104th Congress state that the Congress must, for the first time ever, publicly state all committee spending every 2 years and fund all staff salaries out of a single unified account.  Our committees must also include all the below-the-line costs, the hidden costs, in their budgets. The House Oversight Committee has taken further steps by establishing the franked mail allocations for each committee. Last year the House overspent the franked mail appropriations by over $2 million. Let me repeat that. They overspent the franked mail allowance by more than $2 million. The separate franked allocations included in this resolution will control the overspending and keep a lid on the excess mailings.  One of the biggest accomplishments has come in the area of minority resources. According to the House rules, the majority has the responsibility of determining the funding level of the minority. In the past many committees were denied a fair share of the resources. In the 103d Congress the minority was allowed only about 21\1/2\ percent of the investigative resources. [[Page H3169]] Under the resolution we are considering today all committees will be treated fairly. All committee chairmen will treat the minority the same or better than the minority was treated in the past allocation of resources. In fact, 13 committee chairmen are increasing the allocations of staff or resources to the minority. In the last Congress only 4 of 21 committees were actually provided a figure at or above the 33-percent goal. Nine Republican chairmen will allot one-third of the committee staff and of the resources to the minority.  So I am calling this the Bill Thomas 15-year Great Leap Forward. It is a reform. Progress is being made.
