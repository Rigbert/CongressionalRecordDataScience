President, I rise today to pay tribute to Michael S. Pinto, Superintendent of Schools in Middletown, Rhode Island. After 36 years, Superintendent Pinto is leaving the school system where he began his career, bound for a well-deserved retirement.  During his tenure in Middletown, Superintendent Pinto has held almost every possible position one can hold in the field of education. He has been a teacher, a principal, a business manager for the school district, an assistant superintendent, and, most recently, the superintendent.  Over the years--even when I represented Rhode Island's neighboring Congressional district in the House of Representatives, I was privileged to have the advice of Superintendent Pinto on a variety of issues related to education, from school choice to educational standards. Indeed, I could always count on hearing from Superintendent Pinto about Impact Aid. He is the program's number one advocate.  His commitment to Impact Aid underscores his overall dedication to Middletown's schools and students and the cause of education. A measure of his commitment was shown in a recent news article which reported that in the last fifteen years he has had no more than seven consecutive days off.  As superintendent, Mr. Pinto has presided over a number of successful initiatives including the fundamental repair of two schools, a new system of measuring student learning, and an optional all-day kindergarten. Superintendent Pinto has consistently sought to share the professional accolades he has received with his colleagues in Middletown. His emphasis on team work has earned him the admiration and respect of those who have worked with him.  I thank Superintendent Pinto for his tremendous dedication and congratulate him for all that he has done for Middletown. While the Middletown school system will miss Michael Pinto, I am sure that even in retirement he will continue his work to improve education and better his community.  Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Chafee today in saluting Superintendent Pinto and wishing him the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
