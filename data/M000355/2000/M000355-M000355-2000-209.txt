 President, I rise today to make some brief remarks about an amendment I offered along with Senator Stevens and Senator Warner to the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This amendment temporarily suspends enforcement of a Department of Defense regulation prohibiting State and local election officials from operating polling places at Department of Defense facilities.  A few weeks ago, my staff at the Rules Committee began receiving calls from elections officials in several states complaining that the Department of Defense had directed them to stop using polling places on military facilities that had, in some instances, been used for decades. Senator Grams, Senator Warner and Senator Stevens also received letters and calls from their State election officials expressing concern about the impact of the Department of Defense regulation on upcoming elections.  Mr. President, let me spell out some of the real hardships that would occur in the absence of our amendment.
