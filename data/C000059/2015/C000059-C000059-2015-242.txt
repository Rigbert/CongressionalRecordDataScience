Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a couple whose commitment to each other and to the Riverside County, California community is exceptional. Today, Dan and Joan Hollingsworth will be celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary. This couple has spent their lives raising a beautiful family and serving their local community.  Dan and Joan were married in Pomona, California in 1955 at the First Baptist Church. After moving to San Jacinto, California in 1960, the couple established Dan's Dairy, a dairy farm that also featured a cash and carry storefront. Dedicated to his business and the greater farming industry, Dan joined the Board of Directors of the Riverside County Farm Bureau after being asked to serve. Dan later went on to serve as the President of the Farm Bureau Board from 1976 to 1978. Dan also worked as a District Representative for Congressman Victor Veysey.  Like her husband, Joan was also very involved with the community over the years. She served on the Riverside County School District Organization, as well as many school, church and charitable organizations. Together Dan and Joan have four children; Bettina Louise, Marcella Joan, Leonard Daniel, and Dennis Clark, 17 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.  Dan and Joan are still both very active community members. They have owned and operated JoDan Farms, a wholesale tree nursery, in Murrieta, California since 1989. Dan also has served as the Chair of the Riverside County Republican Party. In 1989, Dan was chosen to be the recipient of the Bob Howie Award for Outstanding Service to Riverside County Agriculture. More recently, he was also selected to receive the Myra Goldwater Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his many contributions to the Riverside County community.  Dan and Joan's tireless passion for their family, community service and giving back has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside County, California. I am proud to call Dan and Joan close friends, fellow community members and great Americans. Today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating them on the celebration of their 60th wedding anniversary.                          ____________________
