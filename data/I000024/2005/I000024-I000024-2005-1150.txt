It is not as great a problem in Oklahoma as the problem in North Dakota because your construction season is shorter than ours. Right now one of our major concerns is that we can get in there and get the contracts in a timely fashion so we can get under construction and do the work we are supposed to be doing.  Also, before the Senator from North Dakota came in, we commented this is somewhat of a life-and-death situation. Last year, nearly 43,000 people died on our Nation's highways. This represents the single greatest cause of accidental death in Americans ages 2 to 33.  The core safety programs will be corrected. According to the Department of Transportation, time in congestion increased from 31.7 percent in 1992 to 33 percent in 2000. We had several discussions yesterday about the cost of fuel and the fact that if you have all this congestion--certainly we know what this is in Washington, DC--the cars are out there idling, burning fuel, not getting anywhere. We need to get this country moving.  I appreciate the comments of the Senator from North Dakota.  We are at the time designated to have the vote. This could be one of the maybe two or three most significant votes we have this year. It will allow us to do all that we have been talking about for the last hour. It is rather refreshing during this time we did not have anyone coming down and opposing this motion to proceed.  The Senator from North Dakota is exactly right. We want to encourage people who have a problem to come down. Maybe we can make them better. We want to consider amendments. We want to get this done.
