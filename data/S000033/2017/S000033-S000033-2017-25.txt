 President, I would like to enter into the Congressional Record the scores produced by the Congressional Budget Office for section 20001 as it appears in Senate amendment 1618; and the score of section 20001 as it appears in Senate amendment 1855.  In Senate amendment 1618, CBO estimates that opening the coastal plain for oil and gas leasing and managing ``it in accordance with requirements of the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (including regulations)'' will result in net Federal receipts of $1092 million from 2018 through 2027.  In Senate amendment 1855, CBO estimates that managing lease sales ``in a manner similar to the administration of leases under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976 (including regulations)'' will result in netFederal receipts of $910 million from 2018 through 2027, a decrease of $182 million compared to the language in Senate amendment 1618.  I ask unanimous consent that the following CBO tables be printed in the Record.
