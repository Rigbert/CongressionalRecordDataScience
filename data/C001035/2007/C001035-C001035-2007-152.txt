President, later today, the Senate will vote on the amendment I have offered with a number of my colleagues--Senator Stevens, Senator Warner, Senator Coleman, Senator Sununu, and Senator Voinovich--that would provide certain employment rights for the Transportation Security Administration's employees.  Throughout our committee's work on homeland security, it has become clear the ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing conditions, to emerging threats, to new intelligence, to impending crises is essential. From the intelligence community to our first responders, the key to an effective response is flexibility--putting assets and, more importantly, personnel where they are needed when they are needed with a minimum of bureaucracy.  My questions about giving TSA employees the right to collectively bargain center around whether this right would hamper flexibility at a critical time. I have long been a supporter of Federal employees throughout my time in the Senate. I have worked in the public sector virtually my entire life, and I know how hard individuals at all levels of Government work to provide services to protect us and to serve us.  It is my hope we can forge a compromise that preserves the flexibility--we have learned in classified briefings from Kip Hawley, the head of TSA--that is needed while at the same time recognizing that TSA employees deserve more employment rights.
