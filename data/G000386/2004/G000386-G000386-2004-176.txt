 What we are doing now has not been done for a long period of time.  The Senator from Louisiana needs to be complimented on her efforts to recognize that and, particularly, to recognize that through employers who show very patriotic fervor in cooperating in this whole program.  I can say that very positively about the amendment of the Senator from Louisiana. She is asking me to predict what might happen in conference. It is very difficult to do that. I have a reputation for defending the position of the Senate and working as best I can to work through this. Obviously, I cannot make any promises to the Senator from Louisiana.
