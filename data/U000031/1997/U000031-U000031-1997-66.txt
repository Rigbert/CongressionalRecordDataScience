Speaker, during last year's Food and Drug Administration [FDA] reform deliberations, two proposals stuck me as particularly innovative, commonsense approaches to simplifying the regulation of medical devices while fully protecting public health and saving agency resources. Today, with my colleagues Representatives Eshoo, Greenwood, Towns, and Hall of Texas, I am introducing the Medical Device Regulatory Flexibility Act, legislation incorporating these proposals, to highlight them and ensure that they are central to FDA reform efforts.  First, this legislation would provide the FDA with greater flexibility in classifying devices than current law provides. Under current law, lower risk--class I and class II--new devices may go to market if the FDA finds that they are ``substantially equivalent'' to ready marketed devices. If the new device is unique andthe agency cannot make a determination that it is substantially equivalent to a marketed device, current law requires that the device be automatically classified as a class III--high risk--device, regardless of the actual level of risk posed by the new device. The manufacturer must then either complete costly and time-consuming clinical studies and submit a new device approval application to the agency or must petition the agency for reclassification, which is under current law a complex and time-consuming procedure.  Under my bill, the FDA would be given the statutory flexibility to classify a new device based on the risk posed by the device, at the request of a manufacturer whose device was determined to be ``not substantially equivalent'' to a marketed device. Under the bill, the FDA would retain full authority for determining the classification of a device. The agency would simply receive a new, risk-based classification option. Since class III devices require the most intensive review, this proposal should free up agency resources to focus on truly high-risk devices.  Second, this legislation will provide the FDA with a much simpler way to recognize device performance standards. Under current law, the FDA has the authority to promulgate standards, but the process for doing so is tortuous. As a result, the agency has rarely used this authority. Under our bill, the agency would retain the authority to promulgate its own standards, but could also recognize national and international performance standards by identifying and listing the standard in the Federal Register. Devise manufacturers would then have the option of certifying to the agency that their products met the standard as a way of fulfilling all or part of the applicable statutory requirements which must be met before devices may be marketed. Devise performance standards form the basis for device regulation in the European Community. Providing U.S. manufacturers with this option would move forward our efforts to harmonize our regulatory systems.  I would welcome additional cosponsors of this commonsense regulatory reform measure. If you would like further information or would like to cosponsor this legislation, please call me or Jane Williams, 5-3761, of my staff.                          ____________________
