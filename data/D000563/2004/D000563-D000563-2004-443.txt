This year we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, 50 years in America where we have said the integration of schools is essential to equality of opportunity. Separate but equal--Plessy v. Ferguson--was rejected by the Supreme Court 50 years ago, moving us toward a colorblind America and the integration of races in America, something essential to put the era of slavery and racism behind us.
