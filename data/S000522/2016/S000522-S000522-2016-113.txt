I thank my friend for his eloquent remarks.  I just want to conclude, Mr. Speaker.  Some day future generations will look back on America and wonder how and why such a seemingly enlightened society so blessed and endowed with education, advanced science, information, wealth, and opportunity could have failed to protect the most innocent and the most inconvenient.  History will not look favorably on today's abortion culture. I do believe we must replace it and work tirelessly to replace it with a culture of life.  Modern medicine and scientific breakthroughs, especially the widespread use of ultrasound, has shattered the pernicious myth that unborn children are mere blobs of tissue and that abortion is anything but an act of violence.  A few years ago I met with Linda Shrewsbury, an academic and African American with a degree from Harvard, who spoke and said:  ``The lies that brought me to that day and its sorrowful aftermath are crystal clear in my mind--falsehoods and deceptions that concealed the truth about abortion. Lies planted in my thinking by clever marketing, media campaigns and endless repetition led to a tragic irreversible decision--the death of my first child.''  ``At age 20, I had no inkling of the mental and emotional darkness I was about to enter.''  ``After spending many years in denial, I did eventually find healing. When I understood and rejected distortions about fetal development, doublespeak about choice, rights, planned and wanted children, I understood the reality and victimhood of my aborted child. I understood the absence of moral bases for choosing to 'dis-entitle' an innocent human being of life. When I embraced truth, truth set me free and I finally gained inner peace.''  We believe that there are two victims in every abortion: the unborn baby and the mother. Linda Shrewsbury found peace. We need to protect women from the violence of abortion, as well as babies.  I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
