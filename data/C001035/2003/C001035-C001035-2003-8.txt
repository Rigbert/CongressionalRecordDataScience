That is a wonderful story of a truly courageous woman.  We have many women such as that throughout Maine's history. Josephine Peary was one such woman. She was married to the great explorer, Robert E. Peary, who was the first to reach the North Pole, not that far from Alaska. They lived together on Eagle Island in Casco Bay, ME. Josephine began exploring when she accompanied her husband to Greenland on a journey sponsored by the Academy of Natural Sciences that would last for a year and a half. That travel, in 1892, made Josephine the first woman in history to be a member of an Arctic exploration team.  I understand that women in Alaska also have been pioneers in expanding opportunities for women to work outside of the home. I wonder if the Senator from Alaska might expand on that.
