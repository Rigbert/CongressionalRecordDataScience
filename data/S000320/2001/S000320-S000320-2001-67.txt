 President, I rise today to pay special tribute to the Valley Haven School, an important part of the Valley, AL community. Valley Haven is a school for infants, toddlers and adults who are mentally retarded or multi-handicapped. On May 5th, the school will hold it's 25th Annual Hike/Bike/Run for Valley Haven, a fund raiser which generates the crucial local funding which is vital to the school's survival.  Valley Haven School was started 41 years ago and has grown into a large, professionally staffed operation. With over 116 clients in ages ranging from 3 months to 70 years, you can see, that Valley Haven must meet significant financial standards each year to maintain viability. The school does this outside of local tax structures, so operating expenses and matching funds for grants must be raised primarily through the community at large. The Hike/Bike/Run for Valley Haven is the key fund raiser of the year which helps to bring the community together for this important cause. Among the events included in the occasion are a 5k, 8K, 10 or 22 mile run, 10 or 5 mile walk, 22, 11, or 5 mile bike, trike, and stroller event, and even a horse trail ride.  I take this opportunity to wish all those helping to organize the event and those planning to participate my best wishes in their efforts to support the school. Whether contributing time, physical effort, or financial resources, working to ensure educational opportunities for others is truly a worthy cause.                          ____________________
