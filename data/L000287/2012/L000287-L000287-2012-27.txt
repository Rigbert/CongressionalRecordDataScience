Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 21 years of service in the Georgia General Assembly House of Representatives by Kathy Ashe. Upon her decision to retire this year she leaves a legacy of altruism inside and outside the legislature and her contributions will be greatly missed.  Kathy represents the heart of Atlanta, the city that I am proud to call home and represent in the U.S House of Representatives. Kathy has stood firm in her advocacy for women and children, and has been a leader in k-12 public education and a leader by example in higher education.  Kathy was born in DeKalb, Illinois and has always spent her life in service to the community; first as a community leader, later as an educator, and continually as a volunteer. She is an example of someone who practices what she preaches and has always used her bipartisan leadership to represent the needs of her constituents. Before being elected to the Georgia Assembly in 1991, Kathy graduated from Agnes Scott College and went on to receive a Masters of Arts in Teaching from Emory University and further continued her path to higher education graduate studies at Georgia State University. She taught in the Marietta and Cobb County public schools for 8 years before dedicating herself to a career in public service.  Kathy has taken an active leadership role in a variety of organizations including the Atlanta Community Food bank, Atlanta Women's Network, Planned Parenthood Atlanta, Central Health Center, City of Atlanta Child Care Task Force, and many other boards and foundations. It goes without saying that her involvement in the community is consistent and done with a graceful dedication.  Representative Ashe, your presence and leadership will be missed in the General Assembly. Let it be known that your hard work and dedication to all Georgians and to the people of Atlanta is appreciated, and I wish you the best in your future endeavors.                          ____________________
