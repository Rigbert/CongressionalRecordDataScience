 May I ask the Senator a question? Some, I understand, may come to the floor and want a study. The study has already been done, and it is the ``Final Report On Price Manipulation in Western Energy Markets, Fact-Finding Investigation of Potential Manipulation of Electric and Natural Gas Prices.'' It was prepared by the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It was put out in March of this year.  I would like to read one section of it to the Senator and see if he is aware of this. It reads:       Recommend that Congress consider giving direct authority to      a Federal agency to ensure that electronic trading platforms      for wholesale sales of electric energy and natural gas in      interstate commerce are monitored and provide market      information that is necessary for price discovery in      competitive energy markets.
