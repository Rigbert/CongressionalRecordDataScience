President, I, too, join my colleagues today to recognize and honor Ms. Bonny O'Neil upon her retirement from the Federal Government. Ms. O'Neil is a true public servant--in all the best sense of that phrase--diligent, hardworking, attentive to details, willing to dig in and truly analyze both sides of each issue, smart, totally honest, a woman of her word, and driven by a desire to do the right thing.  She is to be commended for serving her Nation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture so well. She also served the Congress well by providing us with clear and informative answers, and guiding us through complex issues. I know that she worked closely with my nutrition counsel Ed Barron for many years--both when he was at USDA and while he worked for me starting in 1987. On many occasions late at night during a conference, I would hear someone say: ``Let's call Bonny to get the facts.''  Bonny spent all but six of those years in various positions with the Food Stamp Program, where she currently serves as the Associate Deputy Administrator.  Ms. O'Neil provided valuable assistance during our work on nutrition programs, food stamp amendments and several farm bills. Anyone who has ever worked on a farm bill knows that it is an extremely complicated task that requires many long hours, including nights and weekends. Her attention to detail and willingness to be available at any time, day or night, was most appreciated.  I thank Ms. Bonny O'Neil for her distinguished service to the public good and wish her well in her retirement.                          ____________________
