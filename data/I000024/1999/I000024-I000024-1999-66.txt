A provision of the law directs companies to conduct a public meeting for local residents regarding the risks of chemical accidents. The facilities are then supposed to send a certification of the FBI stating that they conducted the meeting. It is my understanding that the EPA and FBI havedecided that the EPA should collect the certifications and manage them through an EPA contractor. Not only did Congress not appropriate funds for this activity by the EPA but we specifically directed the FBI to collect this information.
