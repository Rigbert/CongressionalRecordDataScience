 President, on May 3, 2002, the Delaware State Bar Association will present its prestigious Liberty Bell Award to Thurman G. Adams, Jr.  I could introduce Thurman Adams to my colleagues in any number of ways, he is the dean of the Delaware State Senate, the majority leader, and by the time his current term ends, he will have served longer than any Delaware State Senator in history. And Delaware has a long history.  Senator Adams has served on and, in fact, chaired virtually every major committee, including 25 years-and-counting as chairman of the Executive Committee, current chairmanship of the Banking Committee, past chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee, and current service on the Judiciary, Administrative Services, Permanent Rules and Ethics Committees, as well as his role in the Senate leadership.  I could also introduce Thurman Adams as, in many ways, the quintessential Delawarean, I should add Sussex Countian, and I can pinpoint it even more to his beloved town of Bridgeville.  Like his father, Thurman was born on the family farm on the road now known as Adams Road. His grandson lives there now, and runs the farming operations day-to-day. Thurman graduated from Bridgeville High School, and then from the University of Delaware. After college, he joined the family feed, grain and farm business, T.G. Adams & Sons, which he now serves as president.  So, I could introduce Thurman Adams as one of the longest serving and most influential leaders of our State. I could introduce him as representing the great tradition of Delaware agriculture, Delaware towns, Delaware small business and Delaware families.  I also have the very great privilege of being able to introduce Thurman Adams as my friend, a friend I deeply admire as a man of his word, a man of conviction, a man of values and of principle.  And in a much higher tribute to him, I could introduce Thurman as the husband of one of the truly great ladies I have met in my life, Hilda McCabe Adams.  I have been with Hilda and Thurman Adams in times of victory and celebration, and I have been with them in times of tragedy and loss. In every circumstance, they have been the definition of class, and they have more integrity in their little fingers than most of us will be able to summon in our lifetimes.  Their journey together has been inspiring to those of us who are lucky enough to be around them, but it has not always been easy. They endured the loss of an infant grandchild, and then tragically in May of 2000, the death of that baby's father, their son, Brent McCabe Adams, Sr., at the age of 45. And now they are facing, with characteristic strength and courage, a serious illness for Hilda.  In honoring Thurman Adams, the Delaware Bar Association will, rightly, pay tribute to his decades of service to our State, his particular contribution as a leader on the Judiciary Committee, and his role in leading the Senate confirmation process, never as a mere matter of procedure, but thoughtfully and skillfully, for so many members of the Bar, and other Delawareans, who have been appointed to positions within our State government.  For my part, I would like to pay tribute to Thurman and Hilda Adams as, simply, exceptional and inspiring human beings, the best of citizens, the best of neighbors, and the best friends anyone could ask for. They just don't make them like Hilda and Thurman very often. We in Delaware are very lucky.                          ____________________
