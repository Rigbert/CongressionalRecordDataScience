  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President was on television this week defending his economic policies talking about the progress, and I am going to admit that after yesterday we are about halfway back to where this administration needs to be in putting Americans and America back to work.  Yesterday--congratulations are in order--Larry Summers was either fired or encouraged to leave. It doesn't matter, he's gone.  It's about a year since I asked the President to fire Geithner and Summers, two people of, by, and for Wall Street. Wall Street has received enough attention, and the Republicans would shower even more attention on Wall Street, should they take overagain, against Main Street American working people.  It's time this President came back to his Democratic roots, his Democratic values. Geithner needs to go too. Let's bring in a team that cares about working Americans.                          ____________________
