 If we pump up the budget now, we will be buying weapons that we do not need, weapons like the Sea Wolf submarine, the F-22 fighter, more B-2 bombers, Comanche helicopters, all designed to defeat a threat that no longer exists. The Sea Wolf, the F-22, the B-2 and the Comanche are all cold war relics. The cold war warriors are trying to buy cold war weapons on a post-cold war budget. That is the only reason we are having the debate on this amendment today.  This kind of defense policy will give us another hollow force like we had in the 1970's. We will end up with another hollow force because the cold war warriors have to rob the readiness accounts to pay for the cold war relics. They have to rob the readiness accounts because all the cold war weapons are underfunded. They are underfunded because this outrageous price tag cannot be justified in the absence of a Soviet military threat.  I yield the floor.
