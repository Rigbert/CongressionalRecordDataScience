 President, no one has been more active in the vineyards of the first amendment than the Senator from Minnesota. I thank him for his important contribution to this debate and his astute observation that to the extent the parties and groups are quieted, the voices are enhanced on the other side, or that is anybody's voice that is not quieted is necessarily enhanced by that action, and in particular the fourth estate, our friends in the press, who love this issue, would have a dramatic increase in political clout as a result of the quieting of the voices of so many other Americans.  So I thank my friend from Minnesota for his observations.
