President, today the Senate will resume debate on the China PNTR legislation. Under the order, Senator Byrd will debate his amendment in regard to subsidies for 1 hour. Following the debate on the Byrd amendment, Senator Thompson will be recognized to offer his China nonproliferation amendment. Further amendments may be offered during today's session, however, any votes during today's session ordered with respect to those amendments will be scheduled to occur at 9:30 in the morning on Tuesday. It is hoped that the Senate can complete action on this important trade bill as early as possible so that the Senate may begin consideration of those appropriations bills still available for action.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.                          ____________________
