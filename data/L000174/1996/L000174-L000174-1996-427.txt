President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman so that we may provide assurance to the many producers in the United States that are actively engaged on farms owned or operated by persons participating in the Market Transition Program, so that they will continue to be eligible for payments and will be treated fairly and equitably under the bill. Specifically, the substitute provides that the Secretary shall provide adequate safeguards to protect the interest of operators who are tenants and sharecroppers who farm land that is enrolled in the Market Transition Program. It also provides that the Secretary shall provide for the sharing of contract payments among the owners and operators subject to the contract on a fair and equitable basis. Mr. President, I would appreciate the chairman's assurance that it is the intent of the substitute that all tenants and sharecroppers who are actively engaged in farming regardless of whether the tenant or sharecropper is an operator of the farm will be eligible for payments, assuming that they are producers on a farm with contract acreage that qualifies for participation in the program.
