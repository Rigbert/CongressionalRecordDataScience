Our tobacco exports went up dramatically. They had the largest percentage increase. Art, collectibles, antiques, and precious jewelry and so forth were No. 3. Now, that may put a few people, you know, who have got expensive boutiques and stores in Manhattan and a few places to work and make them happy, but I do not think it is putting very many Americans to work. I do not think it is helping very many average artists or craftsmen.  Could I just get parochial for a moment? Last year the Pacific Northwest's entire delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike, had a lengthy series of discussions with this administration about refinancing the debt of our regional power authority, the Bonneville Power Administration, because we have had and seen political calls by the Reagan administration, the Bush administration, and now this year the Clinton administration to do a punitive refinancing of our debt.  So we said, ``OK, fine, we will go to the private sector and finance, refinance, this debt,'' and we got the entire delegation, Democrats and Republicans, to agree.  The Office of Management and Budget would not let us do it. They said they could not count it as a plus under the budget rules, so we could not do this.  But somehow Mexico wants $40 billion of loan guarantees, and that is OK; we are not worried about the budget rules here anymore, because this is national security, folks. Those little people up in the Northwest, well, gee, sorry, we could not help you out with your refinancing of EPA, but Mexico, $40 billion, no problem.
