Chairman, I had prior proposed legislation which would have required this House to fulfill its constitutional duties for this particular action, and some 30-some odd people saw fit to put their names on that. This amendment simply refers to the funds in this bill and future actions that are not authorized. So this is actually even more limited in its scope, but it does go directly to the obligations and duties of this House under Article I, section 8.
