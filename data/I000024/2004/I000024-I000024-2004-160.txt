President, the Senator from Ohio and I know something about unfunded mandates, as does the Chair. It keeps creeping up, and we are making every effort in the committee that I chair and the subcommittee the Senator from Ohio chairs to try to resolve that problem. I think maybe we will because we have the right people in line to do it. I may not agree with the Senator from Ohio on this particular issue, but I certainly do on unfunded mandates.  I just found out that the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, has filed an amendment that is a slimmed-down version of the Energy bill. I just have to stake out a position early because it is my understanding that the safe harbor language that was in H.R. 6 that is so fair and so necessary is not a part of the slimmed-down version. If it is not in the bill, I am not going to be able to support the bill. I will do everything I can for the Senator from New Mexico, but this is very serious.
