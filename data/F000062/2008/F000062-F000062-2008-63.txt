 President, I rise to introduce The Oil Speculation Control Act, a bill to reduce the impact of excessive speculation in the oil markets.  The legislation is cosponsored by Senator Ted Stevens.  Last week the price of oil hit $138 per barrel. A commodity that used to be priced at $11 a barrel is now swinging $11 in a single day. Yesterday it jumped $5--supposedly in response to a single Department of Energy report.  Gasoline prices now average more than $4.50 in California. Some gas stations have to charge by the half gallon. Their pumps cannot calculate in prices this high.  There seems to be no relief in sight for consumers as we enter the summer travel season.  In the Farm Bill Congress finally closed the ``Enron Loophole,'' and placed all major electronic trades that could drive energy prices under the watchful eye of the Commodity Futures Trading commission, CFTC.  Today I and Senator Levin introduced the Close the London Loophole Act to close another loophole. This bill would bring oversight to American energy commodities being traded beyond our borders.  I also joined Senator Durbin in calling for the President to add 100 I enforcement professionals to the ranks of the CFTC.  However, these steps are not enough.  I believe we must do more to reduce the excessive speculation of institutional investors in oil markets.  So today I am introducing the Oil Speculation Control Act.  Let me explain what this bill would do.  First, it requires CFTC to review the trading practices of institutional investors and their dealers within 30 days:  It ensures that their trading is not adversely impacting the market price.  It determines whether different regulations are necessary:  It proposes to Congress regulations and legislation necessary to prevent the dramatic increase of fuel costs in the futures markets.  Second, the bill establishes reporting requirements. It requires institutional investors, such as pension funds or endowments, to report their energy market positions to the CFTC, even when trades are executed by a third party broker.  To further increase transparency, it would force CFTC regulations and reports to begin distinguishing between the institutional investors and the ``swaps dealers'' or ``index traders'' who broker their trades.  Third, the bill would force CFTC to limit institutional investor and index trader positions, as CFTC limits the positions of more traditional market speculators.  Fourth, it prevents CFTC from considering the positions of institutional investors or their brokers to be ``bone fide hedges'' that would be exempt from speculative position limits.  Finally, it requires that the Office of the CFTC's Inspector General be removed from the CFTC Chairman's Office and established as an independent office.  This bill is necessary because I believe that speculation in oil futures by large institutional investors and index funds is inflating the price of oil.  The unconstrained and overwhelming entrance of these new commodity investors, who have bet more than 99 percent of their funds on prices rising, must be controlled.  Recent testimony before numerous Congressional Committees indicates that between 2000 and 2002, major institutional investors began to view commodity futures markets as a new ``asset class'' suitable to be used in large financial portfolios. Since 2000, investment fund managers have come to believe that investing in commodities balances a stock portfolio.  As Daniel Yergin, one of the Nation's leading energy market experts put it: ``Oil has become the `new gold'--a financial asset in which investors seek refuge as inflation rises and the dollar weakens.''  Never before have so many institutional investors made large scale investments in commodity markets, but from 2003 to 2008, investments in commodity index funds rose from $13 billion to $260 billion.  The implications for consumers of this shift are potentially devastating. Unlike gold, energy and agricultural commodities meet essential needs in the everyday lives of average Americans, and the potential risk that investment strategies will push the price of these goods higher during economic downturns presents a threat to the public welfare. I do not believe this is in the best interest of the American public.  Under the Commodity Exchange Act, the CFTC must impose speculation limits on the size of energy trader positions. Crude oil speculative positions are limited to a total of 20 million barrels of oil and 3 million barrels of oil in the last three days of a contract.  However, it is CFTC's practice to exempt institutional investors from such limits when investors execute their trades through brokers or dealers.  This is a mistake.  They are not hedging against the risk of changing oil prices, as airlines or utilities frequently must do.  They never take delivery of the product.  They participate in the oil markets only on paper.  This bill will assure that the existing speculation limit powers will constrain the market distortion resulting from this massive influx of capital. It will ensure a regulatory system that limits the size and influence of institutional investor positions in energy markets.  Even CFTC has realized that its policy may be mistaken.  Last month it announced that it will review the trading practices for index traders in the futures markets to ensure that this type of trading activity is not adversely impacting the price discovery process. They also plan to determine whether different practices should be employed.  Today's markets evolve quickly, and we need to make sure our market oversight responds just as quickly.  We now know that over the last few years a whole new kind of investor has entered oil markets. Institutional investors only bet that the price will go up. No matter how high the price goes, they pour into the market to push it higher.  We have ways to control this. We have speculation limits. But we are not using them. I am introducing this bill to make sure we use the tools we have.  As the markets continue to evolve, so must our regulation. I believe the Oil Speculation Control Act takes this step, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3131       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
