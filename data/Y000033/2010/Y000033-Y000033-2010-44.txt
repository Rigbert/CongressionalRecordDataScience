I have listened to this debate, and rarely do I come to the floor if it doesn't affect Alaska, but this also affects Alaska. I am one who believes in health reform, but if anyone can tell me from that side of the aisle, with 2,700 pages, and they say the new one is not quite that long, it is 2,000 pages, what is in the bill. They forget to say there are 160 new grant programs that never existed before. There are 110 new agencies, Mr. and Mrs. America, that can issue regulations. There are 13 health czars; we are making them legal under this bill. The big thing, there is about 1,200 pages of gobbledygook. I read one on the floor the other day, but this is page 1,181:  ``(A) In General. Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subtitle, in the case of an affordable credit eligible individual enrolled in an Exchange-participating health benefits plan--  ``(1) the individual shall be eligible for, in accordance with this subtitle, affordability credits consisting of--  ``(A) an affordability premium credit under section 243 to be applied against the premium for the Exchange-participating health benefits plan in which the individual is enrolled; and  ``(B) an affordability cost-sharing credit under section 244 to be applied as a reduction of the cost-sharing otherwise applicable to such plan; and  ``(2) the Commissioner shall pay the QHBP offering entity that offers such plan from the Health Insurance Exchange Trust Fund the aggregate amount of affordability credits for all affordable credit eligible individuals enrolled in such plan.''  Over a thousand pages of gobbledygook. I have an old saying: KISS; keep it simple, stupid. Keep it simple. I can tell you, go through this bill, Mr. and Mrs. America, and read it and tell me what you understand. I happen to have read this bill. I don't understand it. I suggest, respectfully, Mr. and Mrs. America, we should not pass this atrocity.
