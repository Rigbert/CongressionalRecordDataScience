Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 912) to ensure the protection of beneficiaries of United States humanitarian assistance.  The Clerk read as follows:                                H.R. 912       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Humanitarian Assistance Code      of Conduct Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. CODE OF CONDUCT FOR THE PROTECTION OF BENEFICIARIES                    OF HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.       (a) Prohibition.--None of the funds made available for      foreign operations, export financing, and related programs      under the headings ``Migration and Refugee Assistance'',      ``United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance      Fund'', ``International Disaster and Famine Assistance'', or      ``Transition Initiatives'' may be obligated to an      organization that fails to adopt a code of conduct that      provides for the protection of beneficiaries of assistance      under any such heading from sexual exploitation and abuse in      humanitarian relief operations.       (b) Six Core Principles.--The code of conduct referred to      in subsection (a) shall, to the maximum extent practicable,      be consistent with the following six core principles of the      United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee Task Force on      Protection From Sexual Exploitation and Abuse in Humanitarian      Crises:       (1) ``Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers      constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds      for termination of employment.''.       (2) ``Sexual activity with children (persons under the age      of 18) is prohibited regardless of the age of majority or age      of consent locally. Mistaken belief regarding the age of a      child is not a defense.''.       (3) ``Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for      sex, including sexual favors or other forms of humiliating,      degrading or exploitative behavior, is prohibited. This      includes exchange of assistance that is due to      beneficiaries.''.       (4) ``Sexual relationships between humanitarian workers and      beneficiaries are strongly discouraged since they are based      on inherently unequal power dynamics. Such relationships      undermine the credibility and integrity of humanitarian aid      work.''.       (5) ``Where a humanitarian worker develops concerns or      suspicions regarding sexual abuse or exploitation by a fellow      worker, whether in the same agency or not, he or she must      report such concerns via established agency reporting      mechanisms.''.       (6) ``Humanitarian agencies are obliged to create and      maintain an environment which prevents sexual exploitation      and abuse and promotes the implementation of their code of      conduct. Managers at all levels have particular      responsibilities to support and develop systems which      maintain this environment.''.     SEC. 3. REPORT.       Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, and not later than one year after the date of the      enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the      Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on      International Relations of the House of Representatives and      the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign      Relations of the Senate a detailed report on the      implementation of this Act.     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY.       This Act--       (1) takes effect 60 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act; and       (2) applies to funds obligated after the effective date      referred to in paragraph (1)--       (A) for fiscal year 2005; and       (B) any subsequent fiscal year.
