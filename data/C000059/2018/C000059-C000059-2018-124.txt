Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my good friend Herbert ``Herb'' Spiegel, who passed away in California on Sunday, December 2, 2018. Herb, a devoted family man, served his nation in World War II, and volunteered with many organizations in his community. He will be deeply missed.  Herb and his family escaped war-torn Germany in May of 1939, immigrating to the United States and settling in New York. He served in the U.S. Navy as a Seabee in Kodiak, Alaska during World War II, and was honorably discharged in 1946. He met Flora Hirsch on a New Year's weekend in 1950 and had a whirlwind courtship, proposing on their first date. After she said yes on the second date, they were married on May 23, 1951. They returned to Kodiak as he continued to work as a civilian electrician with the Navy.  The Spiegels would eventually relocate to Corona, California, where they would raise a family and become active members of the community. Herb founded Corona Industrial Electric, Inc. and has been an active member of the National Electrical Contractors Association. Herb retired in 1994, after receiving numerous awards and recognitions in the electrical contracting industry, and became actively immersed in the local community. Herb had remained active with the Corona Chamber of Commerce; Corona Host Lions; Corona Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks; a member of the Masonic Lodge as a Master Mason, and Shriner; Navy League and an active member and founder of Congregation Beth Shalom of Corona. I have seen firsthand how Herb's tireless passion for his family, community service and giving back has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona. Additionally, Herb was a co-founder and creator of a holocaust education forum to share and preserve the story of his life and other holocaust survivors with young adults in Southern California.  Herb is survived by three sons: Sam, Bobby, and Marc; seven grandchildren: Tanya, Rebecca, Rachel, Isaac, Josh, Jacob and Aaron; great grandson RJ, and many nieces and nephews from around the globe. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Spiegel family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Herb. Although Herb may be gone, the many contributions he made to his country, community and family will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
