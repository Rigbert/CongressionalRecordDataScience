 President, I commend the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, for his amendment, which is strikingly similar in concept--as he and I discussed off the floor earlier--to the Auto Choice proposal I have introduced each of the last two Congresses, cosponsored by Senator Moynihan and Senator Lieberman.   Essentially what is envisioned in these kinds of choice proposals is giving the consumer the option of opting out of the litigation lottery in return for a lower premium and lower cost.  I want to ask the Senator from Arizona if it is his view that this is similar in concept to the Auto Choice measure that I just described that we have discussed off the floor.
