However, Madam Speaker, today I cannot vote for this bill unless the motion to recommit passes because of my concern about what is going to happen with these prisoners at Guantanamo.  So I would suggest to all the Members this is a very serious concern to our country. It's a very serious concern to this fight on terrorism throughout the world. And I believe that we should show our unity and vote for the motion to recommit. And if that motion to recommit passes, then I will be happy to vote for this bill, which I think for the most part is a good bill with that exception.
