 As the majority leader knows, after today we will have 8 legislative days left before the CR runs out on April 28. We will be gone, as the gentleman knows, for 2 weeks, or a few more days than that, for the Easter break. We have not enacted any appropriation bills except for the MILCON-VA and the Defense Appropriation bill we passed through this House in a bipartisan vote and that is pending in the Senate.                              {time}  1045  Given the limited number of days in session before April 28, we are going to require relatively quick action if we are to fund the government for the balance of the year past April 28.  Mr. Leader, can you tell me--because no appropriation bill or CR or omnibus was on the schedule for next week, can the gentleman tell me when he expects some form of continuing to authorize expenditures for the balance of the year between now and September 30 will occur?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Discussions are ongoing about the appropriations process and how to ensure the government is funded after April 28.  I thank my good friend from Maryland for being a good faith negotiating partner in this effort.  I do not currently anticipate floor action next week. But as always, I will advise Members as soon as possible when action is scheduled in the House.
