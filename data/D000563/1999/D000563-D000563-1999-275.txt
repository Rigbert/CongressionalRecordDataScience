If the royalty is based on the price of oil, there is a possibility that the royalty payments might go down if it is recalculated; there is a possibility that it might stay the same, or it might go up.  But I take it from this amendment that the oil companies that are pushing this amendment are so certain that their payments to the Federal Government are going to go up that they want to stop the Federal Government from recalculating the royalties.  The net impact of this, and the Senator from California can correct me, is that the oil companies are being protected from paying their fair share of rent or royalties for using public lands, and the taxpayers, because of this amendment, are the losers. We are the ones who do not get the royalties back from those who want to drill all the oil out of land that we own and not pay the taxpayers of this country for the right to do so.
