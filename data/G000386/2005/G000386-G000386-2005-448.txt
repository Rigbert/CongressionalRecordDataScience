 President, we will resume the Roberts nomination tomorrow for a short period of debate. The debate from 10:30 to 11:30 has previously been allocated to the two managers and the two leaders. At 11:30 tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. I remind all Senators that the majority leader has asked all Senators to be in the Chamber by 11:20 and seated at their desks for this historic vote.  Following that vote, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the Defense appropriations bill. Additional votes will occur on Thursday and Friday this week.                          ____________________[Page S10624]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM
