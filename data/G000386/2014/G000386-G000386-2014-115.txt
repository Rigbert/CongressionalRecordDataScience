 Only two have been disapproved. That is more than 99 percent.  As far as the second term of this administration is concerned, I want to say that after the Senate confirms the three district court judges we will approve today, we will have confirmed 50 of President Obama's judicial nominees during his second term. Up to this point in President Bush's second term, the Senate had confirmed only 21. So that is 50 to 21 as far as the production of this Congress for approving judges.  I yield the floor.
