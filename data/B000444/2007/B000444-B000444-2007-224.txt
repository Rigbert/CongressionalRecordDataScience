 Hagel, Mr. Levin, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                             S. Con. Res. 2       Whereas the United States strategy and presence on the      ground in Iraq can only be sustained with the support of the      American people and bipartisan support from Congress;       Whereas maximizing chances of success in Iraq should be our      goal, and the best chance     of success requires a change in current strategy;       Whereas the situation in Iraq is damaging the standing,      influence, and interests of the United States in Iraq, the      Middle East, and around the world;       Whereas more than 137,000 United States military personnel      are bravely and honorably serving in Iraq and deserve the      support of all Americans;       Whereas more than 3,000 United States military personnel      have already lost their lives in Iraq, and more than 22,500      have been wounded in Iraq;       Whereas on January 10, 2007, President George W. Bush      announced his plan to deepen the United States military      involvement in Iraq by deploying approximately 21,000      additional United States combat forces to Iraq;       Whereas Iraq is witnessing widening sectarian and intra-     sectarian violence;       Whereas Iraqis must reach a political settlement if there      is going to be a reconciliation in Iraq, and the failure of      the Iraqis to achieve such a settlement has led to the      increase in violence in Iraq;       Whereas Iraq Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated on      November 27, 2006, that ``[t]he crisis is political, and the      ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting      of innocents are the politicians.'';       Whereas an open-ended commitment of United States forces in      Iraq is unsustainable and a deterrent to the Iraqis making      the political compromises and providing the personnel and      resources that are needed for violence to end and for      stability and security to be achieved in Iraq;       Whereas the responsibility for internal security and      halting sectarian violence in Iraq must rest primarily with      the Government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces;       Whereas there have been repeated promises by the Government      of Iraq to assume a greater share of security      responsibilities, disband militias, consider amendments to      the Iraq constitution, enact laws to reconcile sectarian      differences, and improve the quality of life for the Iraqi      people, but those promises have not been kept;       Whereas a successful strategy in Iraq is dependent upon the      Iraqi leaders fulfilling their promises;       Whereas the commander of the United States Central Command,      General John Abizaid, testified to Congress on November 15,      2006, that ``[i]t's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do      this work. I believe that more American forces prevent the      Iraqis from taking more responsibility for their own      future'';       Whereas the Iraq Study Group suggested a comprehensive      strategy to ``enable the United States to begin to move its      combat forces out of Iraq responsibly'' based on ``new and      enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the      region'';       Whereas the United States Army and Marine Corps, including      their Reserves and the Army National Guard, their personnel,      and their families, are under enormous strain from multiple,      extended deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan;       Whereas the majority of nondeployed Army and Marine Corps      units are no longer combat ready due to a lack of equipment      and insufficient time to train; and       Whereas the United States strategy in Iraq must not      compromise the ability of the United States to address other      vital national security priorities, in particular global      terror networks, proliferation of weapons of mass      destruction, regional stability in the Middle East, the      nuclear program of Iran, the nuclear weapons of North Korea,      and stability and security in Afghanistan: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) it is not in the national interest of the United States      to deepen its military involvement in Iraq, particularly by      escalating the United States military force presence in Iraq;       (2) the primary objective of United States strategy in Iraq      should be to have the Iraqi political leaders make the      political compromises necessary to end the violence in Iraq;       (3) greater concerted regional, and international support      would assist the Iraqis in achieving a political solution and      national reconciliation;       (4) main elements of the mission of United States forces in      Iraq should transition to helping ensure the territorial      integrity of Iraq, conduct counterterrorism activities,      reduce regional interference in the internal affairs of Iraq,      and accelerate training of Iraqi troops;       (5) the United States should transfer, under an      appropriately expedited timeline, responsibility for internal      security and halting sectarian violence in Iraq to the      Government of Iraq and Iraqi security forces; and       (6) the United States should engage nations in the Middle      East to develop a regional, internationally-sponsored peace      and reconciliation process for Iraq.
