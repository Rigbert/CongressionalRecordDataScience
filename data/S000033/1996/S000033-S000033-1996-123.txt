 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, more women in the United States are injured and killed through domestic violence than by automobile accidents, muggings, and rapes by strangers combined. Domestic violence is a terrible plague in American society.  Given that reality, it is an absolute outrage that a number of insurance companies deny health insurance to women who have been battered and who have been victims of domestic violence. These insurance companies argue that domestic violence is a preexisting condition and that it might not be profitable for them to insure these women. Under these conditions women are being abused twice, first by their batterers and, secondly, by the insurance companies who refuse to insure them and their families.  Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that both the Republican and Democratic health care bills before us tonight include an amendment which I offered which would once and for all put an end to this outrage. Women who are battered are entitled to health insurance just like anyone else.
