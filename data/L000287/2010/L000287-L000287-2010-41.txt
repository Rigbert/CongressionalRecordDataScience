Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is April 15, the day Americans will file their income tax returns. The IRS will receive nearly 150 million tax returns this year and issue over 100 million refunds. We know that taxpayers do not enjoy preparing tax returns. The tax laws can be complicated and difficult. We do, however, thank them for complying with the laws; and today, with this bill, we will try to ease some of the burden.  On this day, the House is considering the Taxpayer Assistance Act of 2010. I am pleased that this bill contains proposals supported by the administration, the National Taxpayer Advocate, and Members of the House from both sides of the aisle.  This bill has over a dozen provisions that will help taxpayers. It will help taxpayers who are struggling in this economy by making it easy to enter into payment options with the IRS. It will also help low-income taxpayers by improving the IRS services that are available to them, and it will help small businesses and nonprofit organizations by relaxing the record-keeping requirements for cell phones that they provide to their employees.  This bill addresses issues that have been raised in hearings of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, which I chair, and in legislation introduced by other Members of the House.  Many of the provisions in this bill enjoy broad bipartisan support. Today, in recognition of taxpayers, the Congress will look beyond what divides us and respond to the needs of our taxpayers. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing this good and necessary piece of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
