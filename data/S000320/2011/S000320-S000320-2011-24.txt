 President, I rise to honor a distinguished colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski, who is celebrating a major milestone--today becoming the longest serving female in Senate history.  Elected to the House in 1976 and the Senate in 1986, Senator Mikulski is the first woman to win statewide office in Maryland, the first female Democrat to serve in both the House and the Senate, and the first female Democrat elected to the Senate in her own right.  As one of the most effective Senators, Senator Mikulski used her experience as a social worker and activist to ardently work on behalf of her constituents giving them a strong voice in the U.S. Senate. A leader in the Senate she has successfully fought for a variety of issues ranging from women's rights to protecting our law enforcement.  Throughout our 8 years of serving together in the House and 24 years in the Senate, Senator Mikulski and I have worked on many issues together. We have a strong bipartisan relationship that is reflected in the numerous accomplishments we have achieved working together as the chair and ranking member on the CJS appropriations subcommittee. I have always appreciated Senator Mikulski's candor, sense of humor, and willingness to cross party lines to work in the best interest of our Nation.  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Mikulski on reaching this historic milestone today. I am honored to call Senator Barbara Mikulski my colleague but prouder to call her my friend.
