 President, I rise to congratulate Miss Jessica K. Vaughan of Bowling Green, KY. Miss Vaughan was recently selected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States to receive the Patriot's Pen scholarship award. This scholarship program is a youth essay contest that gives middle school students from across the Nation the opportunity to articulate their views on democracy.  Miss Vaughan, an eighth grade student, was selected to receive this award based on her essay entitled ``Does Patriotism Still Matter?'' I wish to congratulate Miss Vaughan on her hard work, perseverance and dedication.                          ____________________
