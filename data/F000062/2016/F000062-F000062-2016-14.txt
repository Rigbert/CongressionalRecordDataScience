 President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution to honor the great Vin Scully--a magnificent baseball announcer for the Los Angeles Dodgers for the past 67 Major League Baseball seasons.  Days ago, Scully announced his final game at Dodger Stadium.  It was a game won by the Dodgers on a walk-off homerun, in dramatic fashion, to clinch the division.  It was a fitting end to Scully's storied career calling baseball games in Los Angeles. When the homerun was hit, he exclaimed, ``Would you believe a homerun? And the Dodgers have clinched the division, and will celebrate on schedule.''  Seconds later, in true Scully-form, he remained silent, letting the roar of Dodgers fans take over the microphone.  Scully's storytelling over the microphone has captured the imagination of not just those who have grown up in Southern California, but all over America.  In fact, so many Americans recall watching Game 1 of the 1988 World Series when Kirk Gibson famously hit a walk-off homerun against Dennis Eckersley.  After Scully called the homerun shot, he paused to proclaim, ``In a year that has been so improbable, the impossible has happened.''  The call was a harbinger of things to come, because the Dodgers went on to win the series against a heavily favored Oakland Athletics team.  Scully first fell in love with baseball and broadcasting as an 8 year old boy growing up in New York in 1936.  He recounted this beginning in a deeply personal letter he wrote to fans recently, stating, ``God has been very generous to that little boy, allowing him to fulfill a dream of becoming a broadcaster and to live it for 67 years . . . You were simply always there for me. I have always felt that I needed you more than you needed me and that holds true this very day.''  We too are immensely fortunate to have witnessed Scully's life-long devotion to the game of baseball.  Scully has announced more than 9,000 Major League Baseball games, and almost half of all of the Dodger games ever played.  He is credited with teaching the game of baseball to Los Angeles.  He vividly brought to life the feats of all-time Dodgers greats such as Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Sandy Koufax, Don Drysdale, Duke Snider, Don Sutton, Fernando Valenzuela, Orel Hershiser, Tommy Lasorda, Mike Piazza, and Clayton Kershaw.  This is why his voice evokes so many memories for so many people.  But even beyond his artistic accomplishments, Vin Scully is about as fine a person as you will meet. Those who know him closely remark of his character and humility. They speak of his desire simply to be a decent man, a good husband, father, and grandfather.  This humility and grace was reflected in his broadcast style. He was never one to rush, and did all he could to enhance the game he loved. Often times, he let the roar of the crowd speak for itself.  I want to thank Senator Boxer for cosponsoring the resolution to honor Scully, as he takes his final curtain call from the broadcast booth next week.  I also want to express my thanks to House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra for leading the House effort on this resolution.                          ____________________
