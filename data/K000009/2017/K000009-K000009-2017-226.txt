You are such a rare and talented Member. I thank the people of California for sending you here. You serve them every day of the week, 7 days a week--24/7. It is a privilege to appear with you tonight and also with Congressman Paul Tonko, one of our most talented Members from upstate New York--a region like my own that has just been battered by the global economy and the outsourcing of jobs. We all are just honored to serve in this Congress, and we respect it and its history and its potential.  Mr. Speaker, as I travel my own district and State, I am finding I have to reassure people. Anytime there is a change, I guess, in public life, people need to be bolstered that everything is going to be okay. We are here to be that squad and to say to the American people that they have power, too, and that it isn't just the super rich of this country or the billionaire class.  We can label them ``wealth power.'' And that has power; yes, it does. Sometimes extraordinary power. But there is also ``people power.'' I consider myself having been lifted here by people power over many years, and I appreciate the people of my region for allowing me to serve our country and to learn every day, to learn from them, to learn how to make the instruments of the Nation work better for them.  There is also ``spiritual power.'' I am amazed at how people's spiritual groundings help them through difficult situations and transitions.  Then there is ``intellectual power.'' We hope to use some of that here once in a while. That is a power in and of itself. We think about the power of liberty of a free people to improve their Nation, to heal their Nation, to expand opportunity in their Nation.  We are aided and abetted by a very curious media--sometimes more ridiculous than it needs to be--but also of people digging, trying to find that elusive truth that should lead us all forward. So we find ourselves helping to heal our Nation by being Members here, and we all hope for the best for our people and for our country. I think the Members here are very well motivated.  I rise to defend, really, and to support two foundational programs of our society: Social Security and Medicare. I will try to be brief so others can comment.  I am very proud to say that our family is one of those families who would have been completely destroyed had it not been for Social Security and Medicare. Those didn't exist when my parents were born and grandparents wereliving in our country. But in 1935, after our country crashed economically and there were major bank failures and the stock market crashed and wiped out the savings of millions of Americans, the Nation turned to the Federal Government, to the President, to guarantee for a large segment of our society--senior citizens--decent incomes.  The Social Security Insurance Act was enacted at the urging of Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He was regarded as a saint in our household because what happened around our country was that seniors before that time--many of them--were living in what we called poorhouses. They were dying in terrible circumstances, and there was no security as a person aged.  Can you imagine how revolutionary it was at that time to create a social insurance program--probably the largest insurance program America has ever had--to ensure that as people aged or if workers became disabled in the workplace or if they died that their children would have sources of income?  The program did all of that. In thinking back, gosh, over 70 years, how transformational was that?  As for our grandpa, who died in a county hospital in Ohio before the enactment of Medicare, I know the conditions that he died under. And I know that, when our mother died, it was a different situation. She had Social Security and Medicare, and we were able to take care of her. The same was true with our father.  Intergenerationally, I see our country getting better. I am proud of that. I am also proud to be a Democrat and a member of a party that has created Social Security, which has become an indispensable part of our way of life. As I have said to seniors and to workers, it is an earned benefit. People pay for it every time their paychecks are nicked, and their employers match it.  Obviously, to survivors--and, obviously, I have neighbors who have lost spouses, whose children then benefit from the survivor benefit--what an incredible gift this idea is to the American people. There are 35 million people today in our country who depend on Social Security--one out of every six Americans. Every day, Social Security lifts 20 million people out of poverty--people who used to live in poverty.  Can you imagine what that was like?  We don't ever, ever want to go back to that world.  In 2014, the latest data show us that more than 6 million children under the age of 18 live in families who receive income from Social Security, lifting more than a million children out of poverty. Social Security has never been a welfare program. It is an earned benefit, and all Americans who contribute to it during their working lifetimes receive benefits. Social Security is a compact of trust between generations. It is the ever-present sentry at the economic security gate for retirees, for those hurt on the job, or for their survivors, and it is America's greatest insurance program ever.  I happened to be living when Lyndon Johnson helped to create the Medicare program, which provides health insurance coverage now to over 55 million people in our country--essential health security for seniors. Today, only 2 percent of the elderly in our country lack health insurance compared to 48 percent--half the people of this country--in 1962, after World War II, before Medicare even existed. That seems sort of modern times, the 1960s; yet it really was not. I would say that that is a ``wow'' by any measure.  Yes, people are living longer. Thank God the program is working. People are getting free preventative healthcare screenings and are lowering the long-term costs of care because of early diagnosis. Seniors don't have to pay for mammograms or diabetes or cancer screenings, thanks to the Affordable Care Act; so we keep trying to make the system better.  Since House Republicans won the majority in 2011, every House Republican budget has tried to end the Medicare guarantee and turn Medicare into a privatized voucher program.  Do you know what that is going to do?  It is going to shut out millions of Americans who are elderly--or who are about to be elderly--from insurance. The reason we have Medicare is that insurers weren't insuring seniors--that is the reason it exists in the first place--or they will make the price so high that people won't be able to pay for it; or they will cherry-pick only the healthy people. Then those who have diabetes, those who have had prior cancers, those who have multiple sclerosis, those who have Parkinson's will be cast aside.  What kind of a country would this be, for heaven's sake?  The American Association of Retired Persons and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare completely opposed the Republicans' plan to voucherize and let every senior go out there in the market and try to find a plan of his own, because they know what that means. These two programs are the most pro-life programs this Nation has ever created. We should be so proud of what we have been able to do as a country over the last century.  The Republican attacks on Social Security and Medicare need to stop. They are America's bulwark for millions and millions of people, and they have proven themselves to be America's most important, lifetime security programs.  I thank Congressman Garamendi and Congressman Tonko for being down here tonight. I know how passionately you care about the people of our country way beyond just your districts and why we are here. We are here to stand with them.
