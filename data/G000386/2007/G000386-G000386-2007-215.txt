 President, I have 3 minutes left, I have been told. First of all, I think the Senator from Massachusetts was doing a good job reading from a letter Secretary Chertoff sent to me. I sent back a rebuttal letter, and I would like to provide the letter for the Senator from Massachusetts to read. It is a point-by-point rebuttal of what is wrong with Secretary Chertoff's analysis of my amendment.  One of the criticisms that Senator Kyl gave against my amendment is we are not going to force employers to look through 160 million workers to find illegal workers. Let's look at the basic legislation. The legislation legalizes people who are here already illegally. So if they are illegally working, and this bill legalizes them, don't you see how ridiculous it is that we are going to tell people to go out and find people who are here illegally when the bill has already legalized them?  The second point is that we eliminate the requirement of a photograph for identification. My amendment requires every U.S. citizen to present a passport or driver's license and every noncitizen to present a legal permanent resident card or work authorization card. Each of these documents is required to contain an individual's photograph.  Moreover, my amendment requires workers to submit their passport number, driver's license number, or employment authorization number in addition to their Social Security number through the employment verification system. Without that information, there is no guarantee that Homeland Security will be able to contact the issuing agencies or determine which document was issued. This is the very same problem that has prevented Homeland Security from utilizing Social Security Administration data in the past.  My amendment further requires the Social Security Administration, the State Department, and the State departments of motor vehicles to establish a reliable and secure method to allow the Department of Homeland Security to verify the identity document of each issuing agency.  On another point Senator Kyl made saying it eliminates after 5 years the information sharing among Government departments, which is critical to making this work, a sunset is standard practice when we compromise the protection for the individual taxpayer, that the taxpayer's income tax information will be private so that, like President Johnson and President Nixon, it cannot be used to violate your privacy for political reasons. That is why that law was passed.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several letters regarding this issue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2007.     Hon. Michael Chertoff,     U.S. Department of Homeland Security,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are again disappointed that you have      written another erroneous and misleading letter regarding our      amendment to Title III of the immigration bill. However, we      appreciate the opportunity to explain why our amendment      provides a more cost effective and administratively feasible      employment verification system.       (1) Your letter states that ``employers have no independent      obligation to resolve no-match problems . . . (DHS) could      only ask employers to resolve no-match problems.'' This      statement reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of our      amendment. Our amendment establishes criteria to determine      mandatory participation in the employment verification system      with respect to current workers. Current workers identified      by DHS would be verified through the employment verification      system in exactly the same manner as newly hired workers.       The purpose of an employment verification system is to      prevent unauthorized workers from using fraudulent Social      Security numbers (SSN) or misusing legitimate SSNs to obtain      employment in the United States. This goal is accomplished by      comparing the name and SSN submitted by the worker to the      records maintained by the Social Security Administration.      Regardless of whether     this comparison occurs when a worker is hired, or when a      worker's W-2 is processed, the result is the same.       Our amendment requires every employer to verify every newly      hired worker through the employment verification system.      According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, more than 60      million workers would be verified each year through this      process. In addition, under current tax law, every employer      must submit an annual W-2 for every worker. According to      Social Security Administration data, more than 160 million      workers will be verified each year through this process.       Requiring every employer to verify every worker through the      employment verification system would merely duplicate the      results of verifying every worker through the W-2 process. If      the names and SSNs match in one case, there is no reason to      believe they won't match in the other case. In order to avoid      needless duplication, our amendment allows DHS to obtain data      through the W-2 process and thereby identify every worker      using a fraudulent SSN, or misusing a legitimate SSN. The      employers of these workers would be required to utilize      the employment verification system to verify each of these      workers.       (2) Your letter states that under the version of Title III      supported by DHS ``we will be relying on electronic      verification . . . [to prevent] . . . illegal employment.      Your amendment does not require equivalent security      measures.'' This statement reflects a fundamental      misunderstanding of our amendment. Our amendment requires      workers to submit their Passport number, driver's license      number, or employment authorization number (as applicable      based on citizenship status) in addition to their Social      Security number through the employment verification system.      It further requires SSA, the State Department, and state DMV      agencies to establish a reliable and secure method to allow      DHS to verify the identity documents issued by each agency.      Thus, DHS will be able to determine when identity documents      are fraudulent or when more than one person is using the same      legitimate document.       Our amendment differs from the approach envisioned in the      version of Title III being supported by DHS. The approach      being advocated by DHS would require employers to verify the      photo on every identity document presented by every employee      at the time of hiring. This represents an unnecessary and      overly burdensome requirement for workers and employers. Our      amendment would allow DHS to generate a tentative      nonconfirmation whenever the identification number does not      match agency records, or when the same number appears      multiple times. In such cases, the employee would be required      to resolve the tentative non-confirmation with the issuing      agency.       (3) Your letter states ``The need for no-match information      . . . will not disappear in five years.'' Our amendment      provides DHS with the ability to independently verify SSNs,      state driver's license numbers, and U.S. Passport numbers.      There is no reason to believe continued access to SSA no-     match data will be necessary once DHS has fully implemented      the employment verification system. However, should continued      access be needed, we would fully support an extension of the      5-year limitation, provided DHS meets its obligation to      protect and properly use this confidential taxpayer data.       (4) Your letter states that we ``. . . misunderstand the      current bill . . .'' There is no misunderstanding on our      part. The current version of Title III supported by DHS      states ``An employer may not terminate an individual's      employment solely because that individual has been issued a      further action notice . . . [ or] . . . reduce salary,      bonuses, or other compensation . . .'' The comments in our      previous letter referred to individuals who are issued a      ``final nonconfirmation,'' not a further action notice.      Moreover, your letter states ``. . . the current bill allows      workers to earn a living while they appeal what they believe      to be erroneous eligibility determinations.'' This statement      is true only with respect to a further action notice. The      current version of Title III supported by DHS does not      require employers to pay workers who appeal a final      nonconfirmation. In contrast, our amendment protects workers      throughout the entire appeals process.       (5) Your letter states we oppose the requirement that      employers resolve no match letters ``. . . because the      letters are not sent to every single employer.'' That is not      correct. We oppose the no-match requirement because it is      ineffective and unenforceable. DHS would have no knowledge of      who received a no-match letter. Moreover, employers could      continue to rely on the current flawed I-9 process to      ``resolve'' their no-match letters. Our amendment would allow      DHS to readily identify every single employer with a no-     match, and target those with the biggest problem for worksite      enforcement or accelerated participation in the employment      verification system.       Thank you for providing us with the opportunity to explain      our amendment. We stand ready to work with you to create a      more effective and feasible verification system.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley.     Max Baucus.     Barack Obama.                                  ____                              Department of Homeland Security,                                    Washington, DC, June 21, 2007.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I received your June 20, 2007 letter      regarding my concerns that your amendment to the immigration      reform legislation represents a serious step backward in our      worksite enforcement effort. I must respectfully disagree      with your statement that your amendment ``would improve Title      III.'' On the contrary, reading your response to my letter      underscores my initial concerns, for the following reasons:       (1) Your letter acknowledges that under the Grassley-     Baucus-Obama amendment, employers need not use the Electronic      Employment Verification System (EEVS) to find out whether      their existing employees are working legally except ``when      there is evidence to suspect unlawful employment.'' Under      your amendment, employers have no independent obligation to      resolve no match problems, and the Department of Homeland      Security (DHS) could only ask employers to resolve no-match      problems if DHS already had enough information to begin an      investigation. But if DHS has enough information to begin an      investigation, it should not ask employers for their help,      The value of verification is that it generates evidence of      unlawful behavior. It is odd to say that DHS must have      evidence of potential wrongdoing before utilizing the best      means of uncovering this wrongdoing in the first place.       DHS has no intention of asking employers to act as police.      The EEVS is a convenient nondiscriminatory but powerful tool      that will bring violations to DHS's attention without      imposing heavy burdens on employers. We should not impose      arbitrary limits on its use.       (2) As you observe, the current bill requires that only      secure licenses and identification cards be accepted after      2013. In the meantime, we will be relying on electronic      verification as the principal means of identifying identity      fraud and preventing illegal employment. Your amendment does      not require equivalent security measures. In view of the      widespread industry specializing in production of fake      documents, I believe that your amendment keeps us and      innocent employers vulnerable to such documents and weakens      the protections against identity theft.       (3) We all agree that DHS should have access to the ``no-     match'' information that both the current bill and your      amendment allow. Our difference arises from the fact that the      Grassley-Baucus-Obama amendment arbitrarily cuts off that      access after five years. As you will recall, our recent      enforcement efforts have shown that fake IDs and made-up      Social Security numbers are rampant in many industries. The      need for ``no-match'' information to combat such fraud win      not disappear in five years.       We should not exempt employers from enforcement of      immigration laws because we fear that they may refuse to      comply with tax law. I am confident that the vast majority of      employers want to follow the law. Indeed, our enforcement      system rests on the expectation that individuals--employers      and employees alike--will obey the law. For those few who may      flout the law, however, the tight response is more      enforcement, not less.       (4) I believe your letter misunderstands the current bill      in one important respect. The current Title III would not      allow employers to cut off pay to workers who seek      administrative review of their further action notices. In      fact, Title III expressly prohibits businesses from doing so,      or from taking other adverse actions against an employee who      received such a notice.       I am pleased to correct this misunderstanding.       I am also surprised that you appear to prefer a system      requiring that a worker who receives a nonconfirmation notice      be fired first, and that he pursue his administrative and      judicial appeal while unemployed, with the distant prospect      of getting back lost wages. By contrast, the current bill      allows workers to earn a living while they appeal what they      believe to be erroneous eligibility determinations.       (5) We agree that the Grassley-Baucus-Obama amendment does      not require employers to act on the no-match notices they      receive. You argue that the law should not require employers      to resolve no-match letters because the letters are not sent      to every single employer. But the letters are sent to the      employers with the biggest no-match problems. And your      alternative proposed solution is far less effective. Your      amendment proposes that all of the no-match data be sent to      DHS, which would then have to repeat everything that the      Social Security Administration has already done to locate and      send notices to employers whose employees may be violating      the law.       In sum, I committed to inform the bill managers if I became      concerned about an amendment that would threaten the      enforceability and/or workability of the underlying bill A      good enforcement program benefits the vast majority of law      abiding employers by ensuring that they are not competitively      disadvantaged by the unscrupulous few. Unfortunately, I      continue to believe that your amendment will perpetuate the      kinds of obstacles that have burdened effective enforcement      of immigration law at the worksite since 1986.       I appreciate your genuine concern about this matter and      please know that I am always glad to meet and discuss these      concerns.           Sincerely,                                                 Michael Chertoff.                                       ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Michael Chertoff,     Department of Homeland Security,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: We are extremely disappointed that your      June 19th letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter contained a      number of erroneous and misleading allegations regarding our      amendment to Title III.       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:       ``(1) Job Security for Criminal Aliens . . . existing      workers are never checked out . . .''       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:       The pending immigration bill requires all employers to run      all existing workers through the verification system within      three years. This is an onerous and unnecessary requirement      given the fact that these workers are already subject to the      annual wage reporting (no-match) process. Our amendment would      require employers to run existing workers through the system      only when there is evidence to suspect unlawful employment.      To accomplish this goal, DHS would be given access to Social      Security and IRS data to identify all mismatched, duplicate,      deceased, minor children, or non-work SSNs.       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:       ``(2) Loophole for Fake Documents . . . present any      driver's license . . . not required to . . . provide a second      document . . . eliminate grant program . . .''       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:       The pending immigration bill says state driver's licenses      and ID cards that are not REAL ID compliant will no longer be      accepted beginning in 2013. The language also gives the      Secretary of DHS the authority to modify state driver's      licenses and ID cards prior to the implementation of REAL ID.      Finally, it authorizes--but does not fund--grants to States      for REAL ID. Congress can only fund REAL ID though the      appropriations process. Our amendment avoids imposing an      arbitrary deadline and allows the continued use of state      driver's licenses and ID cards (subject to new verification      procedures with the state DMVs) in recognition of the fact      that final implementation of REAL ID remains in doubt.       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:       ``(3) Arbitrary End to Information Sharing . . . cuts off      all information sharing after five years . . .''       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:       The pending immigration bill provides DHS with access to      Social Security and IRS data. Our amendment would sunset      these provisions after five years, subject to a future      extension, as is standard practice when allowing access to      private taxpayer data for the first time for a new purpose.      Moreover, the long-term value of SSA and IRS data for      immigration enforcement is highly suspect. Once employers      realize their W-2s will be used against them, they may simply      stop filing suspect W-2s.       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:       ``(4) Punishing the Enforcers Instead of the Violators . .      . individuals . . . can seek compensation . . . even if the      initial error was caused by the individual and not the      government . . . ''       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:       The pending immigration bill prohibits employers from      firing workers for as long as DHS wants to review a worker's      appeal of a final nonconfirmation notice. This would force      employers to keep workers on their books, but allow them not      to be paid, while the government attempts to find and correct      the mistakes in its databases. This will put legal workers in      a financial bind while providing no incentive for DHS to      improve the system. Under our amendment, illegal workers who      receive a final nonconfirmation notice would be immediately      fired. But, legal workers who are erroneously fired could      recover lost wages, if they did not cause the error, and the      government was at fault.       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:       ``(5) Ignoring the Government's Best Evidence of Illegal      Workers . . . Grassley-Baucus-Obama . . . would not . . .      require employers to resolve no-match letters''       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:       The pending immigration bill requires employers to retain      SSA no-match letters and document steps taken to resolve      them. But, SSA sends no-match letters only when there are      more than 10 employees whose names and numbers do not      match, and the total number of no-matches exceeds 0.5      percent of total employees. Thus, an employer with 11 no-     matches and 2,199 employees would get a letter, but an      employer with 11 no-matches and 2,200 employees would not.      No-match letters are completely at the discretion of SSA.      SSA does not inform DSH which employers receive a no-match      letter. Under our amendment, DHS is granted access to all      no-match data. They can use this data to identify      employers for worksite enforcement or to require early      participation in the verification system with respect to      new or existing employees.       Letter to Senators Kennedy and Specter:       ``(6) No Improvement to IRS Authority... Grassley-Baucus-     Obama drops all of these important provisions ...''       Grassley/Baucus/Obama Amendment:       The pending immigration bill would increase IRS penalties      for filing incorrect information returns and authorizes--but      does not fund--additional IRS personnel to investigate      incorrect returns. This is a poorly concealed effort to      recruit IRS personnel to do the job DHS is supposed to do:      enforce our immigration laws.       We strongly support creating an effective, mandatory      employment verification system for all employers to verify      the legal status of their workers. But the design,      implementation, and oversight of the system as proposed in      the pending immigration bill are flawed in several respects.       Our amendment would improve Title III by (1) protecting      U.S. citizens and legal workers from errors in the system;      (2) protecting the states from excessive federal intrusion;      (3) protecting the rights of all legal workers; (4)      protecting the privacy of all Americans; and (5) improving      our ability to prevent unauthorized employment while      minimizing the burden on workers and employers.       We hope that your future correspondence to the Hill will      acknowledge these much needed improvements and avoid the      erroneous and misleading allegations contained in your      previous letter.       Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley.     Max Baucus.     Barack Obama.                                  ____                              Department of Homeland Security,                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2007.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Specter: I promised at the start of this      process that I would tell you if the bill you were      shepherding became so unworkable or unenforceable that it      threatened to worsen our current illegal worker problem. In      general, the Senate has avoided workability and      enforceability pitfalls, but for the first time I must write      to you to express concern about a proposed amendment that      would be a serious step backwards in our enforcement effort.       Enforcing the law means more than border enforcement. We      have to shut off the job magnet that pulls illegal aliens      into our country. The current bill's Title III wi11 do just      that. It creates a much stronger, more effective worksite      enforcement system than the one that exists today. This      system will stop illegal aliens from getting hired, and it      will punish employers who make illegal workers part of their      business model. By contrast, the Grassley-Baucus-Obama      Amendment will significantly weaken the current Title III,      with the result that illegal workers wil1 still be drawn      across our borders by the lure of easy employment.       These are just some of the specific examples of      deficiencies in the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment that will      lead to a lack of enforceable worksite enforcement:       (1) Job Security for Criminal Aliens--Current Title III      requires mandatory verification of all existing workers.      Under the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment, existing workers      are never checked. So serious criminals, and other aliens who      are not eligible for legal status, would be able to hide in      their existing jobs indefinitely, without ever having to      prove that they are authorized to work in this country.       (2) Loophole for Fake Documents--Current Title III requires      that new hires show a secure identification card to keep      their jobs. Under the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment, in      contrast, most new hires will be able to present any driver's      license, whether or not it meets federal standards for secure      documents. And unlike the current Title III, individuals      presenting a non-secure license will not be required by the      Amendment to provide a second document to establish that they      are authorized to work in the United States. Finally, the      Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment eliminates a grant program to      reimburse States for the costs of improving license      security. The result will be to continue a flourishing      market for fake documents and identity theft.       (3) Arbitrary End to Information Sharing--The best way to      catch unscrupulous employers who do not verify their      employees is to compare Social Security records to the      records of the EEVS. Current Title III allows DHS to do so.      But the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment cuts off all      information sharing after five years. Grassley-Baucus-Obama      tells unscrupulous employers that, after five years, when the      government agencies stop talking to each other, they can      return to ``business as usual,'' employing unauthorized      workers.       (4) Punishing the Enforcers Instead of the Violators--Many      Americans want tough financial sanctions and strict liability      on employers who hire illegal workers. So far as I am aware,      none of them want to impose sanctions and no-fault liability      on immigration enforcers. But that is precisely what the      Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment would do. Under the Grassley-     Baucus-Obama Amendment, any individual who wins his judicial      appeal against the government's determination of his      employment eligibility can seek compensation for lost wages--     even if the initial error was caused by the individual and      not the government. Moreover, in a poorly concealed effort to      make DHS avoid tough enforcement, the Grassley-Baucus-Obama      Amendment actually proposes that any award come from DHS's      enforcement budget. This would actually make the enforcement      climate worse than it was after the 1986 law.       (5) Ignoring the Government's Best Evidence of Illegal      Workers--Every year, SSA sends out millions of ``no-match      letters'', indicating that an individual's name and social      security number do not match. These letters are a powerful      indicator that the individual may not be work-authorized. The      current bill gives DHS authority to require that employers      take action to resolve ``no-match letters.'' Grassley-Baucus-     Obama would not.     It would encourage employers to continue to turn a blind eye      to evidence that their workers may be illegal.       (6) No Improvement in IRS Authority--Nothing worries an      unscrupulous businessman more than the prospect of a tax      audit. The IRS has great investigative skills; it also has      authority to punish immigration violators who file incorrect      information about their employees, but this authority does      not have the deterrent effect it should because the current      fines are so low. Title III fixes this problem by raising the      fines and creating a dedicated Criminal Investigation Office      to investigate tax violations related to immigration      violations. Grassley-Baucus-Obama drops all of these      important provisions.       Title III is the foundation of comprehensive reform. We      will not reform our immigration system. nor will we shut off      the stream of illegal immigrants pouring across our border,      without addressing the force that draws them here in the      first place. We need better documents and stronger tools to      uncover identity fraud. The current version of Title III      gives us these tools; by contrast the Grassley-Baucus-Obama      Amendment eliminates needed tools and allows unscrupulous      businesses to continue to freely hire illegal workers.       Finally, weak enforcement is bad for business. Legitimate      businesses that comply with the law will be undercut by      competitors who disobey that law if enforcement is lacking. I      ask that you help to defeat the Grassley-Baucus-Obama      Amendment, not just to help our enforcers but to give a fair      shake to those who want to obey the law.       In the end, the Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment      unfortunately fuels public skepticism about whether      enforcement will work or political forces will frustrate      serious efforts to bring employers into compliance with the      law. I reject that view. We must enforce the law, and with      your help we will. I urge you to join with me in opposing the      Grassley-Baucus-Obama Amendment.           Sincerely,                                                 Michael Chertoff.
