Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority whip the schedule for the week to come. Oh, I am sorry. I was told that the leader was not going to be available, but the leader is available. So I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), my friend, the leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding; and as the gentleman knows, once a whip, always a whip.
