Mr. Speaker, I reclaim my time. I reclaim my time.  This was an agreement we reached, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and myself, to in fact have the money spent as a continuing resolution to the level of $31,799,104,000, and it reverts back to $27.7 billion. That is what this House agreed to.  It also says that none of the obligated funds will be affected. That is in there, too.  It also says, by the way, it can be changed at a later date; and that will probably be true, too.  But to allude to those people that depend upon our highways, and no one defends those highways better than I do, no one works harder to make sure that the transportation system is improved. It is so much better than what was proposed.  Mr. Speaker, to stand up on television and play the political game on this floor of the House is wrong. The Committee on Appropriations chairman is trying to do his job. I have 64 bills over in the other body that have not been acted on. How many bills in the other body belong to the gentleman that the majority leader in the Senate has not acted on?  Do not ask us to play the political game against my leaders in this House and say it is all their fault. Look at the Senate side. Look at the Senate side. What have they done? Have they passed a budget? Have they looked at the appropriating bills? No, they have not.  In addition, when we get done, I will probably insist on the Senate side to bring us more money. But, in reality, they worked in good faith. Our leaders worked in good faith. I worked in good faith. My ranking member worked in good faith. And to stand up on this floor and play the political card is absolutely wrong for this House.  If the gentleman wants to have power that bad, go at it. But I am thinking of the people of the United States right now. I am thinking about the people who depend on transportation and on the bridges the gentleman talked about. There is more money in this. We have $4.4 billion put back into it when we passed the budget. And the gentleman voted for it.  I am a little excited right now because my back hurts, but the fact of the matter is I have watched this 30 years. I have watched this body for 30 years, and ever since we put the television cameras in, debate on this floor has deteriorated and is for political purposes instead of solving problems.  Our job is to solve the problems and represent the people of this Nation for the best of this Nation, not for political purposes.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
