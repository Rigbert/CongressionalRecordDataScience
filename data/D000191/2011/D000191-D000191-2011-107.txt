Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Daniel Rodriguez on the occasion of his retirement after 26 years of service as executive director for the University of Oregon Alumni Association.  The University of Oregon is a world class institution renowned for its groundbreaking research, and is an important keystone that unites Oregonians both at home and throughout the world.  Since coming to the University of Oregon in 1988, Dan Rodriguez has played a pivotal role in the rebirth of the alumni association. He created the alumni membership program that has topped 20,000 members worldwide and worked diligently to put the association on sound financial footing. He also led the effort to increase the number of active alumni chapters to 22 across the country.  But perhaps Dan's greatest accomplishment is the construction of the new Ford Alumni Center. While Dan will be the first to say this Center came about due to the tireless effort of many committed individuals, there is no question he has been a driving force for the project since its inception.  Dan grew up in Sunnyvale, CA, and is a graduate of Arizona State University. While he is a Sun Devil by pedigree, it is difficult to think of a more devoted and true Oregon Duck than Dan. He has spent untold hours promoting the University and the alumni association. He has also dedicated himself to the University's hometown community of Eugene, Oregon, where he has served on the Eugene Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors, the Rotary Club, and in several capacities with the American Lung Association of Oregon.  Dan has served four University presidents, seven athletic directors, and acted as a mentor to hundreds of UO students teaching the importance of leadership and volunteerism as part of campus life. He leaves a team of 12 employees and a board of directors who will miss his devotion and dedication to the association and the university it serves.  On the occasion of his last day at the University of Oregon, I wish to personally thank Mr. Rodriguez for his service. He will certainly be missed. Go Ducks!                          ____________________
