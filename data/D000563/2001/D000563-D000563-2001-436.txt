President, I rise in support of the amendment. This is the economic stimulus amendment that provides an immediate rebate to the taxpayers of America, both income-tax payers and payroll-tax payers, of at least $300 per person, $600 per family.  It also provides a permanent rate reduction of the lowest rate from 15 percent to 10 percent. It will cost us $60 billion. It will go into effect immediately. It will help families across America this year.  This also provides that the total tax cut in addition to this will be $745 billion. This has been mischaracterized as a tax increase. We do not have a tax cut in place. We are debating the size of the tax cut.  We think a third of the surplus should go to a tax cut, a third to deficit reduction, and a third to crucial priorities, such as Social Security, Medicare, and investments in education. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.
