 President, I wish to join in a colloquy with my ranking member, Senator Bond, to correct clerical errors to project and attribution tables in the transportation, housing, and urban development title to the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2011.  Senator Casey should be added for attribution to the Economic Development Initiative project for the city of Wilkes-Barre, PA.  The project under the Bus and Bus Facilities Account for Longview Transit Vehicle Replacements, Clark County, WA, should read Longview Transit Vehicle Replacements, Cowlitz County, WA.  The project under Surface Transportation Improvements Bench Boulevard Improvements, Helena, MT, should read Bench Boulevard Improvements, Billings, MT, where the project construction will be taking place.  The project under Surface Transportation Improvements for the Maritime Fire and Safety Administration, WA, should read Maritime Fire and Safety Association, WA.  Senator Boxer should not be listed for attribution to the Marin-Sonoma Narrows, CA, project under the Surface Transportation Investments account, and she should be listed for attribution for the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit, SMART, CA project under the Federal Transit Administration Capital Investment Grant account.  The project under the Surface Transportation Improvement Account listed as SR 522 Corridor Improvements should read SR 522 Corridor Signal Improvements, 61st and 181st Street, WA.  Additionally, Senator Franken should be added as a requester of the Economic Development Initiative project for the Lutheran Social Services of Minnesota, MN, Renovation of Homes for the Disabled.
