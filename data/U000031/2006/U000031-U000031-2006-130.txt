Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Dr. William K. Emery. Dr. Emery today will receive the Friend of Public Health Award from the Berrien County Health Department for his many decades of dedicated service.  A caring and compassionate third-generation physician, Dr. Emery served as a family practitioner and as medical director for Whirlpool Corporation for more than 30 years. Dr. Emery, his father and grandfather have provided more than a century of care to the residents of Southwest Michigan. After retiring from his practice, Dr. Emery continued to serve his community as a member of the Berrien County Board of Health.  Dr. Emery is a man of vision and leadership, and brought those skills to bear as a member of the Berrien County Board of Health. He believes that the key to good health is knowledge and prevention. Dr. Emery was the driving force behind the Health Department's mission of preventing disease, prolonging life, protecting the health of the community, and promoting a better quality of life for everyone.  A 1942 graduate of St. Joseph High School, Dr. Emery received his medical degree from the University of Michigan in 1949 and joined the family practice in 1951.  While his colleagues are recognizing him today for his years of service, Dr. Emery's exemplary service continues. He has been named the first Health Board Member emeritus by the Berrien County Board of Commissioners, and he is volunteering at a local health care facility library.  Southwest Michigan is a healthier and better place because of Dr. William K. Emery.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E708]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    TRIBUTE TO DR.
