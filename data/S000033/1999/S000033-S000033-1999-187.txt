 Speaker, I would like to congratulate Blanche Moyse, from Brattleboro, Vermont, on the celebration of her 90th birthday. Thirty years ago, Blanche founded the New England Bach Festival and has served as conductor since that founding. Ms. Moyse has made it possible for people from all overthe world to come to Vermont year after year, and under the spectacular canopy of autumn, be enriched by both her art and her person.  If Blanche, or ``the Blanche'' as some affectionately call her, had done nothing but be ousted at 16 from Conservatory violin competitions to give others a chance; survive WWII in mid France; move a household to South America one year to North America the next in search of work and peace; change artistic direction at 40 because of an increasingly uncooperative bow arm, and awaken a sleepy New England hamlet to the joys of music, she would be a remarkable person. But in fact, Blanche has done much more: She has managed, throughout a life of tempest and tumult, to remain an eternal optimist, and to remain both inspired and inspiring! Thus, year after year musicians from near and far--old and new friends alike--say ``Yes'' to repeat requests for work and play. Year after year, the Blanche Moyse Chorale sings like a lark.  Congratulations and thank you Blanche Moyse for your vision, for your tenacity, for your love of music and for your years of sharing. Happy Birthday.                          ____________________
