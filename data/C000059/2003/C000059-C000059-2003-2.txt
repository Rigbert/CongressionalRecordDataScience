 Madam Speaker, H.R. 2584 will transfer a decommissioned NOAA vessel to the Utrok Atoll local government in the Republic of the Marshall Islands. The Utrok Atoll is one of 29 low coral atolls in the Marshall Islands that is inhabited by 600 people.  This small atoll has been exposed to the horrible effects of radioactive pollution during our nuclear bomb testing period. These citizens require ongoing tests, monitoring and medical care; and it is currently difficult for them to obtain access to that care.  The fundamental goal of this legislation is to provide these citizens with a reliable, safe means of transportation to the city of Majuro. This city is the capital of the Marshall Islands and is more than 300 miles from the Utrok Atoll.  The NOAA vessel likely affected by this measure is the McArthur. The ship is 175 feet long, has a cruising speed of 10 knots, a cruising range of over 6,000 nautical miles and a draft of 12 feet. It was commissioned as a NOAA research vessel in 1966 and decommissioned on May 20, 2003.  Under the terms of H.R. 2584, all rights, title, and interest in the ship are transferred to the Utrok Atoll government. The vessel must be in operable condition prior to the actual transfer; but in the future, all maintenance, responsibility, and liabilities are conveyed to the Utrok Atoll government.                              {time}  1115  Title II of the bill is a corrective measure for the Department of Commerce which may approve appointments and confirmations made for the NOAA Corps in the Clinton and Bush administrations. This measure has been unanimously adopted by the other body.  Title III of the bill reauthorizes two important laws dealing with international fisheries, the Fisherman's Protective Act and the Yukon River Salmon Act. Identical language was incorporated in H.R. 2048 which unanimously passed the House of Representatives on October 20 of this year. Thistitle is noncontroversial and simply extends these two acts for an additional 5 years at existing funding levels.  Madam Speaker, I compliment the gentleman from American Samoa (Mr. Faleomavaega) for sponsoring this bill, and urge my colleagues to support this important humanitarian effort.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
