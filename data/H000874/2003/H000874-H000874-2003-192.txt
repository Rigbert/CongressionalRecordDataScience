Speaker, I know the Members of the House are concerned about the schedule that we have been on and the schedule we are going to be on. And in the interest of apprising Members of what they might expect for the balance of this evening and tomorrow, I yield to the distinguished majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay).  Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the distinguished whip yielding to me.  In consultation with the minority, we have come up with what we think is a very firm schedule, very fair schedule, and that is we, as most Members know, will go to the Head Start bill at the end of this conversation. There will be about 2 hours, 2 hours 20 minutes of debate before a vote. Then when that bill is disposed of, we will go to the drug reimportation bill, hopefully voting on that final passage sometime around 1 o'clock. Then we will break and come back tomorrow.  We have been in discussion with the ranking member of the appropriations and the chairman of the appropriations. They want to do a supplemental on FEMA and fires first thing in the morning, or in the morning, and thengo to VA-HUD appropriations. We will not be doing D.C. appropriations tomorrow. We anticipate or we hope that Members will get us amendments to the VA-HUD bill so that we can make some sort of arrangements in time on that debate. And if everything goes well, we ought to be able to adjourn sometime around 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
