President, I will come to the floor of this Senate again and again and again these next few months to urge bipartisan action on this issue. The Snowe-Wyden legislation is one approach. Certainly, our colleagues will have other good ideas. There are a variety of ways this issue can be addressed in a bipartisan way. I am pleased our approach garnered 54 votes when it came to actually paying for it.  I intend, with Senator Snowe, to continue to urge older people to send in copies of their prescription drug bills to each Member in the Senate in Washington, DC, so we can read their personal accounts into the Record.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from South Carolina.                          ____________________
