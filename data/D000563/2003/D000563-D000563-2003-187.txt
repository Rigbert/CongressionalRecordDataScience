President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative United States postage stamp should be issued to promote public awareness of Down syndrome and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued. I am honored to be joined by Senator Cornyn, Senator Bayh, Senator Bingaman, Senator Feingold, and Senator Inouye in this effort.  Down syndrome is a genetic condition usually caused by an error in cell division called non-disjunction. Regardless of the type of Down syndrome a person may have, all people with Down syndrome have an extra, critical portion of the number 21 chromosome present in all, or some, of their cells. This additional genetic material alters the course of development and causes the characteristics associated with the syndrome.  Down syndrome affects people of all races and economic levels. It is the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormality, occurring once out of every 800 to 1,000 births. In the United States, more than 350,000 people have Down syndrome. Nearly 5,000 children with Down syndrome are born each year. Because the mortality rate connected with Down syndrome is decreasing, the number of individuals with Down syndrome in our society is increasing. Some experts predict that the prevalence of individuals with Down syndrome will double in the next 10 years, further increasing the need for public acceptance and education about this genetic condition.  October is designated as Down Syndrome Awareness Month, so this is an appropriate time to demonstrate support for people with Down syndrome and encourage greater inclusion and acceptance in our society. I encourage my colleagues to co-sponsor this meaningful resolution and assist our efforts to convince the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee to recommend the issuance of a postage stamp promoting public awareness of Down syndrome.                          ____________________
