 President, second, once the administration brings detainees into the United States--right here in our country--it is no longer simply a matter for the administration. In other words, once they get here, the administration cannot entirely control the issue of whether they are going to be released. It is no longer about what it will or will not do. It is also about what a Federal judge will or will not do.  As we saw with Judge Urbina and the Uighurs, a judge may very well agree with the legal arguments of Guantanamo detainees and order them released right here in the United States. In other words, no matter what the administration's intention may be, once we bring them here, they do not control the situation; the courts do.  Those risks do not exist if the Obama administration does not bring the Guantanamo detainees into the United States. That risk does not exist if it leaves them at Guantanamo and tries them at the modern, multimillion-dollar courtroom at Guantanamo Bay under the very military commission rules it has now rewritten to its liking and which we will soon vote on when we consider the Defense authorization conference report.  The Supreme Court should affirm the DC Circuit Court's decision and let the political branches maintain control over our borders, including deciding whether and how foreign nationals outside our borders may be admitted within them.  If it does, it will bring clarity to the debate over whether terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay ought to be transferred to the United States. That clarity is this: If we want certitude that foreign terrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay are not released into the United States, then do not bring them here in the first place.  Mr. President, I repeat. We could try terrorists in the United States--we could do that--but the issue is should we do that. The answer is no.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 19, 2009]             Civilian Courts Are No Place To Try Terrorists                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)       The Obama administration has said it intends to try several      of the prisoners now detained at Guantanamo Bay in civilian      courts in this country. This would include Khalid Sheikh      Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist      attacks, and other detainees allegedly involved. The Justice      Department claims that our courts are well suited to the      task.       Based on my experience trying such cases, and what I saw as      attorney general, they aren't. That is not to say that      civilian courts cannot ever handle terrorist prosecutions,      but rather that their role in a war on terror--to use an      unfashionable harsh phrase--should be, as the term ``war''      would suggest, a supporting and not a principal role.       The challenges of a terrorism trial are overwhelming. To      maintain the security of the courthouse and the jail      facilities where defendants are housed, deputy U.S. marshals      must be recruited from other jurisdictions; jurors must be      selected anonymously and escorted to and from the courthouse      under armed guard; and judges who preside over such cases      often need protection as well. All such measures burden an      already overloaded justice system and interfere with the      handling of other cases, both criminal and civil.       Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the places      of both trial and confinement for such defendants would      become attractive targets for others intent on creating      mayhem, whether it be terrorists intent on inflicting      casualties on the local population, or lawyers intent on      filing waves of lawsuits over issues as diverse as whether      those captured in combat must be charged with crimes or      released, or the conditions of confinement for all prisoners,      whether convicted or not.       Even after conviction, the issue is not whether a maximum-     security prison can hold these defendants; of course it can.      But their presence even inside the walls, as proselytizers if      nothing else, is itself a danger. The recent arrest of U.S.      citizen Michael Finton, a convert to Islam proselytized in      prison and charged with planning to blow up a building in      Springfield, Ill., is only the latest example of that      problem.       Moreover, the rules for conducting criminal trials in      federal courts have been fashioned to prosecute conventional      crimes by conventional criminals. Defendants are granted      access to information relating to their case that might be      useful in meeting the charges and shaping a defense, without      regard to the wider impact such information might have. That      can provide a cornucopia of valuable information to      terrorists, both those in custody and those at large.       Thus, in the multidefendant terrorism prosecution of Sheik      Omar Abdel Rahman and others that I presided over in 1995 in      federal district court in Manhattan, the government was      required to disclose, as it is routinely in conspiracy cases,      the identity of all known co-conspirators, regardless of      whether they are charged as defendants. One of those co-     conspirators, relatively obscure in 1995, was Osama bin      Laden. It was later learned that soon after the government's      disclosure the list of unindicted co-conspirators had made      its way to bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, where he then      resided. He was able to learn not only that the government      was aware of him, but also who else the government was aware      of.       It is not simply the disclosure of information under      discovery rules that can be useful to terrorists. The      testimony in a public trial, particularly under the probing      of appropriately diligent defense counsel, can elicit      evidence about means and methods of evidence collection that      have nothing to do with the underlying issues in the case,      but which can be used to press government witnesses to either      disclose information they would prefer to keep confidential      or make it appear that they are concealing facts. The      alternative is to lengthen criminal trials beyond what is      tolerable by vetting topics in closed sessions before they      can be presented in open ones.       In June, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the      transfer of Ahmed Ghailani to this country from Guantanamo.      Mr. Ghailani was indicted in connection with the 1998 bombing      of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was captured in      2004, after others had already been tried here for that      bombing.       Mr. Ghailani was to be tried before a military commission      for that and other war crimes committed afterward, but when      the Obama administration elected to close Guantanamo, the      existing indictment against Mr. Ghailani in New York      apparently seemed to offer an attractive alternative. It may      be as well that prosecuting Mr. Ghailani in an already      pending case in New York was seen as an opportunity to      illustrate how readily those at Guantanamo might be      prosecuted in civilian courts. After all, as Mr. Holder said      in his June announcement, four defendants were ``successfully      prosecuted'' in that case.       It is certainly true that four defendants already were      tried and sentenced in that case. But the proceedings were      far from exemplary. The jury declined to impose the death      penalty, which requires unanimity, when one juror disclosed      at the end of the trial that he could not impose the death      penalty--even though he had sworn previously that he could.      Despite his disclosure, the juror was permitted to serve and      render a verdict.       Mr. Holder failed to mention it, but there was also a fifth      defendant in the case, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. He never      participated in the trial. Why? Because, before it began, in      a foiled attempt to escape a maximum security prison, he      sharpened a plastic comb into a weapon and drove it through      the eye and into the brain of Louis Pepe, a 42-year-old      Bureau of Prisons guard. Mr. Pepe was blinded in one eye and      rendered nearly unable to speak.       Salim was prosecuted separately for that crime and found      guilty of attempted murder. There are many words one might      use to describe how these events unfolded; ``successfully''      is not among them.       The very length of Mr. Ghailani's detention prior to being      brought here for prosecution presents difficult issues. The      Speedy Trial Act requires that those charged be tried within      a relatively short time after they are charged or captured,      whichever comes last. Even if the pending charge against Mr.      Ghailani is not dismissed for violation of that statute, he      may well seek access to what the government knows of his      activities after the embassy bombings, even if those      activities are not charged in the pending indictment. Such      disclosures could seriously compromise sources and methods of      intelligence gathering.       Finally, the government (for undisclosed reasons) has      chosen not to seek the death penalty against Mr. Ghailani,      even though that penalty was sought, albeit unsuccessfully,      against those who stood trial earlier. The embassy bombings      killed more than 200 people.       Although the jury in the earlier case declined to sentence      the defendants to death, that determination does not bind a      future jury. However, when the government determines not to      seek the death penalty against a defendant charged with      complicity in the murder of hundreds, that potentially      distorts every future capital case the government prosecutes.      Put simply, once the government decides not to seek the death      penalty against a defendant charged with mass murder, how can      it justify seeking the death penalty against anyone charged      with murder--however atrocious--on a smaller scale?       Even a successful prosecution of Mr. Ghailani, with none of      the possible obstacles described earlier, would offer no      example of how the cases against other Guantanamo detainees      can be handled. The embassy bombing case was investigated for      prosecution in a court, with all of the safeguards in      handling evidence and securing witnesses that attend such a      prosecution. By contrast, the charges against other detainees      have not been so investigated.       It was anticipated that if those detainees were to be tried      at all, it would be before a military commission where the      touchstone for admissibility of evidence was simply relevance      and apparent reliability. Thus, the circumstances of their      capture on the battlefield could be described by affidavit if      necessary, without bringing to court the particular soldier      or unit that effected the capture, so long as the affidavit      and surrounding circumstances appeared reliable. No such      procedure would be permitted in an ordinary civilian court.       Moreover, it appears likely that certain charges could not      be presented in a civilian court because the proof that would      have to be offered could, if publicly disclosed, compromise      sources and methods of intelligence gathering. The military      commissions regimen established for use at Guantanamo was      designed with such considerations in mind. It provided a way      of handling classified information so as to make it available      to a defendant's counsel while preserving confidentiality.      The courtroom facility at Guantanamo was constructed, at a      cost of millions of dollars, specifically to accommodate the      handling of classified information and the heightened      security needs of a trial of such defendants.       Nevertheless, critics of Guantanamo seem to believe that if      we put our vaunted civilian justice system on display in      these cases, then we will reap benefits in the coin of world      opinion, and perhaps even in that part of the world that      wishes us ill. Of course, we did just that after the first      World Trade Center bombing, after the plot to blow up      airliners over the Pacific, and after the embassy bombings in      Kenya and Tanzania.       In return, we got the 9/11 attacks and the murder of nearly      3,000 innocents. True, this won us a great deal of goodwill      abroad--people around the globe lined up for blocks outside      our embassies to sign the condolence books. That is the kind      of goodwill we can do without.
