  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President has come to Congress, as he should, to ask authority for a discretionary military action. The sad fact is he doesn't have to because of a defective law passed by Congress in reaction to Nixon's bombing of Cambodia in 1973. The bill that Congress passed is a shadow of our constitutional authority regarding war and peace.  This President has come to us. That's good. The result is not yet known. It has already resulted perhaps in a diplomatic breakthrough. That is also good. But in the future we need to make certain that each and every President comes to us when we're not defending against immediate interests of the United States or against imminent or real attack of our troops or our citizens.  So I'll be reintroducing legislation to fix the war power authority. In the future, in circumstances such as this, it will require that the President come to the Congress before launching a discretionary military action. We must fix this law. This is a good precedent this President has set. Let's make it the law of the United States of America.                          ____________________
