 President, just to reassure my colleagues, CMS indicates that they can handle this for up to 2 weeks. It was encouraging that this passed the House with such a large bipartisan majority, and I want to reassure everyone who is interested in this legislation that we will move to it very quickly when we get back. As I indicated, once again, they can handle a 2-week gap here. We will turn to this legislation very quickly when we get back. I think there is every reason to believe it will pass the Senate by a very large majority.
