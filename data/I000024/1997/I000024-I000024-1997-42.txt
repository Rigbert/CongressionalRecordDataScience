President, today we will be having some conversation on the floor concerning the global warming treaty. I will make a few comments concerning that in that I am the chairman of the Clean Air Committee of the Environment and Public Works Committee. We have had extensive hearings on this. I will review just very briefly what we have learned from the hearing that we held in our subcommittee in the Environment and Public Works Committee insofar as global warming is concerned.  In July, the Environmental Committee had a hearing on the global climate change treaty and we heard from five top scientists.  The conclusions I found were very interesting, particularly since last night when I watched Administrator Carol Browner talk about the scientific evidence that is conclusive concerning global climate change. That is not at all what we found in our hearing. We had five of the top scientists around. While there is a large body of scientific research, there is much controversy and disagreement in scientific facts being misrepresented by the administration and the press.  Four things that we came to a conclusion on were, No. 1, we don't know how much human activity has influenced the climate. One scientist before our committee said it could be as much as 6 percent.  Second, if you look at satellite data, we are not sure if there has been any global warming. We had a very interesting session that lasted more than an hour with viewing the satellites and what conclusions could come, and there was no conclusive evidence that there has actually been any global warming.  Three, even if we eliminate all manmade emissions, it may not have a noticeable impact on the environment, and the treaty may only eliminate emissions here in the United States and not in the entire world.  Four, when asked, all five scientists stated that we would not have the uncertainties understood by this December, when the administration plans on making a decision regarding the treaty.  Now, we found out yesterday that the President came and made his announcement. It is kind of interesting, Mr. President, because we passed a resolution on the floor of the Senate, by 95 to 0, that said we would reject any type of a treaty that came from Kyoto that didn't treat the developing nations the same as the developed nations. So the President came out with something where he is calling for a binding 30 percent reduction in emission levels by the year 2012. He calls this an important first step, with more reductions to follow.  As chairman of the Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I can tell you that this is going to have a profound negative affect on our ability to defend America, as the President stated yesterday that the military accounts for 43 percent of the Federal energy use. The Federal Government cannot reduce by 30 percent or more without significant cuts in the military. I think this equates to something like a 3 to 7 times greater cut than the Btu tax of 1993.  One of the things that bothered me more than anything else is the moving target that we are dealing with. In March of 1995 in a House Commerce Committee hearing, Congressmen Dingell and Schaefer raised concerns that the new targets may not apply to all countries equally, and on behalf ofthe administration, Mr. Rafe Pomerance, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the State Department said, ``Our goal, Mr. Chairman, is that all parties participate in this next round of negotiations. We want to see that all governments participate and help define the post-2000 regime.''  One month later, the administration signed on to the Berlin Mandate to review the commitments made to reduce the greenhouse gases and adopt targets for further reductions. The conference differentiated between developed and developing nations. They signed on to this, totally at odds and contradicting the commitment made to the Congressmen.  In June 1996, Mr. Pomerance stated, ``Are we going to agree to legally binding instrument in Geneva? No way.'' One month later, Under Secretary Wirth announced that the United States supported a legally binding emissions target.  I want to also say that this has not changed since September 1996. It is before the same Commerce Committee. Assistant Secretary of State Eileen Claussen told Congressman Dingell and the committee that the United States would not be bound before we have completed the economic analysis and assessments. We have just learned that the administration's efforts to analyze the economic effects has failed. The models they used did not work, and we will not understand the effect on our nations's economy certainly before December.  The reason I am concerned about this is, there is a very interesting parallel between what they are trying to do in the absence of any scientific evidence in global climate change, which has a dramatic deteriorating effect on our ability to be competitive on a global basis and on the ambient air changes promulgated by this administration. We all know that, just about a year ago, Carol Browner came out and unilaterally suggested--and now has promulgated--the rule change to lower the ambient air standards in both particulate matter and in ozone. We find that during the various hearings that we have had that Mary Nichols, who is immediately under Carol Browner, said that the cost would be $9 billion to put these standards in--the cost to the American people. At the same time, the President's Economic Advisory Committee said it was $60 billion a year. The Reason Foundation estimated the costs between $90 billion and $150 billion. This would cost the average family of four some $1,700 a year.  They talk about the deaths, and Carol Browner reused this yesterday. There would be 60,000 premature deaths. Those deaths were lowered by the EPA last November to 40,000; then in December to 20,000, and in April to 15,000. Then the scientist who discovered the mathematic mistake now says it's less than 1,000. In our committee, Mary Nichols admitted these regulations would not save any lives over the next 5 years.  I have watched how Carol Browner goes around and makes promises. She says to the mayors of America, ``This isn't going to affect you.'' She says to the farmers, ``This isn't going to affect you.'' She says to small businesses, ``This won't affect you.'' To some of the parishes in Louisiana that were found to be out of attainment, she said, ``This isn't going to make you do anything because the problem is for the neighboring State of Texas to the west; they are going to have to do this.''  So, Mr. President, I only ask the question, why is this obsession taking place in the administration if there is no scientific justification on either global warming or ambient air standards? Why are they trying to do this in eroding our personal freedoms? I think probably the best way to answer that is to read an article in Forbes magazine, called ``Watch Out For This Woman; The EPA's Carol Browner is exploiting health and the environment to build a power base.''  If you read this article, Mr. President, it says:       If science isn't Browner's strong point, political tactics      are. Her enemies can only envy the way the EPA uses the      courts.       . . . For her part, Browner often dismisses as simple male      chauvinism any criticism of her hardball tactics.       . . . She learned politics working on Gore's Senate staff,      where she rose to be his legislative director before heading      back to Florida to head the State environmental commission.       . . . She is an environmentalist zealot.  Mr. President, I know my time has expired. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From Forbes magazine, Oct. 20, 1997]                 Carol Browner, Master of Mission Creep                 (By Pranay Gupte and Bonner R. Cohen)       As the center of that enormous rent-seeking organization      known as the federal government, Washington, D.C. has evolved      its own vocabulary. There is, in bureaucratese, an innocent-     sounding but insidious phrase: mission creep. Mark it well:      Mission creep explains a lot about how big government grows      and grows and grows.       Mission creep is to a taxpayer-supported organization what      new markets are to a business organization. It involves a      gradual, sometimes authorized, sometimes not, broadening of a      bureaucracy's original mission. It is a way to accrete money      and power beyond what Congress originally approved when it      funded an agency.       Playing mission creep is an old game in Washington. But no      one has ever played the game with more skill than Carol M.      Browner, Bill Clinton's choice to head the Environmental      Protection Agency.       From a modest beginning a quarter-century ago, the agency      has grown to employ nearly 20,000 people and control an      annual budget of $7 billion. But these numbers are a poor      measure of the agency's power: Because its regulations have      the force of law, the agency can jail people, close factories      and override the judgments of local authorities.       In its quest for power and money, the agency has imposed      many unnecessary costs on American industry, and ultimately      on the American people--costs that do more to satisfy      bureaucratic zeal than to clean the air or the water.       The EPA was established in 1970 by an executive order      issued by President Richard M. Nixon. Rachel Carson, a patron      saint of the environmental movement, had made a huge impact      with her emotional tract, Silent Spring, a few years earlier.       The public was right to be alarmed. Industrialization has      imposed hidden costs in the form of polluted air, despoiled      streams, unsightly dumps and a general degradation of the      landscape. Concerns about pollution could, of course, have      been dealt with by existing agencies, but that is not the      nature of American politics. Politicians must be seen to be      doing something dramatic. Creating new agencies makes      favorable waves in the media.       Nixon created a new agency. Pulled together from a      hodgepodge of existing federal programs, the EPA never had a      congressional charter that would have defined its regulatory      activities. It was simply given the task of carrying out the      provisions of what, over time, became 13 environmental      statutes, each with its own peculiarities and      constituencies.       Without perhaps fully comprehending the issues, Nixon made      the new EPA the instrument for a tremendous power grab by the      federal government. Most environmental problems--chemical      spills, groundwater contamination, abandoned dump sites--are      purely local in nature. But suddenly they were federal      matters. In the name of a greener, cleaner Earth, Washington      mightily increased its power to intervene in the daily lives      of its citizens. It was a goal so worthy that few people saw      the dangers inherent in to. Mission creep had begun.       In 1978 then-EPA administrator Douglas Costle cleverly      shifted the focus of the agency. Henceforth the EPA would      protect not just the environment but your health. ``Costle      became determined to convince the public that [the] EPA was      first and foremost a public health agency, not a guardian of      bugs and bunnies,'' wrote Mark K. Landry, Marc J. Roberts and      Stephen R. Thomas in their book, The Environmental Protection      Agency: Asking the Wrong Questions from Nixon to Clinton.       People do care about forests and wildlife, but they care      much more about themselves and their families. There is a      strong strain of hypochondria in the American people, and      nothing grabs our attention faster than an alleged threat to      our health. If the alleged threat involves cancer, it is      almost guaranteed to make the six o'clock news. Costle      shrewdly exploited cancerphobia to expand his agency's reach      and to wring money from Congress. He launched the EPA on a      cancer hunt, looking for carcinogens in foods and air and      water, even in the showers we take.       Carcinogens, of course, abound in nature, ordinary sunlight      being one of the most prevalent. So it is with many man-made      substances. The exposure to background levels of these      carcinogens is so minimal in most cases as to pose no serious      threat in the over whelming majority of cases. Never mind:      EPA scientists, following the agency's cancer-risk      guidelines, were soon ignoring the age-old admonition that      the ``dose makes the poison.'' If it was man-made and carried      carcinogens, the EPA would root it out. As one EPA scientist      explained it to Forbes: ``At EPA, we're not paid not to find      risks.''       Under the mantra of ``one fiber can kill,'' the EPA in the      1980s mounted a costly and probably self-defeating nationwide      effort to rip asbestos out of schools. Simply sealing the      substance would have kept the fibers away from kids at a      fraction of the cost. But it would not have yielded the same      harvest in headlines.       Even more than her predecessors--and possessing much      greater resources--Carol Browner presents herself as the      great family physician. ``There isn't a decision I make on      any given day that's not related to the health of the      American people.'' she tells Forbes. Browner, it's worth      noting, is a lawyer with no medical training.       After all, she reminds us, she's the mom of a young boy.      Attendees of Capitol Hill hearings snicker at her constant      references to her son, Zachary, when she testifies on      environmental issues. But she never misses a chance to repeat      the message. ``If we can focus on protecting the children . .      . we will be protecting the population at large, which is      obviously our job,'' she tells Forbes.       Who said that was her job? Nobody, but that's what mission      creep is all about.       Last September Browner announced the release of a new EPA      report setting forth a broad national agenda to protect      children from environmental risks. She followed up the report      with the creation earlier this year of the Office of      Children's Health Protection at EPA.       There was no congressional mandate, but Congress meekly      went along by failing to challenge the agency's justification      of the program. Who would want to face reelection accused of      being callous toward children? Especially when the EPA's kept      researchers stand by ready to produce scare studies on EPA      money (see box, p. 172).       Where most agency chiefs tremble at criticism from      Congress, Browner has a platform from which she can      counterattack. An EPA-funded newsletter was recently      distributed by the National Parents Teachers Association. At      the time an internal EPA memo noted: ``The PTA could become a      major ally for the Agency in preventing Congress from      slashing our budget.'' Thus does Browner's EPA use taxpayer      money to fight efforts to trim the federal budget.       On Mar. 15, 1995 David Lewis, an EPA scientist attached to      the agency's laboratory in Athens, Ga., was told by his      supervisor that EPA employees with connections to members of      Congress should use their influence to sway lawmakers against      a bill proposed by Representative Clifford Stearns (R-Fla.)--     if it could be done ``without getting into trouble.''      Stearns' bill would have reduced funding for EPA. The      scientist later said in a deposition: ``We were being asked      to do this during government business hours, and the purpose      was to protect EPA funding levels.'' This request on the part      of high-level EPA officials to lobby Congress on government      time is under investigation by the House Government Reform      and Oversight Committee.       Had this been a Republican administration and had the      department involved been other than the EPA, one can imagine      the outcry in the media.       Asked about the growing criticism of her tactics, Browner      blatantly ducks the question with: ``This isn't about me. It      never has been about me. It's about the air being cleaner. Is      the water going to be safer? It's about business going to be      able to find a better solution to our environmental      problems.''       It's really about politics. When supportive lawmakers ask      to borrow EPA experts for their staffs, the EPA hastens to      comply. Requests from liberal Democrats almost always are      filled, those from Republicans rarely. A request by      Representative Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) for an EPA detailee      was rejected on Jan. 2, 1997 on the grounds that ``new      procedures'' were being written. Less than four weeks later      (Jan. 28), a similar request from liberal Democrat      Representative Charles Rangel of New York was approved,      without reference to any ``new procedures.''       Since 1995 her office has approved all requests for      employee details to four Democratic lawmakers--Senator Frank      Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.), Senator      Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) and Rangel. Of the four GOP      requests, three were rejected.       Browner was at her politically impressive best in this      summer's debate over the EPA's tougher clean air standards.      Because air quality levels have improved markedly since      passage of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, it was      widely hoped--especially in areas that badly need new jobs--     that the standards would not be further tightened. The EPA's      own data showed that levels of the particulates have dropped      dramatically over the past decade. Many local governments,      anxious for jobs and economic development, were looking      forward to being removed from the list of so-called      nonattainment areas for ozone and particulate matter, or PM.       In July the EPA finalized new tighter standards for ozone      and PM. For communities that had made expensive efforts to      comply with the current law, the higher standards were like a      baseball player, having rounded third base and heading toward      home, being told he had to circle the bases again to score.       A good many congresspeople were outraged. Browner's      insistence on imposing the new standards in the face of      nothing more than scanty scientific evidence unleashed howls      of protest from elected officials in the affected      communities.       Legally, Browner was probably in the right. In its haste to      seem to be attending to the environment, Congress failed to      exert control over EPA standards and regulations.       There was nonetheless quite a donnybrook, with veteran      Democrat John Dingell of Michigan leading the charge against      Browner. A lot of jobs were at stake in Michigan, still      headquarters of the U.S. auto industry. Congress, he      insisted, should be consulted. Dingell was not alone.       With lots of support from Vice President Al Gore's office,      Browner went to work putting down the congressional revolt.      Her testimony before Congress was, by general agreement,      brilliant, though her facts were often shaky.       Until then, Bill Clinton had remained on the sidelines. But      Browner maneuvered the President into a corner, where he      faced the politically embarrassing choice of supporting her      controversial initiatives or disavowing his outspoken EPA      administrator. Clinton then got to the head of the parade by      declaring his support for Browner. The game was over. Browner      1, Congress 0.       If EPA's new standards survive congressional and legal      challenges, state and local governments will have to devise      elaborate State Implementation Plans, or SIPs, detailing      their strategies for complying with the agency's latest      regulatory diktat. And in accordance with the Clean Air Act,      it will be up to the EPA to approve or disapprove the SIPs.      The estimated cost of compliance with the new standards for      the Chicago area alone is projected to be between $3 billion      and $7 billion.       ``I wish we never had that fight with Congress,'' she tells      Forbes. ``I wish it could have been avoided. I think it came      at great expense to the country. I think it was very      unfortunate.'' Note the implication: The way it could have      been avoided was for Congress to avoid challenging her.       You can admire Browner's skill and still be appalled by      what she is doing. ``This is by far the most politicized EPA      I've seen in my three decades of working in state      governments,'' says Russell J. Harding, director of      Michigan's Depatment of Environmental Quality. ``It is an      agency driven more by sound bites than by sound science.''       Says Barry McBee, chairman of the Texas Natural Resource      Conservation Commission: ``EPA continues to embody an      outdated attitude that Washington knows best, that only      Washington has the capability to protect our environment.      States are closer to the people they protect and closer to      the resources and can do a better job today.''       As a weapon to humble the state regulatory bodies, Carol      Browner's EPA has embraced the politically correct concept of      ``environmental justice.'' This broadens EPA's mandates even      beyond protection of everyone's health.       In early 1993 Browner set up the Office of Environmental      Justice within EPA which, among other things, passes out      taxpayer-funded grants for studying the effects of industrial      pollutants on poorer, mostly black, communities. In 1994 the      White House supported this initiative by ordering federal      agencies to consider the health and environmental effects of      their decisions on minority and low-income communities.       That's the rhetoric. The reality is that the federal      agencies have a new weapon for overruling state agencies.      Browner's EPA recently delayed the approval of a $700 million      polyvinyl chloride plant to be built by Japanese-owned      Shintech in the predominantly black southern Louisiana town      of Convent. Louisiana's Department of Environmental Quality      had already given the go-ahead; the plant would have created      good-paying jobs and opportunities in an area suffering from      60% unemployment and low incomes. But the EPA argued that      blacks would suffer disproportionately from potentially      cancer-causing emissions of the plant in an area already      lined with chemical factories of all descriptions.       Louisiana Economic Development Director Kevin Reilly was      enraged. ``It is demeaning and despicable for these people to      play the race card,'' he says, pointing out that poor people      and blacks would have gained economically and were at little      health risk. The scientific evidence bears Reilly out: A      recent article in the Journal of the Louisiana Medical      Society found that cancer incidence in the area is in most      cases no higher than nationally.       But never mind the facts: This kind of decision has less to      do with science than with power politics. It delivers the      message: Don't mess with the EPA. ``Carol Browner is the best      hardball player in the Clinton Administration,'' says Steven      J. Milloy, executive director of The Advancement of Sound      Science Coalition in Washington, a longtime critic of EPA who      acknowledges receiving funding from industry. ``She has the      105th Congress completely intimated by her debating skills      and her sheer grasp of facts, however questionable. She eats      their lunch.''       Like many Clintonites, Browner takes her own good time      about responding to congressional requests for EPA documents.      When word got out that EPA was developing a series of      proposals for reducing U.S. emissions of man-made greenhouse      gases, the House Commerce Committee asked for a copy. The EPA      ignored the request for two years.       When the proposals were leaked to the committee late last      week, it was immediately clear why EPA had stiffed Congress.      The document was loaded with proposals for raising taxes to      pay for new EPA initiatives. Produced in the agency's Office      of Policy, Planning & Evaluation and dated May 31, 1994,      EPA's ``Climate Change Action'' recommends a new 50-cent-per-     gallon gasoline tax, with an estimated cost to motorists of      $47 billion in the year 2000 alone. Seven other tax increases      were recommended: a ``greenhouse gas tax,'' a ``carbon      tax,'' a ``btu tax,'' an ``at-the-source ad-volorem tax''      on the value of the fuel at the source of extraction,     an ``end-use ad valorem tax'' on the value of the fuel at      the point of sale, a ``motor fuels tax'' on the retail      price of gasoline and diesel, an ``oil import fee.'' Also      recommended: A new federal fee on vehicle emissions tests      of $40 per person to ``shift the cost of vehicle      inspection from the state to the vehicle owner.''       How could they hope to get so many new taxes through a tax-     shy Congress? The ``Climate Change Action Plan'' contains      repeated references to how each of the above taxes and fees      can be imposed under existing laws. Talk about taxation      without representation.       It's not entirely surprising that Browner and her crew      think in terms of government-by-edict. Browner's      extraordinary power is in many ways a consequences of      Congress' delegation of its lawmaking power to the EPA. It      has let the agency micromanage environmental activities      throughout the nation with little regard for either local      wishes or the cost. This negligence has permitted the agency      to ignore scientific data that conflict with agency      orthodoxy. The EPA is in many ways becoming a state within      the state.       ``This is Washington at its worst--out-of-touch bureaucrats      churning out red tape with reckless abandon. The EPA hasn't      taken into account an ounce of reality,'' says Representative      Fred Upton (R-Mich.), a frequent critic, referring to the new      clean air rules.       If science isn't Browner's strong point, political tactics      are. Her enemies can only envy the way the EPA uses the      courts. An organization such as the Natural Resources Defense      Council will go into federal court and sue to force the EPA      to do something. The EPA will wink and, after the courts      expand its mandate, see to it that big legal fees go to the      NRDC.       Mission creep, in short, takes many forms and its      practitioners have many ways to plunder the public purse.       For her part, Browner often dismisses as simple male      chauvinism any criticism of her hardball tactics. ``I think      sometimes that it's an issue of men and women,'' she says,      coyly.       Such cute demagoguery aside, there is no doubting Browner's      sincerity. She is an environmentalist zealot. She was clearly      behind the decision to tighten the clean air standards to      what many people regard as unreasonable levels. If not a      tree-hugger she is philosophically close to Al Gore and his      quasi-religious environmentalism.       After graduating from University of Florida law school,      Browner (both of whose parents were college teachers) went to      work for a Ralph Nader-affiliated consumer advocate group.      There she met her husband, Michael Podhorzer, who still works      there.       She learned politics working on Gore's Senate staff, where      she rose to be his legislative director before heading back      to Florida to head the state environmental commission.       After the EPA, what's next for this tough and aggressive      politician? If Al Gore's presidential hopes aren't dashed by      the fund-raising scandals, there's vice presidential slot on      the Democratic ticket up for grabs in 2000. A female      environmentalist and mother of a young boy would do a lot to      bolster Gore's otherwise soggy appeal.       In a statement to Forbes, Gore went so far as to try to      claim for Browner some of the credit for the current economic      prosperity. ``She has helped prove,'' he declares, ``that a      healthy environmental and a strong economy are inextricably      linked.''       If not a vice presidential run, what? Could Browner be      nominated by the Clinton Administration to be the next head      of the United Nations' environment program? Or would the      Administration nominate her as the new U.N. Deputy Secretary      General? Either position would give Browner instant      international visibility, which couldn't hurt her political      prospects in Washington.       One way or another, you are going to be hearing a lot more      about Carol M. Browner; whenever you do, it's unlikely to be      good news for business--and it may not even be good news for      the environmental.
