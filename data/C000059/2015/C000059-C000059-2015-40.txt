It does not provide exceptions for critical, urgent, or compelling needs or allow for the consideration of mitigating factors.  I am concerned that this amendment would impose strict legal triggers and take away the ability for Federal agencies to investigate and determine appropriate remedies. I am also concerned that it would deny the due process that the current suspension and debarment system provides. And finally, this is an issue that should be thoroughly vetted through the authorization process, not through the appropriation process.  I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
