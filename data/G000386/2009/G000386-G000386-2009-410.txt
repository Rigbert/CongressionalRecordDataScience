 President, we all know the rest of this year in health care we have big things ahead of us. We know the bill before us today will make the difference for 4 million or so uninsured kids. So 4 million uninsured Americans down but 42 million uninsured Americans to go. That is not going to be an easy task. If we are going to reform our health care system to cover all Americans, if we are going to improve the quality of care to provide for all Americans, if we are going to bring down the cost of health care for all Americans, we need to work together.  If we are going to work together, we need to get a better understanding of what bipartisanship really means. It is not, we will write 90 percent of the bill together and ask the minority to vote for the last 10 percent, like it or not. It is not: here is the bill, does the minority want to sign off on it and let us call it bipartisan?  It is, frankly, very difficult for me to believe we can return to true bipartisanship. But we will finish this bill today, and then I am going to roll up my sleeves. I am going to sit down with the majority to try to improve our health care system for all Americans despite recent evidence that true bipartisanship is elusive here in the Senate.  I know the issues in front of us are too important for me to do anything less than my very best for all those Americans out there who expect us to solve the problems of the day and make a better America for tomorrow's children and all of us.
