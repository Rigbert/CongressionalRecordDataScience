 President, if I may further add to what the Senator said, for our part, we would like to have a very general rule that we would alternate back and forth, but it is also our belief on this side that we would give great deference to the other side to offer amendments, two Democratic or three Democratic amendments in order so we could be very flexible on that. We did want to reserve and provide some predictability to the order on the floor because there might be some Members on the Republican side who would like to offer an amendment, and they want some certainty when that would be done.
