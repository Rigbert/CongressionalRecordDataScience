President, I congratulate Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand for their work.  The distinguished senior Senator from New York is on the floor. I am delighted to see him, and I would ask, when he is finished, if he asks for a quorum call, if he might ask to have it charged against both sides equally.  I yield the floor.
