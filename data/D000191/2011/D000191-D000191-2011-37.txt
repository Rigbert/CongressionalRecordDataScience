Chairman, obviously we've straightened out that misunderstanding, that the folks could serve.  Now let me just harken back to something where I think many of my Republican colleagues agreed with me. I voted against the TARP bailout. Hank Paulson, as I said at the time, I think he was Goldman Sachs's executive standing in as Secretary of the Treasury and meting out justice to some of his competitors in terms of who lived and who died on Wall Street.  So I would think there would be agreement on that side that for future conflicts of interest that these people would be restricted only on that one vote, only as it affects their former employer, only within the last 24 months.                              {time}  1700  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Massachusetts.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 2\1/2\ minutes.
