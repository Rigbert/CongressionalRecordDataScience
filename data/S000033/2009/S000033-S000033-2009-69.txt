 President, as you know, today the Social Security Administration announced there will be no COLA, or cost of living increase, next year for more than 50 million seniors. That is the first time in 35 years that situation has occurred, and it worries me very much.  About a month ago, I introduced legislation which the occupant of the chair is a cosponsor of, along with Senators Leahy, Dodd, Stabenow, Begich, and Casey.  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski and Senator Tom Udall as cosponsors of S. 1685.
