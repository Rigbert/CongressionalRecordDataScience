lenn Beck, and they included 16--pardon me, 7 of these so-called czars are people who have--pardon me, 9 have been confirmed by the Senate. So it appears that some of your colleagues do not share your definition that Senator Collins referred to on the floor.  The point I am trying to make is that this is a legitimate inquiry, it is an important inquiry, but it has been muddled by statements made by some Members of Congress and certainly by those in the political commentary realm.  The good news for Senator Alexander and Senator Collins and everyone else concerned about this issue is that a trusted friend and colleague, Senator Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, has promised a hearing on this issue. I know he will engage Senator Collins, as ranking Republican member, on it, and serious questions which have been presented will be considered by Senator Lieberman. We respect him in that capacity.  So the reason I am objecting to this amendment isn't because I don't think Senator Collins has at least a legitimate inquiry, but I think it should be taken in the greater order of things rather than considered in this fashion on an appropriations bill.  So, Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Collins amendment, No. 2498, violates rule XVI, paragraph 4, legislating on an appropriations bill.  Excuse me, Mr. President, I missed one procedural step.  I call for regular order on the pending Collins amendment.
