Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ``Criminal Code Modernization and Simplification Act of 2006.''  This measure revises the criminal code to update, simplify and consolidate many of the criminal provisions in Title 18 of the United States Code. It has been over 50 years since the criminal code was last revised. The existing criminal code is riddled with provisions that are either outdated or simply inconsistent with more recent modifications to reflect today's modern world.  As my term as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee comes to a close, I am introducing this measure to begin the dialogue and process for rewriting the criminal code. It is my hope that this bill will trigger a dialogue and input from other interested parties to develop a more comprehensive re-write. Further, it is my hope that a careful review of the code will lead to even more of a reduction in the ``federalization'' of what many consider local crimes. I am well aware that federal prosecutions constitute only 7 percent of the criminal prosecutions nationwide. We need to ensure that the federal role continues to be limited and that the State and local offenses are not subsumed within an ever expanding criminal code.  Through the years, the criminal code has grown with more and more criminal provisions, some of which are antiquated or redundant, some of which poorly drafted, some of which have not been used in the last 30 years, and some of which are unnecessary since the crime is already covered by existing criminal provisions.  This bill cuts over \1/3\ of the existing criminal code; reorganizes the criminal code to make it more user-friendly; and consolidates criminal offenses from other titles so that title 18 includes all major criminal provisions (e.g., drug crimes in title 21, aviation offenses and hijacking in title 49).  In redrafting the criminal code, I applied several drafting principles: (1) added a uniform set of definitions for the entire title; (2) revised the intent requirements to apply a consistent definition of intent in response to Supreme Court criticisms of intent requirements for criminal offenses; (3) eliminated excess language that confuses, or potentially complicates, use of a criminal statute; and (4) added new headings to make the code more user friendly.  I attempted to the extent possible to make these changes policy neutral; however, two general policy changes were made: (1) attempts and conspiracies to commit criminal offenses are generally punished in the same manner as the substantive offense unless specifically stated otherwise; and (2) criminal and civil forfeiture and restitution provisions were consolidated unless a more specific policy was adopted for a crime.  I wanted to take a moment to thank the Legislative Counsel's Office and in particular Doug Bellis, the Deputy Counsel of that Office, who devoted substantial efforts to preparing this bill and should be commended for his extraordinary efforts.  I recognize that additional input from outside interested parties will be needed, and look forward to working with other Members, the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Treasury Department and other parties on this worthwhile project.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1922]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]       CRIMINAL CODE MODERNIZATION AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2006                                 ______                                                     HON.
