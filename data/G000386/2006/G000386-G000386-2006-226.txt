 President, this amendment represents a bipartisan effort to create an effective, workableemployment verification system. Without a workable verification system, there is no point in having a bill dealing with immigration.  The amendment balances the needs of workers, employers, and immigration enforcement. The amendment would replace the current paper I-9 process with a new electronic verification system. This new system would allow employers to verify the legal status of their workers within 3 days of being hired. If the system cannot verify a worker's employment authorization, the employer would be notified and the worker must be discharged. If the system fails to operate as intended and a legitimate worker is erroneously discharged, the worker could be compensated by the Government for lost wages.  I understand that some of my colleagues believe that further changes are needed with respect to this provision, which would allow a worker who loses his job through no fault of his own to recover lost wages. I will continue to work with them, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee with jurisdiction over the provisions in this amendment, on this issue and the questions they have in subsequent conference with the House of Representatives. I believe this amendment must move forward, so I urge my colleagues to support it.  I yield the floor.
