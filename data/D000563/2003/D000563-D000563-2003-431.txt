Is it not also true that we have to look beyond these detainees to how we as Americans would be treated in other countries, whether we are establishing a standard which we could live by?  In other words, I am asking the Senator from New Mexico if we believe that we can detain individuals, without disclosure of who they are, and the circumstances of their detention, does that not invite the same conduct against Americans or service men and women overseas and give the United States little or no room to complain?  I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he is not asking for us to stand up for some basic elements of due process which we would ask to be afforded to Americans in similar situations.
