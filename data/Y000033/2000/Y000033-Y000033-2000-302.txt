Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I want to thank my friend for his remarks, and I appreciate his concerns about this issue.  The gentleman and I have spoken on this subject previously, and I know it is an important issue for him as the citizens for Alabama. As I mentioned to him previously, I will continue to work to find an acceptable resolution with him and other interested Members, but I believe the right time to address this issue is during the conference with our colleagues in the other body.  The gentleman from Alabama has my assurance that we will keep his concerns in mind as we move this important legislation through the process.
