President, yesterday Senator Graham and I introduced a bill to establish a National Commission on the Future of the Army, an independent panel that will bear the responsibility of analyzing some major changes to the U.S. Army that were proposed in the President's budget. The Army's budget for Fiscal Year 2015 sets a path toward major, irreversible changes to Army capacity and capability, particularly in the Army National Guard and Army Reserves, that cannot be ignored by the Congress.  Senator Graham, my fellow co-chair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, has said repeatedly that these changes fundamentally alter what it means for the National Guard to be a combat reserve of the Army. The changes would also render the Nation's operational reserve insufficient in its ability to retain gains in experience and readiness that the reserve has achieved over a decade of continuous deployment. Most dramatically, these changes would transfer all of the National Guard's AH-64 Apaches to the active component, leaving the Nation without any combat reserves for one of the aircraft most essential to ground operations.  But the changes that the President's budget proposal would begin to make next year go much deeper. They would eventually reduce the Nation's Army National Guard to 315,000 soldiers, the fewest in decades. The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Odierno, testified before the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense that this number is too low.  General Odierno said that, at that level, if any of our assumptions about future conflict were wrong--that is unless operations were short, decisive, and did not require significant sustainability--then we would not be prepared. Our Nation's defense would be ill-prepared for future conflicts in the mold of past conflicts like Afghanistan, Iraq, Vietnam, or Korea.  No one needs to be reminded of the tight fiscal constraints our government currently faces, and that sequestration, unfortunately, remains the law of the land. Simply barring any changes from taking place in America's Army is not an option. The legislation that Senator Graham and I propose will allow several of the Army's proposed cost-avoidance measures to move forward, while permitting time for a commission to study the major and truly controversial changes that have been proposed.  In addition to tasking the commission with considering overall size and force mix of the Army, this legislation calls for an evaluation of force generation assumptions. That is because the policies put into place during 13 years of war are not the same as those that will be needed post-drawdown, and determining the right modifications is essential to planning for the use and structure of the Army of the next decade.  Congress, under the authorities granted by the Constitution, has a responsibility to both raise and equip armies, and to regulate that portion of the militia which is called into Federal Service. When a budget proposal makes changes in those areas that are as considerable as these, it is entirely appropriate for Congress to hit the pause button and to ask for a second look.  We look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we properly balance and size the Army, and that we do not repeat past mistakes by needlessly discarding the depth of our forces.                          ____________________
