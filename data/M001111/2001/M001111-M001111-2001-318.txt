 President, I thank Senator Kennedy for his work on class size, too. I saw the article in the Washington Post today. It shows that the debate we are about to have on the class size amendment is extremely critical. We know it makes a difference in our children's classrooms. We have had tremendous progress.  I hope that our colleagues will listen carefully to the debate as we bring it forward because it is an important part of education. It is what parents are looking for. It is what we are demanding of our students--achievement.  I appreciate the words of the Senator from Massachusetts, and I look forward to the debate we are about to have.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors to my amendment: Senators Baucus, Biden, Bingaman, Clinton, Corzine, Dodd, Feingold, Harkin, Kennedy, Reed of Rhode Island, and Wellstone.
