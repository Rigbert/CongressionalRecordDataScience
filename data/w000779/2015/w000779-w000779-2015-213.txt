President, I wish to honor an icon in Oregon's legal community and a long-time friend who passed away on March 1. Dick Ginsburg was a long-time resident of the small Washington County community of Cornelius, and a founding member of the Oregon chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, AILA. Dick was one of those rare human beings who brought both reason and compassion to every issue on which he worked. And I know everyone who met Dick will always remember his engaging smile, his joyful enthusiasm and that infectious laughter--regardless of the issue.  Dick often referred to the lifelong impact he felt from his experience in the Peace Corps in Paraguay, surely much of it attributable to his loving wife of 40 years who he met there, Rosalia. Along with their wonderful children, Brian and Laura, the Ginsburg family was always exceptionally generous and created an extended family, not only in Oregon, but everywhere he went.  As a friend during my early days at Legal Aid, Dick showed himself to be a thoughtful, compassionate, and dedicated lawyer. He understood the intricacies of immigration law and devoted his life to making it work with equal justice for businesses and people alike.  While Dick will be remembered by all whose lives he touched, I will especially remember my friend as a mentor, a guiding force, and one of those people who made the world a better place just for being here.                          ____________________
