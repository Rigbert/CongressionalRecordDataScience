President, I just wanted to make it clear to myself and others what we are facing here; that is, there would be only one vote we would have on the resolution that was passed in the House, which I feel I could not vote for because it is nonbinding--it is, again, to support the troops but not the mission, which I think is certainly unique in regards to how people feel about this--and that, basically, the McCain resolution, which I support, which sets out the benchmarks to give to General Petraeus and to give to Prime Minister Maliki to gain some kind of catalyst or effort that would say: Look, this is where the Senate stands, and hopefully we can get these things done so that we can see some progress, to see if it is possible to achieve some security in Iraq and give that Government a political settlement. And the second amendment I am talking about is the one of Senator Gregg, as I understand it.
