 President, for the information of all Senators, we have had very good cooperation. We are working this list down. I have another unanimous consent request. I believe most of these will go by voice vote, and I appreciate everybody's cooperation.        Amendments Nos. 624, 295, 232, 538, 412, and 340 En Bloc  I ask unanimous consent that the next amendments in order to be called up be the following: Johanns No. 624, Corker No. 295, Burr No. 232, Wicker No. 538, Coburn No. 412, and Shelby No. 340; that there be no second-degree amendments in order prior to the votes in relation to any of these amendments; that notwithstanding all time having expired on the resolution, there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote and that all the votes be 10-minute votes; that upon disposition of the Shelby amendment No. 340, the next amendment in order be an amendment from the majority; and I ask unanimous consent they be reported en bloc.
