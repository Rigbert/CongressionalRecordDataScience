 The events of September 11 prompted multiple reviews of the security at all federal facilities. These reviews have highlighted a number of measures that need to be taken to improve the safety for employees and visitors at federal facilities.  One important item that has been brought to our attention is the potential volatility of a storage facility located in the heart of Washington, near the national Mall. The National Museum of Natural History is recognized internationally as a premier museum and research facility. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of specimens are currently stored in 730,000 gallons of highly flammable alcohol.  I commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for including $2 million to begin design for a new facility that would safely store the specimens and do so in a location that is away from such a high traffic area. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
