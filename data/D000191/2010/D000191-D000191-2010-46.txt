The Republicans are attempting to pretzel into a debate honoring the heroes of World War II, the Greatest Generation, those who liberated the Pacific Rim, those who gave their lives, those who climbed Mount Suribachi against all odds and raised the American flag so bravely, and they are trying to pretzel into the debate some pretty strange things. Let me address a couple.  First, we had the gentleman talking about threats to veterans' health care. There will be nothing in the legislation, the health care legislation, that in any way impinges upon the healthcare that our veterans have earned. The gentleman is fully aware that in the House bill, which was thoughtfully written, that that was mentioned and fully protected.  I am not going to apologize for the bipartisan, and it is bipartisan, total incompetence of the United States Senate. I am not going to apologize for that. But we passed a resolution here today to make clear what our intent was, and what will be in the law: veterans' health care benefits fully protected.  While I am on the subject of veterans' health care benefits, I saw the former Chair of the Veterans' Committee here on the floor, and I would remind people, we need a sense of history. There was a year in the Bush administration, after repeated cuts to the veterans' budget, when they were running out of money in June when the Republicans controlled the House, the Senate, and the White House. And it was the Democrats who came to the floor and said we need $2 billion more immediately to deliver on our obligations to our veterans. And there was a brave guy, he is a Republican, Chris Smith from New Jersey, he was the chairman of the Veterans' Committee, and he voted with the Democrats. And you know what the Republican leadership did? They stripped him of his chairmanship for his advocacy for veterans, and they put that other gentleman who just spoke previously in the chair in his stead.
