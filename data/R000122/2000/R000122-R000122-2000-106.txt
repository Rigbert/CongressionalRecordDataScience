President, I rise today to join Cambodian-Americans in celebration of the Cambodian New Year, Chol Chnam, one of the major celebrations of the Cambodian culture. Over the next three days there will be gatherings across the United States to celebrate the beginning of the Year of the Dragon. I take this opportunity to wish all of these people a very happy New Year.  The Cambodian New Year represents more than just a renewal of the calendar and traditional end of the harvest, it is also a celebration of faith. Entry into the New Year, or Maha Sangkrant, is marked by the sounding of a bell. With the sounding, it is believed that the New Angel arrives. Throughout the day people participate in ceremonies and bring food to the Buddhist monks and religious leaders. The second day of celebration, or Vana Bat, is a time to show consideration for others. Gifts are given to parents, grandparents and teachers as a show of respect and charity is offered to the less fortunate. The third day, or LoengSak, includes more religious ceremonies and rituals to bring good luck and happiness to families.  In my home state of Rhode Island there are numerous businesses owned by Cambodian-American families, most of them in the capital city Providence. These establishments contribute much to the local economy.  The Cambodian New Year is an appropriate time to remind all Americans why we must support the political and economic stabilization of Cambodia. As the nation continues to recover from three decades of civil conflict, including the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, it is critical that the United States and international community aid the Cambodian people in their efforts to build a lasting democracy.  Therefore, on this day marking the beginning of Chol Chnam, I encourage all U.S. citizens to join in the spirit of this special holiday.                          ____________________
