Mr. Speaker, I join my fellow colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to salute and pay tribute to Kathleen Battle, a lyrical legend whose contribution to the spirit of music is beyond measure.  In classic, poetic soprano, Kathleen Battle has captivated millions through her performances around the world. The purity and projection of her voice has earned her broad acclaim as one of the premier vocalists of all time. Her range travels through the era of Baroque and into the realm of folk and contemporary jazz.  Kathleen Battle has distinguished herself as one of the finest interpreters of Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti. Her performances are often described as ``spellbinding'' or ``euphoric'' as she takes listeners to the seat of her own soul, refusing to return them until the last chord.  Kathleen Battle's melodic, mesmorizing voice has been featured with the world's most acclaimed orchestras and conductors including Levine, Solti, Ozawa, Previn and Maazell. She is a frequent guest at the festivals of Salzburg, Ravinia and Tanglewood, and has toured extensively in recital across the United States, Canada, Europe and the Far East. She performs regularly at the Metropolitan Opera in New York as well as at the opera houses of Vienna, Paris, San Francisco, Chicago and the Royal Opera House Covent Garden.  Appearing in concert and recording with some of the world's most renowned musicians, including violinist Itzhak Perlman, flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal, and tenors Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo, Kathleen Battle is a brilliant collaborative artist and favorite among the best of the best. Hers is a language of passion . . . raw emotion on stage that cannot be paralleled.  Keen musical sensitivity and introspective interpretation have won Kathleen Battle three Grammy Awards. She is truly one of the most distinguished recording artists of all time, having released complete opera, concert, choral and solo recital albums.  Kathleen Battle has left an indelible imprint on the hearts of her fans and the souls of musicians to come. Today, we honor this great American, but the legacy of her music will live forever.                          ____________________
