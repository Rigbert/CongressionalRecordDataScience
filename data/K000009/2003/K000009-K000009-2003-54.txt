 Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, last week during consideration of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, I spoke of how this administration and this Congress are making a choice between tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and other pressing priorities.  As a member of the subcommittee, I know that the programs in this bill represent many of these vital priorities supporting our farmers, revitalizing our rural communities, and helping the most needy in our country meet their most basic nutritional needs, and safeguarding our food supply. Yet as a result of the budget allocation given to our subcommittee, the bill includes a nearly 5 percent decrease in funding for agriculture, America's leading domestic industry which brings approximately $2.1 billion into my State of Connecticut's economy and provides 50,000 jobs for Connecticut each year.  One of the most critical things we do in this bill is ensure the safety of our Nation's food supply; 76 million Americans become sick and 5,000 people die every year from food-borne illness. At a time when there have been record amounts of recalls and ongoing concerns about USDA performance and the integrity of our food supply, this bill underfunds food inspection by $12 million.  Last week we found out that imported meat inspections have gone down from 17 to 6 percent in the last year.                              {time}  1545  This bill is headed in the wrong direction.  In addition, this bill prevents implementation of country-of-origin labeling for meat and meat products. Country-of-origin labeling gives people the information that they need to make an informed choice to protect the safety of their families. Thirty-five other countries we trade with, including Canada, Mexico and members of the European Union, already have a country-of-origin labeling system in place.  And American families recognize the need for this labeling. People say that they are willing to pay more to know where their food is coming from. At a time when food imports are increasingbut the number of inspections of imported meat is decreasing, consumers deserve that right to know where their food is coming from. Given the record 56 million pounds of recalled meat last year, again, that is 56 million pounds of recalled meat, this effort is also about being able to trace back contaminated product in the event of a recall. Knowing the source of an outbreak is a critical part of that process so that we can quickly take action to prevent people from getting sick.  Country-of-origin labeling will not violate trade agreements or lead to retaliation. It will not bankrupt the food industry. It will simply let consumers know where their food is coming from. I hope my colleagues will support the Rehberg-Hooley amendment to remove this provision from the bill.  I am also concerned that the WIC program, which helps ensure that the nutritional needs of women and children are met, may not be funded sufficiently in this bill. That leaves no room for error. If the need increases, if food or infant formula prices increase, there will be no funds available to help those who depend the most on the program.  Another priority is prescription drugs, which are increasing on average at a rate of 20 percent annually. The generic drugs program at FDA helps us address those concerns by speeding the approval of affordable drugs. Yet this bill underfunds that program by $5 million, in addition to underfunding the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the patient safety and adverse reporting initiative. All are critically important to ensuring the health and safety of every American.  Mr. Chairman, budgets reveal priorities. They reveal values. This bill includes agencies and programs charged with some of our most important responsibilities, many of which protect and oversee the public health. Now is not the time to choose tax cuts for the wealthy over these vital priorities. We must do better. Failure is not an option.
