President, every year in April, we pause to observe National Crime Victims' Rights Week, and this year marks its 35th anniversary. Since 1981, in communities across the Nation, people have observed this week with candlelight vigils and public rallies to renew our commitment to crime victims and their families. Vermonters have always banded together to help crime victims and their families. That is just who we are, and I am proud of that long tradition. It is vitally important that we continue to recognize the needs of these survivors and work together to promote victims' rights and services.  One of our most important tools to do so is the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 and the crime victims fund that it created. I strongly supported passage of this critical legislation, which has been the principal means through which the Federal Government has supported essential services for crime victims and their families for more than three decades. It is time to review and renew that law, and I have been working closely with Senator Grassley in that effort. Next week, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to assess the crime victims fund and discuss how to ensure that it continues to meet the changing needs of victims.  The Justice for All Act is another important law that promotes victims' rights. I am working with Senator Cornyn to reauthorize this vital legislation. Our bill will further strengthen the rights of crime victims; improve the use of forensic evidence, including rape kits, to provide justice as swiftly as possible; and protect the innocent by improving access to post-conviction DNA testing.  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act builds on the work I began in 2000, when I introduced the Innocence Protection Act, which sought to ensure that defendants in the most serious cases receive competent representation and, where appropriate, access to post-conviction DNA testing. I served proudly as a prosecutor in Vermont for 8 years, and I believe that we must find those responsible for crimes and prosecute them. But we must also ensure that our system does not wrongly convict those who are innocent. DNA testing is often necessary to prove the innocence of individuals in cases where the system got it grievously wrong. ``Innocent until proven guilty'' is a hallmark of our criminal justice system, but when a person who has been found guilty is truly innocent, we cannot stand idly by. We must act to exonerate that person.  The Innocence Protection Act passed as part of the original Justice for All Act in 2004, and since that time, atleast 26 people have been exonerated through DNA testing funded by the legislation. In North Carolina, for example, a man was released after spending 37 years in prison for a double murder he did not commit. In Virginia, a man was released after spending 27 years in prison for violent rapes he did not commit. And in New Orleans, a man was released after spending 20 years in a State mental health hospital for an abduction and rape he did not commit. We must continue funding this critical post-conviction DNA testing since we know our system does not always get it right. It is an outrage when an innocent person is wrongly punished, and this injustice is compounded when the true perpetrator remains on the streets, able to commit more crimes. We are all less safe when the system gets it wrong.  As we begin this year's Crime Victims' Rights Week, I look forward to working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to update and reauthorize both the Victims of Crime Act and the Justice for All Reauthorization Act. Survivors and their families deserve nothing less.                          ____________________
