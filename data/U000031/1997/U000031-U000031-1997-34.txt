Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated and devoted community leader and a dear friend, Mr. Harold Schuitmaker of Paw Paw, MI. Harold has been very active in our community, lending his hand wherever he can to help our neighbors. As a Rotarian, United Way board member, an Elk, an advocate for children, an active member of his church, Harold has always been there for the community of Paw Paw.  I talked to a few of our neighbors, and they all agree when it comes tothis community Harold has never said no. In fact, I first got to know Harold through his fine work with the child and family services organization.  Harold has also been an active leader in our Republican Party. For as long as anyone can remember he has been at the helm of the Republican Party in the Sixth District serving as its Chair, and at convention after convention, whether it be on the local, State, or national level, Harold has exhibited the kind of leadership that is both admired as well as respected.  But his efforts are about a lot more than just working for today. One of the indelible images of Harold that sticks out in everyone's mind is him holding his 2-year-old grandson Jordan at every event, the get-togethers, Harold brings his grandson Jordan. He starts early showing the next generation what leadership and service and dedication are all about, and he also helps to remind us what we are working for as well here in this House.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Harold for all his efforts. I would also like to thank a special woman in his life and for everyone's life for that matter, Zoe, for her dedication. Thanks, Harold. The whole community joins me in thanking you for your fine work. You have made a difference for all of us.                          ____________________
