President, I would very much like to work on an energy policy in a bipartisan way. I think we all understand that the only way to get anything important done in Washington, DC, is to work in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, the same Bush administration that so tragically bungled the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita has now bungled its way to $3-a-gallon gasoline. And in particular, I am concerned that all of the evidence showed that this spring we would have these problems.
