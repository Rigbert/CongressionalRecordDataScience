 President, I rise to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who has become a hero to many in my home state and across the country for his honest and moving portrayal of life in southeastern Kentucky. I am speaking of Jimmy Rose, the man from Pineville who has risen to fame this summer for his appearances on the television show ``America's Got Talent'' and his performance of the hit song ``Coal Keeps the Lights On.''  Last night, millions of Americans tuned in to see Jimmy's performance in the final round of the competition, held in New York City. I know I speak for thousands of Kentuckians when I say that no matter what the outcome tonight, he is truly a winner in our hearts, and his original song is a winner with people all over.  Jimmy is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who learned how to play guitar from a fellow marine while deployed in Iraq. He has worked as a coal miner and he himself wrote the song ``Coal Keeps the Lights On'' to raise awareness about how excessive regulations are hurting jobs in his hometown and in the coal industry.  Coal is part of a vital energy sector in the State of Kentucky. But Jimmyis tired of seeing coal mining jobs disappear from Pineville, from his native Bell County, and from the region. I agree with him, 100 percent.  From Jimmy's first appearance on ``America's Got Talent'' earlier this summer, he became a phenomenon. People could identify with the words he sang, and they could identify with his courteous disposition and steadfast character as the trademarks of the people of southeastern Kentucky. Fans across the country have happily supported, voted for, and sung along with Jimmy Rose.  I commend Jimmy Rose for putting a face on a problem that is all too often overlooked by some in Washington--the plight of the coal miner and the many hard-working Kentuckians whose jobs are related to the coal industry. In these difficult economic times, we should be doing everything we can to protect these jobs and protect a way of life for thousands of families.  I think Jimmy's message is an important one. And I want to congratulate Jimmy Rose for all his success to date. I am certain that we will be hearing much more from him in the years to come.                          ____________________
