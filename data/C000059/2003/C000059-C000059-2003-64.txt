Speaker, the Survivor Benefit Plan was, at one time, a good plan intended to provide for surviving spouses of veterans. Unfortunately, that intention has been lost.  Now surviving spouses are experiencing the reality of a one-third drop in benefits when they turn 62 and Congress has yet to take any action on rectifying this wrong.  Well, the time has come for Congress to step up to the plate and provide for our veterans what we already provide to our federal civilian retirees.  I believe the message of this tragic inequality is best conveyed by those who must live with it. I would like to read a statement from a constituent of mine from Riverside, California, Mrs. Marilyn T. Owsley about her experience with the Survivor Benefit Plan:       My husband would turn over in his grave had he known what      was happening to me with his annuity. He chose SBP for me to      have a decent income along with his Social Security. Also, he      liked the idea of this annuity because you get a cost of      living increase each year where other types of annuities did      not. Together with his Social Security and the SBP annuity, I      manage. I rent my apartment and pray they don't increase the      rent too much each year. I gave up driving my 1983 Chevy as      it was too costly to keep up with repairs and insurance. I      have to depend on someone else to go to the store or the      doctor. If not for my children, I don't know what I would do.      I will be 78 years old on October 9, 2003. They say the      Golden Years are good. I say my gold turned to rust. I pray      every night the government will do something about this      problem of the annuity reduction.  Let's return the benefits to the Survivor Benefit Plan and keep our word to the millions of veterans who, in good faith, signed up for this plan with the expectation of taking care of their loved ones after they passed.                          ____________________
