Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  If I hear what the gentleman just said, my interpretation is that we don't expect anything next week, but that does not mean that we don't expect something in the future. Is that a correct reading of it?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. That is correct.
