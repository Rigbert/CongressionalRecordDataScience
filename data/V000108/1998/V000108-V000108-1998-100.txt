Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate an exceptionally talented and dedicated member of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Justin R. Wolf. A senior at Lake Central High School, Justin was recently named as a Finalist in the Imation Computer Arts Scholarship Program.  This program, announced last year by the Imation Corporation in partnership with the National Art Education Association and the American Association of School Administrators, honors high school students who create original works of computer generated art. This scholarship program is a unique approach to encouraging the use of technology and creativity in the arts today. Of over 1,200 students around the country who participated in this year's program, only twenty-five, including Justin, were honored as finalists. Each finalist received a $1,000 scholarship, a trophy for his or her school, and an all-expense-paid trip with a parent, guardian, or school representative to St. Paul, Minnesota for a national recognition event.  In earning this scholarship, Justin has taken his art from the realm of personal enjoyment to the bright lights of national recognition. Indeed, rather than looking for recognition, Justin began utilizing his artistic talents only for personal enjoyment. Like many young people with artistic talent, Justin's interests have often changed throughout his life and still remain broad and eclectic. As a young student, he expressed himself through sketching and drawing in his spare time. Fueled more by daydream and stream of conscious thought than a specific inspiration, Justin's idle artwork became much more when his talent was wedded to a computer. When his dual interests of art and computers mixed, Justin's gift became evident. However, Justin's interests are not just limited to computer art and design, but include computer graphics, internet web page design, and concept art.  Indeed, one of Justin Wolf's current endeavors includes a web page design company. With his high school days counting down to graduation, Justin is ready for the challenge of higher education. He will begin summer classes this month at Columbia College in Chicago, Illinois. His goal is to pursue a film major and put the justly deserved scholarship to use in learning about film, computer graphic design, desktop publishing, animation, and special effects.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Justin R. Wolf for his well earned scholarship in the Imation Computer Arts Scholarship Program. This young man's ability, excellence, and budding future are a shining example of the abilities of today's young people when given the proper opportunities for scholastic, artistic, or athletic excellence.                          ____________________
