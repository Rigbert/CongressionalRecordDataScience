Although I could quote about 10 of them, I think my point is made by these four. One Senator said:       I am gravely concerned about the information provided us      just yesterday that the President received a warning in      August about the threat of hijackers by Osama bin Laden and      his organization. It clearly raises some very important      questions that have to be asked and have to be answered.  Another Senator said:       We have learned something today that raises a number of      serious questions. We have learned that President Bush had      been informed last year before September 11 of a possible      plot by those associated with Osama bin Laden to hijack a      U.S. airline.  Another Senator:       I don't know, again, what he knew and what the White House      knew and when they knew it and what they did about it . . .       . . . but if prior information had been warnings were there      . . .  Another Member on the floor said:       Yet we have had the gnawing question: was there something      that could have been done to prevent the attacks on September      11?  I am very proud of the Senator occupying the chair now because he refrained from trying to engage in this type of political activity.  What do all four Members who made these statements on the floor of the House and Senate have in common? They are all four running for President of the United States. It is unconscionable that anyone would imply our God-fearing President, George W. Bush, might have known something about this and not done everything he could to prevent it. This is simply politics at its worst.                               Exhibit 1                        Demagoguing September 11       Just a few days ago, Democrats on Capitol Hill seemed quite      eager to make political hay out of news reports suggesting      that President Bush might have known in advance about the      September 11 attacks. Prominent Democrats like Sens. Tom      Daschle, Hillary Rodham Clinton and House Minority Leader      Dick Gephardt have loudly demanded investigations into what      the administration knew about the possibility that terrorists      were preparing to attack the United States.       By Sunday, however, some of the harshest Democratic critics      were clearly having second thoughts about such a brazen      attempt to use September 11 to score political points against      Mr. Bush. ``I never, ever thought that anybody, including the      president, did anything up to September 11 other than their      best,'' Mr. Gephardt said. This is a politically prudent move      on Mr. Gephardt's part. Given the abysmal performance of the      Clinton administration in combatting terrorism during the      1990s, it would be a huge mistake for Democrats to attempt to      gain political mileage by blaming September 11 on President      Bush.       Time and time again, the Clinton White House tried to avoid      taking firm steps against Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda and      other terrorist groups that have targeted the United States.      As David Horowitz noted on The Washington Times' op-ed page      yesterday, the Clinton administration did nothing in response      to al Qaeda's February 1993 bombing of the World Trade      Center, in which six persons were killed and nearly 1,000      wounded. Moreover, President Clinton and his aides sought to      play down the fact that the mastermind of the attack was      Ramzi Youssef, an Iraqi intelligence agent. Journalist Andrew      Sullivan quotes Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos as saying      that the Clinton administration ignored the implications of      the WTC attack because ``it wasn't a successful bombing.''       Nine months later in Somalia, Mohammed Farah Aideed's      militiamen, who were trained by al Qaeda, killed 18 American      soldiers and dragged their bodies through the streets of      Mogadishu. Mr. Clinton's response was to end the U.S.-led      humanitarian mission in Somalia and send veteran diplomat      Robert Oakley to negotiate surrender terms. In June 1996, 19      American servicemen were killed when al Qaeda joined forces      with the Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah to bomb the      Khobar Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis      refused to cooperate with FBI agents sent to investigate the      matter, so Washington just forgot about it. Mr. Sullivan      notes that in October, a former Clinton administration      official told The Washington Post that, had Mr. Clinton made      a serious effort to rein in al Qaeda then, ``We probably      would have never seen a September 11.''       In 1998, as Mr. Clinton was preparing to inform the nation      of his affair with Monica Lewinsky, al Qaeda killed 224      persons in bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.      So Mr. Clinton responded by firing 75 missiles at suspected      bin Laden training camps in Afghanistan (bin Laden escaped      unharmed) and to mistakenly destroy a ``nerve gas factory''      in Khartoum which was actually making pharmaceutical      products. Two years later, the United States did nothing of      consequence in response to the bombing of the USS Cole in      Yemen, in which 17 Americans died. ``Clearly, not enough was      done'' to combat terrorism during the Clinton years, former      Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick acknowledged shortly      after the September 11 attacks. Mrs. Gorelick added that even      though President Clinton doubled the size of the FBI's      counterterrorism budget, the bureau was so slow to hire      agents that the money was never used.       As for Mrs. Clinton, investigative journalist Steven      Emerson notes that she and her husband ``repeatedly wined and      dined at the White House'' members of the American Muslim      Council (AMC), including Abdulrahman Alamoudi, an apologist      for Hamas, which has repeatedly denied it is a terrorist      group. The AMC, Mr. Emerson adds, provided talking points for      Mrs. Clinton's syndicated newspaper column and speeches and      was even permitted to organize a reception for itself at the      White House. In short, the Democrats are in no position to      smear Mr. Bush on September 11 or terrorist in general.                          ____________________
