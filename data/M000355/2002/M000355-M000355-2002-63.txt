 This action was taken by the conferees in recognition of the important role independent media will play in improving democracy in Pakistan. I am aware of the excellent work that has been done by Internews in this area and urge that their experience be used in the development of this project.  I also want to note that the agreement includes report language encouraging the United States Agency for International Development and the Department of State to provide $1 million for programs and activities that provide professional training for journalists from the Middle East. My colleagues and the Administration should know that Internews and Western Kentucky University have jointly conducted similar training for journalists from Indonesia and Southeast Asia. This has been a very successful partnership, and I expect that funding provided in the supplemental bill will be used to expand these efforts to the Middle East, particularly Egypt.
