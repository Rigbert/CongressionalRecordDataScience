I will wrap up only by quoting the foremost authority on Senate rules who served as majority leader of the 95th, 96th and 100th Congresses; that is, our friend and colleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd. In chapter 28, ``Reflections of a Party Leader,'' volume 2 of his publication in the Senate, Senator Byrd wrote:       To me, the Senate's rules were to be used when necessary to      advance and to expedite the Senate's business.  Giving the sunshine hold a place in the Senate's rules, creating sunshine holds so as to ensure that there is new openness and new accountability in the way the Senate does its business, seems to me to be an ideal way for the Senate to honor those eloquent words of Senator Byrd.  We have not been successful today, despite the best effort of Chairman Lott, Senator Grassley, and others. But we will be back. This practice is continuing to increase. Even when I came to the Senate, I found it used frequently but not to the extent it is being used today. It is time to do the public's business in public. We will stay at this effort to accomplish just that.  I yield the floor.
