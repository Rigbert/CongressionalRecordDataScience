 President, let me say to my good friend, the majority leader, I concur with his observations about how the Senate should appropriately work. I think we have had a process for handling legislation this year that both sides can be proud of, and I wish to say I concur entirely with his observations about the way the Senate is working.  Obviously, the minority does not agree with a lot of the things we are doing, but the opportunity to shape legislation and for each Senator to make a difference has been respected this year, and for that I commend the majority leader.                          ____________________
