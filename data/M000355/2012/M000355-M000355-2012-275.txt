 President, I rise today in honor of a devoted and loyal serviceman from the UnitedState Navy: Mr. Martin Young of London, KY. Martin enlisted in the Navy on September 22, 1942, when he was 19 years old. His brother was in the Army, so Martin decided to go a different route. He knew that he would have to leave home, but what he didn't know is that he was going to explore a variety of foreign locales and cross the Atlantic Ocean 14 times.  Up until his enlistment in the Navy, Martin had lived in Perry County, KY, his entire life. He was first sent to basic training at Great Lakes Training Center in Illinois. After basic training, Mr. Young decided he would attend gunnery school in San Francisco Bay, CA.  After his 6-week stint in gunnery school, Martin was finally prepared to take to the high seas. He was assigned to the Joseph Gale, a supply ship that carried ammunition and supplies as well as airplanes. During his first deployment on a ship, Mr. Young remembers that he didn't see land for 32 long days.  While aboard the Joseph Gale, Mr. Young traveled through New Guinea and the Loyalty Islands in the South Pacific; Tocapilla, Chili in South America; the West Indies; and Cuba, all before an emergency port in St. Albans, NY. The ship's bow was badly damaged by a torpedo from a German submarine and the crew had no choice but to stop for repairs on dry land.  Once in New York, Mr. Young returned to work on the tanker SS Manassas, a ship that hauled fuel to England. He would go on to make the journey 14 times while serving on that ship. Looking back, Mr. Young remembers the tension amidst the crew on the Manassas during the French Invasion. Although not involved in the attack, the ship was in the English Channel, and all members had to constantly be on alert, ready at a moment's notice to enter the fight.  Once Mr. Young returned to the States, he was given a 32-day furlough in which he and some Navy buddies hitchhiked from San Francisco to St. Louis before finally taking a bus to his eastern Kentucky home. During his leave the war ended, and Mr. Young returned to the Navy without the threat of combat looming over him.  Although the war was over, Mr. Young still had time in the Navy to complete, so when he heard about an opening in the Naval Barber Shop, he applied. He got the job, and cut hair during the days while attending barber school in the evenings. He enjoyed it so much that when he returned to Perry County on August 8, 1946, he continued to wield the scissors in the Commonwealth.  The Navy offered Martin Young the journey of a lifetime. He traveled around the world more than once and had the opportunity to port in breathtaking and beautiful locations on several continents.  Now retired, Martin Young enjoys the finer things in life, such as spending time with his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Although he has retired from cutting hair, he still uses his hands to make woodcrafts and play several different musical instruments. While Martin would probably say the Navy has given him so much, today I wish to recognize him and say that it is he who has given us so much. Martin Young's service to his country during World War II is something that each and every American to this day should be truly grateful for.  An article was recently published in London, KY's local newspaper magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition. The article highlighted the many achievements made by Martin Young throughout his eventful lifetime.  At this time, I wish to invite my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in commemorating Mr. Martin Young and his dedication to our great Nation, and I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]                         Back on His Home Land                            (By Sue Minton)       Martin Young, 89, a member of what has become known as      ``America's Greatest Generation,'' enlisted in the Navy on      Sept. 22, 1942. In the Spring of '42, Young graduated from      high school, and that fall the 19-year-old ventured forth on      a journey that would take him across the Atlantic 14 times.       He traveled from his home in Perry County to Louisville to      be processed, examined and sworn in. ``My brother was in the      Army, so I decided on the Navy,'' Young said.       Following basic training at Great Lakes Training Center in      Illinois, Young chose gunnery school over submarine duty and      was transferred to Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay,      Calif. ``We trained on three guns, the 20-millimeter, 5-inch      38, and 3-inch 50.'' After completing six weeks of gunnery      school, Young was assigned to U.S. Navy Gunner Armed Guard      Unit.       After the gun crew assignment, Young and his comrades      departed for Portland, Ore., to begin their first sea duty.      They boarded the Joseph Gale, a supply ship that carried a      cargo of ammunition and supplies as well as airplanes. This      voyage also included a training trip along the west coast,      down to San Francisco and then across the Pacific Ocean.      ``For 32 days I did not see land,'' Young recalls.       I wanted to be out there,'' Young said. ``But I got seasick      on the first ship.'' He remembers a gunner mate telling him      he had a sure cure for seasickness. ``They called us all      Mack,'' he said. ``He said to me, `Mack, go lay down under a      big shade tree,' but where would you find a shade tree out in      the ocean?''       The Joseph Gale and crew members sailed to the South      Pacific and dropped off supplies at various ports New      Caledonia, Loyalty Islands, Solomon Island, and New Guinea.       After crossing the Pacific, Young and his shipmates      returned to South America Antofagasta and Tocopilla, Chili,''      he said.       From South America, the crew sailed back to the States,      docking in Charleston, S.C. There they boarded a destroyer      escort also used to transport supplies.       For a short time the crew sailed the waves of the Caribbean      Sea. ``The Caribbean Sea was a hot spot, a lot of ships were      sunk there,'' Young recalled.       While in the Caribbean, the bow of Young's ship was      severely damaged by a torpedo from a German submarine. The      sailors abandoned the ship and the wounded were sent to Cuba,      Young among them. After arriving in Cuba, the wounded boarded      the SS Shiloh en route to the U.S. Navy Hospital in St.      Albans, N.Y. Seaman Young remained at the hospital for two      months recovering from his injuries and surgery.       Young returned to duty on the tanker SS Manassas hauling      fuel to England. This ship made seven trips from New York to      England (14 trips across the Atlantic). ``We also hauled      gasoline from Port Arthur, Texas,'' Young said. ``We would      sail up the coast and join a convoy, maybe 60 ships. Several      ships were sunk by German submarines during the seven      crossings.''       The Manassas was rammed by an Allied vessel in the English      Channel and was docked at Belfast, Ireland, a short time for      repairs. ``While the ship was docked for repairs, we still      carried on with our duties,'' Young said. ``This was just      before the invasion of France, and the crew had to be alert      at all times.''       Young recalls being in the English Channel after the      invasion of France and once again was transferred to a supply      ship, the SS Willard Gibbs. ``This time we took supplies and      ammo to Omaha Beach,'' he said.       The Willard Gibbs could not get near the beach, so supplies      were loaded onto barges and transported to the beach.      ``During the unloading of the ship, the crew members went      ashore and walked on Omaha Beach,'' Young said. ``This was      about a month after the invasion.''       Once more Young's ship returned to New York, reloaded with      supplies, and returned through the Panama Canal across the      Pacific Ocean to the Philippine Islands Leyte, Luzon and      Samar as well as the Mariana Islands, Caroline Island, and      several others.       This passage was to be Young's last ocean voyage. When he      arrived back in Los Angeles aboard the SS Willard Gibbs, he      received 32 days travel time to return to New York.       Instead of taking a bus to the east coast, Young and three      crew members hitchhiked. ``We were on Old Highway 66, and we      got a ride with one fellow all the way to St. Louis,'' he      said. ``It took us three days and nights, and at St. Louis we      split up, got bus tickets and headed home.''       After a short furlough at his home in Perry County, Young      went back to New York. But during his 32 days travel time,      the war ended.       After his furlough was over, Young reported to Lido Beach,      Long Island, New York, where he was told there was a      possibility he would not have to go back out to sea but would      have shore duty. The New York base was turned into a USN      Personnel Separation Center, and Young remained on land.       While Young was finishing his tour of duty in New York, he      attended barber school. ``An announcement came over the      loudspeakers that barbers were needed for 12 chairs at the      Navy barber shop, and I applied,'' Young stated. ``On the      ships, we didn't have any barbers so we cut each other's      hair. I enjoyed it.'' While working mornings in the barber      shop, Young attended barber school in the afternoons and      evenings.       On Aug. 8, 1946, just a few weeks short of four years since      his enlistment, Young was discharged from the U.S. Navy. He      returned to his native eastern Kentucky home, went to      Frankfort, took and successfully passed the State Barber      Board examination, and received his barber's license.       While serving in the U.S. Navy, Young received several      medals the Good Conduct     Medal, the American Theater Medal, the European Theater      Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Medal, the Philippine Liberation      Medal, and the Victory Medal.       Three years after being discharged, he married Lela Baker      of Hazard, and for 20 years he lived and cut hair in his      hometown.       In 1965, Young, his wife, Lela, and two children, David and      Judy, moved to the Sublimity area of Laurel County. In 1995,      his wife passed away, and today Young's family includes son      David and wife, Lillie; daughter, Judy Smith and husband,      G.J.; three grandchildren, David Ryan Young, Cameron Justin      Smith, and Trey Jordan Smith; and one great-grandson, David      Rylan Young.       Young retired from the swivel chair and scissors several      years ago, but his hands do not remain idle he makes wood-     crafted items and plays several musical instruments. This      talent got him an appearance in 1947 on the first official      broadcast of the Hazard radio station.       Today, not in good health, like most World War II veterans,      Young spends his days reminiscing and visiting with family      and friends who stop by Laurel Heights Home for the Elderly.                          ____________________
