Speaker, I would find it shocking if a bill ever came to this floor that precluded all debate. The gentleman is telling me it is going to come up and there will be time for debate. I don't know that I have ever been here where a bill came up that had no time for debate, so I assume that, Mr. Speaker, to be the case.  The question is: Will there be an opportunity for Members to offer amendments so that perhaps we can get back to the bipartisan bill that was reported out of the committee and leave the partisan parts of that bill for further discussion, debate, and amendment? We would like to have the opportunity to vote on such an amendment.  I ask my friend again, there is no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that I believe there will be time for debate. It won't be very much time, I presume, but I presume there will be time for debate.  But will there be time to offer alternative views and provisions to that bill as it is debated?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, committees have jurisdiction. The Rules Committee is where you decide what rules comes forward. Chairman Sessions and those in the Rules Committee will take that up. As soon as a decision is made, we will notify every Member of the House.
