I want people to know the three judicial nominations before us today fill vacancies in the District of Columbia, the eastern district of Louisiana, and Kansas. When we act favorably on these nominations, we will have confirmed 24 Federal judges since July, including 6 to the courts of appeals.  I mention that because when I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee in July, Federal court vacancies were rising to 111. Since July, we have worked very hard.
