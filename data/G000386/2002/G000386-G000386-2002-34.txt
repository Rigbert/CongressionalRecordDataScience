 President, I have addressed the Senate many times on my oversight efforts of the FBI. As my colleagues know, I have been trying to improve the FBI for years. Sometimes that means investigating problems that some people would otherwise rather cover up. But there is nothing like sunshine that fixes what is wrong, particularly in Government.  I do this not because I am against the FBI but because I think the FBI ismeant to work well and work right so our country is protected. In fact, since September 11, the FBI is on the front line on the domestic war on terrorism. Obviously, the FBI must change to meet that demand. If it does not, we lose the domestic war on terrorism when the people on the front line are not ready to do what needs to be done.  In February, I was addressing the Senate about the FBI reform bill introduced by Chairman Leahy and myself to help bring more security and accountability to the FBI. I want to highlight that bill.
