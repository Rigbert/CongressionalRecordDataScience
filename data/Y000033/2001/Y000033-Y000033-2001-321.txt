Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous consent request that has been worked out with the minority, and it has to do with amendments that are subject to a point of order. We are more than willing to allow some debate on those amendments before they are either withdrawn or the point of order pressed.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that debate on the following specified amendments to the bill, and any amendments thereto, be limited to the time specified, equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself:  Number 1, an amendment to be offered by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) regarding energy price caps for 30 minutes;  Number 2, an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr) regarding the national power grid for 20 minutes;  Number 3, an amendment to be offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) relating to LIHEAP for 20 minutes;  Number 4, an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) relating to dams and hydroelectric power for 20 minutes;  Number 5, an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Bentsen) relating to FEMA for 20 minutes; and  Number 6, an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) relating to funding for the Department of Defense for 20 minutes; and  that such debate may occur pending the reservation of a point of order on each amendment.
