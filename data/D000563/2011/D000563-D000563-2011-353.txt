President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it adjourn under the provisions of S. Res. 257 as a further mark of respect to the memory of the late Senator Mark O. Hatfield, of Oregon.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:53 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday, September 7, 2011, at 10 a.m.                          ____________________
