The reason you file a motion for cloture--as Senator Byrd knows because he knows the Senate rules better than anyone, and probably wrote most of them--is to bring to an end to debate and to force the Senate to go forward on a vote.  The Republican strategy, as enunciated by Senators Lott and Nickles, is to bring an end to this debate. Which debate would they like to see end? The debate about reforming health insurance in America. They do not want us to move forward with amendments pending by Senators Feinstein of California, Kennedy of Massachusetts, and others, which address the issue of health insurance reform. They do not want to face votes on these amendments. They do not want us to bring the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor and ask Members on both sides of the aisle to vote their conscience, up or down, yes or no, on how we can change health insurance in America.  For several days last week, the argument was made that ``we don't have time to debate health insurance reform.'' But as one day flowed into a second day, and now into another week, we are spending a lot of time on the issue without voting on it. We are spending time finding ways to avoid voting on health insurance reform--a Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights.  Now my Republican colleagues have their own version of the bill and, of course, they are very proud of their version, as we are of ours. We have suggested: Bring your bill to the floor and bring your amendments to the floor. We will bring ours, and then we will assume the role of Senators. We will debate and we will vote. Ultimately, we hope to put together a good bill. But whatever the outcome, we will then go home and explain to the people we represent why we voted one way or another. This is not a radical strategy or policy.
