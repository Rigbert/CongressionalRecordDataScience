President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Statement from Ministers Ritz and Fast on Senator Stabenow's Proposed Bill to amend U.S. Country of Origin Labelling (COOL)'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         (From Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, July 23, 2015] Statement From Ministers Ritz and Fast on Senator Stabenow's Proposed           Bill To Amend U.S. Country of Origin Labeling (COOL)(By Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz and International Trade Minister Ed                                  Fast)       Senator Stabenow's (COOL) 2.0 fails to address Canada's      concerns and would continue to undermine our integrated North      American supply chains. By continuing the segregation of and      discrimination against Canadian cattle and hogs, Senator      Stabenow's measure will harm farmers, ranchers, packers,      retailers and consumers on both sides of the border. This is      contrary to successive World Trade Organization (WTO)      decisions that have clearly ruled in Canada's favor.       The U.S. Senate must follow the lead of the House of      Representatives and put forward legislation that repeals COOL      once and for all.       The only acceptable outcome remains for the United States      to repeal COOL or face $3B in annual retaliation.       Canada will continue to stand up for the rights of our      cattle and hog producers to ensure this harm is ended and to      restore the value of our highly integrated North American      livestock market.
