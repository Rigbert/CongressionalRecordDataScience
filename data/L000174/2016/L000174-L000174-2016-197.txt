President, today we will finally vote on the nomination of Waverly Crenshaw to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Federal District Court in the Middle District of Tennessee. This vacancy has been open since December 2014, and Mr. Crenshaw was nominated over a year ago, on February 4, 2015. He has the support of his two Republican home State Senators, Senators Alexander and Corker. He was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote last summer on July 9, 2015. There is no good reason why it has taken 14 months to confirm this nominee.  Mr. Crenshaw is currently a partner at the law firm Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP, in Nashville. Mr. Crenshaw was the first African-American partner at Waller, and in his nearly three-decade career in private practice, he has tried approximately 50 cases to verdict. Mr. Crenshaw also served for 3 years in the Tennessee attorney general's office as an assistant attorney general. He has the experience and qualifications necessary to serve on the Federal bench, and he should be confirmed.  This is our first judicial confirmation vote in 2 months. In the last 2 years of the Bush administration--with a Democratic majority--the Senate confirmed 68 judges. This new Congress, the Republican leadership has allowed only 16 judges to be confirmed since they gained the majority last year. This record of obstruction began last year, when Senate Republicans confirmed the fewest judicial nominees in more than half a century.  Senate Republican leadership is failing our Federal judiciary with their obstruction of judicial confirmations. When Senate Republicans took over the majority in January of last year, there were 43 judicial vacancies. Since then, vacancies have dramatically increased more than 75 percent to 79. Furthermore, the number of judicial vacancies deemed to be ``emergencies'' by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts because caseloads in those courts are unmanageably high has nearly tripled under Republican Senate leadership--from 12 when Republicans took over last year to 34 today.  After we vote on Mr. Crenshaw's nomination, 19 judicial nominees will remain pending on the Executive Calendar. This includes nominees with home state support from Republican Senators, including Robert Rossiter for the Federal District Court in the District of Nebraska; Edward Stanton for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Tennessee; and Susan Baxter and Marilyn Horan for the Federal District Court in the Western District of Pennsylvania.  We can reduce the empty judgeships in those states if Republican leadership would allow timely votes on the pending judicial nominees on the Executive Calendar. All of those nominees were reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. There should not be any further delay in confirming them.  Last Thursday, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and 42 other organizations submitted a letter to Chairman Grassley expressing their dismay with the failure of the Judiciary Committee to do its job to process nominees for our Federal trial and appellate courts, creating a growing backlog of judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this letter at the end of my statement.  The American people expect Senators to do their jobs. This is true with judicial nominations to the lower courts, but it is even more crucial for the Supreme Court of the United States because no one can fill in for the vacant seat on our highest Court. In just the last few weeks, the Supreme Court has deadlocked twice, so it was unable to serve its constitutional function. Refusing to consider Chief Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court is not only unfair to him, it is irresponsible and a threat to a functioning democracy.  A recent poll shows that nearly 70 percent of Americans--including a majority of Republicans--say that the Senate should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland. That is what the American people are saying, but Republicans are refusing to hear them. Instead of listening to their constituents, they are listening to powerful interest groups.  Since public confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominees began in 1916, the Senate has never denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote. And based on the Senate's precedent for decades, the Senate Judiciary Committee should hold a hearing for Chief Judge Garland this month.  A public hearing would allow Americans to engage in the process of considering the nomination and hear directly from Chief Judge Garland, but Senate Republicans continue to refuse to do their jobs. Instead, Republicans have outsourced their job to political interest groups whose only goal is to raise millions of dollars to launch a smear campaign against the nominee's admirable record of public service. These outside groups are not accountable to the American people. They do not have the American people's interest in mind. They are private, powerful groups whose only goal is to advance their own special interests at any cost.  These special interest groups are spending millions of dollars in dark money to run ads distorting Chief Judge Garland's record. At the same time, Republican Senators are planning to deny Chief Judge Garland a chance to defend himself at a publichearing. It is wrong, it is harmful, and it is unfair.  Some Senators have claimed that their unprecedented obstruction against Chief Judge Garland is based on ``principle, not the person.'' But it is not principled to attack Chief Judge Garland's sterling career and then refuse to allow him the chance to respond at a public hearing.  Rather than following the demands of unaccountable interest groups, Republicans should listen to the American people who want to see real leadership in Washington. Americans want Republicans to do their jobs and consider for themselves the merits of Chief Judge Garland's record through a public hearing and a vote.  I am glad that several Republican Senators have agreed to meet with Chief Judge Garland. This is a person who has spent almost three decades in public service and has more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in history. Those who meet with Chief Judge Garland will see what I have seen: that he has an exceptional legal mind and a deep respect for the Constitution. His commitment to public service is inspiring, from his days at the Justice Department working as a prosecutor on the ground in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing to his nearly two decades as a Federal appellate judge.  But simply meeting with Chief Judge Garland is not enough. The Senate must act on his nomination. In the last several weeks, the Supreme Court deadlocked twice and was not able to carry out its constitutional role as the final arbiter of our Nation's laws. Where you live will impact what your rights are. That is unacceptable and contrary to our constitutional system. If Republicans' irresponsible obstruction of Chief Judge Garland does not stop, this will continue at the Supreme Court for two terms.  I hope Senate Republicans will listen to the American people, roll up their sleeves, and do their job. We must carry out one of our most important and solemn responsibilities and consider the Supreme Court nomination before us.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         The Leadership Conference                                    on Civil and Human Rights,                                     Washington DC, April 7, 2016.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of The Leadership      Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the 42 undersigned      organizations, we write to express our dismay with the      failure of the Judiciary Committee to address a growing      backlog of federal judicial nominations. With only 16 judges      confirmed so far, the 114th Congress is on pace to have the      lowest number of judges confirmed since the 82nd Congress in      1951-1952. Even worse, in the face of rising caseloads and      continuing judicial emergencies, it appears that the      Committee is determined to shut down the confirmation process      entirely--putting political considerations ahead of the      national interest in a well-functioning judicial branch, and      ahead of the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to      do its job of providing advice and consent on presidential      appointments.       While a great deal of public attention has rightly been      focused on the pending nomination of Chief Judge Merrick      Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, vacancies on the lower      courts must not be lost amidst the debate. This year,      President Obama has nominated seven individuals to serve on      U.S. Courts of Appeal in various circuits throughout the      country, including several in circuits that are currently      experiencing judicial emergencies. While some senators have      expressed vague and superficial reasons for opposing      consideration of individual nominees, the qualifications of      these nominees cannot be seriously disputed-- every one of      the nominees below has an outstanding background, as well as      the widespread respect of those in the legal community who      know them best:       Rebecca Ross Haywood (Third Circuit): Nominated on March      15, Ms. Haywood has spent most of her legal career as an      Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Western District of      Pennsylvania, including as the Appellate Chief of the Civil      Division since 2010. She regularly practices before the court      to which she has been nominated--and, if confirmed, would be      the first African-American woman to serve there.       Lisabeth Tabor Hughes (Sixth Circuit): Nominated on March      17, Judge Hughes was appointed to the Kentucky Supreme Court      in 2007 by then-Governor Ernie Fletcher and was reelected      twice, including without opposition in 2014. She previously      served on the Kentucky Court of Appeals (also having been      appointed by Gov. Fletcher), and has extensive experience in      both private practice and as a trial judge in Jefferson      County, Kentucky. She would be the first woman from Kentucky      on the court.       Donald Karl Schott (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12,      Mr. Schott graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in      1980. Since then, he has spent most of his legal career in      private practice at Quarles & Brady, where he became a      partner in 1987, and has extensive trial and appellate      litigation experience, at both the state and federal levels,      specializing in securities and business fraud, commercial      disputes, health care, and energy-related issues.       Myra C. Selby (Seventh Circuit): Nominated on Jan. 12, Ms.      Selby spent 15 years in private practice and Indiana state      government before being nominated in 1995 to the Indiana      Supreme Court. She was the first African American and first      woman to serve there, and authored more than 100 majority      opinions, before returning to private practice in 1999. Since      then, she has specialized in commercial and health care      litigation. She would be the first African American from      Indiana and the first woman from Indiana on the Seventh      Circuit.       Jennifer Klemestrud Puhl (Eighth Circuit): Nominated on      Jan. 28, Ms. Puhl spent several years in private practice and      as a clerk on the North Dakota Supreme Court. In 2002, she      joined the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office      for the District of North Dakota, where she prosecutes a wide      range of criminal cases and specializes in computer hacking      and cybersecurity, intellectual property, and human      trafficking. She would be the first woman federal judge at      any level in North Dakota.       Lucy H. Koh (Ninth Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 25, Judge      Koh became the first Asian American judge to serve on the      U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California,      having been confirmed in 2010 by a 90-0 vote. Prior to her      current position, she worked for the Senate Judiciary      Committee, held several positions within the Department of      Justice, and spent six years in private practice. In 2008,      she was appointed as a judge to the Superior Court of      California for Santa Clara County by then-Governor Arnold      Schwarzenegger. She would be only the second Asian American      woman ever to serve on a federal circuit court.       Abdul K. Kallon (Eleventh Circuit): Nominated on Feb. 11,      Judge Kallon has served on the U.S. District Court for the      Northern District of Alabama since 2009, after being      confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent. For the      previous fifteen years, Judge Kallon specialized in labor and      employment law as a partner at the Birmingham, Alabama firm      Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP. If confirmed, Judge Kallon      would be the first African American from Alabama to serve on      the Circuit.       In addition, the committee has failed to act on dozens of      pending district court nominees--too many to list here--from      throughout the country. As with the above appellate nominees,      many of these nominees would fill seats in districts that are      currently facing judicial emergencies. Many of the district      and appellate nominees come from states in which both      senators have returned their so-called ``blue slips,''      indicating their approval of the nominees. Normally, this      should clear the way for hearings and up-or-down confirmation      votes. Instead, these nominees have fallen victim to      election-year gamesmanship.       The complete obstruction of nominees is unprecedented, and      the arguments some are making in defense of this obstruction      are wholly unpersuasive. In 2008, the Democratic party-     controlled Senate confirmed 22 judges in the last seven      months of George W. Bush's presidency, including 10 in      September 2008. During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the Senate      on average confirmed 16 judges in the second half of      presidential election years. There is no legitimate reason      why things should be any different in the last year of      President Obama's second term.       While the Committee refuses to do its job, the American      people are left to pay the price. There are currently 32      judicial emergencies nationwide (16 of the pending nominees      would fill these seats), and more than 40 total nominees      pending in committee or on the Senate floor. Many of the      pending nominees would fill vacancies in courts that have      been left shorthanded for years. Donald Schott would fill a   Seventh Circuit seat that has been vacant for more than six years,      and more than 30 of the 46 pending nominees are nominated      to seats that have been empty for more than a year.       Meanwhile, the inaction is slowing the wheels of justice      for all types of parties who are seeking to vindicate their      legal and constitutional rights. Numerous judges have      explained the consequences they and litigants face: long      delays on even the most simple filings and motions,      protracted waits for post- conviction sentences, spoiled      evidence, witnesses whose memories fade, lost businesses and      the jobs that go with them while waiting for trials, and many      more. Not only is the situation rife with injustices, but it      is also completely unsustainable.       The Committee has a constitutional responsibility to      provide advice and consent on presidential nominees, and a      duty to the American people to simply do its job. In the      coming weeks and months, our organizations will continue to      make the case until it does.
