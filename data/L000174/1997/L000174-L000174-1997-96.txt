 Mr. President, I just want to make reference to the comments just made by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, my friend and colleague of 23 years. He has served here much longer than that. I have had the opportunity to serve with him for now almost 23 years.  Mr. President, I have made it very clear in speeches on the floor and comments to the public and people back in my home State of Vermont that I completely agree with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on the question of the line-item veto.  I was one of those, as he knows, who voted against the line-item veto. I recall when he first came trying to say something to me about it. He may well recall this: I said, ``You don't even have to lay out the arguments. I can't imagine why anybody in any legislative body would want to give up the power of the purse strings to the Executive.''  Again, I do not blame the Executive for asking for it. If any Executive thought that the legislative body would be foolish enough to just hand over the most significant part of their power to them, well, few Executives could resist the temptation.
