President, the confirmation of Maryanne Trump Barry to the Third Circuit--and I predict that she will be confirmed--will bring to 15 the total number of federal judges considered by the Senate all year.  While I am appreciative of this opportunity to consider this nomination, I note that the Republican leadership has chosen to skip over the nominations of Marsha Berzon, Judge Richard Paez, and Ray Fisher to the Ninth Circuit. These nominations have all been on the Senate calender for as long or longer than that of Ms. Barry. The Republican leadership has, again, skipped over the nomination of Justice Ronnie White for the federal court in Missouri, as well.  All of these nominations could and should have been considered before the August recess. Indeed the nominations of Judge Paez and Justice White, should have been considered when they were first reported last year.
