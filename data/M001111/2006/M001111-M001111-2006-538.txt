 President, the amendment I have sent to the desk tonight, that we will vote on tomorrow, restores the $1 billion cut in funding for Community Development Block Grant Programs that are assumed in the budget resolution that is before the Senate this week.  For more than 30 years, the Community Development Block Grant Program, known as the CDBG, has served as a tremendous catalyst for change in communities across the Nation. It has brought hope and opportunity to families and to residents and to communities everywhere we look in this country. For both cities that are urban and rural, CDBG has supported efforts to expand affordable housing. It invests in neighborhoods, and it supports local economic development projects that have literally revitalized communities.  But tonight, as we look at this budget resolution, that future, that hope is really being diminished.
