President, when the Judiciary Committee reported Federal reporters' shield legislation to the floor on October 23, I called on the full Senate to promptly consider and pass this important legislation. The Senate version of the Free Flow of Information Act, S. 2035, is bipartisan legislation that was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan vote. The House has already passed legislation on this same subject, H.R. 2102, with a strong, bipartisan and veto-proof majority of 398 to 21.  Both of these bipartisan bills are available and waiting for Senate action, and I believe that there are well over 60 votes in favor of passing a shield bill in the Senate. I strongly support the enactment of a Federal shield law for journalists, and I urge the Senate to promptly consider and pass Federal shield legislation.  All of us have an interest in enacting a balanced and meaningful first amendment privilege. According to a newly released study by Privacy International--a privacy, civil liberties and human rights watchdog organization, the United States is one of just a few established democracies around the world that does not have a law to protect journalists from being forced to reveal confidential sources. In fact, according to that study, approximately 100 countries have adopted laws that allow journalists to honor their promise of confidentiality.  Sadly, the press has become the first stop, rather than the last resort, for our government and private litigants when it comes to seeking information. This is a dangerous trend that can have a chilling effect on the press and the public's right to know.  Enacting Federal shield legislation would help to reverse this troubling trend. In fact, proceeding promptly to consideration of this legislation is something I strongly support. Should the Senate take up the bipartisan shield bill that overwhelmingly passed in the House, federal shield legislation could go immediately to the President's desk and be signed into law without delay this year.  The Senate bill has the support of a bipartisan coalition of Senators, including Senators Specter, Schumer, Lugar, Dodd, Graham, and myself, who have all united to cosponsor this legislation. In addition, more than 50 news media and journalism organizations support this legislation and the call for Senate action on this historic bill extends to editorial pages across the country, including The New York Times, Arizona Republic, L. A. Times, Salt Lake Tribune, and San Francisco Chronicle, among others.  The Senate and House bills protect law enforcement interests and safeguard national security. Moreover, both of these bills follow the lead of 33 States and the District of Columbia which have shield laws, and many other States, including Vermont, which recognize a common law reporters' privilege. Tellingly, the Bush administration has not identified a single circumstance where a reporters' privilege has caused harm to national security or to law enforcement, despite the fact that many courts have recognized such a privilege for years.  Given the overwhelming need and support for a federal shield law to protect the public's right to know, I urge the Senate to promptly consider and pass a Federal shield bill.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a support letter from the Media Coalition Supporting the Free Flow of Information Act, which is signed by 67 different news organizations, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Media Coalition Supporting the                                 Free Flow of Information Act,                                                 November 6, 2007.     Re S. 2035 and H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act       Dear Senator: On behalf of the men and women across the      nation who work to bring the American people vital news and      information, we, the undersigned media companies and      organizations, urge you to support expeditious Senate passage      of the Free Flow of Information Act, legislation that is      vitally important to the national interest. Protecting      confidential sources through federal legislation has broad      support on both sides of the aisle, in both houses of      Congress, and from state attorneys general across the nation.      Your support is essential to ensure that the American people      have access to information about their government and the      institutions that affect their daily lives.       Democrats and Republicans have united to provide      overwhelming support for this legislation. The Senate      Judiciary Committee reported S. 2035 by a 15-4 vote on      October 4, and the House passed H.R. 2102 by a 398-21 vote on      October 16. Both versions of the Free Flow of Information Act      are available for immediate floor action on the Senate      Business Calendar. As the strength of these votes suggests,      Senators and House Members from opposite ends of the      political spectrum have joined together to support the      public's right to have essential information and to protect      whistleblowers who are sometimes the only way the public can      get this information.       While the Free Flow of Information Act will protect      confidential sources by establishing a uniform standard for      obtaining information from reporters in federal court      proceedings, it is important to note that both versions of      the legislation have been amended to ensure that national      security is also protected. While many state laws provide for      a more absolute privilege, both versions of this legislation      are limited to a qualified privilege with exceptions for acts      of terrorism or other significant harm to national security.       With 49 states and the District of Columbia having either      common law or codified protection for confidential sources,      there is a growing (bipartisan) acknowledgement that      enactment of a federal law is imperative. In a recent brief      filed with the United States Supreme Court, a group of 34      state attorneys general pointed out that lack of a clear      standard of federal protection undermines state law. These      state laws have worked successfully for many years, defining      those covered by the law and the limits of that coverage. At      the same time, they have protected the public's right to      information while still allowing these states to investigate      crimes and protect public safety.       News organizations prefer to have their sources on the      record whenever possible. However, history is replete with      examples of news articles critical to the national interest      that would have never been written had it not been for the      protection of confidential sources. As many of your      colleagues have     stressed and state legislatures have recognized, the time is      now for the protection of confidential sources, and the      safeguarding of the public's right to know. This issue is too      important to remain unresolved as the year and the      congressional session draw to a close. We urge you to press      for immediate and favorable Senate floor consideration of the      Free Flow of Information Act. Thank you.
