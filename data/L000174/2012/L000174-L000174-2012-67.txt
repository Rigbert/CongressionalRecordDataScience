The      Republicans have time and again used the filibuster, the      threat of filibuster, holds on nominations and other tactics      to confirmations.  This is the new practice that Senate Republicans adopted when PresidentObama was elected. They delay and obstruct judicial nominations for no good reason. There are currently 13 circuit and district court nominees still pending on the Senate Executive Calendar who were reported before the August recess and should all have been confirmed before the recess. Most are consensus nominees. All have the support of their home State Senators, including their home State Republican Senators.  The Federal Bar Association wrote a letter earlier this week to Senate leaders that said:       [W]e write to urge you to promptly schedule floor votes on      pending, noncontroversial United States circuit court      nominees and district court nominees who have cleared the      Judiciary Committee with strong bipartisan support and who      await a final up-or-down vote. The high number of existing      judicial vacancies--81, of which 35 constitute judicial      emergencies--underscores the need for prompt attention by the      Senate in fulfilling its Constitutional responsibilities.  They are absolutely right. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.
