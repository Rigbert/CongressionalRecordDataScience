President, I rise today to congratulate Susan Dollenmaier of Tunbridge who was chosen as the Vermont Small Business Person of the Year. She has shown extraordinary innovation and vision in building a successful business in Vermont.  Ms. Dollenmaier is the president and co-founder of Anichini Inc., an importing and manufacturing company that designs, wholesales, and retails linens and textiles from Italy, India, the Far East, and Eastern Europe. Anichini also has a furniture division and a line of products for infants. A former social worker for the state of Vermont, Dollenmaier and her ex-business partner, Patrizia Anichini, launched the company about 20 years ago with only a $600 investment. This year, sales of Anichini's linens are expected to top $10 million. Besides its outlet store in West Lebanon, New Hampshire--a site she hopes to move to the Vermont side of the Connecticut River very soon--and a new one slated to open in Manchester, Vermont, Anichini operates retail stores in Beverly Hills and Dallas, along with a boutique in New York City. Susan makes sure that some of the cash flow from her wealthy and demanding clientele finances flex time, day care stipends, generous vacations and holidays, a profit-sharing plan and other benefits--as well as better-than-average wages--for her largely female work force of 45 employees. We are very happy Susan chose to start and maintain her business in Vermont.  I commend Susan and all of her employees for receipt of this prestigious award.  I ask that a copy of an April 15, 2001, article in the Valley News outlining Ms. Dollenmaier's achievements be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                 SBA Honors Turnbridge's Anichini Inc.                           (By Bob Piasecki)       Turnbridge.--Most people drive right past the yellow      farmhouse off Route 110 that contains Anichini Inc.'s      offices, and that's just fine with Susan Dollenmaier.       Dollenmaier, president and co-founder of Anichini, the      importer, manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer of linens and      textiles for the rich and famous, prefers to keep a low      profile.       That explains why there isn't a sign outside Anichini's      headquarters or its warehouse farther down the road--and why      there never will be, as long as Dollenmaier is running the      company.       ``I'm not into being a celebrity,'' says Dollenmaier,      dressed casually in black leggings and a gray cable-knit      sweater. ``I just want us to get recognition because of our      products.''       That won't be possible for much longer because Dollenmaier      was just named Vermont's Small Businessperson of the Year by      the state's Small Business Administration.       Some of Dollenmaier's employees went ahead and nominated      their boss for the prestigious award without telling her, and      she ended up winning.       The selection put Dollenmaier in the running for being      named the national Small Business Person of the Year award,      which will be announced next month in Washington D.C.       The SBA singled out Dollenmaier and Anichin for      ``seamlessly blending economic success with socially      conscious business practices.''       Deborah Mathews, who has worked with Dollenmaier virtually      since the day Anichini was launched, said she was willing to      reduce her salary and make other painful cuts when times were      tough.       ``Susan's focus on the needs of her staff and the community      in which she lives and works made her an ideal recipient for      this honor,'' added Matthews.       ``Susan has a profound gift for recognizing hidden      potential, and she knows how to bring it out in the open,''      said Kenneth Silvia, director of the SBA's office in Vermont.      ``It's manifest not only in her choice of Anichini's product      line, but in the people who work at the company--the majority      of whom are Vermonters.''       A former social worker for the state of Vermont,      Dollenmaier and her ex-partner, Patrizia Anichini, launched      the company about 20 years ago with a paltry $600 investment.      This year, sales of Anichini's linens are expected to top $10      million.       Besides it outlet store in the Powerhouse Mall in West      Lebanon, and a new one slated to open this summer in      Manchester, Vt, Anichini operates retail stores in Beverly      Hills and Dallas, along with a boutique in New York City. Its      regular clientele includes celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey,      Sharon Stone and Tom Cruise.       Not bad for the daughter of an electrical salesman who grew      up in Libertyville, Ill., a small agricultural town 45 miles      northwest of Chicago.       Dollenmaier said she always had a thing for beautiful      textiles, but doesn't quite know where that fascination came      from. ``That's something to figure out with a therapist,''      she jokes. But she suspects it probably has something to do      with her grandmother, a dressmaker who also made her own      quilts.       She sewed her own clothes as a teenager, and began      collecting antique fabrics of all styles and types, never      thinking it was ever going to turn into a business.       After graduating from Southern Illinois University, where      she earned a degree in design and studied under R.      Buckminster Fuller--the inventor of the geodesic dome--     Dollenmaier bounced around for a while.       Her life changed in the early 1970s, when she came to south      Royalton from Los Angeles to visit her sister, whose husband      was attending Vermont Law School at the time, and fell in      love with the area.       ``It was spring. It was so green and there was so much      water,'' Dollenmaier recalled, sitting at an enormous      wooden table in Anichini's spacious conference room.       ``It was so refreshing, I turned to my sister and said,      `this has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the      world,' and essentially I never left after that.''       She got a job as a social worker for the state of Vermont,      and helped set up several programs including Meals on Wheels      in Tunbridge and many of the other towns along the First      Branch of the White River. At the same time, Dollenmaier      continued to go to tag sales, flea markets and estate sales,      collecting antique fabrics for her burgeoning collection.      After she sold part of her cache in New York City,      Dollenmaier decided it was time for a major life change.       ``It finally dawned on me that I wanted more challenges,      and that I was headed toward running some government program      in Washington, D.C., if I continued to be a social worker,''      she says.       So she quit after seven years, and with her partner, rented      a loft in Manhattan on 20th Street. ``We lived there hand-to-     mouth,'' she said buying, selling and swapping antique      linens.       She remembers driving an old, unheated bread truck filled      with their wares back and forth from New York and Vermont,      where she also kept an apartment in Tunbridge. The duo got      their first big break when Barney's, the upscale New York      department     store, agreed to sell some of their material in its home      furnishings store, which was just opening.       During a trip to Venice with her husband, glassblower Robin      Mix, Dollenmaier got the idea of making and selling new,      heirloom quality textiles, which is essentially what Anichini      does today.       ``In Italy I found women who were still making the same      kind of textiles I was buying and selling,'' she says.      ``That's really where the seed of the business was formed.''       Soon after that, Anichini caught another break when one of      Italy's premier textile weavers took a chance on the      fledgling company and agreed to give it $50,000 worth of      materials on consignment.       The business sold all $50,000, and was on its way. It      grossed $100,000 in its first year, and has continued to      expand and grow. Dollenmaier and Anichini eventually sold      their loft in New York, and used the proceeds to buy the      buildings the company still owns in Tunbridge.       The partners went their separate ways a few years ago, when      Dollenmaier bought out Anichini's share in the business.       Today, Anichini has a furniture division, a line of      products for infants and is widening its scope to include      fabrics and designs from India, the Far East, Eastern Europe      and other countries. It no longer bills itself as simply an      purveyor of Italian, Dollenmaier says.       The company recently worked out an agreement with a weaver      in India who is trying to keep some of the country's old      techniques alive.       Dollenmaier acknowledges that the 2,000 or so women who      make textiles for Anichini in India are, at least by Western      standards, poor. Asked how this squares with Anichini's Ben &      Jerry's-style commitment to social responsibility,      Dollenmaier says she has thought deeply about this question.       ``I guess I'd say they've got to be working doing      something, and they are making a lot more money making stuff      for us as opposed to someone else.''       One thing is certain, Anichini's 60 employees in the United      States are treated quite well. The company provides profit      sharing, which has averaged more than 10 percent of the      employee's salary over the past five years, 11 paid holidays,      five weeks vacation after five years of service, and paid      membership in gym.       Dollenmaier hopes to eventually move Anichini's outlet      store in West Lebanon across the river to the Route 4      corridor in Vermont. Long-range, she also plans to      consolidate all of Anichini's operations in a new facility in      Tunbridge that will be even harder to find than its existing      buildings.       Looking back on her life and how she has parlayed a hobby      and passion into a highly successful business, Dollenmaier      says: ``I'm really doing exactly what I want. I really have      very few regrets.''                          ____________________
