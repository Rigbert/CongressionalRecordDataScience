Speaker, I was a bit surprised to hear the gentleman from Texas and a few others on the Republican side find an excuse to oppose this legislation, but, then again, they always find an excuse to side with their international corporate benefactors.  He feigned, ``Oh, my god, the American people won't be able to afford shoes for their kids next fall because we won't have those cheap Chinese imports shutting down American factories.''  Now, what the Americans need are jobs. We don't need jobs in China; we need them here. And with an unfairly priced currency, we are losing more and more manufacturing.  When the Republicans controlled everything from 1994 to 2006, or the Congress and the presidency for a good part of that time, our trade deficit with China went up 806 percent, and they did nothing. But they can find little problems here and there with this legislation.  They are worried about a trade war. We are at war. We are having a trade war with China. They are supporting capitulation, and we are finally starting to fight back from this side of the aisle.  No, no excuses. Plain and simple: Are you with the American people and fairtrade, or are you with the Chinese and the big international corporations and their excuse for free trade, which is manipulated currencies, trade barriers, and taking our jobs away from our workers. Plain and similar: Where do you stand?
