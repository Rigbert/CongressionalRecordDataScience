President, I am proud to join Senator Franken in sponsoring the Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2010, SNDA, an important step in our march toward a more inclusive Nation. This bill continues the civil rights work we began earlier this Congress when I offered the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act as an amendment to the defense authorization bill last year. The Student Non-Discrimination Act will ensure that under Federal law, all public school children are protected equally from discrimination. Children deserve a safe environment where they can learn the skills and knowledge necessary to be good citizens.  More than 55 years ago, in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court reaffirmed our Nation's commitment to justice and equal rights for all Americans by ending racial segregation in our public schools. A unanimous Court recognized that ``it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he [or she] is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms.''  Congress continued on the path of progress by passing laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Education Amendments of 1972, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. These laws protected students in federally-funded public schools from discrimination and harassment based on race, national origin, sex, and disability. President John F. Kennedy said in 1963, ``Simple justice requires that public funds, to which all taxpayers . . . contribute, not be spent in any fashion which encourages, entrenches, subsidizes or results in . . . discrimination.''  Tragically, for far too long, U.S. taxpayer dollars have gone to public school systems that tolerate or perpetuate discrimination, harassment, and even violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity. To paraphrase Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., ``now is the time to make justice a reality'' for all of our children--now is the time for Congress to extend existing Federal protections against discrimination to all public school students.  The legislation we introduce today does just that by prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity in public, non-religious, federally-funded schools.  Vermont has recognized the importance of creating a safe school environment for our children. In 1993, the State legislature enacted a law to protect school children from harassment based on sexual orientation, and in 2007, the law was strengthened to protect against harassment based on gender identity. Nine other States and the District of Columbia protect school children from discrimination based ongender identity and sexual orientation. This legislation makes clear that it would not preempt state laws such as those in Vermont, which provide additional protections and remedies.  The Student Non-Discrimination Act also preserves our First Amendment freedoms of expression and religion. The bill is narrowly tailored to comply with the Supreme Court's First Amendment precedents. It includes provisions that explicitly exempt parochial schools, and to make clear that religious groups in public schools continue to be protected by the First Amendment and the Equal Access Act.  I urge all Senators to come together to support this important bill to ensure that all of our students are given the opportunity to succeed, free from harassment or discrimination.                                 ______                                       By
