I tell my friend that Tim Walz of Minnesota has had a bill, as the gentleman probably knows, of the STOCK Act--also, Louise Slaughter, ranking member of the Rules Committee, has worked on for literally a decade or more--so we have legislation which is available to take, frankly, from the desk, pass that, and go immediately to conference with the Senate.  The gentleman indicates he wants to change the Senate bill. I think that that may be appropriate; but if he does, we're going to have to go to conference in any event. So my suggestion is you take Tim Walz's bill, act on that, a House bill, and we go to conference on that bill. That seems to me that's the most expeditious way to accomplish what the gentleman says he wants to accomplish in a very quick fashion.  I think Tim Walz of Minnesota would be happy to hear that and available to work towards that end, along with Louise Slaughter.
