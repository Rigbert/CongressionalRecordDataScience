Speaker, I have come to address the issue of Amtrak, but I just cannot resist making some comments regarding one of the most bizarre and tortured speeches I have ever heard given by a Member who preceded me in the well.  Yes, it is true Americans pay more than twice as much as most people who live in industrialized nations around the world for our pharmaceuticals, many of those pharmaceuticals manufactured in the United States by United States-owned drug manufacturing firms and somehow exported from the United States and sold for half or 30 percent of the price overseas where they still make money. He said all we need is a bigger dose of the free market in the Republican approach to this bill.  We certainly do not want a government program like Medicare, that would actually rein in the price of drugs by negotiating it down using the market power of the 40 million people in Medicare, just like Blue Cross/Blue Shield does with their patients, just like the Veterans Administration does with their clients. Why? Because the pharmaceutical industry, who hosted the Republican fundraiser, the most successful in history, earlier this week, is bitterly opposed to that. They do not want the free market to work here in the United States.  But what he was really commenting on was the fact that overseas they control the outrageous price of these drugs and the companies still make a profit. So it was one of the more bizarre and tortured speeches I have ever heard trying to get around the fact their bill will do nothing about the outrageous price of pharmaceuticals, and that in fact they are introducing and passing legislation written by the insurance and pharmaceutical industry.  Now, on to Amtrak, another looming disaster. On Monday, the administration has a critical decision to make: Will they guarantee a loan for Amtrak to continue its operation, or will they kill Amtrak and kill our national rail system once and forever?  Will we become the only major industrialized Nation on Earth without a national rail system? What happens the next time there is a 9-11 when there is no rail alternative? Where are those people going to go? What are our alternatives?  This administration is rehashing again there another free market mantra. My God, Amtrak should not get subsidies. Well, yes, the trucking industry gets subsidies; automobiles get huge Federal subsidies; and, yes, the aviation industry got more subsidies in one day than Amtrak has gotten in 15 years. But Amtrak, no, they should not get a penny, because they compete with the regional airlines, and they are not liked by the freight companies.  So the administration is falling back on this: let us make it like the British rail system. That is as credible as the idea of modeling our electricity on the British system, which we have done. Deregulation, the disaster in California, was modeled on what they have done in Great Britain. And, in fact, what they are proposing for Amtrak is modeled on what they have done in Great Britain.  When I was over there earlier this year for aviation security issues, the paper was filled day after day after day with disasters, capacity problems, safety problems, crashes, dissatisfaction of the public. Divide off the rails from the actual providers of service. Yes, the Brits did that. It is a disaster.  No, this is plain and simple an excuse to kill the system. And if the administration does not sign this loan on Monday, they have just signed the death warrant of the national rail system in this country, which would be a horrible tragedy.  In my region, we have grown, with minuscule investment, rail passengers by 600 percent in 8 years. If we can turn it into a truly high-speed system, of course then it might compete with the aviation industry, we could get people to Seattle just about as quickly as they could get there and deal with the traffic problems coming to and from the airport in Oregon and the airline schedules.                              {time}  1530  But they do not want to have that kind of a system. They do not want that alternative. They do not want it to be successful. They want to kill it.  I challenged the administration on Monday, give them that loan guarantee and let Congress work its will in terms of reforming Amtrak, making it work better. We can do that, but do not just kill it with the lame excuse you want to make it like the failed British system.  Why should we emulate the failures of governments overseas when they are well known and well publicized? And if you want to kill it, just be honest about it and say you want to kill Amtrak, in particular because a few airlines are concerned about their routes in the east coast and other quarters where rail is actually carrying almost as many passengers, and in Europe where, in fact, on less than 400-mile flights they do carry more passengers. It is a more efficient way to get there. If that is what the agenda is, at least be honest about it.                          ____________________
