There is a very powerful commitment in both Houses to take a meaningful stand against the genocide in Sudan. State governments, universities, and other institutions from coast to coast have passed divestment measures. Those voices have been heard in Congress, and I agree there is strong bicameral, bipartisan support for divestment, but that no single provision could be allowed to jeopardize passage of this important legislation, given the situation on the ground in Darfur.
