Pryor be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 National Council of Churches,                                                    July 31, 2003.     President George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: As religious leaders from various faith      traditions, we are fully committed to religious freedom and      separation of church and state as basic tenets of our      Constitution. We agree with you that, ``we (America) must      continue our efforts to uphold justice and tolerance and to      oppose prejudice; and we must be resolved to countering any      means that infringe on religious freedom.'' Today, we write      to express our grave concern about the attempt to make      religion an issue in the consideration of judicial nominees.       We were deeply troubled to learn that during a Senate      Judiciary Committee hearing last week on the nomination of      Alabama Attorney General William H. Pryor, who is being      considered for a lifetime position in the U.S. Court of      Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, the Chairman of the      Judiciary Committee injected religion into a debate over      qualifications for this position. By questioning Mr. Pryor's      religious faith, Chairman Hatch supported a scurrilous      advertising campaign designed to make those opposed to the      Pryor nomination seem guilty of religious bias.       Mr. President, we urge you to immediately denounce the      reprehensible behavior of the Senate Judiciary Leadership. We      ask that you send a clear message to oppose religious      interrogation and restore order and dignity to the judicial      nomination process. Judicial nominees can be reviewed on a      wide range of criteria--but religion must not be one of them.      To allow questioning of religious faith during consideration      of nominations will set a dangerous precedent with profound      implications on future nominees.       We urge you to protect the integrity of the judicial      nomination process by denouncing this behavior. As religious      leaders, who take seriously our charge to promote tolerance      and justice, we hope you will act swiftly on our request. We      have a lot to lose. Our shared values of religious freedom      are at stake.           Sincerely,                                                   Rev. Bob Edgar,                                                General Secretary.
