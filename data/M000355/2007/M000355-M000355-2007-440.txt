 President, let me for my side of the aisle describe what we have just done. Senator Reid and I have entered into an agreement, which I previously described to my conference, under which we will be able to smooth the passage of the supplemental appropriations bill into conference. The majority leader, with my concurrence, has filled up the tree and filed cloture. This should give us an opportunity Thursday afternoon on a broad bipartisan basis to move this troop funding bill into conference where we will continue our discussions.  The majority leader and I have had several meetings with the President's designee, Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and we will have additional meetings--as well as with House Democrats and Republicans--and hopefully achieve what I think we all want to achieve at this point, which is a signed troop funding bill before Memorial Day.
