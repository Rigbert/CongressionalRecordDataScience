Chairman, in closing, I will reiterate my strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment.  We are talking about allowing people with weapons in areas where we have dams and water treatment plants, and the Army Corps of Engineers ought to be able to exercise control over those for the protection of those major economic infrastructures. I would respectfully disagree with the gentleman, that he would also reduce their ability as far as the regulation of people with explosives. And I think that, again, is very detrimental relative to our national security. For these reasons, I strongly oppose the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).  The amendment was agreed to.                              {time}  1550                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Cohen
