 I have seen on both sides of the aisle the prodigious efforts dialing for dollars. People leave; they have to take time off. They go to party headquarters. They stand out on the street corner with their cell phone, and they call people and ask for contributions.  If inflation had not risen to the extent it has, that would be a different story. I know there are people on my side who believe that if you raise this contribution limit, it disadvantages Democrats. I truly do not believe that. It goes across the field. It gives a nonincumbent an advantage; it gives an incumbent the ability to do their work and concentrate less on fundraising. It gives one at least double the opportunity to meet expenses which, since this limit was put on, have actually tripled.  May I ask a question?  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.
