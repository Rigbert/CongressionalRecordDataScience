A bill to conserve global bear populations by prohibiting the importation, exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and items, products, or substances containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear viscera, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, incredibly, there is a good chance that today someone will put on a facial cream, apply a medicine, or even eat asoup that contains bear parts. Bear bile, gallbladders, paws and claws are found in culinary delicacies, cosmetics and traditional ethnic medicines in Asia, and these parts often fetch thousands of dollars. A cup of bear paw soup has sold for up to $1,500 in Taiwan, and wildlife experts say that a gallbladder can command tens of thousands of dollars on the Asian market. Not surprisingly, the lure of astronomical profits overseas has spawned rampant poaching of American bears. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service continues to find bear carcasses rotting with their gallbladders ripped out and their paws sliced off. Just today, creator Jack Elrod chronicled this heinous act in his wildlife preservation comic strip, ``Mark Trail.''  The slaughter of American black bears and the sale of their parts is a deliberate and dastardly plot hatched by a black market of poachers, traders, and smugglers who have been known to transport bear parts in cans of chocolate syrup or bottles of scotch. Because certain Asian bear populations are being poached to near extinction, poachers and smugglers often target American black bears to meet the demand for bear parts in Asia and even within certain communities here at home. In Oregon alone, one poaching-for-profit ring reportedly killed between 50-100 black bears a year for 5 to 10 years simply to harvest their gallbladders. While the bear population in North America presently is stable, the growth of illegal and inhumane poaching, coupled with the difficulty of anti-poaching enforcement efforts, could pose a real threat to our resident bear population. We should not stand by and allow American bears to be decimated by poachers.  The depleted bear populations in Asia suffer a different, but equally cruel, fate as they are ``protected'' to meet the demand for their bile. National Geographic, U.S News and World Report and The Los Angeles Times each have reported that Asiatic bears in China have been trapped in bear ``farms'' and milked for their bile through catheters inserted into their gallbladders. Bears in other countries often fare no better. In South Korea, for example, bears have been bludgeoned to death or boiled alive in front of patrons to prove they are purchasing authentic Asian bear parts.  Some States in America prohibit trading in bear parts. But others do not. And to make matters more complicated, some States prohibit such trading only if the bear was killed within that State. It hardly takes a lawyer to quickly find the loophole in such a law, poachers and black market profiteers can simply kill a bear in another State and take it back across State lines to sell the parts. And because it is almost impossible to tell where a bear was killed just by looking at its parts, traders and smugglers can always claim that the bear was killed out of State. So, as you can see, our conflicting web of State laws does little to deter poachers from their prey. In fact, the confusing labyrinth of laws may make it easier for poachers to slaughter still more bear.  To help bring the complex, sometimes criminal, and inhumane trade in bear parts to an end, I am once again introducing the Bear Protection Act. This legislation always has enjoyed broad, bipartisan support since I first introduced the bill in the 103rd Congress. Last year the bill passed this chamber by unanimous consent, only to be returned by the House under the blue-slip rule. I am proud to be joined by 25 original cosponsors of the bill today, including 14 Democrats, 10 Republicans and an Independent, and I hope that others soon will join me to help shepherd this important legislation to passage.  My legislation is straightforward. It prohibits the import, export, or sale of bear viscera, or any products containing bear viscera, and it imposes criminal and civil penalties for violators. Enacting a uniform Federal prohibition on the trade in bear parts is necessary to close the loopholes left open by the patchwork of State laws that have facilitated the illegal trade of bear parts in the United States and overseas.  This legislation will in no way affect the rights of sportsmen to hunt bears legally in any State. Illegal bear poaching and legal recreational hunting are separate and distinct acts. Indeed, we should remember that every bear poached for illegal profiteering of bear parts is a bear taken away from sportsmen. A former chief enforcement officer for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has estimated that approximately 40,000 bears are hunted legally each year, but an almost equal number are poached illegally. Many States understand this problem, as over two-thirds of the States that allow bear hunting also ban the trade of bear parts.  This bill is another example of what I like to call consensus conservation. The legislation does not pit hunters against environmentalists. Nor does it pit States against the heavy hand of the Federal Government on wildlife management or sporting laws. Indeed, I am happy to report that there are no political fireworks in this bill. One look at the cosponsor list should indicate that.  Instead, what we have is a bill that targets a specific legislative goal, to protect bears from illegal and inhumane poaching and black market profiteering. By carefully crafting this legislation with that single goal in mind, we have an opportunity to pass a common sense bill that is supported by wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists while protecting the autonomy of states and the rights of sportsmen.  I continue to believe that these types of targeted, bipartisan conservation efforts that are rooted in consensus goals, rather than conflicting politics, can, in the end, make the most noticeable strides toward protecting our national wildlife and environmental treasures.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record, and I further ask unanimous consent that the Record include letters of support from the Humane Society of the United States, the Society for Animal Protective Legislation, and the American Zoo and Aquarium Association.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1125       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of      2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown      bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant      panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or      II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered      Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249);       (2)(A) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES      may adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions      for trade, taking, possession, or transport of species listed      on Appendix I or II; and       (B) the Parties to CITES adopted a resolution in 1997      (Conf. 10.8) urging the Parties to take immediate action to      demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts;       (3)(A) thousands of bears in Asia are cruelly confined in      small cages to be milked for their bile; and       (B) the wild Asian bear population has declined      significantly in recent years as a result of habitat loss and      poaching due to a strong demand for bear viscera used in      traditional medicines and cosmetics;       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed      that American bears have been poached for their viscera;       (5) while most American black bear populations are      generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could      stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the      demand for bear viscera increases; and       (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United      States and exportation from the United States, as well as      prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera      and products containing, or labeled or advertised as      containing, bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the      United States does not contribute to the decline of any bear      population as a result of the commercial trade in bear      viscera.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term      viability of the world's 8 bear species by--       (1) prohibiting interstate and international trade in bear      viscera and products containing, or labeled or advertised as      containing, bear viscera;       (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to      eliminate such trade; and       (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with      respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products      containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear      viscera.

SEC. 8. CERTAIN RIGHTS NOT AFFECTED.       Except as provided in section 5, nothing in this Act      affects--       (1) the regulation by any State of the bear population of      the State; or       (2) any hunting of bears that is lawful under applicable      State law (including regulations).                                  ____          HSUS Statement in Support of the Bear Protection Act       The Humane Society of the United States, the nation's      largest animal protection organization with over seven      million members and constituents, strongly supports Senator      McConnell's Bear Protection Act.       The Bear Protection Act would eliminate the patchwork of      state laws in the U.S. and improve protection of America's      bears. Thirty-four states already ban commerce in bear      viscera. The remaining states fall into three categories: six      allow trade in gallbladders taken from bears legally killed      in-state; eight allow trade in gallbladders from bears killed      legally outside the state; and two states do not have      pertinent laws. This current patchwork of state laws creates      loopholes that are exploited by those engaged in the bear      parts trade. The loopholes enable poachers to launder      gallbladders through states that permit their sale. The Bear      Protection Act would eliminate this patchwork of state laws,      replacing it with one national law prohibiting import,      export, and interstate commerce in bear viscera.       Bear viscera, particularly the gallbladder and bile, have      been traditionally used in Asian medicines to treat a variety      of illnesses, from diabetes to heart disease. Today, bear      viscera is also used in cosmetics and shampoos. Asian demand      for bear viscera and products has increased with growing      human populations and increased wealth. Bear gallbladders in      South Korea are worth more than their weight in gold,      potentially yielding a price of about $10,000 each.       While demand for bear viscera and products has grown, Asian      bear populations have dwindled. Seven of the eight extant      species of bears are threatened by poaching to supply the      increasing market demand for bear viscera and products. Most      species of bears, and all Asian bear species, are afforded      the highest level of protection under the Convention on      International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and      Flora (CITES). CITES has noted that the continued illegal      trade in bear parts and derivatives of bear parts undermines      the effectiveness of the Convention and that if CITES parties      do not take action to eliminate such trade, poaching may      cause declines of wild bears that could lead to the      extirpation of certain populations or even species.       Dwindling Asian bear populations have caused poachers to      look to American bears to meet market demand for bear parts      and products. While each year nearly 40,000 American black      bears are legally hunted in thirty-six states and Canada, it      is estimated that roughly the same number are illegally      poached each year, according to a former chief law      enforcement officer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.       The U.S. Senate passed this legislation in the 106th      Congress and we hope swift action will be taken again this      year. We also hope that the House will follow the Senate's      wise lead and act to protect bears across the globe before      it's too late. The Humane Society of the United States      applauds Senator McConnell and the quarter of the United      States Senate that has signed onto the Bear Protection Act as      original cosponsors. With Senator McConnell's leadership,      there may come a day when bear poachers and bear parts      profiteers no longer are able to ply their cruel trade      unpunished.                                  ____                 Bear Protection Act Is Urgently Needed       The Society for Animal Protective Legislation strongly      supports Senator Mitch McConnell in his effort to pass the      Bear Protection Act once again. This bill would end the      United States' involvement in the trade of bear viscera by      prohibiting the import, export and interstate commerce in      bear gallbladders and bile. Bears are targeted for their      internal organs, which fetch enormous profits for the      poachers who illegally kill them and the merchants who sell      their organs for use in traditional medicine remedies.       The insatiable, growing demand for bear viscera contributed      mightily to the decimation of the Asiatic black bear and may      do the same to the stable population of American black bears      if a law is not passed to eliminate the United States' role      in supplying this devastating bear parts trade.       There is a price on the head of every bear in this country      and Senator Mitch McConnell deserves high praise for      introducing proactive legislation protecting bears from the      looming threat of the gallbladder trade.       The current patchwork of state laws addressing the trade in      bear gallbladders and bile allows an illegal trade to      flourish. It is impossible to distinguish visually the      dissociated gallbladder of one state's black bear from      another. This enables smugglers to acquire gallbladders      illegally in one state, transport them to a state where      commercialization of bear parts is legal, and sell the      gallbladders under false pretenses. These gallbladders are      also smuggled out of the country, providing a laundering      opportunity for the sale of gallbladders from highly      endangered bears.       Enactment of Senator McConnell's Bear Protection Act will      ensure that those who seek to profit by the reckless      destruction of America's bears can be punished appropriately      for their illegal and immoral activity.       Mr. McConnell's bill does not impact a state's ability to      manage its resident bear population or a lawful hunter's      ability to hunt bears in accordance with applicable state      laws and regulations. The Bear Protection Act is not about      bear hunting--it's about ending bear poaching. This is a      laudable goal that all Americans should support.       American citizens should not sit by helplessly while bears      are slaughtered, their gallbladders ripped out and the      carcass unceremoniously left to rot. It's time to take a      stand against bear poachers and profiteers. Congratulations      to Senator McConnell for taking up the charge.                                  ____                        American Zoo and Aquarium Association,                                 Silver Spring, MD, June 26, 2001.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing on behalf of the 196      accredited members of the American Zoo and Aquarium      Association (AZA) in support of your proposed Bear Protection      Act of 2001.       AZA institutions draw over 135 million visitors annually      and have more than 5 million zoo and aquarium members who      provide almost $100 million in support. Collectively, these      institutions teach more than 12 million people each year in      living classrooms, dedicate over $50 million annually to      education programs, invest over $50 million annually to      scientific research and support over 1,300 field conservation      and research projects in 80 countries.       In addition, AZA member institutions have established the      Species Survival Plan (SSP) program--a long-term plan      involving genetically-diverse breeding, habitat preservation,      public education, field conservation and supportive research      to ensure survival for many threatened and endangered      species. Currently, AZA member institutions are involved in      96 different SSP programs throughout the world, including      four species of bear--sloth, sun, spectacled and the giant      panda.       It is in this context that AZA expresses its support for      the Bear Protection Act. There is little question that most      populations of the world's eight bear species have      experienced significant declines during this century,      particularly in parts of Europe and Asia. Habitat loss has      been the major reason for this decline, although overhunting      and poaching have also been factors in some cases, especially      in Asia. In recent years, the commercial trade of bear body      parts, in particular gallbladders and bile, for use in      traditional Asian medicines has been implicated as the      driving force behind the illegal hunting of some bear      populations. Analyses by the US Fish and Wildlife Service      (USFWS), TRAFFIC and other organizations have documented the      existence of illicit commercial markets and smuggling rings      for bear body parts.       Recent information suggests that this is not only an      overseas issue but a domestic one as well. The American black      bear is listed on Appendix II of CITES due to the similarity      of appearance to other listed bear species, and conservation      and management of black bear populations remains largely in      the hands of the states. Most states prohibit commercial      trade in bear parts but there are some states that still      allow commercial trade of products from bears taken within      their borders. Several other states do not explicitly      prohibit the commercial trade in parts from bears taken      within the borders of other jurisdictions. This has raised      concerns that inconsistent state laws may facilitate illegal      trade and laundering of bear parts.       The relatively high value of the wild bear parts,      particularly viscera, on the international market warrants      that continued action be taken to minimize the threat or      potential threat of illegal trade. Your bill provides the      necessary first step for closing the potential loopholes that      are afforded to bear poachers and dealers by fragmented state      laws. Equally important, the bill encourages dialogue between      the U.S. and countries known to be leading importers,      exporters, and consumers of bear viscera in an attempt to      coordinate efforts to protect threatened and endangered bear      populations worldwide.       AZA applauds your efforts in this important wildlife      conservation matter. In addition, AZA stands ready to work      with you to ensure that the necessary funds are authorized      and appropriate for the effective administration and      enforcement of this critical work.       Please feel free to contact AZA if you have any question or      comments.           Regards,                                                 Sydney J. Butler,                                               Executive Director.                                 ______                                       By
