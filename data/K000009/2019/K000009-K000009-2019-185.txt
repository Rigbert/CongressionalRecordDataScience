A veteran, civic leader, and philanthropist who never forgot his roots. He persevered in uplifting the economic, civic, and cultural life of our region.  Steve was born on May 3, 1934 to Virginia Secor Stranahan and Duane Stranahan, Sr. His father was the only child of Frank D. Stranahan, who with his brother R.A. Stranahan, Sr., formed the Champion Spark Plug Co. The product was regarded as the finest in the world during its time, and its dependability contributed to U.S. victory in World War II. Steve's mother grew up in the Old West End, her father a Toledo resident since the 1850s and a prominent banker. She helped found the Junior League of Toledo and the League of Women Voters in Perrysburg.  Steve attended Maumee Valley Country Day School, Brooks School in North Andover, and Dartmouth College, where he majored in music.  He served as a specialist in the 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment of the Ohio Army National Guard.  Steve's first job was in the marketing department of the legendary Champion Spark Plug and where he worked his way up to serve as the director of the company.  An entrepreneurial, creative business leader, he found an opportunity to buy a small airport at Telegraph and Alexis roads, National Airport, and operated National Flight Services, which later moved to Toledo Express Airport as a fixed-base operator. He became a dealer of Beechcraft airplanes, tracing his affinity for flight back to his father, who was a pioneer of Champion's spark plugs for aircraft.  Throughout the 1960s, Steve took the mantra of community wide leadership and became a rising civic leader, serving as president of Downtown Toledo Associates, the Toledo Area Chamber of Commerce, and Civic Pride Inc., which owned the Toledo Blades hockey team.  In 1964, he, along with Ned Skeldon, Willard I. Webb III, and Henry Morse, arranged for the return of the minor league baseball team--the Mud Hens--to Toledo.  Steve joined Paul Block, Jr., Ned Skeldon, and Thomas Anderson to form Clear Water Inc. to campaign for cleaning up the Lake Erie watershed. His firm, Riverview One, erected Fiberglas Tower in downtown Toledo and he was a leader in Arrowhead Park, a Maumee business development.  A pianist himself, he took his love of music and applied it to the Toledo Symphony, an institution his paternal grandmother, Marie Celeste Stranahan, helped to found. Having served as a long-time board member and board president of the Toledo Symphony, he stressed financial prudence and Steve and his wife were recognized in 2015 by the Toledo Symphony for their stewardship of the institution.  Steve's overarching influence was most impactful on the University of Toledo, having served as chairman of the Board of Trustees and as chairman of the University of Toledo Foundation trustees. His insistence on having an endowment fund set up for the University and his leadership through much of the institutional growth helped transform the University of Toledo from a municipal school to a state university.  Toledo has been blessed with his life as a rare leader. Though an ``Ivy League'' success story, he dedicated his substance to the advancement of life for all in the Toledo area.  Steve will ultimately be remembered for his dedication not only to his family, but the family of greater Toledo. On behalf of a grateful community, please let me offer his wife Ann Anderson Stranahan, his children Frances Parry, Abbot Stranahan Ward, Stephen ``Josh'' Stranahan and Daniel Stranahan, his eight grandchildren and great-grandson, his sister Mary Stranahan and brothers Michael, George, and Duane ``Pat'' Stranahan, Jr., and his many friends and associates our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories and lasting accomplishments of Steve, and of his inspirational role in bettering our way of life. His legacy lives on.                          ____________________
