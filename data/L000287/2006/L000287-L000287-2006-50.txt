Mr. Speaker, 38 years ago Martin Luther King, Jr., was taken by from us by an assassin's bullets. He had gone to Memphis, Tennessee to call for economic justice for working people in America and for the sanitation workers there.  Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to find the right words to express my feelings about Martin Luther King, Jr. He was a man, my friend. He was my inspiration, my leader, my colleague, and my brother.  Martin Luther King, Jr., more than any other American of the 20th century had the power to bring people together to do good, black and white, rich and poor, young and old, Protestant, Catholic and Jews.  He could inspire with his words, with his vision, and his leadership. He could fill ordinary people with the extraordinary vision that they had the power to build a new, more fair, more just America.  His message was love. His weapon was truth. His method was creative nonviolence. And his goal, Mr. Speaker, was the Beloved Community, a community of justice, a Nation at peace with itself. In a sense he spoke a strange language, a philosophy of passive resistance to evil and the use of nonviolence in the struggle for good.  He was far too advanced in his concepts of love and peace for the violent times in which he lived, perhaps too advanced for us to understand even today. But, Mr. Speaker, the assassins of Martin Luther King, Jr., did not kill the dream of peace. They did not kill the dream of an open society. They did not kill the dream of a Beloved Community.  The movement that Martin Luther King, Jr., led was too right. It was too necessary to be buried with his body. We know that his voice was stilled 38 years ago today, but his message of love, of peace, and of the good society continue to resonate all around the world.  Mr. Speaker, we here in the people's House, we know that Dr. King's dream has not been fulfilled. But that is why it must be our task to renew our commitment to the values of his vision, the values of peace, love and justice.  If Dr. King were here today he would say we must find a way to support courageous legislation, legislation that will redirect the priorities and the tremendous resources of this Nation, not to oppress but to uplift, not to divide but to bring together, not to enslave but to set free. He would say we must use the resources of this great Nation, our talents, our minds, and our votes to work for the good of all humankind.  Through the life of Martin Luther King, Jr., through his noble efforts, he injected new meaning and new dignity into the very veins of our society. We are a better people. We are a better Nation because he lived.                          ____________________[Page H1398]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  REMEMBERING MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
