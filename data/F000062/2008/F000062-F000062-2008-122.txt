 President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator Stevens and Senator Akaka to offer a bill that takes a major step forward in protecting our Nation's food supply. This bill will provide penalties for those who are caught trying to slaughter ``nonambulatory'' or downed animals for food, and will improve public notification procedures for voluntary food recalls.  First, this bill would ban the slaughter of ``nonambulatory'' animals for use in food.  Second, it would establish a graduated penalty system providing incentives for slaughter facilities to follow the law regarding nonambulatory animals; and; third, in the event of a meat or poultry recall, it would direct the USDA to release the names of establishments that have received the recalled products so consumers can more easily identify products that could be harmful.  Animals that are sick and too weak to stand or walk on their own should not be slaughtered and used for food.  The safety of our food supply is too important to take any chances.  Processing downed animals poses a health risk especially to vulnerable populations, those who have compromised immune systems, and the very young and elderly who rely on our Government food inspection system to protect them against foodborne illness.  On February 17, 2008, the Westland/Hallmark Meat Company in Chino, CA, issued a recall of over 143 million pounds of beef products that were processed at their plant.  This came after the Humane Society of the U.S. released a video showing workers abusing nonambulatory cows to get them on their feet for slaughter.  The recall brought to the forefront the risk associated with processing sick or injured animals for human consumption.  The potential health risk of slaughtering downed animals became a public concern in late 2003 when a cow imported from Canada was found to have BSE, mad cow disease.  In an effort to keep BSE infected beef out of the food supply, USDA banned all nonambulatory cattle from being slaughtered regardless of the reason.  Since then, the regulation banning nonambulatory cattle from slaughter has been revised to allow USDA veterinarians discretion on a case-by-case basis to allow downed cattle into the food supply.  Clearly, establishments have an incentive to keep all the animals delivered to their facility ambulatory for slaughter.  This legislation provides the incentive for an establishment to follow the laws and regulations governing the humane handling of nonambulatory animals by offering a graduated penalty system for noncompliance.  For a first violation, in addition to temporarily suspending USDA inspection, a fine will be assessed and will be based on a percentage of the establishment's gross income.  A second violation will suspend USDA inspection services for 1 year.  A third violation will withdraw the establishment's Grant of Inspection permanently, effectively closing the operation.  Additionally, to aid in recovering all of the meat products that are recalled, the USDA will be required to promulgate regulation to release the names of establishments that have received recalled products.  This will help distributors, retailers and consumers better identify products that have been recalled to aid them in getting those products off their shelves and out of their homes.  We must ensure that those who process our food provide the safest, most wholesome products possible to consumers, and when a recall is necessary, we must provide the best notification systems for consumers to take action.  This bill will take us one step closer to a safer more wholesome food supply system.  I hope that my colleagues will join us in support of this important bill.                                 ______                                       By
