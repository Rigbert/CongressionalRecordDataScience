 President, I wish to take a few moments to speak about an amendment that I will be offering as part of the Keystone Pipeline legislation. It is an extremely simple, straightforward amendment. It is a brief amendment, but it basically raises a very fundamental issue, and that issue is whether the Senate will abide by scientific evidence, will come down on the side of science as we debate this enormously important issue of climate change.  The amendment is very brief, and I wish to read it and then explain why I believe it is such an important amendment. This is what it says:       It is the sense of Congress that Congress is in agreement      with the opinion of virtually the entire worldwide scientific      community that, No. 1, climate change is real; No. 2, climate      change is caused by human activities; No. 3, climate change      has already caused devastating problems in the United States      and around the world; No. 4, a brief window of opportunity      exists before the United States and the entire planet suffer      irreparable harm; and No. 5, it is imperative that the United      States transform its energy system away from fossil fuels and      toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy as rapidly as      possible.  That is it. That is the entire amendment. I would say that for the scientific community around the world, there is nothing in that statement that smacks of controversy. These are simple statements of fact, agreed to by the overwhelming majority of scientists who have written and studied climate change.  Climate change is, in fact, one of the great threats facing our country and the entire planet. It has the capability of causing severe harm to our economy, to the food supply, to access to water, and to national security.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--the leading international scientific body on this issue--reported yet again this past fall that ``warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level.''  More than 97 percent of the scientific community in the United States and across the globe agrees with these findings, including, among many other organizations, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, the American Meteorological Society, and the American Geophysical Union, to name just a few. In fact, at least 37 American scientific organizations, 118 international scientific organizations and national academies, and 21 medical associations all agree that climate change is real and is being caused by human activities.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of 37 American scientific organizations, 135 international scientific organizations, 21 medical associations, and some religious and teacher organizations that understand that climate change is real and that it is caused by human activity.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Virtually every major scientific organization in this      country and throughout the world have said that climate      change is real, climate change is caused by carbon emissions      and human activity, and that climate change is already      causing devastating problems in the United States of America      and around the world.       This list includes at least:       37 American scientific organizations, 135 international      scientific organizations, 21 medical associations, 4      religious organizations.                  37 American scientific organizations       American Anthropological Association, American Association      for the Advancement of Science, American Association of      Geographers, American Association of State Climatologists,      American Astronomical Society, American Chemical Society,      American Fisheries Society, American Geophysical Union,      American Institute of Biological Sciences, American Institute      of Physics, American Meteorological Society, American      Physical Society, American Quaternary Association, American      Society for Microbiology, American Society of Agronomy,      American Society of Plant Biologists, American Statistical      Association, Association of American Geographers, Association      of Ecosystem Research Centers, Botanical Society of America,      California Academy of Sciences.
