President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that will implement the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Protocol). This bill is part of my ongoing effort to refine American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests and does not serve to encumber small companies seeking to expand into international markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty, thereby helping American businesses to create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process. This bill is one of many measures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to ensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in today's world of changing technology and complex international markets.  In addition to this legislation, I have introduced the Trademark Law Treaty Implementing and Registration Simplification Act, which will bring U.S. trademark law into conformance with the Trademark Law Treaty. The Trademark Law Treaty will simplify trademark registration requirements around the world by establishing a list of maximum requirements which Treaty member countries can impose on trademark applicants. All American businesses, and particularly small American businesses, will benefit as a result.  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation authorizing the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other intellectual property rights.  Moreover, I supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, which was passed last Congress, to provide intellectual property rights holders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of famous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive quality.  Together, these measures represent major steps in our efforts to refine American trademark law to ensure that it serves to promote American interests.  Currently, in order for American companies to protect their trademarks abroad, they must register their trademarks in each and every country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple countries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a process which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American companies seeking international trademark protection. This legislation will ease the registration burden by enabling American businesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries with a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office.  Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Agreement) has provided an international trademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the Protocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained terms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In 1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which corrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American participation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, applications for international trademark extension can be completed in English; formerly, applications were required to be completed in French. It should be noted that the Protocol will not require substantive changes to American trademark law, hence the implementing legislation I introduce today is identical to the legislation that passed the House on May 5, 1998 and only would make those technical changes to American law necessary to bring the U.S. into conformity with the Protocol.  To date, the Administration has resisted accession to the treaty because of voting rights disputes with the European Union, which has sought to retain an additional vote for itself as an intergovernmental entity, in addition to the votes of its member states. I support the Administration's efforts to negotiate a treaty based upon the equitable and democratic principle of one-state, one-vote. However, in anticipation of the eventual resolution of this dispute, the Senate has the opportunity to act now to make the technical changes to American trademark law so that once this voting dispute is satisfactorily resolved and the U.S. accedes to the Protocol, ``one-stop'' international trademark registration can become an immediate reality for all American trademark applicants.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2191       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
