Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I know this is a very hard and difficult time for the gentleman and for all of us, and for the people of Hawaii.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution remembering the life and the work of our colleague, the gentlewoman from Hawaii, Patsy Mink. Patsy was beautiful and smart. I loved this woman. I loved Patsy Mink. Sometimes on this floor when Patsy was sitting here, I would just walk over and say, hello, Patsy, how are you? What are you thinking about?  I first met Patsy when she was a keynote speaker at a Democratic convention during the 1960s. Patsy was one of the most liberal and most progressive Members of this Congress.                              {time}  2030  When Patsy spoke, she spoke from her soul. She spoke from her heart. She had the capacity to get our attention and hold our attention when she stepped in the well of this House. She spoke with passion. Determined, dedicated and committed, Patsy was a fighter. She fought for civil rights, social justice and equality. She was a champion of education. Patsy stood by her convictions. She would not yield to the prevailing wind. She did not put her fingers into the air to see which way the wind was blowing.  Patsy will be forever missed. We will miss her as a Nation and as a people. We will never be so lucky, not so blessed to see her likeness again.  Mr. Speaker, when the Master created Patsy Mink, he threw away the mold. May the mercy and the grace of God be with her family and with all of us.
