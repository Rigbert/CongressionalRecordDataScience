President, this may be the last day of Senate activity before we take a recess for August. In that recess, both major political parties will have their conventions in Boston and New York. Members will be back home in their States, some campaigning, some spending time with their families--a period of time we all look forward to each year. However, we leave this Senate with a great deal of unfinished business.  This morning, Governor Tom Kean, a former Governor of New Jersey, and Congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana gave a briefing to Members of the Senate on the 9/11 Commission Report. Let me say at the outset that those two individuals, Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, as well as every member of this Commission, performed a great service for the United States of America. They have produced a report which, frankly, is a bargain. They were given an appropriation of some $15 million, they had 80 staff people, and over a very short period of time by congressional standards did a more thorough analysis of the events leading up to September 11 than any analysis that has been done by a congressional committee. They did it in a bipartisan fashion, an analytical fashion, and they did it not looking for someone to blame or someone to assign responsibility but, rather, to learn so they would learn as a Commission and we would learn as a nation how to make America safer.  As Governor Kean this morning went through this Commission report, he outlined all of the occurrences, starting with the initial bombing of the World Trade Center many years ago, that led up to September 11. As he read the list, it went longer and longer and longer, all of the clear evidence we had accumulated of activities by al-Qaida and other terrorists threatening the United States of America. When you heard this list, you reached the same conclusion he did; that is, why didn't we see it coming?  There was so much evidence leading in that direction. Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton said many of our leaders, many of our agencies, many Members of Congress, and many American people were still thinking about the threat and danger of our world in terms of a cold war. Now we were facing a new danger, a danger which was not obvious to us, and very few people were prescient enough to see it coming.  He talked about how these al-Qaida terrorists on 9/11, with a budget of less than half a million dollars, managed to see weaknesses in our system of security, that they could bring a 4-inch bladed knife on a plane but not a 6-inch bladed knife. All they needed was a 4-inch knife. They used box cutters. They came on planes and threatened the crews and commandeered the aircraft. They knew the doorways to the pilots' cabin were not reinforced or locked. They put all this together into this hideous plan of theirs to crash airplanes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Well, the facts were there for us to see, and most of us missed it. But this Commission said: We need to look beyond that. We need to look to the next question: What should we be doing to make certain America is safer? What should we have learned from 9/11? And they identified several areas.  Congressman Hamilton said: We need more imagination. At one point he said--I suppose halfway in jest--we should have been reading more Tom Clancy novels and thinking about possibilities rather than just analyzing the way things had always been. We needed to make sure we developed imagination, developed a program that could respond to these new threats, capabilities. And we needed to make certain we had done everything we could to organize and manage our Government assets so they could be used most effectively.  Our friends in the military understand that. It is the reason why the United States of America has the best military in the world. About 10 years ago, Senator Goldwater and Congressman Nichols proposed some dramatic reforms in the military and its management to try to stop this competition among the branches in the military and bring them together, and it has worked. This cooperative effort has made our military even that much better today.  Well, this Commission report suggests we need to do the same thing when it comes to the 15 different intelligence agencies across our Government that are responsible for collecting and analyzing information, to warn us of dangers ahead. Fifteen different agencies, with many extremely talented people, some with the most sophisticated technology in the world, but often dealing with obstacles and hurdles between agencies that should not exist.  They gave us examples: that one agency would know of the 19 terrorists on 9/11 and that many of them were dangerous people, but it was not communicated to the Federal Aviation Administration to keep them off airplanes; that we would establish standards which said: If you were identified by our Government as a dangerous person, we are going to search your baggage, but we are not going to stop you from getting on a plane. All of these things suggest we need to be smarter and better and tougher in the future.  The proposals they came up with are going to be controversial. They will be discussed at length by Members of Congress and a lot of others. But they are on the right track.  First: to give to one person new authority over these intelligence agencies. Senator Feinstein of California, my colleague, has one approach. The Commission has another approach. But the idea is to vest in that person more authority to get the job done.  Second: to force together all these different agencies, 15 different agencies, into a counterterrorism network that works and cooperates. That is something that is long overdue.  And then, third: to look at Congress, because we have a role in this, too. Congress did not do as good a job as it could have done. We have a Senate Intelligence Committee, of which I am proud to be a part, and the House Intelligence Committee. But we need more oversight. We need to be able to develop the skills, with staff and our own commitment, to ask hard questions of these intelligence agencies, to ask what they are doing, whether they are being imaginative enough, whether they are cooperating with other agencies.  We need to ask hard questions about the appropriations for these agencies. I happen to serve on the Intelligence Committee and on the Appropriations Committee. So I sat through both hearings recently. I will tell you what happened in our Appropriations Committee hearing. It was a meeting of the Defense Subcommittee, in the closed room upstairs.  Then-Director of the CIA George Tenet presented a lengthy analysis of the intelligence threats to the United States, about 150 pages, and went through it. On about page 110, he started talking about the appropriations. That is what we were there for. We were there to discuss the money needed for our intelligence operations. But the first 110 out of 150 pages were all about the threats around the world and how serious they might be.  When it came time for members of the Appropriations subcommittee toask questions, they dwelled on the front part of Mr. Tenet's presentation, the first 110 pages. They dwelled on questions related to threats to the United States.  I am way down the line on that committee. By the time it came, an hour and a half later, to my questions, I said to Director Tenet: May I ask you a question about your appropriations? It was the first question asked about that at that hearing. We spent less than 10 minutes asking about the money that was to be spent and why.  My question to Director Tenet at the time was: What is the most significant part of your budget? How has it changed from last year? And why do we need it?  Well, that is an obvious question in any Appropriations hearing. But we never got to it until extremely late in the hearing. We can do better.  One of the suggestions from Congressman Hamilton is to look for a joint Intelligence Committee between the House and the Senate. There is only one viable analogy, when we did the same thing with atomic energy 40 years ago. No one in Congress today served at that time. It would be interesting to see how it worked.  Another is to give to the Senate Intelligence Committee and House Intelligence Committee authorizing-appropriating authority. For most people following this debate, this sounds so arcane it does not sound important, but it is: to give to one committee the authority to look at the programs and how they are working and then look at the budget and see how it matches up. That is important.  We need to expand the Senate Intelligence Committee staff. We do not have enough people. How can we possibly keep track of 15 different agencies, thousands of employees, the reaches of these agencies into countries all around the world, in the heavens above and the Earth below, and do this with literally a handful of staff people?  On the Senate Intelligence Committee, which I have served on for 4 years, I have one staff person whom I share with another Senator. That is not good enough. Part-time staff will not do the job.  Again, let me say, the 9/11 Commission report is a great service to America. The men and women who spent the time to make it a reality deserve our thanks and praise. President Bush was right yesterday. This is not a matter of blaming President Clinton or blaming President Bush. We are called on, as Members of Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, to think of ways to change the law to make America safer. I think that is what people across America expect of us.  Let me tell you what we can do today in a bipartisan fashion. We are hours away from leaving. We will be off, as I said, for the August recess. We will leave behind this Senate Calendar of pending legislation. On the back page of this calendar, the first item: the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It has been on this calendar since June 17--over a month now. We will leave town. We will leave Washington for 6 weeks, without passing the Homeland Security appropriations bill.  We should have done that a long time ago. We should be moving toward a conference to make sure that when October 1 comes, the new fiscal year, we are ready to move, we are ready to send the resources that are necessary not only to the Department of Homeland Security but to State and local first responders. That is a critical issue.  Let me give you an example. The President's budget request for Homeland Security has a total appropriation of $32.6 billion. This is a 7.7-percent increase over last year. In the House of Representatives, they appropriated $33.1 billion, slightly more than the Senate. But the problem is within the appropriations request itself.  President Bush's budget request for the Department of Homeland Security represents a dramatic cut of $1 billion in money for State and local first responders. I have said it repeatedly, God forbid another act of terrorism hits the United States. People in the streets of America are not likely to look for the number of the White House or of the Senate. They will dial 911. They will be looking for first responders in their community.  When we cut money, as the President's budget does, for State and local first responders, we are shortchanging our line of defense, our hometown line of defense against terrorism.  When you make these cuts to these State and local units of government, let me give you an example of some of what we in Illinois and other places may find at risk.  We need the money that has been cut in the President's budget for homeland security. We need it to specially train and equip local and State teams, firefighters, policemen, medical responders. We need it for interoperable communications.  I was surprised to learn a few years ago that in my State of Illinois, with 12.5 million people, there is no single network for the police and firefighters and ambulance services and hospital trauma centers to communicate. They each have different radio systems, different frequencies. What is wrong with this picture? We need them all together. If something should happen in my State or in a neighboring State, in South Carolina, wherever it happened to be, the first responders in that State should have a common communications system. When President Bush's budget cuts money for State and local responders, it reduces the likelihood that we can develop those systems. We need standardized training, methods to share intelligence, and we need mutual aid plans.  Most people, when they think of dangers and threats in the State of Illinois, automatically think of the great city of Chicago that may be a target. I hope it never happens. We had an exercise 2 years ago to try to simulate what might happen if we had such a tragedy. We quickly learned that if something did happen, we would need a dramatic increase of first responders, that the existing police and firefighters in Chicago and most major cities were inadequate to the task. We would almost have to double their numbers. That means reaching out to surrounding communities in mutual aid, so if it is a situation in downtown Chicago or in a suburban area, surrounding units would come to their assistance. That is done today over and over again across America. When the tornado hit Utica, IL, a few months ago, they had fire departments and first responders from all over the region coming together. But in order to make this mutual aid happen, we need money for the State and local responders to develop it. That line in the budget was cut by President Bush. It needs to be restored by Congress. We need to do that before we go home.  Within this same Senate calendar, you will also find other provisions of homeland security, such as a provision to increase the safety and security of nuclear powerplants. We have six nuclear powerplants in Illinois. These are important for us. They provide more than half of our electricity. They need better protection. We need better coordination of the fire and police and medical units around them.  We also have in our State--and it is probably the reason why we have been as prosperous as we have throughout our history--so much transportation, intermodal facilities. I visited at the old Joliet arsenal out in the area where Shell is. All of these trainyards and interstate highways--each one of them is vulnerable and needs to have special protection. We are a significant source of our Nation's food supply. We have many great universities.  Our State is not unique. Virtually every State can tell the same story of areas where we need to focus our attention and resources. We have these four bills on the calendar that would address some aspects.  One of the bills provides for greater security and defense of nuclear power facilities. That is one that is obvious. We will leave the Senate today without enacting that legislation and moving it to conference committee.  We also have a provision for the chemical industry. Obviously, here is a part of the private sector that is really vulnerable. Legislation has been developed to make it safer, and it sits on the calendar while we spend our time spinning our wheels on the Senate floor.  The same thing for our ports with the thousands of containers that come in on a daily basis, and our rail facilities. Each one of these areas has a special piece of legislation on this calendar that we have failed to address as we leave to go on our August recess. Ihope there won't come a moment in the next 6 weeks when we look back and say: We really should have done our work. We should have spent less time on the Senate floor embroiled in these political debates that spin our wheels and go nowhere and more time doing things people care about.                        Further Important Issues  I have devoted this period of time in my speech on the 9/11 Commission report and homeland security, but I will say that we are remiss if we leave Washington without thinking of other issues that have a direct impact on the families and businesses across America. Some are extremely obvious. Pick a State. Pick a city. Go to any business, large or small, and ask them their No. 1 headache today. It is likely that most will respond: The cost of health insurance. It is a cost which is crippling businesses, denying coverage to many people, it continues to go up and out of sight, and reduces protection for the people who are supposed to be helped.  What have we done in Washington in the Senate on the issue of the affordability of quality health care and health insurance? Absolutely nothing. We don't even talk about it. We act as if it is not a problem. It is the No. 1 complaint of businesses and unions and families in Illinois. How can this representative body, charged with changing the laws and making life better in America, have a session that is void of any meaningful debate on the cost and availability of quality health care? We will have done that. We will adjourn without having seriously considered it.  The second issue is the state of the economy, whether we are prepared to help those industries which have struggled during the last recession, particularly manufacturing, whether our trade laws are adequately enforced, whether we are training and equipping the workforce of the future.  The third issue is obvious to most: What are we going to do about energy? Are we going to continue to be dependent for decades to come on the Middle East, drawing us into the intrigue of Saudi Arabia and those surrounding countries and all the other sources or are we going to move toward energy independence? We had a debate on an energy bill that went nowhere. Sadly, that bill didn't get very serious about the real issues. Can you imagine a debate on energy policy in America that does not even address the question of the fuel efficiency of America's cars and trucks? That was our debate. We decided, because the special interest groups, the manufacturers, and some of their workers didn't want to get into energy efficiency, that we would consider an energy bill that did not address the No. 1 area of consumption of energy in America--the fuel efficiencies of cars and trucks.  We can do better. America can have a good, strong, growing economy that is environmentally responsible and energy efficient. We have done it before, and we can do it again. What is lacking is leadership, on the floor of the Senate, in the House, and in the White House. That is critically important.  Of course, the one issue I started with is the issue that I will end with--America's security defense. As we speak on the Senate floor today, just a few minutes away by car are Walter Reed Hospital and the Bethesda Naval Medical Center. In the wards and rooms of those two great medical institutions are men and women who served our country valiantly in Iraq, many of whom suffered extremely serious injuries. I have been out with colleagues to visit with them from time to time and can't help but be impressed. They are the best and brightest in America. They are young men and women who stood up, took the oath, put on the uniform, and risked their lives for America. My heart goes out to them every day and many just like them who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and all around the world.  We have to be mindful of the fact that our situation in Iraq is a long-term commitment. No matter what you might have thought when we decided to invade Iraq--and I was one of 23 Senators who voted against the use-of-force resolution at that time--we all come together now believing that we need to provide every resource our men and women in uniform need to finish their mission and come home safely. That is something that should never be far from our minds, as well as the question of what we are going to do to make America safer here at home.  We talk about a war on terrorism, but former Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska at the 9/11 Commission meeting made an observation we should not forget. He said to Donald Rumsfeld and George Tenet, who appeared before the Commission, that it really isn't a war on terrorism. Terrorism is a tactic. The question is, Who is the enemy using the terrorism tactic? That is the real question. What should we be doing now to discover the plots and dangers across the world that might come to threaten the United States but also to reach out to the next generation in countries around the world to let them know we are a compassionate, caring people with values they can share and that their lives will be better for that.  It goes beyond military strength and intelligence. It goes into diplomacy and leadership around the world so that this country, as we may hear from time to time, is not only strong at home but respected around the world.  We can do our part. We need to reach out in different areas where we have not as much in the past. Yesterday, I spoke on the floor about the situation in the Sudan. It is a situation where literally a thousand people a day are losing their lives to what is a horrible genocide occurring in that country. We need to do more.  The United States has spent over $100 million so far in food aid. We need to be a political force, too, to push that Sudanese Government to do what is right and to work with the United Nations so that we say to the world: The United States is not interested in treasure or territory; we are a caring people, a humanitarian people who care about some of the poorest places on Earth, such as the Sudan.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
