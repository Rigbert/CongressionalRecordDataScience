Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4757, legislation renaming the North/South Center at the University of Miami after our former House colleague, the former Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Honorable Dante B. Fascell.  Dante Fascell served in the House of Representatives, from 1954-1992; I was privileged to serve with him on the Foreign Affairs Committee and witness, first-hand, his tireless efforts on behalf of the North/South Center. Given his commitment and his role as a driving force behind the creation and development of the North/South Center, H.R. 4757 is a fitting and long-overdue tribute for Dante Fascell's great work in this regard.  Mr. Speaker, most of us know that the North/South Center is an independent research and educational organization that promotes policy initiatives aimed at resolving the most critical issues facing the nations of the Western Hemisphere. The Center's research, publications, and training efforts have focused on furthering freedom and democracy, and economic development. To date, the Center's programs have benefited citizens of the Western Hemisphere by supplying significant knowledge and expertise relevant to an inter-American agenda which has grown more complex and more critical each year.  In its first eight years, the North/South Center has embraced and fostered the ideals that Dante Fascell outlined when he first envisioned the program, especially the importance of offering academic interchanges--the free exchange of views to promote understanding and cooperation--as a means to promote democracy. The Center has also proven that it is uniquely capable of assessing the increasing interdependence of the two hemispheres, the North and the South, and developing cross border policies that stress the similarities and also bridge the gaps of the countries of the Western Hemisphere. The academic and intellectual dialogues promoted by the Center have helped advance democratic ideals especially in those Western Hemisphere countries where democracy has not yet taken hold.  The North/South Center at the University of Miami has lived up to Dante's hopes and dreams, becoming a major player in helping to determine the conduct of the U.S. in our public policy for the two hemispheres. It is well respected and provides an invaluable source of research, public outreach, cooperative study, and programs of education and training on a large variety of Western Hemisphere issues.  Mr. Speaker, in 1990 the gentleman from Florida, Chairman Dante Fascell, put forth a democracy-promoting concept that today stands as a great tribute to his foresight, commitment and leadership. I am pleased to have had the privilege of serving with Mr. Fascell in this chamber and delighted to participate in honoring his accomplishments in this way. His alma mater, the University of Miami, is to be congratulated for its continued contributions through the North/South Center and for the recommendation to rename the North/South Center in Dante's behalf. It is a well-deserved recognition, and one which will make him, and all of us who served with him here in the House, very proud.                          ____________________
