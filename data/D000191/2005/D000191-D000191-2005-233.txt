Speaker, proponents of the so-called free trade agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which I opposed, have long promised endless riches for U.S. workers, farmers, businesses and the economy. Of course, they have been wrong on all counts. But they are not to be deterred. They want another bite of the apple here. They think that the American people and Members of Congress who represent them, those who have lost their jobs, seen their jobs threatened, their standard of living diminished as we have gone into massive trade deficits and exported industries overseas in pursuit of cheaper labor and lower environmental standards, that they can fool us again.  The President finished secret negotiations a year ago the end of this month for what is called the Central American Free Trade Agreement. And they are promising all the same things. I went before the Committee on Ways and Means which reluctantly, begrudgingly, allowed some of us to testify in opposition to this pending agreement.  Now, there is no legislative process. They mark up what is called a mock bill or a pretend bill or a play bill in Ways and Means. They are not allowedto amend it or change it. The President secretly negotiated it, and it will be brought to this floor for an up-or-down vote, no amendments allowed. Congress has given up all its rights as a legislative body and its constitutional rights as relate to trade agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries.  If this were in the best interests of the United States or an urgent priority, it might make sense; but what it does is perpetuate a failed and failing trade policy. The United States of America, the Bush administration, is setting a record every month this year. Congratulations to the Bush administration. They have us on track for beating last year's trade deficit of $620 billion to $720 billion, $2 billion a day borrowed from foreign interests representing tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs that have moved to China, India, Central America, Latin America, Mexico and other countries chasing the cheapest labor they can find, the most exploited labor they can find, the most environmental depredations they can find around the world.  They think that this is just working great. The President thinks that it just shows our economy is really strong. That is why we are running these huge trade deficits. So they want to replicate it closer to home so U.S. companies do not have to go all the way to China to exploit cheap labor; they could move a little closer to home in Central America.  When they offered NAFTA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted it would create 170,000 jobs in the United States. Many on that side of the aisle are still talking about all the great jobs that will come from NAFTA. Of course, and now CAFTA, it actually cost the United States 880,000 jobs. So they were off by a million jobs. That is a pretty big miss. CAFTA is likely to accelerate that trend.  They tell us, Oh, it's just that we want to sell things to Central America. Think of the massive buying power of those people in Central America. They earn $2 a day. If they devoted all of the economies to all of the countries that would be included in CAFTA, if every penny in those countries was spent on buying U.S. goods, it would equal 5 days' production in the United States of America.  No, it is not about selling U.S. goods there any more than it was about selling goods to Mexico or selling goods to China. It is creating an export platform for U.S. companies who want to move overseas and have cheaper labor and avoid environmental laws and protections in this country.  The only problem with this theory is what happens to the middle class? What happens to the working people of this country? We are larding them down with a huge foreign debt, $2 billion a day, and they are losing their jobs. How is this model sustainable? It also undermines our sovereignty. As we borrow more and more money from overseas, China, Japan and other countries, they get more and more capable of squeezing our country economically.  And it will hurt farmers. For the first time in our history, the United States of America is going to run a trade deficit in agriculture. That was going to be one of the big winners under the WTO, CAFTA, NAFTA. Oh, it's going to be great for ag. I remember having all these farmers come in, Oh, this is going to help us so much, the wheat farmers in Oregon. They were back the next year saying, You were right. The Chinese bought one shipload and that was it.  Now, they are talking about shipping wheat to the United States of America. We are going to run a trade deficit in agriculture. We are going to become not only dependent upon foreign countries to borrow money and build things that we use every day but to feed us, and we are going to ask them to lend us the money to buy the food to feed ourselves.  This is not a policy that is sustainable and in the national economic interest or the national economic security or defense interest. We need a new model for trade, not replicating the old failed model. I am pleased to see that more and more and more of my colleagues are coming around to this conclusion.  Defeat CAFTA.                          ____________________
