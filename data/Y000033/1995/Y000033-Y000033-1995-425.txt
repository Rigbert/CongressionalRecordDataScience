Mr. Speaker, today I introduce legislation which will ratify a land exchange agreement in Alaska between the U.S. Forest Service and the Kennecott Greens Creek Mining Co. [KGCMC]. This land exchange is a novel and public-spirited agreement which will provide jobs in Alaska for my constituents, promote sound economic and environmentally responsible resource development, and further the interests of land consolidation on conservation system units in the Tongass National Forest without any cost to the Federal Government. This land exchange is a true partnership between the private sector, KGCMC, and the Federal Government. In fact, the Secretary of Agriculture approved the land exchange agreement on October 26, 1994. I look forward to working with all interested parties toward the successful enactment of this legislation.  The Greens Creek Mine is located on Admiralty Island near Juneau, Alaska's capital. The mine was located under the general mining law while the area was within multiple-use lands in the Tongass National Forest. Subsequently, the area became part of the Admiralty Island National Monument through the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act [ANILCA] in 1980. Because this mine had world class potential, Congress included a special provision in ANILCA to ensure that the mine could go forward. It provided a special management regime and specific provisions to permit perfection of the mine's claims. Under this special regime, the managers of the claims were able to perfect and patent 17 claims in the Greens Creek Mine which began operation in 1989.  I remember the pride of all Alaskans when the Greens Creek Mine was opened. Unfortunately, low metal prices caused the temporary closure of the mine a year and a half ago. Since then, KGCMC has been working diligently to revise its mining development plan so that the mine can reopen in the near future. I hope that this reopening will occur soon.  The land exchange agreement is the product of a nearly 10 year effort by KGCMC to deal with one of the problems created by the special management regime in ANILCA. Although that regime permitted the perfection and patenting of 17 claims, it did not provide an adequate time for exploration of all the area with mineral potential surrounding the Greens Creeks Mine. KGCMC estimates that approximately 8,000 acres surrounding the existing mining claims are of interest geologically. This area is now closed to mineral exploration and development because it is located in the National Monument. Under normal circumstances, in an operating mining district on general Forest Service or public domain lands, KGCMC would be able to explore any such areas.  Since this area of interest has been off-limits to mineral exploration under ANILCA, KGCMC has been searching for a way to explore these areas. It has engaged in a multiyear negotiation with the Forest Service to develop a land exchange which would permit access to the area in a manner which is compatible with the monument designation provided by Congress.  The management regime provided for in ANILCA permitted the development of the Greens Creek Mine under special circumstances. The mine is an underground mine and its footprint on the surface is quite small. There is a development area with a series of buildings and surface facilities such as tailings ponds, but generally the mine is located in a manner to minimize its effect on the area. For example, there is no permanent camp or town at the mine. All workers commute by boat daily from Juneau. The terms of the land exchange require KGCMC to utilize its existing facilities to the maximum extent possible to ensure minimal change to the existing footprint. Additionally, mining in any new areas would be under the same management regime by which KGCMC developed the existing Greens Creek Mine.  Future exploration and development at Greens Creek will have minimal impact on the surface area and the mine will remain an underground operation. No open pit mining is permitted under the terms of the agreement, and the Forest Service will continue to administer the surface area just as it does now.  [[Page E619]] This land exchange also provides other major benefits to the Government, the community and the environment:  First, upon completion of mining, KGCMC's existing patented claims and any other claims which it holds on Admiralty Island will revert to the Federal Government. Although these claims cover a small area, the Forest Service considers this reversion very important to its overall general management plan within the monument.  Second, KGCMC will also fund the acquisition of 1 million dollars' worth of landholdings within the Admiralty Island National Monument and on other conservation system units in Alaska. This land acquisition process will take the form of either an exchange or the formation of a special land acquisition escrow account which would permit the Forest Service to make the acquisitions. In any case, none of these lands can be acquired except on a willing seller/ willing buyer basis.  Third, the lands to which KGCMC will acquire subsurface title also reverts to the Federal Government when mining ceases.  Fourth, finally, and most important to me, the exchange will improve chances that 250 jobs created by the mine will continue for a longer period of time once the mine reopens. While there is never any certainty in mining, KGCMC is hopeful that new ore will be discovered and mined. This would lengthen the life of the Greens Creek Mine and keep jobs generated by the mine in Juneau longer.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation I introduce today simply ratifies the land exchange agreement. It cannot be implemented without this legislation because the parties agreed that this matter should be approved by Congress. I believe that this land exchange is good for all parties involved. It helps the environment; it promotes mining in Alaska; and it encourages a good corporate citizen to continue to work toward full development of the mining area in which its claims were located under very strict and rigorous environmental requirements. I look forward to pursuing this matter in the Resources Committee and reporting this bill to the House for consideration. This is an issue which should be quickly agreed upon by all parties.                          ____________________
