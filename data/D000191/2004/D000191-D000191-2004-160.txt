Chairman, like many of my colleagues, I've been long concerned about the increasing coarseness of language and content on radio and TV.  Had I not been required to travel to Oregon for official representational purposes, I would have voted ``aye'' on H.R. 3717, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004.  We have an obligation to balance first amendment rights with our duty to ensure that programming that's accessible to children, particularly those shows that are available on network TV, is free of language and material that's inappropriate for children. A recent study by the Parents Television Council found that foul language during the so-called family hour increased by 94.8 percent between 1998 and 2002. With the average American watching nearly 4 hours of TV per day, inappropriate programming affects us all. At the same time we need to be mindful not to scare broadcasters from pulling programming that is challenging and provocative. It's also likely that the dearth in quality programming is a result of increasing corporate concentration of mass media, which is leading to a loss of accountability to local values. Congress needs to address this before community standards are driven into the ground.  H.R. 3717 would increase the fines on broadcasting obscene, indecent, or profane language to $500,000 per violation. Nonmonetary penalties could include forfeiture of broadcast licenses and producing public service announcements that serve the educational and informational needs of children and would have an audience up to five times larger than the offending broadcast.  With his inability to defend the public interest against increasingly inappropriate broadcasts, Michael Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission has forced Congress to take action. While this legislation could have been improved with new restrictions on gratuitous TV violence, this bill is a good first step towards bringing some civility back to the public airwaves. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________
