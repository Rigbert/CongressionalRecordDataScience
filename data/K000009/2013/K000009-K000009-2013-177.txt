 What is really being debated is whether we are going to trade off the science of the future, which is so essential to America's competitiveness in the global economy, to take care of necessary past cleanup. Who can make that choice? They are both essential. Are we going to sacrifice the future for the past? That's really what this debate is about.  We know that this bill is $4 billion under the administration's request and over $2 billion under what we spent in this fiscal year of 2013. So we really have an argument that nobody wins. If we fund the past cleanup, we sacrifice the future. If we sacrifice the future, do we really take care of all the past cleanup? We hardly do what's necessary, even with current funding.  So I think it's a perfect example of where the sequestration process is so counterproductive and moves America backwards. We have very imperfect choices here and actually very dangerous choices that we're being forced to make. I think the majority would be much better suited to come back to us with a budget that allows us to do the job that the Energy and Water Subcommittee is charged with doing.  We simply can't try to solve the problem internal to the resources we've been given. It's an impossibility. So somebody is going to lose; and I guarantee you in the past amendment that just came up, some of the people that were the losers have no lobbies here in Washington. The poorest people in our country, who are getting weatherization assistance in order to stay a little bit warmer in the wintertime, they just lost money. They've got no lobby here. They've got none of those people from these various nuclear sites to come in here and lobby for them. Yet they just lost out in a prior amendment.  They have a right to an existence in this country, but we are seeing inside the strictures of this set of choices that we've been given that somebody is always a loser. Actually, the country is a loser because of sequestration and the fact that our subcommittee has been given a mark so far below what is reasonable and frankly what we could do if we had a budget that allowed us to move the country forward, rather than create a can't-do Nation. We can't do science, we can't do cleanup because of what we were handed by, what, a Budget Committee whose members don't even appear on the floor to argue their positions during this debate?  I feel sorry for our country, and I feel sorry for those who have to come down here and take from one another during this debate and hurt people across this country because our allocation is simply too insufficient to meet the needs of the Nation.  So I want to thank the gentlelady for rising on this very important point ofscience of the future versus cleanup of the past, but we simply don't have the funds in this bill to do both and it puts us in a very destructive position for the interests of our Nation.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson).  The amendment was rejected.                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Takano
