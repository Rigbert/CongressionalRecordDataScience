One of my best friends in the House, who I served with on the Appropriations Committee for many years, and who greeted me when I first came to the Congress, my friend, Congressman Norm Dicks, has just recently cast his 20,000th vote in the House of Representatives. And I personally think almost every one of them was correct.  Madam Speaker, it is a testament to his distinguished record of service in this Chamber, which began on January 3, 1977, at the start of the 85th Congress. Since that date, our colleague, Norm Dicks has continued to represent the people of the Sixth Congressional District of Washington, the cities of Bremerton and Tacoma, as well as the Olympic Peninsula, as he has worked his way up to the top of the leadership of the House Appropriations Committee. As some of you know, I refer to him as the Chairman in waiting.  The expertise he has developed on defense and natural resource issues throughout those years on the committee is well known.  Madam Speaker, as I indicated, Norm Dicks now serves as our ranking Democratic Member on the Appropriations Committee, and serves with the distinguished chairman, Hal Rogers from Kentucky.  I believe I can speak for all of us, all of our Members today, in congratulating Norm on reaching this important milestone. And I think I can also say for both sides of the aisle, Norm Dicks is one of those Members who reaches across the aisle and tries to make policy in a positive way.  Norm Dicks, I think, is an example for all of us. He's become one of the few Members of the House who has had the determination and endurance to remain engaged in the people's business for so long here in the House of Representatives.  Norm, we congratulate you, not only on your 20,000th vote, but on the quality of service you have given to thisHouse, to this country, and to your district and Washington State. Congratulations.
