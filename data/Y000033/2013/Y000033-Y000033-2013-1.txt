Madam Chairman, it is amazing as I sit on this floor after 40 years of listening to so much nonsense from the other side when it comes to energy. This increase of production in the United States came from private lands and State lands, not the Federal lands, and those are the facts. And we are still not independent from oil from the Middle East that caused us disruption in our economy. To hear the same litany of words over and over again, we have to save, we can't produce, but we have to have employment. We will have a stimulus package. And, in fact, we will have more government borrowing for the economy and forget real jobs.  But I am going to talk about title V in this legislation. The Federal Lands Jobs and Energy Security Act contains a number of measures to promote energy development by and for the benefit of Indians and Alaska Natives.  Specifically, title V contains a range of measures requested by a number of Indian tribes and Alaska Native corporations to streamline burdensome Federal regulations and legal procedures that hinder exploration, development, and production of energy on their lands.  There are 56 million acres of lands held in trust by the Federal Government for the benefit of Indians, 56 million. In Alaska, there are 44 million acres, a total land mass larger than the State of California.  Many of these areas are in untapped energy resources. It is estimated that up to 10 percent or more of our Nation's energy is contained in Native lands.  The problem is that outdated Federal policies thwart the ability of tribes to use their lands for their benefit. Leases of Indian trust lands require Federal review and approval, which arguably brings little or no value to the tribes involved. If Federal review and approval of energy leases created any economic value, then private landowners and State governments would be clamoring to have their projects reviewed and approved by the Federal Government, too.  There are few better measures of how ineffective Federal supervision of Indian affairs has been than the fact that since 2010 nearly $5 billion has been paid by the government to Indians to settle Federal mismanagement of their trust lands.  While many Indian tribes and Alaska Native corporations have made great strides in building businesses and strengthening their economies, tribal communities remain at the bottom of nearly every economic and social indicator. The sad fact is in 21st-century America, severe poverty wears a Native face.                              {time}  1430  Instead of helping tribes make positive strides in energy development, the Obama administration is erecting new hurdles. The EPA canceled a valid permit for the largest tribe to operate a large power plant on its land with its coal. The Department of the Interior has proposed a hydraulic fracturing rule which makes Indian lands less competitive and less attractive to industry, again, taking away from the American Indians.  Fortunately, several tribes are seeking to shed the current Federal system altogether and to take over management of their lands and energy resources. It is these tribes which asked for the provisions in title V of the bill today.  It is with great pleasure that the standalone bill on which title V is based, H.R. 1548, has been endorsed by the National Congress of American Indians and several individual tribes.  It is time to stop treating Indian trust lands as public lands--they are not public lands; they are private lands--and increase tribes' powers of self-governance over their energy resources for the good of their members and for the good of the United States' energy security.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
