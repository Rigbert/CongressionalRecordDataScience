 For at least as long as Chairman Baucus and I have served as the leaders of the Finance Committee, and certainly during those times I was chairman, all individuals nominated by the President who were subject to the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee have been subject to a thorough and nonpartisan vetting process. In addition to filling out a detailed committee questionnaire, all nominees submit tax returns and the committee is provided with financial disclosures. The review of these documents has nothing to do with the nominee's political affiliation or policy goals.  The Finance Committee's nomination process is there to ensure basic compliance with the law and to confirm that these individuals can be trusted with the incredible responsibilities that come with public service.  My vote on this nominee will be a vote of confidence in the Finance Committee's vetting process; it is a vote for the importance of character and integrity in those who serve; and, specifically, it is a vote for treating Presidential nominees, and all people, in a consistent manner.  This nominee is not the first nominee to run aground on the Finance Committee's vetting process. There are other individuals who, after lengthy discussions with Senator Baucus, me, and committee staff, decided to withdraw from consideration.  In these situations, the Finance Committee keeps details learned during the vetting process private. In cases where the nominee decides to go forward, such as that of this nominee, the committee makes details public in the interest of transparency and good government. I believe the public's business ought to be public. Sometimes when details are disclosed the nominee is confirmed and sometimes the nominee is not confirmed. In these situations, Members have to judge the seriousness of the issues at hand, and the nominees have to judge how far they are willing to go. Consequently, if the nominee decides to move ahead, the information will be released.  However, in the past, nominees who had tax issues as serious as this nominee's, and some who have had less serious issues, have not attained Senate confirmation.  I feel it is improper to judge this nominee by a different standard. I realize that economic times are tough right now, but, if anything, that should be an incentive for us to raise our standards and not lower them.  Finally, I believe we also need to treat all people in a consistent manner. The same Internal Revenue Code applies to everyone regardless of whether someone is a well-known Wall Streeter or a student earning minimum wage. Many people around the country who have not satisfied their tax obligations have been caught by the IRS, as this nominee was for tax years 2003 and 2004. Many people end up having their houses seized, bank accounts frozen, and other assets taken by the Government to pay their tax debts. Some people even go to jail.  There are many people who settle their liabilities without going to jail or having assets seized, but can this system operate with integrity if all parts of it report to someone who was unable for a long period of time to meet his own tax obligations and only did so as a condition of his nomination?  Finally, I want to mention differences of perception of different people who have been found to have unsettled tax liabilities. During last year's Presidential campaign, we read a lot about a man named Joe the Plumber who hailed from Ohio. When this man was found to have a tax lien for State taxes, some portrayed it as evidence that his opinions on national tax policy were irrelevant. However, this nominee's tax problems have been revealed to be much larger than Joe's, and this nominee's defenders still insist he is the only man for the job of Treasury Secretary.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article discussing this inconsistency by Jonah Goldberg appearing in National Review Online be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the National Review Online, Jan. 23, 2009]                 A Free Pass for the Indispensable Man                          (By Jonah Goldberg)       During the hothouse days of the presidential campaign, Joe      Wurzelbacher became famous because he got Barack Obama to      confess that he likes to spread the wealth around. Better      known as Joe the Plumber, the Toledo, Ohio, laborer became      the target of bottomless venom and scorn because he seemed      like an obstacle to Obama's coronation.       One of the main talking points, particularly among left-     wing bloggers, was that Wurzelbacher was a tax cheat because,      it was revealed by ABC News, he had a tax lien of $1,182 for      back Ohio state taxes. This fueled the argument that he was a      fraud, his opinion didn't matter. Nothing to see here, folks.      Move along.       Fast-forward to today. Timothy Geithner, President Obama's      choice to be the next treasury secretary, quite clearly tried      to defraud the government of tens of thousands in payroll      taxes while working at the International Monetary Fund. The      IMF does not withhold such taxes but does compensate American      employees who must pay them out of pocket. Geithner took the      compensation--which involves considerable paperwork--but then      simply pocketed the money.       His explanations for his alleged oversight don't pass the      smell test. When the IRS busted him for his mistakes in 2003      and 2004, he decided to take advantage of the statute of      limitations and not pay the thousands of dollars he also      failed to pay in 2001 and 2002. That is, until he was      nominated to become treasury secretary.       Obama defends Geithner, saying that his was a ``common      mistake,'' that it is embarrassing but happens all the time.      My National Review colleague Byron York reports that, at      least according to the IMF, Geithner's ``mistakes'' are      actually quite rare. Indeed, it's almost impossible to      believe that the man didn't know exactly what he was doing      given that he would have had to sign documents, disregard      warnings, and all in all turn his brain off to make the same      ``mistake'' year after year. And keep in mind, Geithner is      supposed to run the IRS. So maybe sloppiness isn't that great      a defense anyway.       The bulk of Senate Republicans seem willing to green-light      his appointment because, in the words of many, ``he's too big      to fail.'' Wall Street likes this guy and so does Obama. So,      who cares if he breaks and bends the rules? Who cares that he      took a child-care tax credit to send his kids to summer camp?      He's the right man for the job, no one else can do it, he's      the financial industry's man of the moment.       This strikes me as both offensively hypocritical and      absurd. Obama has made much of Wall Street greed. He and his      vice president talk about paying taxes like it is a holy      sacrament. They both belittled Wurzelbacher for daring to      suggest that the Democratic Party isn't much concerned with      how the little guy can get ahead.       Heck, Obama and pretty much the entire Democratic party      insist that they speak for the little guy. But it appears      they fight for the big guys.       You would think this is a perfect moment for Republicans to      stand on principle, particularly since their votes aren't      needed to confirm Geithner. What they will tell you is that      Geithner is the indispensable man and, in the words of South      Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, ``These are not the times to      think in small political terms.''       Never mind that there's nothing small about the belief that      paying taxes in an honest fashion is a minimal requirement      for the job of treasury secretary. What's absurd is that      Geithner, who helped regulate Wall Street as head of the New      York Fed, is the indispensable man now. He may indeed be      qualified to be treasury secretary, but is he really the only      man who can do the job? Really? Everyone said the same thing      about Hank Paulson not long ago. How'd that work out?       I thought the Democrats believed the financial implosion      was caused by arrogant and greedy men who thought the rules      didn't apply to them because they were so important. I guess      they didn't mean it.
