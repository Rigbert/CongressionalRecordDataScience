 This month, Greg Jones concludes over 21 years as executive director of the non-profit Southeast Kentucky Economic Development Corporation, SKED. His daily presence at the helm of the organization will be sorely missed, but his legacy will endure in the thousands of jobs he helped create and the increased economic vigor he helped bring to the region.  When he first took the job at the behest of Congressman Hal Rogers in 1992, Greg oversaw a two-person staff and commanded a $75,000 budget. Under his leadership the organization has grown to its current staff of 10 professionals and a budget of nearly $2 million. Throughout his tenure as executive director, Greg marshaled SKED's resources to help start and expand businesses, provide training for entrepreneurs, and attract new industries to the corporation's 45-county service area. Under Greg's watch, SKED has unquestionably lived up to its stated mission--``to foster economic growth and vitality in the region.''  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing Greg's exemplary career as well as wishing him a happy retirement with his wife Belinda and son Christopher.  An article about Greg Jones's retirement from SKED recently appeared in an area newspaper, the Commonwealth Journal. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objections, the article was ordered to be printed as follows:        SKED Executive Director Greg Jones Retiring in December                    [From the Commonwealth Journal,                              Oct. 13, 2013]       Somerset, Ky.--Greg Jones, executive director of Southeast      Kentucky Economic Development Corporation (SKED), will retire      in December after more than 21 years of service to the      nonprofit organization and to Southeast Kentucky.       The longest serving executive director in the      organization's 27-year history, Jones is credited with      strengthening SKED's mission of job creation and making it      the premier economic development agency in the region.      Beginning with a $75,000 budget and two-person staff in 1992,      Jones and his current staff of 10 professionals now operate      with an annual budget of nearly $2 million.       ``I've had the privilege to lead SKED and our amazing team      of professionals for over two decades, and I am extremely      proud of our successes,'' Jones said. ``I shall forever be      grateful to Congressman Hal Rogers and the incredibly      supportive and talented individuals on the SKED Board of      Directors for giving me the opportunity to be a part of this      remarkable organization. And, finally, I wish to thank the      dedicated staff of SKED for their loyalty and friendship over      these many years.''       It was Congressman Rogers who asked Jones to head up the      grassroots effort he began, in 1986, back in 1992. At the      time, Jones was working as executive director of the      Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce.       ``Over the last two decades, Greg Jones has worked      tirelessly to recruit thousands of jobs and expand the      industrial portfolio of southern and eastern Kentucky,'' said      Rogers. ``Greg's foresight to address vital infrastructure      upgrades, recruit high-tech companies and support      entrepreneurial growth will continue to benefit economic      development in our region for years to come. While he is      moving on from daily operations at SKED, I have asked Greg to      remain in close contact to offer guidance for the      organization that he has helped mold for success. My wife      Cynthia and I wish Greg and his family many blessings in his      years of retirement.''       As SKED executive director, Jones has been responsible for      the marketing and industrial recruitment activities for the      45-county SKED service area, managing a $10-million loan      portfolio and providing economic and community development      assistance to local communities in Southeast Kentucky.       Under his leadership, SKED has successfully assisted more      than 100 businesses and industries in starting or expanding      their operations in the region. These companies now employ      more than 7,700 workers and have invested an estimated $500      million in Southeast Kentucky. He has successfully prepared      loan and grant applications totaling more than $26 million to      support the organization's job creation activities.       Building partnerships has been Jones's mantra for the past      21 years. Whether it was with local community leaders or      state and national funding agencies, Jones worked tirelessly      to form strong alliances across the region, state and nation.      One of those key partnerships is with the Appalachian      Regional Commission (ARC).       Earl Gohl, ARC federal co-chair, has worked with Jones on      several key projects in recent years.       ``Greg's leadership has made SKED what it is today,'' Gohl      said. ``What he has accomplished with the SKED      entrepreneurship program and the Valley Oak Technology      Complex has laid the groundwork for what Eastern Kentucky can      be tomorrow.''       Jones led SKED to receive designation as a Community      Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in 1999. As a      result, the organization received funding to implement      several innovative regional projects including the Valley Oak      Technology Complex, the Somerset Rail Park, the Southern      Kentucky Information Technology Center and the Enterprise      Center.       SKED received the National Association of Development      Organization's (NADO) 2002 Innovation Award in recognition of      its technology initiatives.       In 2009, SKED became a Certified Development Corporation      (CDC) by the U.S. Small Business Administration. This      designation authorized SKED to process SBA 504 loans      throughout the state of Kentucky. The 504 Loan Program is the      SBA's economic development tool to provide small-business      financing and create jobs all across America.       To date, some 250 people have received entrepreneurial      training from SKED thanks to a grant from the ARC in 2011.      SKED established the Entrepreneurial SMARTs program designed      to offer nationally acclaimed entrepreneurship classes at a      reduced rate. A CDFI grant provided the funding to hire a      professional to teach the classes.       SKED is governed by a 12-member, volunteer board of      directors. Over the past 21 years, Jones has worked with a      number of successful men and women on the board, each with      different areas of expertise and from a variety of career      fields, but all leaders in their own communities. As board      members, they share SKED's mission of job creation in      Southeast Kentucky.       SKED President Tim Barnes is one of those community      leaders. President and CEO of Hometown Bank, he's led the      SKED Board of Directors for the past three years.       ``Greg has been the face of SKED for so long, it's hard to      imagine ever being able to replace him,'' Barnes said.      ``Let's just say there will be no replacing Greg. He's one of      a kind. His legacy of caring professionalism will live on      through the lending programs and other initiatives he's      worked so tirelessly to develop over the past two decades. We      wish him all the best in his future endeavors, and speaking      on behalf of all board members past and present, I say a      hearty thank you.''       The SKED Board of Directors plans a national search for      Jones's successor.       A native of Laurel County, Jones has served on numerous      boards and commissions both locally and nationally. These      positions include being past president of the Appalachia      Development Alliance. He is currently on the board of      directors for both TOURSEKY and the National Institute for      Hometown Security. He was named East Kentucky Power      Community/Economic Development Professional of the Year in      2007.       He earned his B.S. in industrial technology at Morehead      State University in Morehead, Ky. He also holds a master of      public administration degree from Southern Illinois      University--Edwardsville. He also attended the Institute for      Organization Management and Economic Development Institute.       In 1995, he received the Certified Economic Developer      designation from the American Economic Development Council.       He is married to Belinda Taylor Jones and they have a son,      Christopher.                          ____________________
