President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of my self and Senator Warner that will provide increased support for the families of those brave men and women in the armed forces who make the ultimate sacrifice in service to our Nation. The bill I introduce will raise the amount paid to the next-of-kin of military personnel killed while on active duty from $6,000 to $12,000. Further, it makes this increase retroactive to September 11, 2001.  Like all Americans, I have been greatly saddened by the loss of life in recent days during our operations in Iraq. While all of us understand the dangers whenever the Commander-in-Chief sends our troops into harm's way, that does not lessen the shock and sadness we all have felt as we learn of the loss of lives and see the cruel video of American POWs held in Iraq.  In the initial days of the war, two Marines with ties to Main lost heir lives. Both Captain Jay Aubin and Corporal Brian Kennedy, who perished in a helicopter crash in the Kuwaiti desert, have parents living in Maine. I came to this floor yesterday to express my condolences to their families, and declare my commitment to ensuring that their sacrifice is remembered.  I can think of no better way to honor their memories, and the memories of other Americans who have given their lives, than to ensure that their loved ones receive the care that they need and deserve. The last time that the death gratuity was raise was in 1991, during the period of the last Gulf War. At that time, it was increased from $3,000 to 6,000. It well past time for the Congress to move forward and increase this amount to better recognize the sacrifices of these families.  The death gratuity is commonly provided within 72 hours to the family of the servicemember who is killed while on active duty. This amount, while a small solace to a grieving family, assist them with their immediate financial needs. It is our obligation as a Nation to ensure that those families receive every support we can provide during such a terrible time. Just as important, as our troops enter into combat they need to be confident that, should the worst occur, that their family will have the support they need.  We can never fully repay the debt of our Nation to those who have laid down their lives for our Nation. The best we can do is honor their memory, ensure that their sacrifice is not in vain, and help provide for their families. The bill I have introduced will send a message to our brave young men and women that their Nation if grateful for their service.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, and Mr.         Allen):  S. 705.
