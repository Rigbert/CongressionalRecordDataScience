President, anybody who sees something that looks different: Hispanic, Black, someone wearing religious garb, they have a reasonable ground to turn them in under this. This is far too broad. Let it go to the Judiciary Committee--I guarantee we will have a hearing--but not on this.  I make the motion that the pending amendment is not germane. I raise a point of order pursuant to section 305(b)2 and 310(e)1 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
