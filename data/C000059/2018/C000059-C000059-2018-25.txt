Chairman, the fiscal year 2018 bill included $10 million for EPA to establish a grant program to provide funds to States and communities for lead reduction projects as authorized in the 2016 WIIN Act.  I might also point out that we now have a WIFIA program that is in the bill, which will allow for communities throughout the country to leverage up to $5 billion annually, and maybe more in the future, in their communities for such things as lead reduction within their towns and counties.  Mr. Chairman, therefore, this is an amendment we can accept, and I yield back the balance of my time.
