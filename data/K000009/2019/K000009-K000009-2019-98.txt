 There is not a more important infrastructure agency at this moment in our country than the Army Corps. The administration said it was going to come forward with an infrastructure bill. Well, if they can't do whatever they are calling an infrastructure bill, this is the infrastructure bill for this country at this time.  The needs are enormous. I can't imagine. We have 8 divisions and 38 districts. I want to thank every single individual out there sworn to protect and defend the American people who work for the Army Corps of Engineers and give their lives to this profession across this country.  General Semonite is a great patriot, and as were his predecessors. It has a long history, and we really need to have more attention devoted to Corps funding by various administrations that sit over there in the executive branch and underfund these projects around the country. That is why Louisiana had so much trouble and that is why other places in the country have so much trouble.  So I do not support the gentleman's amendment. I urge opposition, and I yield back the balance of my time.
