 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is right. The minimum wage should have been raised 2 years ago, and I had a bill in to raise it to $5.50 an hour. But the fact that it was not raised then makes it more imperative that we raise it now because the purchasing power of low-wage workers has declined even more. So let us move forward today and pass a minimum wage.  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Linder], my fellow colleague on the Committee on Rules.
