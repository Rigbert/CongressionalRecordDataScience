 President, I pay tribute today to a dear friend and Alabama icon, Mr. Earl Goodwin. Earl passed away on Friday, October 24, 2003 at the age of 93. He and I and our families have been close friends for nearly 40 years, and his death is a great loss for the State of Alabama.  Earl was a soldier in the United States Armed Forces, fighting on the beaches of Normandy. He made multiple trips back to England to pick up more groups of troops bringing them over to France. He completed these missions in aircraft that were unsafe because of their frequent crash landings. Earl was a true war hero, who put love of country before everything else.  After the war, he returned to Alabama and eventually created Bush Hog which became one of the world's foremost manufacturer of farm implements. Bush Hog employs hundreds of Dallas County residents, and has made great contributions in economic development to the region. Earl was a visionary with a smart mind for business. He will certainly be remembered for the tremendous difference he made in Dallas County.  Throughout his time in business, Earl was active in the community and politically astute. A lifelong Democrat, he became a prominent member of the Alabama State Senate, worked for Governor George Wallace, worked to elect Governor Don Siegelman, and served as a National Democratic Committeeman.  Senator Goodwin is an example of the American success story. Born into poverty, Earl took adversity and challenged it in every way possible. He was a war hero, a successful businessman, a husband of 61 years, and a father and grandfather.  Earl Goodwin will be missed by all those who knew him, and I hope this tribute exemplifies, in a small way, the kind of man that he was.                          ____________________
