President, nearly 4 years have passed since Congress enacted the Medicare Modernization Act. Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare was long overdue, and many senior citizens and people with disabilities are relieved to finally have drug coverage.  But the drug benefit was not structured like the rest of Medicare. For all other Medicare benefits, seniors can choose whether to receive benefits directly through Medicare or through a private insurance plan. The overwhelming majority choose the Medicare-run option for their hospital and physician coverage.  No such choice is available for prescription drugs. Medicare beneficiaries must enroll in a private insurance plan to obtain drug coverage.  A report released today by the Medicare Rights Center, with the support of Consumers Union, identifies the problems this decision to rely exclusively on private drug plans has created.  Seniors are having trouble identifying which of the dozens of private drug plans works best for them. Anyone who has visited a senior center or spoken with an elderly relative knows that the complexity of the drug benefit has created much confusion.  Each drug plan has its own premium, cost-sharing requirements, list of covered drugs, and pharmacy network. After you have identified the right drug plan, you have to go through the whole process again at the end of the year because your plan may have changed the drugs it covers or added new restrictions on how to access covered drugs.  Medicare beneficiaries often cannot obtain the drugs they need because they are trapped in an appeals process that the Medicare Rights Center calls ``hopelessly dysfunctional.'' Drug plans often do not tell beneficiaries that they can appeal a drug plan's decision to deny coverage of a drug, even though they are required to do so. Beneficiaries who do appeal soon find that it is a long and difficult process.  The complexity of the Medicare drug benefit also has made beneficiaries more vulnerable to aggressive and deceptive marketing practices. Some insurers try to steer seniors into more profitable Medicare Advantage plans. Some seniors have been signed up for Medicare Advantage plans without their knowledge, and, unfortunately, there have also been unscrupulous insurance agents who have misrepresented what benefits would be covered.  Adding to the frustration with the program so far is accumulating evidence that private drug plans have not been effective negotiators, which means seniors end up paying more than they should.  Drug prices are higher in private Medicare drug plans than drug prices available through the Veterans Administration, Medicaid, and other countries like Canada.  A report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee estimated that taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries would have saved almost $15 billion in 2007 if administrative expenses in the drug program were as low as the traditional government-run Medicare program and if drug prices were the same as Medicaid levels.  It should come as no surprise then that the average beneficiary who stays in their current Medicare drug plan will see their monthly premiums increase 21 percent in 2008.  Today, I am introducing the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act. The bill would create a Medicare-operated drug plan that would compete with private drug plans and would require the Health and Human Services Secretary to negotiate with drug companies to lower drug prices.  This is the kind of drug plan that Medicare beneficiaries are looking for. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, \2/3\ of seniors want the option of getting drug coverage directly from Medicare, and over 80 percent favor allowing the government to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices.  The Health and Human Services Secretary would have the tools to negotiate with drug companies, including the use of drug formulary. The best medical evidence would determine which drugs are covered in the formulary, and the formulary would be used to promote safety, appropriate use of drugs, and value.  The bill would establish an appeals process that is efficient, imposes minimal administrative burdens, and ensures timely procurement of nonformulary drugs or nonpreferred drugs when medically necessary.  The Secretary would also develop a system for paying pharmacies thatwould include the prompt payment of claims.  Seniors want the ability to choose a Medicare-administered drug plan. Let us give them this option, just as they have this choice with every other benefit covered by Medicare. Many seniors will find direct Medicare coverage to be a simpler, more dependable, and less costly option than private drug plans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2219       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Prescription Drug      Savings and Choice Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG                    PLAN OPTION.       (a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part D of the Social Security      Act is amended by inserting after section 1860D-11 (42 U.S.C.      1395w-111) the following new section:           ``MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN OPTION       ``Sec. 1860D-11A.  (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any      other provision of this part, for each year (beginning with      2009), in addition to any plans offered under section 1860D-     11, the Secretary shall offer one or more medicare operated      prescription drug plans (as defined in subsection (c)) with a      service area that consists of the entire United States and      shall enter into negotiations in accordance with subsection      (b) with pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce the purchase      cost of covered part D drugs for eligible part D individuals      who enroll in such a plan.       ``(b) Negotiations.--Notwithstanding section 1860D-11(i),      for purposes of offering a medicare operated prescription      drug plan under this section, the Secretary shall negotiate      with pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to the      purchase price of covered part D drugs in a Medicare operated      prescription drug plan and shall encourage the use of more      affordable therapeutic equivalents to the extent such      practices do not override medical necessity as determined by      the prescribing physician. To the extent practicable and      consistent with the previous sentence, the Secretary shall      implement strategies similar to those used by other Federal      purchasers of prescription drugs, and other strategies,      including the use of a formulary and formulary incentives in      subsection (e), to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D      drugs.       ``(c) Medicare Operated Prescription Drug Plan Defined.--     For purposes of this part, the term `medicare operated      prescription drug plan' means a prescription drug plan that      offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to      negotiated prices described in section 1860D-2(a)(1)(A). Such      a plan may offer supplemental prescription drug coverage in      the same manner as other qualified prescription drug coverage      offered by other prescription drug plans.       ``(d) Monthly Beneficiary Premium.--       ``(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage.--The monthly      beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage      and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D-     2(a)(1)(A) to be charged under a medicare operated      prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such      premium for months in 2009 and each succeeding year shall be      based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost of      offering the medicare operated prescription drug plan for the      year involved, including administrative expenses.       ``(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage.--Insofar as      a medicare operated prescription drug plan offers      supplemental prescription drug coverage, the Secretary may      adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1).       ``(e) Use of a Formulary and Formulary Incentives.--       ``(1) In general.--With respect to the operation of a      medicare operated prescription drug plan, the Secretary shall      establish and apply a formulary (and may include formulary      incentives described in paragraph (2)(C)(ii)) in accordance      with this subsection in order to--       ``(A) increase patient safety;       ``(B) increase appropriate use and reduce inappropriate use      of drugs; and       ``(C) reward value.       ``(2) Development of initial formulary.--       ``(A) In general.--In selecting covered part D drugs for      inclusion in a formulary. the Secretary shall consider      clinical benefit and price.       ``(B) Role of ahrq.--The Director of the Agency for      Healthcare Research and Quality shall be responsible for      assessing the clinical benefit of covered part D drugs and      making recommendations to the Secretary regarding which drugs      should be included in the formulary.
