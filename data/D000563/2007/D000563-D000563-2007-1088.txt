 As far as our meeting this week in the Senate, we are able to point to the passage of the court security bill, which is an important piece of legislation. Unfortunately, it is a bill that took 2 days, and it should have taken 20 minutes. During the course of 2 days, we had a general debate about budget deficits and a debate which started and ended without a vote on splitting up the Ninth Circuit. It was time for some Members to bring up issues of importance to them, but I would suggest we have a limited amount to show for our activity this week because of activities on the other side of the aisle.  Twice we were stopped in efforts to call up important legislation. We wanted to have the reauthorization of the intelligence agencies in America so that they are prepared to deal in the most effective way in fighting terrorism. Unfortunately, there was resistance from the Republican side of the aisle, and we weren't able to do so. The bill had to be pulled from debate on the floor and put back on the calendar for another day. Then we wanted to move to the Medicare prescription Part D Program. Those of us on the Democratic side think it is important to have a debate as to whether Medicare can offer less expensive, more affordable drugs to seniors and disabled people. The pharmaceutical companies don't like this idea. The current system is very profitable for them. They have mounted a very expensive campaign to stop any suggestion of changing Medicare prescription Part D. It would have been a lively debate, an important debate, followed closely by many seniors and their families but, unfortunately, once again, the Republican minority, within their rights, stopped us from moving to that important debate.  So for two very substantive issues, we were stopped this week from the kind of progress which I think people expect us to make. Even if we disagree between the parties, there should be a spirit of cooperation here, at least when it comes to honest debate in a reasonable period of time and then an up-or-down vote and then move on, but we couldn't reach that point this week. Sadly, the only bill that passed was the Court Security Act, as important as it is. It should have passed very quickly without controversy. It took us 2 days.  Now we have a very important bill before us, which I think is long overdue. I wish to thank Senator Alexander from Tennessee and Senator Bingaman for being the lead sponsors on this bill. I hope the debate tomorrow will lead to some amendments the beginning of next week and then to passage. America needs to maintain the competitive edge in so many parts of our economy, particularly when it comes to manufacturing, and this bill could be very positive.                          ____________________
