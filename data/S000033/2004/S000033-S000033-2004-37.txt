  If I may just very briefly tell the Members what the amendment is. I very much appreciate the chairman's support for this amendment. I know the ranking member is also supportive.  Mr. Chairman, all over rural America, we are seeing the decline of family-based agriculture. And while we want to look at the broader picture as to how we can help family farmers in dairy or in any other commodity, I think one way that we can move forward, and I am glad that the majority agrees, is to start emphasizing agritourism. All over this country, in Vermont and in rural America, billions of dollars are being spent by tourists who go to rural areas. Yet, unfortunately, family farmers who in most cases are the folks who are keeping the land open and keeping the land beautiful are not receiving the kinds of funds from the tourists that they should and that they deserve.  To my mind, as we see the decline of family-based agriculture, what we are seeing in Vermont and all over this country is that agritourism is putting hard cash into the pockets of family farmers.  Mr. Chairman, from the experience of my own State, I can tell the Members that there is a lot of support for agritourism nationwide, and I know that there is in this body in a bipartisan way. My own State of Vermont has been working on this concept for many years now, in part with funding provided by the USDA some years ago.  Some of the successes of Vermont's agritourism model include on-farm technical assistance in using the Internet and helping farmers get business through the Internet, setting up cooperative marketing with various commodity groups, the Chamber of Commerce and the Vermont Departments of Tourism and Agriculture. In addition, a regional marketing Web site was established that received over 40,000 hits in any average month. Vermont's agritourism initiative was highlighted by the travel book company Frommer's. In addition, the six New England States held an agritourism summit to coordinate their efforts in this area.                              {time}  1600  So, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of the committee and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) for their support of the concept of agritourism, and I very much appreciate that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time
