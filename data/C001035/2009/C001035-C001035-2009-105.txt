President, today I introduce the Energy Assistance Fund Act of 2009, legislation which will assist people who want to invest in energy conservation and alternative energy technologies and help set us on a path toward energy independence.  As I visit communities around the State of Maine, I hear time and again that the costs of energy create hardship for many of our citizens. Unpredictable, and often increasing, prices for home heating oil, gasoline and diesel fuel are a huge burden for many families, truckers, and small businesses.  I am concerned that in a difficult economy, investments in energy conservation and alternative energy improvements are simply too costly for many American families and small businesses. For example, under the present code, taxpayers who install energy efficient windows and skylights or solar water heating systems receive a 30 percent tax credit. In both instances, the investment which must be made by the taxpayer far exceeds the credit amount. In the current economic climate, most families and small businesses are already scrimping and saving to make ends meet, and they do not have the money to finance the gap between the tax credit we provide and the cost of the investment.  The legislation I am introducing today calls for additional loan authority to support current Federal programs that help families and small businesses finance energy efficiency improvements. The loan authority I am proposing would expand existing Federal programs that make low-interest loans to individuals and small businesses for energy efficiency improvements. This new loan authority would be made available through a new energy assistance revolving loan fund within the Treasury Department. Individuals who make less than 115 percent of the national average median income would be able to apply for low-interest loans to cover the difference between the tax credits available for energy efficiency improvements and up to 90 percent of the cost of those improvements. The Federal agencies can make these loans through their lender networks.  USDA, HUD, and other Federal agencies already have programs that can make loans of this kind to individuals. Small businesses can seek low-interest loans for energy efficiency improvements under existing loan programs such as the SBA's 7(a) program. The revolving loan fund called for by my bill will enable these agencies to offer more loans to the individuals and small businesses we have asked them to serve.  I urge my colleagues to work together in a bipartisan way so that we can help Americans overcome the challenge of our dependence on foreign oil and restore and strengthen our Nation's economy.                                 ______                                       By
