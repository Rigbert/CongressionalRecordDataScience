 President, I rise today to submit a resolution honoring our Nation's correctional officers and employees. This resolution reaffirms our support for the more than 200,000 corrections professionals who work in the face of danger while monitoring and reforming criminals and maintaining the safety of our communities.  I am pleased that Senators Hatch, Stabenow, Reid, Boxer, Kennedy, Cleland, Cantwell, Wyden, Thomas, Bingaman, Domenici, Jeffords, Murray, Roberts, Feingold, Helms, Sarbanes, and Akaka have joined me in submitting this resolution today.  The job of correctional officers and employees is a dangerous, and often thankless, one. Most of us leave for work knowing that we will return home safe and sound at the end of the day. But, corrections personnel are not afforded this luxury. They put their lives on the line every time they begin a shift.  Tragically, many correctional officers have been permanently injured or killed in the line of duty. In all, more than 361 correctional officers and employees have died while on duty. This year, we honor nine: John Burkett III, Wayne Mitchell, James Salvino, Gregory Collins, George Turner, Richard Huffman, Virgil Reel, Timothy Williams, and Rodney Welch, whom we lost during the past year. We must not forget the sacrifices made by these heroic individuals for our public safety.  These courageous officers all died while performing the normal day-to-day tasks their jobs asked of them. Whether they died transporting inmates or responding to disturbances within their facilities, their loss reminds us of the many brave acts that take place daily among correctional officers and employees.  Since prison security never rests, officers work all hours of the day and night, weekends, and even holidays. But, corrections professionals do much more than just watch over prisoners. They also play an important role in reforming them and in lowering recidivism rates. Through literacy programs and vocational training, they work hard to transform offenders into productive, law-abiding members of society, which is sometimes no easy task.  The efforts of America's correctional officers and employees to make our world a better, safer place too often go unnoticed. Few of us can truly appreciate the perils faced daily by these courageous public servants. We not only owe them our recognition, but our gratitude as well. To that end, I am pleased to offer this resolution to designate the week beginning May 5, 2002, as National Correctional Officers and Employees Week, and to honor and acknowledge their diligence and dedication to our public safety.                          ____________________
