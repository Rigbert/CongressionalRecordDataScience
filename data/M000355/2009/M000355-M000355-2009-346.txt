 DURBIN. I am.  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say I am only quoting the President's spokesman. He says he doesn't know what would happen if Ghailani is released.  Let me say to the Senator from Illinois, let's assume that he is sent back to the country from which he came. I ask, in what way is America safer if this terrorist subsequently, under this hypothetical release in the United States, goes back to his native country from which he potentially could launch another attack on the United States?
