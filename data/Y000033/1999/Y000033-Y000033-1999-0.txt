Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 438) to provide for the settlement of the water rights claims of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
