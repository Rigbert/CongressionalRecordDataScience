Chairman, absolutely not. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) might have forgotten that Mr. Madland testified on how big his establishment is, and might not have made the connection with the exemption contained in the Sensenbrenner amendment.  I am just here to inform the gentleman from North Carolina that Mr. Madland would not be exempt, and representations that the operator of that big an establishment, whether it is in Chetek, Wisconsin, or anyplace else in the country, would be exempt, that person simply has not read what is in the text of the Sensenbrenner amendment.  Mr. Madland pays, and anybody else that has that big an establishment would pay under my amendment.
