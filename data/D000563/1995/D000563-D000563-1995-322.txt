The reason why there is a rush is the folks making over a hundred grand a year are going to need $2,465 in tax breaks under the Gingrich Republican bill, and the folks over 200 grand, 11,000. Well, I want to suggest to you, Let's make a deal, and here is the deal, a bipartisan approach, Democrats and Republicans together, and here is what I would like to suggest:  One hundred and six Republicans wrote to Speaker Gingrich and said, ``This is embarrassing. It is embarrassing to be giving this kind of tax break to people at a time when we have a deficit and we're cutting school lunches, student loans.'' And 106 Republicans said to the Speaker, ``Why don't you cut it off at $95,000? If the families making $95,000 or less, let's give them the tax break for their kids. Don't give it to the superrich, the privileged few.''  Well, those 106 Republicans stood up to Speaker Gingrich. They made a proposal we can do business with. Let us [[Page H4152]] get Democrats and Republicans together in a bipartisan way helping real working families.                          ____________________
