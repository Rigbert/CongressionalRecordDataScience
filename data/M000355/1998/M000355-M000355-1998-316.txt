 President, I, for one, would like to see that DOE use the funds, which were collected from USEC customers and currently earmarked for cleaning up the uranium, continue to be dedicated to cleanups.  Would the Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee assist me in finding a solution to ensure that the money earmarked, for the purpose of cleaning up the uranium tails produced by USEC, will continue to be dedicated for these purposes and help to mitigate the job losses at these plants?
