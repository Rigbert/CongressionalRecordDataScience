 Chairman, we have heard a lot about waste and bureaucracy. Let us talk about waste. Do Members know what waste is? $10 billion on the space station. Helping senior citizens heat their homes in Vermont in the winter time is not waste. Do you know what waste is? Corporate welfare and subsidies for large corporations and wealthy individuals, that is waste. Drug prevention programs for high schools and elementary schools in this country, that is not waste. That makes good sense.  Do people really think it is waste to put money into the WIC program so we can provide decent nutrition for pregnant women and their children? Is that waste? That is not waste. Keeping the CIA funded at almost the same level as in the cold war, that is waste.
