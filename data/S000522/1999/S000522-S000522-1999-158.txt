Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding me this time.  First, Mr. Chairman, let me point out again, as was noted by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon), that the parameters of the compensation package, including the health package, are established not by the collective bargaining procedure, not by the Office of Personnel Management but by the Congress. That goes for the entire spectrum of benefits, whether it be the money, the health benefits, the retirement package--so we are right and this is the proper place to deal with this issue and to come to a conclusion on it.  I do rise in very strong opposition to the DeLauro amendment. This is not the first time we have dealt with this. For the last four appropriations bills that have been signed into law, this language has been rejected and the underlying pro-life language which proscribes funding for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or life of the mother has been put into law. This was also in effect from 1984 through 1993, and hopefully in fiscal year 2000 it will be again.  Let me remind Members, as well, that 72 percent of the money that is used towards the purchase of the health plan comes from the taxpayer, not from the premium payer. The remainder comes, about a quarter of it, from the premium payer, but almost three-fourths of the money is a direct subsidy from the United States taxpayer. This amendment would strike the Hyde amendment of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Again, I hope that Members will vote against it.  Mr. Chairman, let me also point out, it is bad enough from our perspective on the pro-life side that abortion on demand is the Supreme Court-imposed policy of our land. It was not voted into policy by the Congress, nor by the States. It was imposed upon us--forced on America--by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1973. But we do not have to pay for it. That is the issue squarely before this body today.  Many of us have profound, conscientious objections to abortion. We believe it is killing. We believe it is the taking of an innocent and defenseless human life. We believe abortion exploits women, and hurts them both emotionally and physically. The pro-life language in this bill ensures that all of us who believe that abortion is killing and dangerous to women will not be complicit, will not be party to the taking of that innocent, unborn child's life.  Let me remind Members as well that more and more people in America, and the polls clearly reflect this, are coming to the inescapable conclusion that abortion methods are acts of violence against children, against little kids. Abortion, rather than the language in the bill, abortion itself is discriminatory against children who cannot defend themselves, boys and girls of all races who cannot say, ``Hey, wait, what about me?'' I think at a time when we know more about the unborn child's life in fetology, at a time when we have a window to the womb with ultrasound and can watch with incredible clarity an unborn child moving, sucking his or her thumb at the very earliest stages, to turn around and say that we can poke holes in that child and stab that child and kill that child, I think, is unspeakable.  I have spent my 19 years in Congress working on human rights issues. I believe this is the most egregious human rights abuse on the planet, because it is so often disguised and masqueraded as somehow being a right is abortion. It is indeed violence against babies.  I would just ask Members, remember what abortion methods are actually done. As soon as we get into the rhetoric of choice and all of the numbing rhetoric that makes us look askance rather than at the reality of abortion, then we are able to put it out of mind, put it under the table and fail to realize that dismemberment and chemical poisonings are terrible things. And that is what abortion is.  Look at dismemberment abortions--commonplace all over America. A loop-shaped knife is hooked up to a hose, into a suction device that is 20 to 30 times more powerful than the average vacuum cleaner, and then that child'sbody is literally hacked to death. That is violence, I say to my colleagues.  One of the Members on the pro-abortion side just threw her arm as if to say I should go jump in a lake. But this is the reality whether you like it or not.  I have viewed the ``Silent Scream'' produced by Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a former abortionist, who wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, ``I've come to the agonizing conclusion that I have presided over 60,000 deaths,'' and then he quit doing abortions. This is a man who founded NARAL, a group that is backing the DeLauro amendment. He gave up doing abortions and now supports life. One of the things that made him give it up was that he saw that abortion in America and healing are schizophrenic. In some operating rooms physicians desperately try to save unborn children, in other operating rooms they hack off their limbs and decapitate babies.                              {time}  1745  He produced a video called The Silent Scream and another video that followed it in which he used real-life ultrasound. He used the ultrasound and chronicled an abortionist hacking that baby to death. And, as my colleagues know, I have been in the movement, the pro-life movement, for 25 years. Until I saw that, it did not even hit me as to how hideous this process, this violence against children, really is.  So dismemberment is not a pretty thing--it doesn't get any uglier--and to pay for it on demand because the child is, quote, unwanted, and then reduced to an object that can be thrown away and be treated as junk, is inhumane.  Then look at the saline abortions. High concentrated saltwater is injected into the baby's amniotic sac. The baby swallows that water and dies a slow, excruciatingly painful, death. It takes 2 hours for the baby to die from the caustic effects of saline abortions. It is legal; it is being done. If the DeLauro amendment passes, my colleagues and I in this Chamber will have to pay for it, and that is outrageous.  And then partial-birth abortions. In recent years, finally, Members have begun to see the reality of abortion when we talked about partial-birth abortion where the baby is more than half born, legs outside the mother's womb, literally in view, plain view, and then the brain is punctured with scissors, and the brains are literally sucked out.  That is the reality. We can talk all about choice and use all the sophistry from here to kingdom come, but the reality of what the abortionist does when he plies his or her craft is the killing of innocent human life. That is violence against children. That is a human rights abuse. Someday, I do not know when, someday I believe there will be an overwhelming consensus that we should not have been doing that for so long.  We have 40 million kids in this country who have died from abortions since 1973. That is more than the combined populations of many of our States who have been killed by dismemberment, chemical poisoning or some other hideous means. To tell us we have to fund it goes beyond the pale.  I urge a strong no vote on the DeLauro amendment.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran).
