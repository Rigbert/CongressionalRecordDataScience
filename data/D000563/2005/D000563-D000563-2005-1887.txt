 We are going to have several amendments this morning. Each one of these amendments tries to clarify this bill. This bill is being driven by the credit card and banking industry, you know, the same people who fill your mailbox with credit card applications you never asked for, the same people who show up at the Big Ten football game trying to peddle their credit cards to students--the same people are pushing this bill. They want folks to get deep in debt and if they file for bankruptcy never get out from under the debt--keep paying it for a lifetime: a literal debtors' prison.  If we truly want to exempt the lowest income Americans from the worst provisions and toughest provisions of this bill, I encourage all of my colleagues to support amendment No. 110.  I yield the floor.
