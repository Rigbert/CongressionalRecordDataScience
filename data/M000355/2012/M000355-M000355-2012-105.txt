 President, I would say to my friend, the majority leader, I have already made some comments about why I will be propounding the consent agreement I now propound with him here on the floor.  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the disposition of the pending cyber security bill, but no later than September 28, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 451, H.R. 6079, an act to repeal the President's health care bill or the so-called ObamaCare; further, that there be 1 hour of debate on the bill, no amendments be in order to the measure, and following that debate the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to the vote on passage, with no intervening action or debate.
