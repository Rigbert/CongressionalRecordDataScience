 President, I believe I need a very short time for my amendment. I believe Senator Simpson would like to speak on the deeming amendment for 10 minutes, and it would be agreeable to have 10 minutes on my side on that amendment.  On the other amendment, 10 minutes is enough. Senator Kennedy would like to speak on the deeming amendment as well.
