President, in a short while, my longtime press secretary, Joe Jamele, will be retiring. Joe Jamele set probably an all-time record as press secretaries of 15 years in my office. I think this is a great compliment to two Italian-Americans, Joe and myself, that we put up with each other for 15 years. We were good friends when we began our association; we are even better friends as it comes to an end.  Joe Jamele is one of those very special people who is a true Vermonter. I remember when I grew up, we always had the debate of what it took to be a Vermonter. Usually, the debate centered around whether your great-great-grandparents were born and raised in Vermont or whether your great-great-great-grandparents were born and raised in Vermont.  Joe Jamele established it in the best of ways. He earned his right to be aVermonter through his sense of hard work, honesty and loyalty, loyalty to his family, loyalty to his community, and loyalty to those who were fortunate enough to have him serve in their office, whether it was the Governor of the State of Vermont, Governor Salmon, or whether it was myself.  Having Joe Jamele as a member of your office comes with a price. I would often come in feeling that I just made some brilliant coup, either in the media or on the floor or back home. Joe would lean back and say, ``Well, you know, Patrick, the way I heard it was,'' and then he would give it to me from the eyes of the vast majority of Vermonters. And I would say, ``Yeah, I guess I didn't do quite as good as I might have,'' and he would bring it back to Earth. But he also did it in a way that was in the best interest of Vermont.  He would say oftentimes, ``Let's talk about what really is on people's minds back there.'' That is something he knew because he had such a farflung group of people, and still does, around Vermont, people he could call and talk with, people who are the true opinionmakers, not those who thought they were the true opinionmakers, but the people who really were the true opinionmakers and those who understood it.  Joe had, and has, this sense of history in Vermont. We sometimes have members of the press who come there, have been there a very short time and don't know who had gone before them. He was a very distinguished member of the press and has a sense of history that has probably only been seen, in my recollection, in Mavis Doyle, a former, and now deceased, reporter for the Rutland Herald. Joe knew who the players were. He knew those who spoke just for a sound bite as compared to those who spoke to do what they thought was best for the State or our country.  He had a professor's true heart, because over this decade and a half, we had so many young people who came into our office who found their real mentor was Joe Jamele, and they could go to Joe with everything from a professional to a personal concern and get the best of advice.  So, Mr. President, I was very pleased when Sam Hemingway of the Burlington Free Press wrote in May a column about Joe, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 31, 1996]                           (By Sam Hemingway)                   Washington Bids Farewell to Jamele       To his last day on the job--today--Joseph Jamele Jr., 65,      was remaining true to form: part curmudgeon, part romantic      and full-time Vermont political junkie.       ``It's terrible,'' he muttered on the phone from      Washington, D.C., where he's worked as press secretary for      U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., for 15 years, an eon in a      profession famous for short life spans.       ``Winding down is terrible,'' he went on. ``I don't like      this going-away stuff. I'd rather say goodbye on a one-to-one      basis than have those cheery testimonials. I've been to a lot      of them and every one's been a disaster.''       And then, a minute later, he was talking fondly about      working for peanuts as a reporter in the 1950s. About      managing the gubernatorial victory of Democrat Tom Salmon in      1972, one of the great upsets in Vermont political history.      About the changes in Vermont he can't bear to watch.       ``There's some parts I can barely visit because they've      changed so much,'' he said. ``Like the outskirts of      Burlington. I can remember driving through Colchester at      night and not see a light on. Or up around Lake Seymour. It      used to be you could go for miles and not see anyone. Now      it's ringed with cottages.''       The two sports are important to Jamele. Lake Seymour, close      by Morgan in the Northeast Kingdom, was where he was sent to      summer camp by his family in New Jersey all through the      Depression and World War II. Burlington is where he got his      first job while still a college student, bundling freshly      printed Free Presses on the midnight shift.       A reporting job soon followed, with Jamele honoring the      advice of a plaque on the wall in the office of his      University of Vermont mentor, Andrew Nuquist, that read:      ``Never give them two bad ones in a row.''       He didn't. Jamele's news writing career covered the      mundane--taking sports briefs over the phone--to the      dramatic: a story about the abused dog who crawled home to      die. He once interviewed a blind man who had wandered lost in      a forest for three days. He talked with a sobbing Gov. Phil      Hoff the day President Kennedy was assassinated.       By the early 1970s, his love for politics and weariness      with low-paying journalism jobs got the best of him. In 1972,      he had begun working for the GOP gubernatorial campaign of      then-Attorney General James Jeffords when Salmon called and      coaxed him to not only switch horses, but political      affiliations as well.       The move paid off, Jeffords eventually lost his party's      primary to Luther Hackett; Salmon went on to victory in      November.       ``The night Tom won, the first returns that came in came      from Granby, which voted 26-0 for Hackett,'' Jamele said.      ``Tom's daughter began to cry on the couch, and Tom consoled      her by reminding her about Hackett's pledge to visit every      town. `I think he spent too much time in Granby,' he told      her.''       Jamele remains convinced that had Salmon run for retiring      U.S. Sen. George Aiken's seat in 1974, he would have won. ``I      think Aiken really wanted Tom to succeed him,'' Jamele said.       But Salmon passed on the chance, and the door was opened      for Leahy. Jamele worked for Salmon for four years, then for      Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. He joined Leahy's staff      in 1981, a move he's never regretted.       And will not now sentimentalize as he heads for the exits.      He leaves, critical of the way federal workers have become      scapegoats for those who blame government for what's wrong in      the country, angry about the dominance of polls and      television ads in political campaigns.       Passionate and skeptical to the end.
