 I supported the creation of the MIP program, established under HIPAA, to provide a stable and increasing funding source for fraud and abuse detection efforts. Prior to MIP, Medicare contractor funding for anti-fraud and abuse activities was often reduced because of other spending priorities in the annual appropriations process. MIP was created to prevent that from happening again. The House Appropriations Committee recommendation is in clear disregard of congressional intent.  Additionally, I am concerned about the Senate Appropriations Committee recommendation to flatline the Medicare contractor budget. HCFA requested a $57 million increase to the Medicare contractor budget, in part to ensure implementation of certain balanced budget amendment provisions. Without this money, I am told by HCFA, that the final provisions of BBA will not be implemented. It doesn't make much sense to pass laws, if we don't provide the funding to ensure their implementation.
