President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his usual courtesy and giving me some time to speak. I have had the privilege of serving almost 33 years--a third of a century--with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. Of course, I know my 33 years pale in comparison with the time he has served.  While the distinguished Republican leader is on the floor, he and I have worked closely together on many things. I will not make comments about crocodile tears and all that, but it is interesting that he spoke of Judge Southwick being passed out unanimously last year. He forgot the fact that when he was being cleared for a vote by the Republican-controlled Senate, a Republican objected.
