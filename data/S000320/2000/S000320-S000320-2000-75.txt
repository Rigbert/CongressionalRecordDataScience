 President, chairman Stevens and the leader asked us to move quickly on this year's Transportation appropriations bill, and I'm happy to say that with the assistance of the senior Senator from New Jersey, we have reported a bill for the Senate's consideration. I am speaking of the Senate bill now. Considering that the Senate approved the Transportation appropriations bill in September last year, I suppose that presenting this bill during the second full week in June would qualify as moving more quickly this year.  I commend Senator Stevens and Majority Leader Lott for pushing this agenda.  Both Senator Lautenberg and I strongly support this package, thoughneither one of us agrees with every decision and funding level that is included in the bill and report. However, this bill contains the essential elements of a Transportation appropriations bill that meets the challenge of adequately funding the Transportation programs within the budget constraints that we have set for Federal spending in fiscal year 2001.  I will spend a few minutes on the bill funding summary.  The bill provides a total of $54.7 billion, which is $4.7 billion more than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. Because the firewalled highway and transit programs account for most of this growth--not to mention the increases in aviation capital investment anticipated in FAIR-21 that this body approved just a few months ago--we have been left with no choice but to constrain the growth in the FAA and Coast Guard operations accounts and Coast Guard capital account. Nevertheless, I am confident that, with responsible management, the funding levels for FAA operations and for the Coast Guard are adequate to meet the challenges of safely and effectively managing the nation's airways and the execution of the Coast Guard missions.  I note that the administration requested 15 percent growth in the Coast Guard operations account and 12 percent in the FAA operating expenses account. The bill before you today directly provides 9 percent growth in both those operating accounts with an additional 4 percent potential growth available to the FAA operations account if necessary to maintain aviation safety at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA Administrator.  That is a lot of money--and a great deal of growth under the budgetary constraints we are operating under. At the same time, the funding levels in our bill require the Secretary to balance the critical needs of both the Coast Guard and the FAA as he (or she) manages the Department. My concern is not that we haven't provided enough resources. My concern is that they won't be administered with an eye towards saving the taxpayers money or toward seeking efficiencies in program execution.  We have rejected the administration's proposal to divert highway funds in Revenue Aligned Budget Authority--or RABA--to other programs. This unrealistic proposal raised expectations, but is nothing more than a case of the administration wanting to say they support the highway firewalls while proposing to spend the money on nonhighway activities. You can't have it both ways.  We have also rejected the administration's proposal to levy new user fees. Three years ago during my first year as chairman of the Transportation subcommittee, we said no to the administration's new user-fee taxes, 2 years ago, we said no again to the new and improved user-fee taxes from the administration, and last year, we again said no thanks to the newly reconstituted user-fee tax proposal from the administration. Guess what? This is my fourth year as chair of the Transportation appropriation subcommittee, and the President's budget again includes $1.3 billion in new user-fees taxes--I am starting to recognize a pattern. Is anyone in the administration listening to what Congress is saying about new user-fee taxes?  Along these lines, I would note that the shortfalls that the administration will complain about in the FAA operations account in this bill are far short of the user-fee proposals that they have proposed for the FAA, not to mention the Coast Guard. If the administration would refrain from submitting budgets with new user-fee taxes as a budget gimmick that they know will never be enacted to hide other non-transportation spending, it would make all our jobs a lot easier to meet realistic targets and expectations for these operations accounts.  The bill before you meets the TEA-21 firewall levels for highway and transit investment. In highways, the RABA funding has all been distributed to the states in accordance with each state's share of the program consistent with last year's Senate appropriations bill. In short, every states gets more highway funds through the approach taken in the bill before you. I urge every Senator to refer to the table I will insert in the Record to see the total highway funds that will be available for highway construction in his or her state through the approach we propose.  The transit new starts and bus projects are not earmarked, which is the way the Senate has handled these programs the last 2 years. This is an approach that has worked well for the Defense appropriations process with respect to the National Guard equipment account, and I believe that it is a good model for balancing congressional and administration priorities in the allocation of discretionary transit projects.  The bill provides $4.4 billion for the activities of the U.S. Coast Guard, and, as I mentioned earlier, there is an 9 percent increase for the operating expenses of the Coast Guard. I think we can all agree that it is essential to provide the Coast Guard with the resources they need to continue their tradition of maritime search and rescues, protecting the environment and our coastlines, and enforcing our laws on the seas.  There are a few general provisions that I would draw to your attention. One requires the administration to submit with their budget request an accounting of what programs are to be cut if the Congress does not choose to enact the next complement of new user-fee tax-budget gimmicks.  Although there are other issues that will be discussed during consideration of this bill, I will note one now. That issue is the national ``.08'' blood alcohol content provision. Senator Lautenberg, who is managing his last Transportation appropriations bill this year, makes a compelling case for why the states should adopt ``.08''. This language was included in the bill at his request and will vote to support its inclusion the bill the Senate passes. I urge you to look at it and consider it carefully.  The bill before the Senate sets the stage well for a conference with the House. The House 302b for Transportation appropriations has substantially more budget resources than the bill before us today. As a result, the House passed bill is higher in a number of accounts than the bill before the Senate today. Notably, the Coast Guard has $150 million more in the Operating Expenses account, $100 million more in the AC account--the Coast Guard's capital improvement account, and the FAA operations account is $200 million higher than the Senate bill. We have included a number of flexibility provisions for the Secretary of Transportation and for the FAA administrator to soften the impact of those cuts from the President's budget request, but the fact remains that we are below the House appropriated levels in those accounts in particular. In addition, there are a number of specific projects or procurements that are included in the House bill that are not in ours, and a number of initiatives in our bill that are not in the House-passed bill. I believe that we can resolve all of these issues in conference to the satisfaction of both bodies and present a conference report that the President will sign.  We know of a few amendments to the bill and we would encourage those Members who have amendments to come to the floor to offer them or to see if they can be accepted. We want to work with Members where possible and will seek time agreements on amendments so we can move the bill.  Mr. President, I also would be remiss if I did not note my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, has joined us. He is the former chairman of this subcommittee and is now the ranking Democrat. I have enjoyed working with him on this subcommittee. This will be the last Transportation bill he will help manage. I can tell my colleagues that he has rendered a great service to his State and to the country. He has been a lot of help to me as I have worked through this process, the same road which he has been down many more times.  Before yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that a list of revenue aligned budget authority be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    REVENUE ALIGNED BUDGET AUTHORITY                        [In thousands of dollars]------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             Full RABA              STATE                 Admin.
