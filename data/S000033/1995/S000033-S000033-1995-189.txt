 Let us review again who is getting those tax breaks. Obviously, one would think that, if one decided to give tax breaks, and that is a debatable issue, clearly you were giving it to the working people, the people who are in most trouble. Interestingly enough, if you look at the Republican budget, the wealthiest 1 percent, the people who need the tax breaks the least, are getting more in tax breaks than the bottom 60 percent.                              {time}  1730  Mr. DeFAZIO. You are talking at the top, generally the people in the top will be getting breaks that average up to $40,000 off of their taxes, compared to $500 for a $40,000 a year family. This is not restoring equity to the tax system.
