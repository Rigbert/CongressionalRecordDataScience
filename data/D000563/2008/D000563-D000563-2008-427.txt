President, pending before the Senate is an important measure about compensating medical providers who treat Medicare patients. Medicare patients, of course, are the elderly and the disabled. This program that was started over 40 years ago reaches 40 million Americans. It is an important lifesaver. It is a lifeline for many people who have reached a point where they can no longer afford to pay for their own major medical bills. Many of these people are on fixed incomes. Many of these folks have no health insurance, other than Medicare.
