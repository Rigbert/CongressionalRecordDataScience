Mr. Chairman, we do have some problems with weight limitation on these trucks. Four hundred pounds does not sound like much; but if you add all the trucks up, we do not know the ramifications of the weight factor on the roads. And I really think the gentleman is on the right track, but I think we have to consider what that would do if, in fact, we raise that limitation to 400 pounds, do we raise the limitation on other aspects of the trucks such as a new engine which adds 3,000 pounds to the truck. We have not done that yet.  So I think we need to look at the total wear and tear on the road.
