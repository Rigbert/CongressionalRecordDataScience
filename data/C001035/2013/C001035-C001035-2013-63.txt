The chairman of the full committee has been extremely constructive in exercising her leadership. She very much wants a new approach, and I commend her for bringing bills individually to the Senate floor.  What we are going to propose--and through the Chair I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the full committee--is that, as usual, we would go back and forth, one side then the other, in considering amendments but that we would allow Senator Coburn to file a series of amendments at this point. They are already filed, but he will call them up and make them pending, with the understanding that we would set aside individual amendments so we could keep going back and forth and so that other colleagues on the Republican side who have amendments would not be shut out but, rather, would be accommodated as well.  Is that the understanding of the chairman of the Appropriations Committee?
