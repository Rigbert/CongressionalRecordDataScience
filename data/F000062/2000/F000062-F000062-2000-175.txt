 President, I rise today to submit a resolution. I tried to submit it during the first session of the 106th Congress, but due to a clerical error, it was never printed. This resolution commends and remembers events that transpired in Remy, France as its citizens honored the fallen World War II Army Air Corps pilot, Lieutenant Houston Braly. This inspiring story happened over fifty years ago, but its example of compassion and brotherhood remains in our hearts and minds.  On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in northern France encountered a German munitions train. After three unsuccessful attacks at the camouflaged train, Lt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion.  Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel from the train, haystacks in fields some distance away burned, and nearly allbuildings in the small French town were demolished. A 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but its historic stained-glass windows were shattered.  It was this explosion that tragically claimed the life of Lt. Braly at only twenty-two years of age.  Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents of Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled Braly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the nylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. Hundreds of villagers left flowers around his body, stunning German authorities.  The next morning, German authorities discovered that villagers continued to pay tribute to the young pilot despite threats of punishment. The placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued until American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople.  Almost 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, discovered this story in his research. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the explosion had never been replaced. He contacted members of the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. After hearing how the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend, veterans joined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization that would raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows as a gesture of thanks to Remy for its deeds.  On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.''  I know that my fellow Senators will want to join me in commending the people of Remy for their kindness and recognized the comrades of Lt. Braly for their goodwill.                          ____________________
