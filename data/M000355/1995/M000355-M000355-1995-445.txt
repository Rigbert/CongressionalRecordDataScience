  I would like to ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that a letter dated today from the American Civil Liberties Union legislative counsel, Robert S. Peck, on the amendment before us, appear in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                  Washington, DC, January 6, 1995.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: This morning, Senator Wellstone      proposed an amendment to S. 2 that would prohibit political      contributions to federal officeholders by registered      lobbyists. The American Civil Liberties Union opposed the      amendment as inconsistent with the guarantees of the First      Amendment.       The amendment would prohibit lobbyists from making      political contributions during a period of one year following      a lobbying contact. Alternatively, if a lobbyist does make a      political contribution, the lobbyist would be prohibited from      making a lobbying that member of Congress or covered      executive branch officers for a one-year period following the      contact. Finally, it prohibits lobbyists from suggesting to      clients possible recipients of their campaign contributions.       The First Amendment provides, among other things, broad      guarantees of freedom of speech and the right to petition the      government for redress of grievances. The Supreme Court, in      the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), held that      campaign contributions are a form of free speech that is      protected under the Constitution. The Buckley Court approved      of a system of campaign contributions limitations that were      designed to avoid the appearance of corruption as the least      restrictive means of furthering an important governmental      interest without unduly obviating a constitutional right.      Because these contribution limits still stand, further      restrictions on contribution rights, such as the limitation      on contributions by lobbyists, do not meet the constitutional      requirements of the least-restrictive-means test.       Moreover, the First Amendment also the right to lobby,      denominated in the Constitution as the right ``to petition.''      As the Court      [[Page S536]] said in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476,      484      (1957), the First Amendment ``was fashioned to assure the      unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of      political and social changes desired by the people.''      Lobbying is nothing more than a manifestation of this      interchange. Because lobbying is designed to influence      public policy, the speech that is burdened by this      proposal is ``at the heart of the First Amendment's      protection,'' First National Bank of Boston v. Belloti,      435 U.S. 765, 776 (1978), and constitutes ``the essence of      self-government.'' CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 US. 367, 396      (1981) (quoting Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 75      (1964)). Moreover, it is ```wholly at odds with the      guarantees of the First Amendment''' to place legislative      restrictions on those engaged in ```the discussion of      political policy generally or advocacy of passage or      defeat of legislation.''' Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414,      428 (1988) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 50, 48 (1976)).      The court's decision make apparent that these activities      involve the highest level of constitutional protection.       The ban on making political contributions proposed by this      amendment is an unconstitutional condition imposed because of      the exercise of a constitutional right. It does not matter      that it is primarily aimed at those who represent moneyed      interests, because the provision will not affect those      interests--only their registered lobbying representative.      Thus, it is both ineffective in accomplishing that goal and      in preventing the appearance of corruption. The existence of      contribution limitations already cabins the potential for      corruption. Thus, there are no legitimate grounds to believe      that a lobbyist restricted to the same maximum contributions      will have any more undue influence over a legislator's views      than anyone else.       The ACLU urges the Senate to reject this amendment, as      unconstitutional and ill-conceived.           Sincerely,                                                   Robert S. Peck,                                              Legislative Counsel.
