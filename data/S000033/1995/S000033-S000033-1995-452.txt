 Speaker, did you know that investment by U.S.-based multinational corporations abroad rose by 7.2 percent to a total of $716.2 billion in 1993 and increased at an even faster rate in the first half of 1994?  Stop and think about the jobs and economic growth that would have been generated here in the United States of America if that investment capital had been plowed into rebuilding our Nation instead of boosting offshore competition and production.  It is time for Uncle Sam to help redirect much more of our Nation's limited investment capital into providing good-paying jobs for Americans here at home.  The best place to start is by eliminating various special interest tax breaks and subsidies that reward U.S. companies for investing abroad rather than in the United States and that add tens of billions to our Federal deficit every year. Currently Federal tax and spending policies actually favor overseas investment by U.S.-based multinational corporations in many ways, instead of rewarding domestic investment and job creation.  That is why I have been joined by other members of the Progressive Caucus in sponsoring comprehensive legislation--The Come Home, Corporate America Bill--to cut the corporate welfare for U.S.-based multinational corporations that are busy hollowing out our Nation's production base, exporting good-paying U.S. Jobs, and bilking the American taxpayer all at the same time.  My bill will cut the Federal deficit by $252 billion over the next 5 years by wiping out assorted special interest tax loopholes and subsidies that have been handed out year after year to U.S.-based multinational corporations. These are the same companies that have turned their backs on millions of American working families whose hard work and personal allegiance has been instrumental in building these Fortune 500-type companies into economic powerhouses.  Specifically, my bill will achieve major deficit reduction by cutting the following multinational corporate welfare:  Abolishing the foreign tax credit;  Eliminating tax deferral of income from controlled foreign corporations;  Cracking down on transfer pricing, whereby multinational corporations arbitrarily allocate computed income among their operations in different countries;  Eliminating special tax break that allows companies to exclude 15 percent of their export income generated from special subsidiaries often created merely to claim and process the break;  Repealing tax exemption from U.S. taxes for employees of multinational corporations regardless of whether or not that income is subject to foreign taxation. Companies often equalize tax liabilities so that their employees' after-tax income is the same, thus allowing the company to pad their profits;  Abolishing the Overseas Private Investment Corporation [OPIC] which obligates the American taxpayer to insure and underwrite political risk insurance for companies to invest in scores of foreign countries;  Cutting below-market loan subsidies and fees provided by the Export-Import Bank for foreign purchasers to buy from U.S. companies;  Eliminating tax loopholes allowing earnings stripping and intrafirm transfers that allow companies to inflate their deductible expenses;  Abolishing exemption for foreign investors to avoid paying capital gains tax on the sale of their stock in U.S. corporations; and  Repealing the exemption that allows foreign investors to avoid paying taxes on interest received on bonds issued in the United States.                          ____________________
