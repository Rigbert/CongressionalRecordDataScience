Speaker, I rise today in tribute to a steadfast colleague and a truly dedicated public servant. This week, this House lost a treasured friend with the passing of Representative Herb Bateman of Virginia.  One characteristic distinguished Herb throughout his 50-year career: commitment to public service. Whether as a teacher, Air Force Officer, attorney, or legislator, Herb aspired to and reached a high standard of service to his students, his country, his clients, and his constituents. I know this first-hand, since we served together for over 18 years.  In his time in the Virginia Senate, Herb distinguished himself as a leader in diverse issue areas including agriculture, energy, education, and the budget. In this body, Herb, a member of the Armed Services Committee, earned a reputation as a fighter for a strong and prepared military. He understood the dynamic role of the United States in the post-cold war world. Toward this end, Herb was a strong advocate for military readiness, and a staunch supporter of his constituents in the shipbuilding industry and the local military community.  Perhaps the greatest reasons for Herb's success as a legislator are his bipartisanship and his patriotism. He was always looking out for America's best interests, always willing to hear the other side, always capable of expressing his views in logical, rather than partisan, ways. Herb showed us the importance of duty, integrity, and responsibility in public life.  We will miss him.                          ____________________
