 President, one in three women worldwide will experience gender-based violence in her lifetime. In some countries, that's true for 70 percent of women. No country is immune. From trafficking of women in Eastern Europe to ``honor'' killings in Jordan to rape being used as a brutal weapon of war in Darfur and the Congo, violence against women and girls crosses all borders and affects women in all social groups, religions and socio-economic classes.  Around the globe, women and girls face domestic violence, rape, forced or child marriage, so-called ``honor'' killings, dowry-related murder, human trafficking, and female genital mutilation. The United Nations estimates that at least 5,000 ``honor'' killings take place each year around the world and more than 130,000,000 girls and young women worldwide have been subjected to genital mutilation. A 2006 United Nations Report found that at least 102 member states had no specific laws on domestic violence. The statistics are staggering.  Not surprisingly, violence against women and girls has a profound impact on the health and development of countries worldwide. Violence breeds poverty. It impedes economic development because it can prevent girls from going to school, or stop women from holding jobs or inheriting property, or shut down access to critical health care for themselves and their children. We can't eradicate poverty and disease unless we prevent and respond to the violence women face in their own homes and communities. We cannot truly empower women to become active in civic life and promote peace, prosperity and democracy unless they personally are free from fear of violence.  Violence against women is a global health crisis, not just because so many women and girls are injured and die as a result, but also because inequality and violence interfere with current efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Forced sex increases vulnerability to HIV/AIDS transmission, in part, because condoms are not likely to be used. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, women account for close to three-quarters of those living with HIV/AIDS between the ages 18 and 24.  The picture is grim, and can be discouraging. But the good news is that local and international organizations are working in communities around the world with courage, sensitivity and great success to help women overcome violence at home, in school and at work. But they need our help.  We've made tremendous progress in reducing violence against women here in the United States since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, in 1994. That important work continues. But we cannot ignore the devastation wrought by violence in every corner of the globe. Now is the time to turn our attention to women in other parts of the world--women whose lives are devastated by poverty, political and civic exclusion, disease, and violence. Gender-based violence contributes to the poverty, inequality and instability that threaten peace. Addressing it isn't just moral; it is also smart.  So today, during this final week of Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I am introducing with my good friend from Indiana, Senator Lugar, the International Violence Against Women Act. This groundbreaking, bipartisan legislation would integrate efforts to end gender-based violence into all existing, appropriate U.S. foreign assistance programs.  The International Violence Against Women Act has three main components. First, the bill reorganizes and rejuvenates the gender-related efforts of the State Department by creating one central office--the ``Office forWomen's Global Initiatives'', directed by a Senate-confirmed Ambassador who reports directly to the Secretary. The Coordinator of the Office or Women's Global Initiatives, the ``Coordinator'', will be charged with monitoring, coordinating, and organizing all U.S. resources, programs and aid abroad that deals with women's issues, including gender-based violence. Additionally, my bill creates a new Office of Women's Global Development at the United States Agency for International Development, also to be directed by a Senate-confirmed nominee. The Director will be responsible for addressing gender-based violence and integrating gender into U.S. government assistance programs. The Director will work closely with the Coordinator and the Secretary of State to implement the provisions of the IVAWA legislation.  Under the current organizational scheme, projects addressing violence against women, either primarily or tangentially, are spread throughout the State Department and USAID without a central inventory, game plan or leader. My bill will raise the profile of women's issues generally at the State Department, and ensure that gender-based violence programs are building on past successes, leveraging core competencies and working in conjunction with other initiatives.  Second, the International Violence Against Women Act mandates creation of a 5-year, comprehensive strategy, with coordinated programming, to prevent and respond to violence against women in 10 to 20 targeted countries. The act creates a dedicated funding stream of $175 million a year to support programs dealing with violence against women in five areas: the criminal and civil justice system--everything from drafting laws on domestic violence, to enhancing women's access to property and inheritance rights, to reforming police practices--health care, girls' access to education and school safety, women's access to employment and financial resources, and public awareness campaigns that change social norms.  I know from my experience in Delaware that coordinating community responses in towns and cities has made all the difference in fighting domestic violence and rape. I applied those same principles of coordination and joint programming to the International Violence Against Women Act. International experts agree on the necessity of a multi-disciplinary approach that brings governments and nongovernmental organizations to the table to create sustainable infrastructure. To be clear, the International Violence Against Women Act is not asking countries to reinvent the wheel. At every step our strategy will lead to coordination of efforts to have the greatest possible impact. This type of effective, cost-efficient, gender-based violence programming already exists and is taking place in pockets all around the globe. We have the blueprints; my Act would provide the momentum and support for a full-scale international priority.  Finally, as the recent reports from the Congo make tragically clear, in situations of humanitarian crises, conflict and post-conflict operations, women and girls are vulnerable to horrific acts of violence. Reports of refugee women being raped while collecting firewood, soldiers sexually abusing girls in exchange for token food items, or women subjected to unimaginable brutality and torture as a tactic of war are shocking in number and inhumanity. The Act requires training, reporting mechanisms and other measures for those who are working directly with or protecting refugees and other vulnerable populations. The act also requires that the State Department identify ``critical outbreaks'' in which violence against women and girls is being used as a weapon of intimidation and abuse in armed conflict or war, or is escalating in an environment of impunity, and to take emergency measures to respond to the outbreaks.  The issue of violence against women and girls is complex and our legislation is a bold and ambitious plan. There are limitations on the United States' power to ``fix'' a problem that is so widespread. We are mindful that no country has a perfect record or all the answers. Yet Congress has a long and proud history of tackling complex international problems, most recently the devastating epidemic of HIV/AIDS and the insidious crime of human trafficking.  I did not approach this legislation lightly. Over the past months, I've solicited information from every relevant office in the State Department, USAID and the Department of Justice that works on the issues of women's rights and gender-based violence abroad. I asked for input and information from the United Nations secretariat, and many of its subsidiary agencies who are working to prevent and respond to gender-based violence internationally in various capacities. And most importantly, the International Violence Against Women Act was drafted with the insight and expertise of over 100 nongovernmental organizations and 40 women's groups around the globe, including American Refugee Committee, Amnesty International, CARE, Christian Children's Fund, Family Violence Prevention Fund, Global AIDS Alliance, Human Rights Watch, Inter-Agency Gender Working Group, IGWAG, International Rescue Committee, International Justice Mission, Women's Edge Coalition, Vital Voices Global Partnership and many others. I thank all of them for their invaluable assistance and perseverance as this bill came together.  Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. And it is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making real progress towards equity, development and peace.'' I could not agree more. My International Violence Against Women Act marshals together, for the first time, coordinated American resources, good will and leadership to address this global issue. I believe the time is now for the U.S. to get actively engaged in the fight for women's lives and girls' futures.  Over the past 30 years, the understanding of human rights and violence against women has metamorphosed. A State's responsibility to protect women from violence has evolved--what was once seen largely as a private, family or cultural matter is now understood by the international community as a violation of basic human rights. Violence against women is a legal wrong. It cannot be excused or justified or ignored. It is an engrained social norm but one that we can dismantle over time--one woman at a time--with patience, creativity and sustained political will. The International Violence Against Women Act is the first step.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2279       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Amendments to Foreign Service Act of 1980.Sec. 202. Support for multilateral efforts to end violence against               women and girls.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Violence against women and girls is rooted in multiple      causes and takes many forms, including physical, sexual, and      psychological. It affects all countries, social groups,      ethnicities, religions, and socioeconomic classes and is a      global health, economic development, and human rights problem      of epidemic proportions.       (2) According to the World Health Organization--       (A) approximately 1 in 3 of the women in the world will      experience violence in her lifetime, with rates of up to 70      percent in some countries; and       (B) 1 in 5 of the women in the world will be the victim of      rape or attempted rape in her lifetime.       (3) According to the 2006 United Nations Secretary-     General's report entitled Ending Violence Against Women, 102      member states have no specific laws on domestic violence.       (4) Women and girls face many different types of gender-     based violence, including forced or child marriage, so-called      ``honor killings'', dowry-related murder, human trafficking,      and female genital mutilation. The United Nations estimates      that at least 5,000 so-called ``honor killings'' take place      each year around the world and that more than 130,000,000      girls and young women worldwide have been subjected to female      genital mutilation.       (5) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 2006      Report on Gender-Based Violence and HIV/AIDS reports that      violence against women is a public health and development      problem that significantly increases susceptibility to HIV/     AIDS. A United Nations study on the global AIDS epidemic      found that in sub-Saharan Africa, women who are 15 to 24      years old can be infected at rates that are up to 6 times      higher than men of the same age.       (6) Recent studies in Africa indicate that between 16 and      47 percent of girls in primary and secondary school report      sexual abuse or harassment by male teachers or classmates.      Girls who experience sexual violence at school are also more      likely to experience unintended pregnancies or become      infected with sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/     AIDS.       (7) Rape and sexual assault are weapons of war used to      torture, intimidate, and terrorize women and communities.      Amnesty International reports that women have suffered from      sexual violence during conflicts in Rwanda, the former      Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, and most recently in the Democratic      Republic of the Congo, where women have suffered from brutal      and systematic sexual assaults.       (8) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in      humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural      disasters face extreme violence and threats because of power      inequities, including being forced to exchange sex for food      and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased risk of      rape, sexual exploitation, and abuse.       (9) According to the United States Agency for International      Development (USAID)--       (A) 70 percent of the 1,300,000,000 people living in      poverty in the world are women and children;       (B) \2/3\ of the 876,000,000 illiterate adults in the world      are women;       (C) \2/3\ of the 125,000,000 school-aged children who are      not in school are girls;       (D) more than \3/4\ of the 27,000,000 refugees in the world      are women and children; and       (E) 1,600 women die unnecessarily every day during      pregnancy and childbirth.       (10) In 2003, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on      Violence Against Women concluded that violence against women      violates the basic human rights of women, results in      ``devastating consequences for women who experience it,      traumatic impact on those who witness it, de-legitimization      of States that fail to prevent it and the impoverishment of      entire societies that tolerate it.''.       (11) Violence against women is an impediment to the health,      opportunity, and development of women and their societies.      According to an October 2006 study of the United Nations      Secretary General entitled Ending Violence Against Women,      ``Violence against women impoverishes women, their families,      communities and nations. It lowers economic production,      drains resources from public services and employers, and      reduces human capital formation.''.       (12) The World Bank recognizes that women's health,      education, and economic opportunities directly impact the      development and well being of their families and their      societies. A 2001 World Bank Report, entitled Engendering      Development, reports that greater gender equality leads to      improved nutrition, lower child mortality, less government      corruption, higher productivity, and reduced HIV infection      rates.       (13) Increased access to economic opportunities is crucial      to the prevention of and response to domestic and sexual      violence. Both microfinance-based interventions and increased      asset control have been shown to reduce levels of intimate      partner violence in addition to providing economic      independence for survivors.       (14) Campaigns to change social norms, including community      organizing, media campaigns, and efforts to engage and      educate men and boys, have been shown to change attitudes      that condone and tolerate violence against women and girls      and reduce violence and abuse.     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.       It is the policy of the United States--       (1) to promote women's political, economic, educational,      social, cultural, civil, and human rights and opportunities      throughout the world;       (2) to condemn and combat violence against women and girls,      and to promote and assist other governments in preventing and      responding to such violence;       (3) to promote ending violence against women and girls      around the world, whether the abuse is committed directly by      a foreign government, is implicitly committed by such      government through hostile laws or de jure mandates to      disenfranchise women, or is committed by private actors and      the government fails to address the abuse;       (4) to encourage foreign governments to enact and implement      effective legal reform to combat violence against women and      girls, and to encourage access to justice, true      accountability for abusers, and meaningful redress and      support for victims;       (5) to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts to      prevent and respond to violence against women and girls into      United States foreign policy and foreign assistance programs,      and to expand implementation of effective practices and      programs;       (6) to fully implement the comprehensive international      strategy set forth in section 300G of the Foreign Assistance      Act of 1961, as added by this Act, which provides assistance      to eligible countries to reduce and prevent gender-based      violence with coordinated efforts in the criminal justice,      health, education, and economic sectors;       (7) to support and build capacity of indigenous      nongovernmental organizations that are working to prevent and      respond to violence against women and girls, particularly      women's nongovernmental organizations, and to support and      encourage United States organizations working in partnership      with such nongovernmental organizations;       (8) to prevent and respond to violence against women and      girls through multisectoral methods, working at individual,      family, community, local, national, and international levels      and incorporating service, prevention, training, and advocacy      activities and economic, education, health, legal, and      protective intervention services;       (9) to coordinate activities with recipient country      governments, as appropriate, and with other bilateral,      multilateral, nongovernmental, and private sector actors      active in the relevant sector and country;       (10) to foster international and regional cooperation with      an aim towards defining regional strategies, as appropriate,      for preventing and responding to violence against women and      girls, and exchanging data and successful strategies;       (11) to work through international organizations of which      the United States is a member, including the United Nations      and its specialized agencies, funds and programs to      encourage, promote, and advocate for stronger efforts and      policies to prevent and end violence against women and girls;       (12) to enhance training and other programs to prevent and      respond to violence against women and girls in humanitarian      relief, conflict, and post-conflict operations;       (13) to enhance training by United States personnel of      professional foreign military and police forces and judicial      officials to include specific and thorough instruction on      preventing and responding to violence against women and      girls;       (14) to press for the implementation of policies and      practices in global peace and security efforts, including      United Nations peacekeeping and policing operations, that      prevent and respond to violence against women and girls and      hold personnel accountable for the full implementation of      these policies and practices.
