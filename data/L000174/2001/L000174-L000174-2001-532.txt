If I could have the attention of the Senator from Utah for a moment, I am obviously not going to object to his making a statement, nor would he object to my doing the same. I keep reading statements from some of the leadership that we should hurry up this bill so that we would be allowed to vote. The Senator from New York had his amendment here on Thursday of last week and hasn't been able to get a vote. We began the bankruptcy bill and it was pulled down at the request of the Republican leadership to bring up ergonomics. I hope that the Republican leadership will allow us to start having some votes on some of these amendments and not just wait until such time as we have a cloture vote.
