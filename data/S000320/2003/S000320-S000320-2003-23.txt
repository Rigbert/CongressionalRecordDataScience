  The committee spent a great deal of time, as the Presiding Officer knows, as a distinguished member of the Banking Committee, carefully considering the reauthorization and reform of the Fair Credit Reporting Act national standards.  The committee bill is carefully crafted, and it balances protecting consumer interests and ensuring the efficiency of our credit markets.  The committee bill was unanimously approved, as the Presiding Officer knows, by a voice vote in the committee, which is hard to get. It was unanimous.  Extraneous amendments, I believe, alter this balance and focus and threaten our ability to maintain the strong, bipartisan consensus necessary to pass this important legislation this year.  As a result, the managers of the bill--Senator Sarbanes and I--intend to oppose including this amendment and all non-Fair Credit Reporting Act-related amendments, regardless of their merit. This might have some merit, but I think it can be better served at another place on another day.  At the proper time, I will move to table the amendment. Right now, I yield to Senator Sarbanes.
