President, today I want to bring to the Senate's attention a group of student athletes in Vermont who have an unusual and admirable tradition. For the past 42 years, Middlebury College freshman have helped a Middlebury man with a disability make it to football and basketball games like clockwork. It is another example where students' education extends far beyond the walls of a college classroom.  In the March 10, 2003, issue of Sports Illustrated, well-known sports columnist Rick Reilly took a moment to explain the tradition to his readers. Middlebury College has long been recognized as one of the Nation's finest institutions of higher education. The quality of its faculty, the rigors of coursework, stunning facilities, and the success of its athletic programs are the foundation for Middlebury's storied history and academic reputation. Yet it also is what goes unnoticed that makes this truly a special place--like a tradition that takes place right before the start of every football and basketball game. It is a tradition that has come to exemplify what it means to be a Middlebury College Panther, a Vermonter, and a person in full.  For the past 42 years, the freshman members of the Middlebury College football and basketball teams have been going to Butch Varno's house before the start of the game and literally giving him a lift. Mr. Varno, who from infancy has contended with cerebral palsy, is confined to a wheelchair and does not drive. On game day, he anticipates the arrival of a small band of Panthers for a ride to the game, which includes lifting Mr. Varno out of bed and getting him to the bleachers.  We in Vermont are proud of the student athletes who make this happen before each game. Whether they know it or not, they represent the very best of our Nation's college students. They are learning, playing hard and, most importantly, caring for others in their community.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Rick Reilly's column be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From Sports Illustrated, Mar. 10, 2003]                              Extra Credit                            (By Rick Reilly)       The best college tradition is not dotting the i at Ohio      State. It's not stealing the goat from Navy. Or waving the      wheat at Kansas.       It's Picking Up Butch at Middlebury (Vt.) College.       For 42 years Middlebury freshman athletes have been Picking      Up Butch for football and basketball games. It's a sign-up      sheet thing. Carry the ball bags. Gather all the towels. Pick      Up Butch.       Basketball players, men and women, do it during football      season. Football players do it during basketball season. Two      hours before each home game, two freshmen grab whatever car      they can get and drive a mile off campus to the tiny house      where 54-year-old Butch Varno lives with his 73-year-old      mother, Helen, who never got her driver's license. And they      literally Pick Up Butch, 5'3'' and 170 pounds, right off his      bed.       They put him in his wheelchair and push him out of the      house, or one guy hauls him in a fireman's carry. They pile      him into the car, cram the wheelchair into the trunk, take      him to the game and roll him to his spot in the mezzanine for      football games or at the end of the bench for basketball.       Butch always smiles and says the same thing from the bottom      of his heart: ``CP just sucks.'' Cerebral palsy. While his      fondest dream has always been to play basketball, it'll never      happen. There is little that he can physically do for      himself.       ``At first, you're a little nervous; you're like, I don't      know,'' says freshman wide receiver Ryan Armstrong. ``But the      older guys say, `We did it when we were freshmen. Now you go      get him. It's tradition.' So me and my buddy got him the      first week. He's pretty heavy. We bumped his head a couple of      times getting him into the car. He's like, `Hey! Be careful!'      But he loves getting out so much that afterward you feel      good. It's fun to put a smile like that on somebody's face.''       And the kids don't just Pick Up Butch. They also Keep Butch      Company. Take Butch to the Bathroom. Feed Butch. ``He always      likes a hot dog and a Coke,'' says 6'8'' Clark Read, 19, a      power forward. ``It's kind of weird at first, sticking a hot      dog in his mouth. The trick is to throw out the last bite so      he doesn't get your fingers.''       Thanks to 42 years of freshmen, Butch hardly ever misses a      Middlebury game. Not that he hasn't been late.       ``One day this year, the two guys were calling me on their      cell,'' says Armstrong, ``and     they're going, `We can't find Butch!' And I'm like, `You lost      Butch? How can you lose Butch?' Turns out they just couldn't      find his house.''       Nobody at Middlebury remembers quite how Picking Up Butch      got started, but Butch does. It was 1961. He was 13, and his      grandmother, a housekeeper at the dorms, wheeled him to a      football game. It started snowing halfway through, and      afterward she couldn't push him all the way back home. A      student named Roger Ralph asked them if they needed a ride.      Ever since then, Butch has been buried in the middle of      Middlebury sports.       Sometimes he gives the basketball team a pregame speech,      which is usually, ``I love you guys.'' He holds the game ball      during warmups and at halftime until the refs need it. He is      held upright for the national anthem. Once in a while, just      before tip-off, they put him in the middle of the players'      huddle, where they all touch his head and holler, ``One, two,      three, together!'' When the action gets tense, the freshmen      hold his hands to keep them from flailing. After the games      some of the players come back to the court and help him      shuffle a few steps for exercise, until he collapses back in      his chair, exhausted. Then it's home again, Butch chirping      all the way.       And it's not just the athletes at Middlebury who attend to      him. Butch is a campus project. Students come by the house      and help him nearly every day. Over the years they taught him      to read, and then last year they helped him get his GED.      Somebody got him a graduation cap and gown to wear at the      party they threw in his honor. During his thank-you speech,      Butch wept.       ``These kids care what happens to me,'' Butch says. ``They      don't have to, but they do. I don't know where I'd be without      them. Probably in an institution.''       But that's not the question. The question is, Where would      they be without Butch?       ``It makes you think,'' says Armstrong. ``We're all young      athletes. Going to a game or playing in a game, we take it      for granted. But then you go Pick Up Butch, and I don't know,      it makes you feel blessed.''       Now comes the worst time of the year--the months between      the end of the basketball season, last week, and the start of      football in August. ``It stinks,'' Butch says. He sits at      home lonely day after day, watching nothing but Boston Red      Sox games on TV, waiting for the calendar pages to turn to      the days when he can be one, two, three, together again with      the students he loves.       On that day the door will swing open, and standing there,      young and strong, will be two freshmen. And, really, just      seeing them is what Picking Up Butch is all about.                          ____________________
