President, I am glad the Senator asked that question because that is exactly the point of what I am saying. It is because of your language in the amendment that states, ``Unless authorized or provided by law,'' bilingual printing cannot be done, and it would be illegal.  We have done some quick research but there is no statute we have found which says that when Members give speeches on the floor in foreign languages, the government shall print that speech in the foreign language in the Congressional Record. It isn't there.
