 President, I will make it real quick. First of all, I think the characterization of my friend from Iowa is bizarre. It makes it sound like this is a CIA plot that is still underway. It is one of the most noble undertakings that the Western World has ever engaged in. If you ask any people in Eastern Europe, from Lech Walesa to Vaclav Havel to Boris Yeltsin, and others, who in fact were there before the Wall came down, they credit Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty more than any single thing.  Number two, is it still needed? It is needed now. There is an enemy. The enemy is called censorship, and if you wonder whether or not it is true, some of us met this week with Mr. Gusinsky, the fellow who has the media empire in Russia now who is criticizing the present President. They are threatening to take down the television stations. They are taking down the radio and television access to the news for the people everywhere from Slovakia through Russia.  The third thing is this notion it is no longer needed. Mr. President, 25 million people still listen to it on a regular basis in Eastern Europe and Russia. Anyone who thinks democracy has taken root and the free market system is in place in those areas, I respectfully suggest they take another close look. And the notion that they can watch CNN--I would say to my friends, CNN is in English; it can be censored. It, in fact, can be impacted upon. And CNN communicates international news, not what is happening within those countries--as RFE/RL does. What we are doing is fully emasculating the ability of Radio Free Europe or Radio Liberty to continue to function.  I am a supporter, an unabashed supporter of public television. I believe it should be more than it is now. But this is like having the hearing impaired steal from the physically impaired, from those who are unable to walk. They are pitting two very important functions of government against one another. But we should not undermine Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.  Again, those who think democracy is secure in those areas, please stand and raise your hands and tell me that censorship is still not the single biggest enemy of the prospect for freedom to flourish and democracy to flourish in Eastern and Central Europe.  Let me give a few more examples. In Russia, we have heard about the media courageously reporting on the war in Chechnya.  But that does not mean that Russia is now blessed with completely free media.  Last year, the State Duma in Russia adopted a new media law which requires that State-owned media must inform the public of activities of the President, Government, and Parliament within 24 hours after any noteworthy event.  And although the State Department reports that ``print media [in Russia] functioned largely unhindered,'' this optimistic picture is clouded by the situation in many provinces:       Regional political authorities [in Russia] resorted to      various devices to close down critical newspapers.  Last winter and spring, during the parliamentary campaign in Kazakhstan, a television station went off the air for several days when local authorities, upset by broadcasts critical of the mayor of the capital, shut off electricity to the station.  [[Page S5352]] In Slovakia, as the Washington Post reported last Tuesday, the newly elected Government has increasingly pressured--and at times forced--television, radio, and newspapers to accept wholesale changes or drop programs.  In my view, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are as important today as they were during the past 40 years.  Because the establishment of free and independent media in the region has been a slow process, RFE/RL today have a dual role: To provide a model of how independent media should function in a free society, and to keep honest those who seek to reestablish repression and to silence the press.  This function is not one conceived in the abstract; the practical reality lies in the public response: The people of the region continue to tune in to RFE/RL.  In nearly every country in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, the listenership of RFE/RL today equals or exceeds that of the Voice of America.  It also exceeds the audience of the British Broadcasting Corporation's World Service.  All told, some 25 million people in the region listen to RFE/RL on a regular basis.  Surveys conducted last fall of leading citizens in the region found that an average of nearly 75 percent supported the continuation of western radio broadcasts.  Equally important, every leader of the new democracies in the region continues to urge that these radios remain open.  Let me quote from a letter from Czech President Vaclav Havel to President Clinton:       [RFE broadcasts] remain important to the development of      independent journalism and democracy in our country.  The Presidents of the three Baltic States expressed a similar view:       These broadcasts [are] an integral part of the continuing      development of [our] democratic institutions.  These are not leaders whose budgets benefit from RFE/RL--these are leaders who recognize that RFE/RL still make a contribution to the establishment of democracy.  This year, the administration proposes to spend $100 million on the so-called ``Warsaw Initiative,'' a program to assist the new democracies of Eastern Europe to modernize their militaries.  I would argue that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are as important as this military assistance in helping to secure the democratic foundation in the former East bloc.  Yet I predict that hardly anyone around here will blink an eye when the Congress votes on the $100 million ``Warsaw Initiative.''                      rfe/rl is cutting its budget  I agree with the Senator's belief that we need to reduce our international broadcasting budget.  We are doing just that.  The State Department authorization bill, enacted last year, provides for the consolidation of all U.S. international broadcasting.  The plan will reduce operations at both RFE/RL and the Voice of America. By next October, VOA and REF/RL will have reduced their combined broadcast hours to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by 32 percent.  RFE/RL will reduce its budget by 67 percent--from $220 million to $75 million annually by fiscal 1996.  In terms of employees, RFE/RL will be cut by a similar amount--from 1,600 in September, 1993 to about 420 in fiscal 1996.  The research arm of RFE/RL has already been privatized: Its operations have been taken over by the open media society--a project funded by the philanthropist George Soros.  The new institute will undertake the restoration and preservation of the invaluable archives owned by RFE/RL--40 years of material that trace the dark era of totalitarianism in Eastern Europe and Eurasia.  This is a project for which no Federal funds were available. But because of this public-private partnership, that important objective will be realized.  The changes that I have enumerated will produce $400 million in savings over the period from 1994 to 1997. All this is not a one-time phenomenon--it is a permanent structural change.  In addition, Congress has directed RFE/RL to begin an effort to privatize the radios--that is, that the funding should be assumed by the private sector by the end of the decade.  The radios are taking that directive seriously. Their ongoing move to Prague is a critical part of the effort to prepare for privatization.  Let everyone understand what this amendment will do--it will emasculate Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.  The fiscal year 1995 budget for the radios is $229 million. That includes $103.5 million for one-time downsizing costs.  Nearly $67 million of those costs are mandated by German labor laws.  Restrictive German labor laws require RFE/RL to pay severance and other benefits to the hundreds of employees who will be laid off--laws that RFE/RL, as a private corporation operating in Germany, must comply with. It is undisputed that RFE/RL, Inc. is subject to German labor laws.  A recent case, decided in February in the D.C. Circuit (Mahoney v. RFE/RL, Inc.), made clear that as a corporation with its principal place of business in Munich, RFE/RL would violate the laws of Germany if the corporation breached its collective bargaining agreements.               this will stop an important move to prague  In short, the effect of this amendment would be to place a dagger in the heart of the radios--at a moment when they are in the midst of a move from Munich to Prague, where they are preparing for the eventual privatization of RFE/RL.  This would break faith with a decision that the President and Congress jointly made last year.  Last January, the Senate voted to consolidate RFE/RL and the Voice of America.  Last summer, the President sent a reprogramming to Congress which provided for the move of the headquarters of RFE/RL from Munich to Prague.  I do not recall any of my colleagues objecting at that time to the continuation of RFE/RL.  But now the move to Prague is in motion. Four language services are now being produced in Prague: Russian, Ukrainian, Latvian, and the South Slav service.  RFE/RL plans to be out of Munich by June 10.  Because Munich is one of the most expensive cities in Europe, the move will achieve important savings. Per capita personnel costs will be reduced by one-third.  The President of the Czech Republic, President Havel, made an extremely generous offer to allow the radios to use the former Czechoslovak Federal Parliament Building for a nominal fee of one Czech crown per day--or 12 dollars per year.  The President of the United States accepted that offer last summer. This amendment would obviously undercut that commitment.  That is why the Clinton administration is strongly opposed to the Harkin amendment, as stated in the letter I read earlier from Joe Duffey, director of the U.S. Information Agency.                   rfe/rl and voa are not duplicative  It is not true that RFE/RL duplicates the Voice of America.  The two radios have different missions. The Voice of America's is mandated to tell America's story.  By contrast, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, radios provide news and information about local events within the recipient countries.  In this manner, RFE/RL act as home service or surrogate radios in the absence of fully free and independent media in the emerging democracies of the Eastern Europe and Eurasia.  As a result of the broadcast consolidation, the amount of overlapping broadcasts--that is, broadcasts by both RFE/RL and the VOA in the same language at the same time--was reduced from 24 hours to zero.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the cable news network now suffices for the countries of the former Soviet Empire.  In most countries, there are only two ways to obtain CNN--by staying in an expensive hotel or to buy a satellite dish.  I do not have any data on how many such dishes are available, but I cannot believe they are widespread.  More important, the news of CNN is in English, and it is international news. The news on Radio Free Europe [[Page S5353]] and Radio Liberty is in the vernacular--the local language; and it focuses mainly on local news.  Do not take my word for it that these broadcasts are still needed. Listen to the results of a survey conducted last fall in the region.  A poll of decisionmakers in each country--government, military, media, and economic leaders--clearly demonstrates this point.  When the proposition was put to them that Western radio is needed despite the new media freedom, some 75 percent of those polled disagreed or strongly disagreed.  I sympathize with my friend from Iowa about the choice we face in this bill.  I am in favor of restoring the cuts to the corporation for public broadcasting--but not at the expense of one of the most valuable instruments in American foreign policy.  The last point I will make is the administration is opposed to the amendment of my friend from Iowa. And I hope I have done this within 2\1/2\ minutes.
