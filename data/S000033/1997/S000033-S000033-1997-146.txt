 Chairman.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will report the amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:  Amendment offered by Mr. Sanders: After title XVII insert the      following new title: TITLE XVIII--SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPRISONMENT OF NGAWANG                            CHOEPHEL IN CHINA     SEC. 1801. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMPRISONMENT OF                    NGAWANG CHOEPHEL IN CHINA       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Chinese Government sentenced Ngawang Choephel to an      18-year prison term plus 4 years subsequent deprivation of      his political rights on December 26, 1996, following a secret      trial.       (2) Mr. Choephel is a Tibetan national whose family fled      Chinese oppression to live in exile in India in 1968.       (3) Mr. Choephel studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury      College in Vermont as a Fulbright Scholar, and at the Tibetan      Institute of Performing Arts in Dharamsala, India.       (4) Mr. Choephel returned to Tibet in July 1995 to prepare      a documentary film about traditional Tibetan performing arts.       (5) Mr. Choephel was detained in August 1995 by the Chinese      authorities and held incommunicado for over a year before the      Government of the People's Republic of China admitted to      holding him, and finally charged him with espionage in      October 1996.       (6) There is no evidence that Mr. Choephel's activities in      Tibet involved anything other than purely academic research.       (7) The Government of the People's Republic of China denies      Tibetans their fundamental human rights, as reported in the      State Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices,      and by human rights organizations, including Amnesty      International and Human Rights Watch, Asia.       (8) The Government of the People's Republic of China is      responsible for the destruction of much of Tibetan      civilization since its invasion of Tibet in 1949.       (9) The arrest of a Tibetan scholar such as Mr. Choephel,      who worked to preserve Tibetan culture, reflects the      systematic attempt by the Government of the People's Republic      of China to repress cultural expression in Tibet.       (10) The Government of the People's Republic of China,      through direct and indirect incentives, has established      discriminatory development programs which have resulted in an      overwhelming flow of Chinese immigrants into Tibet, including      those areas incorporated into the Chinese provinces of      Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu, and Quinghai, and have excluded      Tibetans from participation in important policy decisions,      which further threatens traditional Tibetan life.       (11) The Government of the People's Republic of China      withholds meaningful participation in the governance of Tibet      from Tibetans and has failed to abide by its own      constitutional guarantee of autonomy for Tibetans.       (12) The Dalai Lama of Tibet has stated his willingness to      enter into negotiations with the Chinese and has repeatedly      accepted the framework Deng Xiaoping proposed for such      negotiations in 1979.       (13) The Chinese have displayed provocative disregard for      the concerns of the United States by arresting and sentencing      prominent dissidents in close proximity to visits to China by      senior United States Government officials.       (14) The United States Government policy seeks to foster      negotiations between the Government of the People's Republic      of China and the Dalai Lama, and presses China to respect      Tibet's unique religious, linguistic, and cultural      traditions.       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that--       (1) Ngawang Choephel and other prisoners of conscience in      Tibet, as well as in China, should be released immediately      and unconditionally;       (2) to underscore the gravity of this matter, in all      appropriate official meetings with representatives of the      Government of the People's Republic of China, United States      officials should request Mr. Choephel's immediate and      unconditional release;       (3) the United States Government should sponsor and promote      a resolution at future meetings of the United Nations      Commission on Human Rights and other appropriate      international fora regarding China and Tibet which      specifically addresses political prisoners and negotiations      with the Dalai Lama, until those situations in China and      Tibet improve substantially;       (4) the United States Department of State should advise      American citizens that Tibet is not currently a safe      destination for American travelers;       (5) an exchange program should be established in honor of      Ngawang Choephel, involving students of the Tibetan Institute      of Performing Arts and appropriate educational institutions      in the United States; and       (6) the United States Government should seek access for      internationally recognized human rights groups to monitor      human rights in Tibet.
