Speaker, those who have followed the congressional debate today may be in a quandary trying to figure out exactly what is going on on Capitol Hill. Let me try to set the record straight, so that there is an understanding about the political dynamic and what it means to every American family.  Mr. Speaker, we are in the process now of trying to come up with a budget for this fiscal year for the Federal Government. The fiscal year actually started October 1. There was a failure of the Republican leadership to pass appropriation bills on time to continue the business of the Federal Government. As a consequence, they have passed what is known as a continuing resolution which just basically keeps the agencies in business on a short-term basis.  There is a second item known as a debt ceiling, which basically gives authority to the Federal Treasury to continue to borrow money so that we can extend the full faith and credit of the United States and not default on our obligations. That debt ceiling limit should have been passed for a long period of time several weeks ago, but we have failed under the Republican leadership to do that either, and so now we are at an impasse.  The President of the United States has said that he will sign a bill which will keep the agencies of Government in business. He will sign a debt ceiling bill so that the United States does not default on its debt. But my Republican colleagues have decided to make this more interesting from a political point of view. They will not send the President a simple bill that meets our obligation. Instead they keep loading up every bill with their political favorites.  Mr. Speaker, there are special interest groups roaming all over the corridors on Capitol Hill, each of which wants another ornament for his Christmas tree, and so they find these bills that come along and they stick on a series of amendments, some of them very serious in tone, others just designed to keep special interest groups very happy.  The Republicans are going to send these bills to the President, and he has already told them that he is going to veto them. This leads to the so-called train wreck, the gridlock, the crisis which Speaker Gingrich is using as part of his strategy to pressure the President of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, what is sad about this is that none of us, Democrats or Republicans, or Independents for that matter, were sent to Washington to engage in gridlock. We were not sent here to fail, to create problems, to close down Government agencies so people seeking Social Security checks or veterans checks or small business loans will not have anybody to work with.  We were not sent here to default on the debt of the Nation for the first time in our history. We were sent here to meet our obligations on a bipartisan basis and really go back home and meet with our constituents. Instead, we are spending late night hours and long, tortuous debates because of this political tangle.  Part of it has to do with the Republican plan to balance the budget. Most of us favor balancing the budget, but the Republican approach goes far beyond balancing the budget. What they are calling for is a $270 billion cut in Medicare, a cut in a program that is totally unnecessary. They are savaging Medicare far more than they have to in order to come up with extra funds. For what purpose? Not do reduce the national debt, but to create tax breaks. You see the Republican theory from time immemorial is a trickle-down theory. They have always believed that if you make the rich rich enough, it will somehow help working families. Most of us know that is not true. Working families know it for sure.  We are also concerned about cuts in education. I am here today standing on the floor of this hall of the U.S. House of Representatives because this Federal Government, over 30 years ago, loaned me the money to go to college. If they had not loaned it to me, I am not sure what I would be today.  My story is repeated millions of times over, and yet the Republicans believe we need to cut over $10 billion out of college student loans as part of balancing the budget.  Frankly, if we give up on education, if we give up on educating the kids of working families, we are giving up on our future. What we need now is a more responsible, bipartisan, commonsense approach. We have got to stop this massive cut of Medicare to provide a tax break for the wealthy. We have got to stop savaging the education programs that are so important to our children. We have got to stop playing political games with the operations of the Federal Government and with our Nation's national debt.  Unfortunately, the next several days are not going to be very pretty. I wish Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle would adopt my simple proposal: No budget, no pay. If the Members of Congress cannot meet their responsibility to keep the agencies of the Federal Government in operation and not to default on our national obligations and debt, we should not be paid for it. We ought to basically say if we are going to send the Federal employees home without pay, Members of Congress ought do without a pay check.  Mr. Speaker, I have offered it three times and lost three times. I wrote a letter to Speaker Gingrich and asked him to make it in order. Unfortunately, there must have been a fire in his mailbox. He has not gotten back to me.  The concerns that the American people have about the future are concerns that we share in Congress. We do not shut down Federal Agencies and then keep drawing congressional paychecks. That suggests to me the kind of arrogance which people do not want in their elected representatives.  Mr. Speaker, I hope those who follow this debate will remember the simple challenge that is ahead of us. We can balance the budget if we get rid of the tax cuts and the onerous cuts in Medicare, we can make sure that we have a bright future if we stick with investments in education, and we can make certain that this Government stays in business doing its business if we stop the political shenanigans and get down to the real business of functioning on a bipartisan, commonsense basis.                          ____________________
