For 29 years, Steve has served our region as a reporter with the Washington Post, and for the last 8 years he has written the Post's Federal Diary column, covering workplace issues within the three branches of the Federal government.  As someone who represents 58,000 Federal workers, I am especially grateful for Steve's work to make the Federal Diary a highly-valuable resource on the issues of greatest importance to our nation's civil service employees. For those of us monitoring the daily developments affecting our federal workforce, Steve's column has been required reading.  Madam Speaker, as we are well aware, our federal workforce is one of the best in the world, and in Steve, we could not have asked for anyone who recognizes that more. The quality of his work is a mark of the great pride and pleasure he so clearly possesses in his service to our public service workers. So while Steve's departure marks the end of an era at the Post's Federal Diary, I assure you that his contributions will long be remembered. I wish him the best in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
