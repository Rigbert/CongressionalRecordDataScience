President, without going into the issue of the telecommunications bill--which I will not--I just want to emphasize what the distinguished majority leader said. As my colleagues know, he, I, and some others had an amendment at the desk. We would have voted cloture under normal circumstances. Following the first cloture vote today, the distinguished majority leader, the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Lugar, and I have met. I want to emphasize one thing.   In the 21 years that I have been here, the most successful farm legislation has been bipartisan farm legislation. The most successful farm legislation has been that where we have worked together. There are a lot of issues in this, from the normal crops to issues of nutrition, conservation, reserve areas, which are very important to me. I know that the only kind of legislation we are ever actually going to see go into law is something we all work together on.  I commend Senator Dole and Senator Daschle and Senator Lugar and others for working so hard to bring us together. I think we will shortly be in a position to put before the body a piece of legislation that we can at least all vote cloture on and then go on in the normal course of things on the farm bill.  But I commend those Senators again on both sides of the aisle who have been willing to work together on legislation to protect the farmers of our country, to require the production of food and fiber and allow family farms to continue, but also to protect the environment of this country and to feed the people of this country through the nutrition programs. Those programs work best when we come together to pass it. I think we are coming very close to that.  I thank the distinguished majority leader for yielding to me.                          ____________________
