I have said this right along. I may or may not vote for Mr. Estrada based on what is in the writings, but I will never give a blank check to any President--I have not--Democrat or Republican. I want to know what is in there. After all, there have been statements by this person's supervisor that he did not fairly state the law in the course of his work. We should have the basis to determine the quality of his work.  As the Senator from Illinois knows, when I was chairman of the committee, in 17 months we certainly moved far more of President Bush's nominees than the Republicans did when they were in the chair the previous 17 months for President Clinton. I believe that we actually moved more than the previous 30-month period under them. I did not allow the secret holds they had used extensively to block President Clinton's nominees. At times, they actually required 100 Senators to be for somebody before they would go through it.  A former Republican leader accepted part of the blame for how the Senate came to this, and I appreciate him doing that. He acknowledged you filibuster a lot of different ways. The Republican majority often defeated nominees by making sure they were never given a hearing or a vote. I don't believe in that.  If a nominee will go through the normal process, if the White House will stop playing games, if they will stop stonewalling, I am perfectly willing to go forward.
