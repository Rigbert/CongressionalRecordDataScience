 I don't know the particular situation of their States. I don't know whether they tax DSL. I do know that the bill exempts telecommunications, and telecommunications has been a legitimate source of revenue which is now affected by this grandfather clause. Obviously, if I could get half a loaf for my State, I do not want to sell out those whom I have been working with over the last week.
