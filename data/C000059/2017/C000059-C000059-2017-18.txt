 Ms. McCOLLUM. The EPA was there to work with the city when the fire department found out what a danger it was. When the county wasn't able to handle such an extreme toxic cleanup, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency was able to call on EPA Region 5. They knew the people. They had worked together on other projects, and they gave comfort and aid to homeowners that this toxic waste site that people didn't even know existed from as close as you and I are to each other, sir, was in their backyard.  The EPA does a lot of work. We are asking them to do it on a shorter budget. This would make it impossible for them to do their work at all.  Madam Chair, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his support of the EPA, although sometimes we disagree at what level.
