 President, today I honor Dr. Richard B. Harvey, Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science on the occasion of his retirement from Whittier College. Over the span of four decades, Dr. Harvey has also served as Assistant Dean, Dean of Academic Affairs and Chair of the Political Science Department of Whittier College.  In addition to his academic pursuits, Dr. Harvey is the accomplished author of The Dynamics of California Government and Politics, a well known textbook in its sixth edition, Earl Warren, Governor of California, and a number of articles and book reviews. He is also a radio commentator, delivering political analysis of election results.  His educational leadership has inspired countless young students to pursue civic opportunities. Dr. Harvey's Politics Outside the Classroom course exposed students various powerhouses in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas. Students met and discussed California politics with some of the state's most influential political officials, learning more about the practical world of politics than a textbook or lecture can offer.  Dr. Harvey's dedication to educating students and his belief in the significance of the political process are worthy of recognition. He earned a B.A. degree from Occidental College, and M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing Dr. Richard Harvey best wishes on his retirement and in all of his future endeavors. His dedication and commitment to teaching California politics for over forty years has set an example that will be emulated for years to come.                        TRIBUTE TO NATIONAL LIFE
