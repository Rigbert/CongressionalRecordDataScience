 I have come to respect Claire McCaskill over a long period of time. I have watched her walk in a room and watched heads turn. I have listened to her up front, answering questions: no nonsense, direct, truthful, to the very best of her ability. I found in her a great sense of conscience. She has this marvelous exterior. I think the interior is a little different.  There is a sensitivity there that is very special, Senator. I hope you never ever lose it because it is what gives you the ability to do what you do. Now I expect to turn on my television set and turn on my radio and hear you many times and take a lot of good advice and have a few laughs listening to you.  I want to say thank you. You have represented your State well. You have stood tall. You have spoken out in our caucuses. You have let people know what you feel. You wear your heart on your sleeve, and you are one great woman.
