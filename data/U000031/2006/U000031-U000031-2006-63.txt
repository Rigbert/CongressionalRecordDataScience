Chairman, I live by an adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. No Internet service provider ought to be able to block access to your favorite Web sites or Internet applications, and I have to say that there are protections in this bill which preserve those rights. There is no evidence of any problem. And if they surface, we have some protections in here.  Let me read what they are. This bill, Barton-Rush bill, ensures that consumers are entitled to: one, access the lawful Internet content of their choice; two, run applications and services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement; three, connect their choice of legal devices that do no harm to the network; and, four, competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers.  We give the FCC the explicit authority to enforce those principles, in fact, a fine for up to half a million dollars for every violation. We have a 90-day time clock to make sure that they are adjudicated properly and in a timely fashion.  The Internet has a great history of developing free of taxation and regulation. We want to keep it that way, and that is why we should vote ``no'' on this amendment.
