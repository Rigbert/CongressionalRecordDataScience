President, I rise today to talk about a bill that will help many truck-drivers across the country. As we all know, the trucking industry has incurred an incredible cost increase in recent years due to higher fuel prices and other taxes. One of my constituents, Phillip Parks, has felt this tremendous financial burden and, as a result, sold his truck and got out of the business altogether.  The heavy vehicle use tax is one tax many truck drivers, like Mr. Parks, are required to pay each year. Under the current IRS code, when a vehicle over 75,000 pounds is purchased and driven over 5,000 miles, the owner must pay a $550 heavy-use tax. However, if the owner sells the vehicle in the same year, he or she is unable to receive a refund on this tax, while the person buying the vehicle does not have to pay the tax during that year since it has already been paid. This is what happened to Mr. Parks.  My bill will not only make this tax more fair, but will provide some much-needed relief for people who wish to sell their trucks within the same year they bought them. The Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Equity Act will require the purchaser to pay a prorated tax on the vehicle, while the person selling it will receive a refund for the portion of the tax relative to the time in which they owned it.  I am pleased to introduce this bill that will help make our complex tax code more equitable while putting money back into the hands of hard-working Americans, like Phillip Parks of Stillwell, OK.                                 ______                                       By
