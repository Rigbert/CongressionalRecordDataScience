 President, on February 5, I introduced the Bear Protection Act, S. 263. This measure is aimed at controlling poaching of bears such as the American black bear which is found in Kentucky. It addresses several enforcement and jurisdictional loopholes that are caused by a patchwork of State laws. The current inconsistencies enable a wildly profitable underground black market for bear parts to flourish in the United States.  Mr. President, my bill would in no way affect legal hunting of bears. Hunters would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears killed during legal hunts. This measure would only prohibit the sale or barter of the internal organs of the bear which are referred to as bear viscera.  This bill is made necessary because of the booming illegal trade in bear viscera. At least 18 Asian countries are known to participate in the illegal trade in bear parts. Bear viscera are also illegally sold and traded in large urban areas in the United States such as San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and New York City. These cities serve as primary ports for export shipments of these goods.  Bear parts, such as gall bladders, are used in traditional Asian medicine to treat everything from diabetes to heart disease. Due to the increasing demand for bear viscera, the population of Asian black bears has been totally annihilated over the last few years. This has led poachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand. I, for one, will not stand by and allow our own bear populations to be decimated by poachers.  Mr. President, it is estimated that Kentucky has only 50 to 100 black bears remaining in the wild. Black bears once roamed free across the Appalachian Mountains, through the rolling hills of the bluegrass, all the way to the Mississippi River. Although we cannot restore the numbers we once had, we can ensure that the remaining bears are not sold for profit to the highest bidder.  Poaching has become an astoundingly profitable enterprise. It is estimated that over 40,000 bears are poached in the United States every year. That equals the number that are taken by legal hunting.  Mr. President, the main reason behind these astounding numbers is greed. In South Korea, bear gall bladders are worth their weight in gold, and an average bear gall bladder can bring as high as $10,000 on the black market.  Currently, U.S. law enforcement officials have little power to address the poaching of bears and the sale of their parts in an effective manner. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has neither the manpower nor the budget to test all bear parts sold legally in the United States. Without extensive testing, law enforcement officials cannot determine if gall bladders or other parts have come from threatened or endangered species. This problem perpetuates the poaching of endangered or threatened bears.  The Lacey Act currently regulates the interstate commerce of wildlife possessed or transported in violation of State law. Inconsistencies in State law, however, make convictions under this statute difficult. Under the current legal situation, it is impossible to determine whether a gall bladder being sold in Idaho comes from a legally taken local bear or an endangered Louisiana black bear without expensive testing. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Special Agent Corky Roberts illustrates this point in a recent Humane Society publication,       If somebody kills a bear in the state of Washington all      they have to do is get it to Idaho. Technically * * *, it's      against the law but all it does is make it more difficult to      prove that the bear was taken in Washington and traded      illegally in interstate commerce. That's where the Lacey Act      has problems.  The Bear Protection Act will establish national guidelines for trade in bear parts, but it will not weaken any existing State laws that have been instituted to deal with this issue. My bill will also instruct the Secretary of the Interior and the U.S. Trade Representative to establish a dialog with the appropriate countries to coordinate efforts aimed at curtailing the international bear trade.  Mr. President, this measure is crafted narrowly enough to deal with the poaching of the American black bear for profit, while still ensuring the rights of American sportsmen. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this much-needed legislation. Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Congressional Record.  The text of the bill follows:                                 S. 263       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) there are 8 extant species of bear: Asian black bear,      brown bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear,      giant panda, sun bear, and sloth bear;       (2) the Asian black bear populations have been decimated in      recent years by illegal trade to supply the growing demand      for medicines and cosmetics containing valuable bear viscera;       (3) without immediate action to end United States      involvement in the lucrative black market trade in bear      viscera, American bear populations may suffer the same      devastating losses as Asian bear populations;       (4) increasingly, undercover operations have discovered      that poachers are establishing extensive smuggling networks      to illegally commercialize American bears;       (5) because it is practically impossible to distinguish the      viscera of CITES Appendix I bears from the viscera of other      bear species, there is an urgent need to eliminate the trade      in the viscera of all bear species;       (6) as a party to CITES, a world leader in wildlife      conservation, and a larger market for and supplier of bear      viscera and products, the United States shares responsibility      for supporting and implementing measures to stop the illegal      trade in CITES Appendix I Asian black bears and CITES      Appendix II American black bears;       (7) inconsistency in State prohibition of commercialization      of bear gall and inadequate Federal regulation of such      commercialization make law enforcement difficult; and       (8) individual States, which have the right to set,      maintain, and enforce quotas for the legal hunting of black      bears, will be assisted in their management efforts by the      enactment of a Federal law banning the import of, export of,      and interstate commerce in bear viscera.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term      viability of the world's 8 bear species and specifically to      perpetuate healthy populations of American bears.     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.       It is the policy of the United States that effective long-     term conservation of the world's bear species, including      North American bears, depends in part on the prohibition of      the lucrative trade in bear viscera.
