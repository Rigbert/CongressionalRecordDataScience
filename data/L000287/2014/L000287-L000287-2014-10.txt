Speaker, I rise today to reintroduce the National Parents Corps Act of 2014. I am proud to author this legislation which intends to combat youth violence and substance abuse in our country's schools.  The National Parents Corps Act aims to continue the successful National Parents Corps program first initiated in 2003. The bill revitalizes a program which trains parent leaders to collaborate with schools, students, and the community in order to proactively work together in deterring and reducing alcohol and drug abuse, bullying, gang involvement, and other dangerous activities.  The program targets middle school students and creates a collaborative network to recognize and respond to dangerous trends in the most susceptible school-age population--middle school. Professionally-trained parent leaders will build critical networks between students, parents, teachers, administrators, local law enforcement, and the community. They will develop prevention programs, share scientific research, best practices, and create spaces of open dialogue and targeted action.  Mr. Speaker, I have always stood for investing in children and for peaceful communities, which is why I am reintroducing this legislation. No child should live his or her life in fear or marked by drugs and violence. This bill responds to a clear need, with a targeted and effective approach, and I hope all of my colleagues will join this common-sense effort to support healthy, safe, schools.                          ____________________
