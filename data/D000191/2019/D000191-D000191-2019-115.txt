. 3055, a Continuing Resolution (CR) to fund the government through December 20, 2019.  Let me be clear: I strongly support the majority of the funding extensions and protections in this CR. This includes the well-deserved 3.1 percent pay raise to our men and women in uniform, of which I also voted in favor earlier this year in separate legislation. The compensation for our men and women in uniform should never be compromised by Congress's inability to pass annual funding legislation.  I am also pleased that this CR includes a provision that would protect federal highway funding and generate new jobs. Using my position as Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I worked to ensure that the CR included a provision that would repeal Section 1438 of the FAST Act of 2015. Section 1438, which was included at the insistence of Republican leaders in 2015, will rescind $7.6 billion of federal highway funding in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 if it is not repealed.  I strongly support repeal of Section 1438, which is long overdue. Transportation agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia are counting on Congress to prevent this massive, multi-billion dollar cut from going into effect. Although I unfortunately had to vote against the CR for unrelated reasons, I applaud my colleagues for taking this issue seriously and including the rescission repeal in this must-pass bill. I'm pleased we are taking a positive step to finally give states the certainty they need to carry out long-term projects that create jobs and help their communities.  Furthermore, I strongly support the extensions in the CR to protect funding for Community Health Centers, which provide a vital lifeline for health care services to thousands of Oregonians and millions of Americans across the country. I am also pleased that this legislation extends funding for the National Health Service Corps and the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education Program, two health care workforce programs that provide resources to support the training of health providers in rural and underserved areas.  In addition, I am pleased that this legislation protects funding for important health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid programs, disproportionate share hospitals, the Community Mental Health Services Demonstration Program, the Special Diabetes Program, and funds to respond to the Ebola outbreak in Africa.  I also strongly support the funding extensions provided to ensure the Census Bureau has the funding it needs to continue carrying out the 2020 Decennial Census.  Moreover, I support the CR's funding extension for the critical Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which allows the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to match state child care expenditures and make scheduled contingency fund payments. The legislation also ensures that the current caseload in the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which serves low-income seniors, is maintained.  However, I opposed the CR because it includes absurd provisions to extend mass surveillance programs under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). This includes Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which has allowed for mass surveillance of Americans' call records, as well as roving wire tap provisions and so-called ``lone wolf'' authority.  I am strongly opposed to these data collection and mass surveillance programs, which I believe are unconstitutional. I voted against the original PATRIOT Act in 2001, and I have continued to oppose reauthorization of this and related mass surveillance programs unless and until significant reforms are made to protect the constitutional privacy rights of U.S. citizens.  For years, I have urged congressional leadership under both parties to take up meaningful reform of these government spying programs and allow for sincere, robust debate on how to restore Americans' constitutional rights to privacy while also protecting our nation's security. In July, I was one of 7 Democrats to vote against the Intelligence Authorization Act because it did not contain any significant reforms to curb government surveillance.  That's why I joined my colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees urging them to finally take up meaningful surveillance reform legislation before Section 215 and related FISA provisions expire on December 15 of this year.  Regrettably, this CR is yet another example of Congress's habit of kicking the can down the road instead of engaging in long-overdue, substantive debate on surveillance reform legislation. Congress owes it to the American people to end government mass surveillance and restore Americans' civil liberties and constitutional rights.  As I've always said, while we must ensure that law enforcement officials have the tools they need to assess, detect, and prevent future terrorist attacks, I don't believe we have to shred the Constitution and Bill of Rights in order to fight terrorism.  The bottom line is that it is beyond time for Congress to provide long-term stability and funding in its annual appropriations process. The Democratic-led House completed nearly all of its appropriations bills before September 30, the end of the Fiscal Year. Because the Senate did not get its work done in time, bridge funding in the form of continuing resolutions has been needed to keep the government open. Congress needs to get its act together and halt the ridiculous and irresponsible lurching from short-term fix to short-term fix.  I hope the Senate can get its work done so we can finally stop the budget gimmicks and spend our time working on important issues like fighting climate change, improving access to health care, upgrading our dilapidated infrastructure, investing in public education, and more. That is what Americans expect, and that is what they deserve.                          ____________________
