Mr. Speaker, I rise today to note the passing of a fine man, long-time Alaskan Jon Scribner. Jon was from Juneau, where he had served as the Regional Director of the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. In this job, Jon managed transportation issues for Southeast Alaska. He loved his job and did it well; he will be badly missed by his many friends and co-workers in Juneau.  Scribner, 63, died May 12, 2005 at elevation 3,100 feet, in an accidental fall while returning from a successful climb of Mount Stroller White near Juneau.  He was born March 1, 1942, in San Francisco, California and was raised in Weed, California. Jon majored in civil engineering and played basketball at the University of California Davis. For part of his senior year, he had been a bench warmer until he entered late into a game when his team was so far behind that the coach figured the game was lost. Jon intercepted passes, stole balls, and single-handedly scored about a dozen points in less than two minutes. Davis won and Scribner started the rest of the season.  After UC Davis, Jon earned a master's degree in engineering from Stanford, which had a distinguished program in environmental engineering.  He married Kathryn (Kit) Duggan of Carmel, California, on June 10, 1967.  After Stanford, Jon served his nation honorably in the Army Medical Service. Captain Scribner taught at the Medical Field Service School at Fort Sam Houston, Texas from 1967 to 1969. He had been selected as faculty based upon his academic record and related credentials.  Jon and Kit moved in 1969 to Alaska, and he worked for the Alaska Department of Health and Welfare in Fairbanks. In 1971, they moved to Juneau, where he served as director of air and water quality for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. He was a senior official in the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, serving as assistant deputy commissioner for design and construction and as director of the department's Southeast Alaska Region. He served at the pleasure of Governors Hammond, Sheffield, Cowper, Hickel, and Knowles. His repeated reappointments attest to his integrity and hard work.  He retired from state service in 1997 after a career publicly recognized for professionalism and accomplishment. When he left the department, then-Juneau Mayor Dennis Egan proclaimed his retirement date, Feb. 7, 1997, as Jonathan Scribner Day in the city. The proclamation included thanks for Scribner getting a Thane Road project out to bid on his last day of work.  In the legislature, the speaker of the House and president of the Senate signed a statement honoring Scribner for his contributions. ``All Alaskans, both now and in the future, will continue to benefit from his efforts,'' it said.  The couple raised their family in Juneau, where they enjoyed boating, hunting, fishing, bird watching, scuba diving, and hiking. They made frequent visits with family to the Mount Shasta area of California. He traveled Southeast Alaska with his 24-foot Bayliner cruiser, Mandy Ann, speeding family and close friends from one end of Southeast Alaska to the other.  He is survived by his wife, Kit; his daughters, Jennifer Laitinen and her husband Todd, and Amanda Mallott and her husband Anthony; his son, Nathan; and his grandson Tyler and granddaughter Addison.  Lu and I send our deepest sympathies to them in their hour of loss. We hope they are comforted by the memory of Jon's very full life, and of his many friends and admirers. I consider myself one of them.                          ____________________
