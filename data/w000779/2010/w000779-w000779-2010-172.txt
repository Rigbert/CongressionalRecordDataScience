President, today I honor Fred Rosenbaum, a brigadier general, businessman, public servant, philanthropist, Holocaust survivor and one of Oregon's greatest residents. I have known few others who matched Fred's courage and dedication to improving the lives of every American. Although cancer may have taken Fred from this world, nothing can take away the remarkable legacy he left to Oregon and the Nation as a whole.  From his childhood as a Jew in Nazi Germany, Fred Rosenbaum saw the worst of humanity. Growing up in Vienna, Austria, Fred experienced the anti-Semitic riots of Kristallnachtfirst-hand. At age 12, shortly after Kristallnacht, school officials attempted to round up Fred and his Jewish classmates in a school basement, for eventual capture by the Nazi SS. Fred narrowly escaped them by crawling out a window and eventually finding his way to England. From England, Fred helped his parents escape from Austria.  Fred and his family eventually immigrated to Portland, OR, to start a new life. Within just a few years, Fred began serving his new country. At age 16, Fred lied about his age and joined the Army, serving in the Philippines. In a sense, Fred experienced both fronts of the Second World War.  Fred's service to his country extended for long after the conclusion of the war. After Fred returned home, he joined the Oregon National Guard and, by his retirement in 1986, earned the rank of brigadier general.  At the same time, Fred built up a successful insurance business and employed his success for the public good. He chaired Portland's Housing Authority for 13 years, served as president of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, served on the board of trustees of Reed College, and became an associate national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League. Service to others was an essential part of Fred's life, and we are all richer for it.  However, if the name ``Rosenbaum'' lives on in Oregon for one reason, it is his work improving the lives of children. Fred drew upon his experience both as an officer in the Oregon National Guard and as a chairman of the Housing Authority of Portland to create a summer camp for at-risk youth. He founded the camp 40 years ago, and the camp continues to operate to this day, buoyed by Fred's tireless dedication to its fundraising and survival.  The camp, located at the National Guard's Camp Rilea and now called ``Camp Rosenbaum'' in Fred's honor, provides pre-teens who live in public housing with an opportunity to fill their days with sports, the arts, and computer skills, while counselors and the Portland Police Bureau educate the children on the dangers of gangs and drugs. For many of the young and impoverished campers, it gives them their first chance to see the Pacific Ocean, and that moment always excites the kids. For the first time in their lives, they see a limitless horizon and Camp Rosenbaum helps them see that their potential is just as limitless.  Even though Fred has passed away, Camp Rosenbaum will continue to educate and engage at-risk youth. He would ask for nothing more.  Fred lived a life of service that immeasurably benefited both America and Oregon, and his legacy will live on for long after his passing. Not satisfied to just improve his own life, Fred dedicated himself to giving every child an opportunity to achieve their dreams.  His life is an inspiration to refugees everywhere, and a demonstration of the promise our country offers to those in even the direst of straits. Oregon and America have lost a humble hero who achieved greatness by helping others. Living up to his example of kindness and caring is a challenge he left to us all. Every American should rise to that challenge and give back to their communities and our country as much as Fred did. It would be a fitting tribute to an extraordinary man and a great American.                          ____________________
