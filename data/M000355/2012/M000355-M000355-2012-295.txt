 I think of, as an example, my own wife, who came here at age 8, not speaking a word of English. The majority leader was just pointing out an immigrant from Vietnam who has done well. Senator McCain has said the same thing that all three of us have said on numerous occasions. So it is indeed something to celebrate.                          ____________________
