Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I recognize the Visiting Nurse Association, VNA, of Porter County Hospice Program as the organization celebrates its 30th anniversary. In honor of this momentous occasion, the VNA Hospice is hosting a celebratory event on Saturday, June 22, 2013 at Central Park Plaza in Valparaiso, Indiana.   The VNA Hospice Program was established in 1983 with the goal of providing comfort, care, and compassion to terminally ill patients and their families in and around the communities of Porter County. The program started with only 22 patients and has quickly grown over the years, caring for 742 patients in 2012. In 1994, in order to meet the growing need for inpatient hospice care, the VNA of Porter County opened the 10-bed Mary E. Bartz Hospice Center in Valparaiso, which was the first self-supporting hospice center in Indiana. Due to the tremendous support of the community through a $2.85 million capital campaign, the Arthur B. and Ethel V. Horton 20-bed hospice center was built to replace the Bartz Hospice Center in 2002. Throughout the last 30 years, the VNA Hospice Program has been able to help more than 11,000 patients live their final days with peace and dignity.   The VNA of Porter County Hospice Program has been successful due to the unwaveringdedication of its leadership, volunteers, and staff, including nurses, social workers, home health aides, clergy, and therapists. Northwest Indiana is not only grateful, but proud to have had the organization's support and help during the past 30 years.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the VNA of Porter County Hospice Program on their 30th anniversary. For their remarkable leadership, commitment, and compassion shown through their service to so many in need throughout Northwest Indiana, they are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
