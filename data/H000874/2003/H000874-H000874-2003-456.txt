Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. We all agree that this bill is needed. We also all know that the President's expectation of the number of people who would have gotten the smallpox vaccination at this point in time, particularly as it relates to first responders, nurses, police, emergency medical technicians, would have been far higher than it has been to date, so we are trying to facilitate that.  Clearly, the passage of this bill would be facilitated by having a bipartisan agreement that will not be contentious. But of course, as the gentleman knows, at the nub of this issue is how substantively we can accomplish the objective of getting as many of our nurses and police and emergency response personnel to voluntarily participate in this vaccination process.  So, again, I would urge the gentleman, if we cannot reach agreement, let the floor consider alternatives and let them decide, the floor, the Members of this House, as to what procedures and process and compensation will best facilitate that end. I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the leader, regarding the tax bill, I know the gentleman mentioned it, but when does he anticipate that coming to the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, the gentleman knows we are sort of at the mercy of the other body. The quicker we can complete a conference report on the budget, the quicker we can move the economic growth package. We are working as hard as we can to convince the Committee on the Budget, the budget committees of both houses, to work through the weekend, work all through next week, so we can bring the conference report to the floor.  If that happens, then we know what we have to deal with; and I would hopethat this House could bring the economic growth and jobs creation package to the floor before the Easter break.
