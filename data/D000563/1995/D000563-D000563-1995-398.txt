But if I may say this, this Member and most Members have the highest regard for the professionalism of the House Parliamentarian and his staff, and I want to make that clear and a matter of public record. If an apology has been extended, from this Member's point of view it is certainly accepted because I believe their level of professionalism is respected by all. We clearly will have differences of opinion on rulings.  I just would like to ask two questions by parliamentary inquiry and then I will sit down. I thank the Chair for [[Page H333]] rereading the ruling. It is improving every time he reads. But I would ask this question. Can a Member during the course of a 1-minute make any reference to an activity of another Member, including the Speaker, which has taken place outside this Chamber?
