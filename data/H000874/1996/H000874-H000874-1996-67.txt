Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of her amendment, but more than that, Mr. Chairman, I rise to commend the gentlewoman, who is the Chair of the oversight committee. She, and, I might say, her staff as well, have done extraordinarily hard work on reviewing what is a large, critical agency in our Government to insure that the taxpayers' money is being spent well, that the objectives issued by the Committee on Ways and Means, passed by this Congress and supported by this subcommittee, the Committee on Appropriations, are in fact carried out, and she and I are speaking not only from the same hymnal, but from the same chapter and the same verse on this issue, and I congratulate her for her hard work and focus on this issue because I think the taxpayers will be benefited by it, and I thank her for her efforts.
