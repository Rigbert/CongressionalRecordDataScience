Mr. Speaker, today we commemorate the eighth anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square, and the task of people who believe in truth and justice is more difficult than ever before.  Eight years ago, the world watched in horror as the Chinese military, under the direction of General Chi Haotian, rolled into Tiananmen Square and gunned down thousands of people--young and old--who had gathered in the Square, the heart of China, to peacefully seek reform and greater freedoms from their government. In minutes, the hopes and dreams of people the world over united in solidarity with the Tiananmen Square protesters were destroyed, and millions stood in disbelief that any government could unleash such terror on its people while the world watched.  I am sure that Chinese Government officials believed that, in time, the world would forget what happened in the early hours of June 4, 1989. But the spirit of those thousands who died there lives on. Their blood cries out so that we will not forget. Our hearts still ache for the dead, the injured, the arrested. Mr. Speaker, the world has not forgotten the martyrs of Tiananmen Square.  But there is something going on now that would be even more tragic than forgetting the Tiananmen Square Massacre and those who gave their lives on that day 8 years ago.  Now, the Chinese Government does not want us to forget this event happened, it wants us to believe that it never happened--that thousands of peaceful young people were not shot down in cold blood, that hundreds more were not injured. The Chinese Government wants us to believe that what we witnessed, what has been reported by observers, is a fabrication. A big lie. That instead of innocent students who were attacked, it was the People's Liberation Army which was under attack and on the defense.  The Butcher of Beijing, Gen. Chi Haotian, who ordered the troops into Tiananmen Square, and who is ultimately responsible for every death, every injury, every arrest, is now the Defense Minister of China. Just 6 months ago, this man was the honored guest of the Clinton administration--meeting with the President, given full military honors, and addressing top U.S. military officials.  The civilized world was stunned during his visit when General Chi told us that ``not a single person lost his life in Tiananmen Square'' and that the People's Liberation Army did nothing more violent than the ``pushing'' of ``hooligans.''  But, Mr. Speaker, we know the truth. We know that thousands died and more were injured. Witnesses have told of the horrors as people died standing up for freedom, democratic reform, and human rights.  Mr. Speaker, today is not enough for us to just remember. We must raise our voices so that the lives and deaths of those martyred in Tiananmen Square will not be erased.  The memory of those who died 8 years ago must burn in our hearts not just today but every day. We must not allow their deaths to be in vain. We must not allow the deeds of evil people to be rewarded and their lies to go unchallenged.  Mr. Speaker, today, we stand as one, to remember the courage of those who gave their lives in Tiananmen Square, and to commit ourselves to continue working together to carry on their dreams to bring about a free and democratic China.                          ____________________
