Mr. Chairman, I want to express my strong support for H.R. 7, the National Security Revitalization Act. The facts and figures set forth in the legislative findings to H.R. 872 make it clear that the United States may well be on its way back to the hollow forces of the 1970's. But this is not the whole story. Even as we have committed less to the national defense, we have spent more and more of these precious resources on operations which are at best peripheral to the mission of the U.S. Armed Forces. During the first 100 days of this Congress we can change this course and put America back on the road to peace through strength--the successful strategy of the Reagan years, which made the world both more peaceful and more free.  Mr. Chairman, we need the things this bill will provide and encourages. We need to seriously pursue an anti-ballistic missile system, which is not only more practical but also more moral than a system of mutual assured destruction. Most Americans are woefully unaware of the fact that we have no defense against incoming missile attacks. We need to adapt NATO, which Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick has described as the most successful collective security arrangement in modern history, to provide for the security of European nations which are newly free. We need a relationship with the United Nations that allows that organization to do the things it does best while also preserving the sovereignty and effectiveness of the United States.  Mr. Chairman, nothing in this world is perfect. Many Americans would say that things designed by Congress are even more imperfect than other things. Members of the International Relations Committee, including this member, made suggestions for improving this bill. Our distinguished Chairman, Ben Gilman and members of the Committee staff encouraged these suggestions and worked hard to accommodate them. We amended the bill to meet many of the objections that are now being reiterated on the floor. Mr. Chairman, the National Security Revitalization Act as amended will go a long way toward the restoration of a strong America. This, in turn, will make for a safer and freer world. I hope we can move quickly to final enactment.                              {time}  1630
