We believe the American public, the American people, have the right to know where their representatives stand on the central and sole issue that the resolution will raise.  There may be other issues that you might want to raise at some point in time. And there are going to be at least three pieces of legislation, as you know, that will be coming down the pike on this issue: the supplemental, the authorization bill, and the appropriation bill for 2008.  We expect all of those bills to be relatively broad in their treatment of various different aspects. But I will tell the gentleman, frankly, because we feel this is such a critically important question and that the clarity of the question and the clarity of the response is so important that we are trying to carefully consider how we can assure that there is no confusion as to the answer that this House gives.
