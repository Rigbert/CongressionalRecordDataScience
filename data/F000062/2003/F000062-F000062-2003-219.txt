 It is important to note that in making its initial request for fiscal year 2004, the administration acknowledged that it was a preliminary estimate based on less-than-complete information. Since the administration made its initial budget request last January, it has become evident that ORR will need more funds in order to fulfill its unaccompanied alien child responsibilities.  In talking with experts who work with these children as well as with administration officials, it has become evident that this important program will need at least $20 million in additional funding to order to operate effectively in fiscal year 2004.  As the Senate knows, I was prepared to offer an amendment to this bill that would appropriate the additional $20 million for these programs, bringing the total appropriation for unaccompanied alien children for fiscal year 2004 to $54,227,000. This anticipated that the additional $20 million being appropriated for these functions would be derived from unused refugee and entrant funds from prior fiscal years. These funds have gone unused because of the unfortunate shortfalls that have occurred in refugee admissions during the last several fiscal years.  In the interest of time and in deference to the delicate balance that the committee was forced to achieve in putting together this bill, I will not offer this amendment at this time. However, I ask the chairman for some assurance that he will work with House conferees to secure a minimum of $54.227 million for these functions in conference.
