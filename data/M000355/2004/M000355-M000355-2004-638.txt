 I think retaliation would be the order of the day. I will give you an example in my State. The Japanese corporation Toyota chose to outsource from Japan to the United States over 8,000 jobs to Georgetown, KY, to build the Toyota Camry. Eight thousand Kentuckians are employed at that particular site as a result of the outsourcing from Japan of those jobs into my State. They are high-paying jobs. We are extremely pleased they are there, and we would not want to do anything to jeopardize the existence of Toyota or the 50 or 60 supplier plants that have come into my State as a result of the Toyota company being there to send parts to the Toyota plant. Under their ``just in time'' supplier strategy, they send parts up there every day to be installed in those cars, employing a dramatic number of Kentuckians in addition to the 8,000 who are there at that site.  So the Senator from New Hampshire is exactly on point. I thank him for his contribution.
