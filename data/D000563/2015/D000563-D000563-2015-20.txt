 Daniel went to work this morning--just as he has done every day for the past 15 years--ready to fight fires and risk his life to save the lives of others. Not many people can say they wake up each day ready to make that sacrifice, but this morning, Daniel Capuano did just that.  At 2:40 a.m. today, Daniel Capuano and his fellow firefighters were contacted about a warehouse fire in the 9200 block of South Baltimore Avenue on the South Side of Chicago. Daniel and the other firefighters were immediately dispatched to the scene. The warehouse was undergoing construction, and because of that, there were reports of holes in the floors. When they got there, they saw billowing smoke coming out of the vacant three-story warehouse. Firefighter Capuano and his team moved cautiously through the second floor of the warehouse in search of the cause of the fire, but the heavy, thick smoke made it nearly impossible to see, causing Capuano to fall through an elevator shaft from the second floor of the building to the basement. His fellow firefighters were able to find him quickly and get him on an ambulance and to a nearby hospital. Sadly, it was too late. By the time he arrived at the hospital, he was already in serious condition. At 4:25 a.m. this morning, Daniel Capuano was pronounced dead from trauma.  It is times like these when we are reminded of just how dangerous the job these men and women face every day really is. Daniel Capuano spent his entire career putting the safety of his community before his own. For 15 years he served the Chicago Fire Department fighting and eliminating fires while pulling others to safety. Before that, he was a firefighter in Evergreen Park, a Chicago suburb.  Daniel Capuano is a true hero who made the ultimate sacrifice to make the residents of his community and neighborhood safe. Daniel's death is a devastating loss and serves as a reminder of the risk our firefighters andother first responders take every day. My condolences and prayers are with his wife Julie; his three children, Nicholas, Andrew, and Amanda; and his fellow firefighters.  Daniel, you are a hero to me and to the people of Chicago and Illinois. There are no words to truly describe the sorrow for your loss. I cannot, nor can anyone, thank you for the commitment you made for the safety of the people in your community.                          ____________________
