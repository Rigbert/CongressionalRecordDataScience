Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I ask the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] and I would ask the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] if they would answer this: Under the Agency for International Development's policy, during the 1980's and early 1990's, before Mr. Clinton, there was a clear definition as to what abortion is, a method of family planning. It was abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother.  Now to legislate ambiguity and vagueness and just toss it all over to the White House and say, ``You decide,'' I asked AID how they would define the Gilman amendment. They do not have a clue. They said, ``Look at what goes on on the House floor.'' I would hope during the course of this debate that my friends on the other side will say yes, there is health abortions, gender-selection abortions, so-called sex-selection abortions. What are we talking about?
