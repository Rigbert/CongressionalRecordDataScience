 Had I been present for rollcall 1034, H.R. 3222, on closing portions of the conference for a measure making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2008, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``yea.''  Had I been present for rollcall 1035, H.R. 513, on a motion to suspend the rules and pass, as amended the National Heroes Credit Protection Act, I would have voted ``yea.''  Had I been present for rollcall 1036, H. Res. 744, on a motion to suspend the rules and agree to a measure recognizing the contributions of Native American veterans and calling upon the President to issue a proclamation urging the people of the United States to observe a day in honor of Native American veterans, I would have voted ``yea.''                          ____________________
