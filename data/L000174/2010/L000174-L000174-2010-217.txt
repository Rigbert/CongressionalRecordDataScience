The distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee work very hard to control spending. As a member of that committee I know the votes I have cast to substantially cut spending. We need to eliminate programs that are wasteful or can no longer be justified. We need to be frugal about what new programs we fund.  But just as we are in a different world today than when I came to the Senate 35 years ago, the things we need to do to respond to the challenges of today are different than they were 35 years ago. The way we respond to those challenges is different than when the distinguished Appropriations chairman was gallantly fighting to protect our Nation in World War II--something which we all honor and the Nation has honored when he received the Congressional Medal of Honor. But he, like so many others, tried to make the world safe for democracy, but I think he also wanted to make it a world where America could achieve its goals through the strength of its ideas and not just through its military might.  This amendment is not going to make a dent in the Federal deficit by cutting $1.1 billion from the State and Foreign Operations budget. The amendment, however well intentioned, would permit a small minority of the Senate to dictate to the majority. It would limit the global influence of the United States. It would cede more of our influence to China. It would diminish our ability to develop and access export markets that are vital to our economy and vital to increasing jobs here in the United States. At worst of all, it would weaken our security alliances.  I urge Senators to reject it.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                             Secretary of Defense,                                                     Pentagon,                                     Washington, DC, Apr 21, 2010.     Hon. Kent Conrad,     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express my strong      support for full funding of the President's FY 2011 foreign      affairs budget request (the 150 account) which, along with      defense, is a critical component of an integrated and      effective national security program.       I understand this year presents a challenging budget      environment, with competing domestic and international      pressures. However, I strongly believe a robust civilian      foreign affairs capability, coupled with a strong defense      capability, is essential to preserving U.S. national security      interests around the world.       State and USAID partners are critical to success in      Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. Our military and civilian      missions are integrated, and we depend upon our civilian      counterparts to help stabilize and rebuild after the fight.      As U.S. forces transition out of war zones, the U.S.      government needs our civilian agencies to be able to assume      critical functions. This allows us, for example, to draw down      U.S. forces in Iraq responsibly while ensuring hard-fought      gains are secured. Cuts to the 150 account will almost      certainly impact our efforts in these critical frontline      states.       In other parts of the world, the work performed by      diplomatic and development professionals helps build the      foundation for more stable, democratic and prosperous      societies. These are places where the potential for conflict      can be minimized, if not completely avoided, by State and      USAID programs--thereby lowering the likely need for      deployment of U.S. military assets.       In formulating his request for FY 2011, the President      carefully considered funding needs for the budget accounts      for both foreign affairs and national defense, taking into      account overall national security requirements as well as      economic conditions. I believe that full funding of these two      budget accounts is necessary for our national security and      for ensuring our continued leadership in the world. I hope      you will take this into account when acting upon the      President's FY 2011 budget request.           Sincerely,     Robert M. Gates.                                  ____                                                   Chairman of the                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,                                     Washington, DC, May 21, 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: As the Congress moves to finalize      the budget for FY 2011, I want to offer my strong support for      fully funding the Department of Defense and related agencies.      I also want to reinforce the views expressed in Secretary      Gates' letter of April 21 and Secretary Clinton's letter of      April 20 (copies attached) to Senator Kent Conrad, requesting      full funding of the Department of State and USAID. We are      living in times that require an integrated national security      program with budgets that fund the full spectrum of national      security efforts, including vitally important pre-conflict      and post-conflict civilian stabilization programs.       Diplomatic programs are critical to our long-term security.      I have been on record many times since 2005 expressing my      views of the importance of fully funding our diplomatic      efforts. As Chief of Naval Operations, I said that I would      hand over part of my budget to the State Department, ``in a      heartbeat, assuming it was spent in the right place.''      Diplomatic efforts should always lead and shape our      international relationships, and I believe that our foreign      policy is still too dominated by our military. The diplomatic      and developmental capabilities of the United States have a      direct bearing on our ability to shape threats and reduce the      need for military action. It is my firm belief that      diplomatic programs as part of a coordinated strategy will      save money by reducing the likelihood of active military      conflict involving U.S. forces.       I am told that the Senate Budget Committee reduced the      international affairs budget by $4 billion, and I respect and      appreciate the tough choices the committee had to make. I      would ask that as you finalize the spending outlines for FY      2011, you underscore the importance of our civilian efforts      to the work of the Defense Department, and ultimately, to our      Nation's security. Because of the increasingly integrated      nature of our operations, a $4 billion decrement in State and      USAID budgets will have a negative impact on ongoing U.S.      military efforts, leading to higher costs through missed      diplomatic and developmental needs and opportunities. A      fully-integrated foreign policy requires a fully-resourced      approach. Our troops, Foreign Service officers and      development experts work side-by-side in unprecedented and      ever-increasing cooperation as they execute our strategic      programs. We need to continue to grow the important      capabilities that are unique to our non-military assets,      ensuring they have the resources to enhance our security and      advance our national interests, in both ongoing conflicts as      well as in preventative efforts.       As always, I appreciate your strong support of our men and      women in uniform, and appreciate your considering my      perspective as you finalize the FY 2011 budget.       The more significant the cuts, the longer military      operation will take and more and more lives are at risk.                                                      M. G. Mullen                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.
