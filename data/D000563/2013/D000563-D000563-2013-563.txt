I know she has a busy schedule, and I couldn't find her to ask her for her amendments to include on this list. I am going to go ahead and make the unanimous consent request, and I give her my word when she comes to the floor I will be happy to amend it to include two of her amendments, which offer I made to her earlier and I wish to make again.  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Enzi amendment be set aside and it be in order for the following amendments to be called up: the Collins-King amendment No. 771, the Pryor-Blunt amendment No. 740, and Hatch amendment No. 754; further, that no second-degree amendments be in order to any of these amendments prior to votes in relation to the amendments.  Unless someone has another suggestion, I am going to suggest we have 20 minutes of debate equally divided between opponents and proponents of each amendment.
