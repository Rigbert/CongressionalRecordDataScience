 President, I rise today to pay tribute to James Francis (Jimmy) Crawford, a tireless public servant, a prominent businessman, and a man whose deep religious convictions touched the lives of many. Jimmy Crawford was a lifelong resident of Abbeville, Alabama, and was serving his third consecutive term as mayor. His contributions to the city of Abbeville left an indelible mark in the memories of all who knew him. Jimmy passed away on Thursday morning, September 17, 1998 at the age of 58.  Throughout his life, Jimmy Crawford selflessly dedicated himself to the benefit of others and stood by his principles and ideals in an unwavering fashion. From his early youth, Jimmy demonstrated a considerable eagerness to help others. Growing up in Abbeville, Jimmy was active in the Boy Scouts of America, achieving the highest possible rank of Eagle Scout. After graduating from Abbeville High School in 1957, Jimmy attended school at Howard College, now Samford University. At Howard, Jimmy earned the distinction of being named in Who's Who Among American Colleges and Universities. These accomplishments served as a hint of the dedicated life which Jimmy would eventually lead.  Upon his return to Abbeville, Jimmy quickly became a respected and admired businessman in the community. His rental and finance firm provided the vehicle for Jimmy to help to organize and assist area businesses. He was the charter president of the Abbeville Jaycees, and was awarded the highest Jaycees honor by being named International Senator in 1975. Jimmy moved on to become the president of the Abbeville Chamber of Commerce in 1975 and 1976. During his tenure, the Chamber saw unprecedented growth and one of the largest memberships in the history of the organization. Jimmy was a member of the Abbeville Lions Club and a former member of the Abbeville Kiwanis Club. He also served for eight years on the Abbeville Recreation Board, two of those as chairman. No one would dispute the fact that he played a vital role in the development of these various organizations and the entire business community of Abbeville.  Jimmy also achieved notoriety with his impressive political achievements. He was first elected Mayor of Abbeville in 1988 and was currently serving in his third term. He was vice-president of the Board of Directors of the Southeast Alabama Regional Landfill Authority. He served dutifully on the Board of the Southeast Alabama Gas District for ten years, taking the position of chairman in 1995. He was active in the Alabama League of Municipalities as a member of the Executive Committee, and achieved the high honor of being a certified municipal official. Jimmy was extremely proud of his accomplishments as Mayor, most recently working with my office to secure important transportation and downtown revitalization grants.  Remarkably, Jimmy's business and political successes did not take away from his other devotions. Jimmy was a man with unwavering religious beliefs that led to a life of teaching the word of God. He was a charter member of the Calvary Baptist Church of Abbeville, where he served for 36 years. During this time, Jimmy served in a variety of capacities for the Church, including the post of chairman of the deacons for four terms, as well as Sunday School superintendent and teacher. Along with these responsibilities, Jimmy was the founding director of the Abbeville Christian Academy and served on its Board of Directors for many years. During his time involved with the Calvary Baptist Church and the Abbeville Christian Academy, Jimmy had the opportunity to help shape the lives of thechildren whom he taught and provided them with a firm groundwork in morality and Christianity which will help to guide them through life.  From his youth, Jimmy was also an avid sports fan. Having played football for Coach Bobby Bowden at Howard College, his competitive spirit never faltered. He was a former coach of the Abbeville Christian Academy Pee Wee Generals, and freely gave of his time to coach various teams in the Abbeville Recreation Department. He also was an avid Auburn University fan, from where his two daughters, Lil and Fran, graduated.  James Francis ``Jimmy'' Crawford will be remembered as a devoted husband and father. He will be missed by all who knew him, especially his wife Jo Smith Crawford; his daughters Lillian Ella Crawford, of Birmingham; and Martha Frances Crawford, of Abbeville; and other relatives and many friends whose lives he touched.  I will truly miss Jimmy. His many accomplishments touched the lives of every citizen of Abbeville and beyond. He should be remembered as a man with great vision and leadership. My heart is with his family during this difficult time.                          ____________________
