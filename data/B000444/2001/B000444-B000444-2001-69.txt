 I note the Senator from South Carolina said the distinguished Senator from Arizona doesn't have a port.  I am reminded when I first got here as a young Senator, I went to Senator Eastland, who I served under on the Judiciary Committee. Sitting in his office one day, as I often did, with Senator Thurmond, asking him anything a young kid, a 30-year-old Senator would ask, I asked: Who is the most powerful man you ever served with?  He said: Senator Kerr.  I said: Senator Kerr, Senator Kerr of Oklahoma?  He said: Yeah--in his southern drawl which I will not attempt to imitate on the floor as I often do off the floor.  He said: Who in the heck else could bring up the Gulf of Mexico in the middle of his State if he wasn't powerful?  I think, as the Senator's power continues to increase, he may bring the Pacific Ocean to Arizona, but I am not sure how he will do it.  Mr. McCAIN. The most entertaining man I ever knew was Morris Udall, who often was heard saying: We in Arizona eagerly await the next earthquake so Arizona would be a coastal State.  That is not as amusing as it was once, since there was one out there. But perhaps the Port of Yuma will still be a place the Senator from Delaware can help us with.  In case our colleagues are wondering what we are doing, we are hoping to resolve one remaining issue before final passage. Negotiations are going on as we speak so we would be able to move to final passage. We hope within minutes that we will have that issue resolved.
