Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4168. This bill is similar to previous passed legislation, H.R. 3008, which sailed through this body earlier this year with bipartisan support by a vote of 411 to 10. This legislation includes language negotiated in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to provide a National Academy of Sciences study on how to dispose of the helium reserve.  We bring this measure before the House again today because of the limited amount of time remaining in the 104th Congress. By passing this version of the bill, the Senate can act on the same measure and the bill can go directly to the President for signature.  This bill demonstrates our commitment to put an end to bloated Government programs by shutting down an inefficient facility which has outlived its need and can't compete with the private sector. I thank my colleague, Mr. Cox, for his tireless efforts to bring this important bill to the floor. I also want to thank my colleague on the Committee on Resources, Mac Thornberry, in whose district the helium reserve is located and whose constituents are affected by the loss of jobs at the facility. Mr. Thornberry worked diligently through the committee process to find the best solution for his constituents, offered privatization alternatives to the plan closure, and pushed for reconsideration of how to conduct the sale of the helium reserve.  Specifically this bill will:  Get the Federal Government out of the helium business, including sale of the stockpile, and shut down an inefficient helium refinery.  Ensure repayment of the helium debt.  And, protect our domestic helium industry from undue disruption by the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
