Speaker, this is a crucial issue of the privileges of Members in our representation of our districts, of our constituencies, and of the precedents of the House of Representatives on how we conduct business.  The House earlier this week voted unanimously to return to conference because the bill had been in dispute because of a contentious section regarding the privatization or contracting out of 69 air traffic control towers. The only way it seemed possible to resolve that issue was to return to conference. The House voted unanimously to return to conference, but no conference meeting was ever held. Earlier in the debate one would have gotten the impression that such a meeting was held. It was not held.  The Chair has ruled that an actual physical meeting of the conferees representing the various points of view on the bill in representing their constituents must be convened and they must have the opportunity to work through those issues.  In this case, there was no meeting of any conference. No Democratic Member, and, to the best of my knowledge, no Republican Member, was invited to a conference, there was no public notice of a conference, and no conference took place. Yet the bill was modified and returned to the floor of the House here.  So, Mr. Speaker, given the 200 years of precedent that an actual conference meeting must take place before you can have a conference report, I would respectfully make a point of order under clause 12 of rule XXII that there be at least one conference meeting. As I understand it, that same rule provides for a point of order in the House against the report and for an automatic request for a new conference if the House managers fail to meet in open session.  So I would ask that the Chair so rule, that this bill is out of order, and that we be mandated to return to actually have a physical meeting of a conference.
