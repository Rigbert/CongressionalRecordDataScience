 President, today I introduced S. 817, legislation designed to maintain rural communities' access to hospital care.  Today many rural Americans live in fear that they may lose access to local and regional hospital care. In these rural areas, where serious accidents, often related to farm equipment, are a constant threat. Access to an emergency care hospital within 35 miles can mean the difference between life and death. The ability to be referred to a major regional hospital for more specialized care can be of like importance. Congress must recognize the special needs of rural America and work to meet them. This bill is a step in the right direction.  The Rural Health Care Protection Act of 1997 focuses on providing support to Sole Community Hospitals and Rural Referral Centers. Sole Community Hospitals [SCH's] are hospitals located at least 35 miles from other hospitals and are often the sole source of emergency care or inpatient services in their areas. There are currently 728 SCH's in 46 States. There are 11 in my home State of Iowa. Rural Referral Centers [RRC's] are relatively large and specialized rural hospitals which receive referrals from community hospitals throughout a region. There are currently 142 RRC's in 39 states, including five in Iowa.  This legislation contains four proposals designed to help keep these care centers operating. First, the act would give SCH's the option of choosing an updated fiscal year 1994-95 base year for Medicare funding instead of the outdated base years which they must currently use. Second, the act would permanently grandfather as an RRC any hospital that has previously qualified as an RRC. Third, the act would exempt the RRC's from the statewide rural wage index threshold for geographic reclassification. Finally, the bill would allow rural hospitals that meet the reclassification criteria to be reclassified as urban hospitals for purposes of disproportionate share hospital [DSH] payment adjustments.  This bill would help ensure that rural Americans maintain access to these essential care centers. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of this measure.                          ____________________
