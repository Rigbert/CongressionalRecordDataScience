I do not want to take Members' time unduly. I simply want to make a couple of observations in closing on the debate.  I, again, want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen, as well as the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Dicks, the ranking member here, for their tireless work. As I said at the beginning, Mr. Frelinghuysen has been a leader on the Subcommittee on Energy and Water, and he has also been a tremendous partner. This process has been transparent, it has been open, and it has been thoughtful. As people who have followed the last 5 days understand, we have not agreed on every issue, but we have worked very closely together. I truly personally appreciate that, and as a public official and Member of this body, I appreciate that.  Also, again, because we all know, as members of the committee, who does the work to make this such an exceptional bill, I again want to personally thank the staff: Rob Blair, Joe Levin, Loraine Heckenberg, Angie Giancarlo, Perry Yates, Taunja Berquam, Nancy Fox, Katie Hazlett, and Joe DeVooght. Everyone has their expertise. We may have separate offices, but we have, I think, collectively worked very well together and fashioned a wonderful bill.
