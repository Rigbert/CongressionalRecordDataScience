Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Temecula, California are exceptional. Temecula has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. John Kelliher is one of such individual. On February 21, 2015, John will be honored at the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce Annual Awards Gala where he will receive the Citizen of the Year award.  Grapeline Wine Tours was founded and introduced in Temecula, California by John and his wife, Kim, in June of 2002. The company's reach now spans through Santa Barbara County and Paso Robles. Prior to their inception, Temecula did not offer many options regarding wine tour operators. Grapeline Wine Tours has now grown to become the largest wine tour operator in Southern and Central California, shuttling over 20,000 visitors through the beautiful vineyards of Temecula. John's Grapeline venture has become so successful, the business has announced their upcoming expansion to Northern California, encompassing wine regions in Sonoma.  Over the past ten years, Temecula has now become even more of a destination for travel and tourism as over hundreds of thousands come to visit the region. Much of this can be accredited to promising businesses such as Grapeline Wine Tours that encourage fun-filled experiences in Southwest County.  In the course of Grapeline Wine Tour's progression, John has won a variety of awards and accolades for its success. The business and its founders have won awards including the 2005 Sterling Business of the Year from the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce and the Hospitality Award and Tourism Professional of the Year Award from the Temecula Valley Convention & Visitors Bureau in 2013. With unmatched depth and experience, Grapeline Wine Tours is sure to be successful in their future endeavors throughout California.  John Kelliher's tireless passion for the Southwest County has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Temecula, California. I am proud to call John a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year Award.                          ____________________
