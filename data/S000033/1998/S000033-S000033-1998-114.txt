 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 629, the Texas-Maine-Vermont Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact.  The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments make commercial low-level radioactive waste disposal a State, not a Federal responsibility. Since that time, 41 States from every region of the country have come together to form compacts.  Essentially, all we are asking today is that our three States be given the same consideration that every other State which went before us received in this process.  In every instance, Congress has understood the benefits of these compacts and has recognized the rights of the different States to come together in their own best interests to form these compacts. In fact, each of these waste compacts passed by voice vote and without amendment.  This compact has been overwhelmingly approved by the legislatures of Texas, Maine, and Vermont. It has the very strong support of the governors of the three States. It has the support of all the Senators from Texas, Vermont, and Maine, all of the House Members from Vermont and Maine, and as I understand it, about two-thirds of the members of the Texas congressional delegation.  We hear a great deal of discussion in this body about devolution, returning powers to the States. If we believe in that concept and believe that States should have the right to come together in their own best interests to address this very difficult issue, then today's vote should be an easy one. This legislation won by a vote of 309 to 107 last year and should be strongly supported today.
