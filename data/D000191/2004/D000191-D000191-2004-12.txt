  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is business as usual after the election here in Washington. Right now they are writing a bill to finance the entire Federal Government, hundreds of billions of dollars, behind closed doors. It will be brought up with one vote, no amendments allowed, up or down. Why not? Maybe because we are borrowing $1 million a minute to run the Federal Government, $1 million a minute.  Yesterday the Pension Benefit Guarantee Fund announced that its deficit has doubled to $24 billion. They are broke. They cannot guarantee pensions. Social Security will collect $163 billion more than it needs, but every penny will be borrowed and spent this year for current consumption. We hit the federal debt limit for the third time in 3 years, but the Federal Government is not in default because they are borrowing from Federal employees' pension savings.  Is this not great? Nothing wrong with this picture. We do not need to change. The majority has a plan: more spending, more borrowing, more tax cuts, more dynamic scoring, which means we pretend none of this exists, and we pass the bill to our kids and grandkids.                          ____________________
