We made a special policy in the Committee on Appropriations we were not going to allow any demonstration programs in the bill. You must feel you really have a lot of pull over there at the Committee on Rules because, in fact, your proposal here is totally out of step with every other Member of this institution but for one other.  I find it quite interesting. Let me ask you, in the demonstration program that you are proposing be included in this appropriation bill, is your program authorized? You mentioned the gentleman from New York [Mr. Lazio] wants to do it later in the year. Is your program authorized that you are asking for?
