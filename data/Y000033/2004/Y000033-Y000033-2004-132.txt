Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Although it is well merited, the Federal Public Transportation program does not provide programs for airport-based services. In addition, we understand that this amendment, according to our figures, adds $300 million to the cost of the bill, and that concerns me a great deal.  And, lastly, may I suggest respectfully, as important as natural gas is, we have some real problems getting natural gas to the United States, and we had better start looking at that problem very quickly; and under the energy bill we can do that. We have not passed the energy bill, but it is crucially important for this Nation to have a new supply of natural gas.
