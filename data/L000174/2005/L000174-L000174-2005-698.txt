President, this day has been a long time in coming, and I am pleased to join the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, and others in sponsoring bipartisan legislation to address the serious problem of asbestos-related disease. It is the product of years of difficult and conscientious craftsmanship and negotiation. Building on the Committee's work under Chairman Hatch, we have striven to bring a fair and efficient plan to the Congress, a plan that will ensure adequate compensation to the thousands of victims of asbestos exposure, but that also will give due consideration to the industries and the insurers that should, and will, provide that compensation. Our bipartisan legislation does that. Asbestos exposure has created a maze of arduous problems, and we have worked hard to produce a balanced bill that offers fair solutions.  Senator Specter, with whom I have worked so hard on this legislation, rightly calls this one of the most complex issues we have ever tackled. It is not the bill that I would have written, were I alone responsible for its drafting, nor is it the bill that Senator Specter might have produced. Nor should anyone be surprised to hear that the interested groups--the labor organizations, the industrial participants in the trust fund, their insurers, the trial bar--are each less than pleased with some portion of the bill or another. That is the essence of legislative compromise: We have kept the ultimate goal of fair compensation to victims as the lodestar of our efforts, and we have all had to make sacrifices on a variety of subsidiary issues as we worked together to resolve this emergency. What we have achieved is important and a significant step toward a better, more efficient method to compensate asbestos victims.  Asbestos is among the most lethal substances ever to be widely used in the workplace. Between 1940 and 1980, more than 27.5 million workers were exposed to asbestos on the job, and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure over long periods of time. We even know of family members who have suffered asbestos-related disease from washing the clothes of loved ones. The ravages of disease caused by asbestos have affected tens of thousands of American families. We need better health screening and swifter compensation for those affected. In light of the devastating damage it has wreaked, it is hard to believe that asbestos is still being used today, yet it is. This bill will change that as well, protect against yet another generation of victims.  The economic harm caused by asbestos is also real, and the bankruptcies that have resulted are a different kind of tragedy for everyone--for workers and retirees, for shareholders, and for the families that built these companies. In my home State of Vermont, the Rutland Fire and Clay Company is among the more than 70 companies to have declared bankruptcy.  As Chief Justice Rehnquist noted several years ago, ``the elephantine mass of asbestos cases cries out for a legislative solution.'' Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., 527 U.S. 815, 865 1999). In another Supreme Court opinion, Justice Ginsburg declared that ``a nationwide administrative claims processing regime would provide the most secure, fair, and efficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure.'' Amchem Products v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 628-29, 1997). I agree, the Chairman agrees, Senator Feinstein agrees, and we hope that many others in the Senate will agree.  Weare encouraged by the favorable reception that this bill has already generated from a wide array of interested parties. In the past week, I have received letters of support from the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, VFW, the Asbestos Study Group, and others. The UAW notes in its April 13th letter, ``[The Specter-Leahy Proposal] will provide more equitable, timely and certain compensation to the victims of asbestos-related disease.'' The VFW letter of April 14 declares: ``The national trust fund that you are proposing offers our members who are sick and dying the opportunity to secure timely and fair compensation for the injury they suffered in the course of serving their country.'' The National Association of Manufacturers also released a statement expressing their hope that this legislation will engender broad support.  These statements in many ways tell the story of what we have already accomplished: We have drafted a bill that has garnered a favorable response from labor, manufacturers, and companies with considerable asbestos liabilities. We have worked on this legislation for several years now, and I can assure you that garnering this level of consensus has been no small feat. I ask unanimous consent that the text of these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                          UAW,                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 2005.       Dear Senator: Senators Specter and Leahy recently put      forward a compromise asbestos compensation proposal, and have      indicated that they intend to introduce legislation      incorporating this proposal early next week. The UAW supports      the Specter-Leahy asbestos compensation proposal because we      believe it will provide more equitable, timely and certain      compensation to the victims of asbestos-related diseases.       There is widespread agreement that the current tort system      fails miserably in compensating asbestos victims. There are      often years of delay before victims receive any compensation.      Awards to victims are highly unpredictable, with similarly      situated individuals receiving vastly different amounts. Too      often compensation goes disproportionately to the less sick      at the expense of the most seriously ill victims. The      transaction costs, including lawyers' fees, are very high and      reduce the amounts received by victims. And even when victims      are awarded substantial compensation by the courts, these      judgments are often not collectable because the     defendant companies have filed for bankruptcy, leaving the      victims with little effective recourse.       The Specter-Leahy proposal would address these serious      problems by replacing the current tort system with a national      asbestos trust fund to compensate the victims of asbestos-     related diseases. By creating a no-fault administrative      system for process claims, this approach would provide      victims with speedier compensation, while reducing the      substantial lawyers' fees and other transaction costs in the      current adversarial litigation system. By compensating      victims pursuant to a fixed schedule of payments for      specified disease levels, this approach would also provide      predictable awards to individuals with similar illnesses, and      ensure that the most compensation goes to the most seriously      ill victims. Perhaps most importantly, by providing      compensation through a national asbestos trust fund, this      approach would ensure that victims will receive the full      amount of their award regardless of whether a particular      company had filed for bankruptcy.       The UAW is especially pleased that the Specter-Leahy      proposal does not permit any subrogation against worker      compensation or health care payments received by asbestos      victims. This will ensure that awards are not largely offset      by worker compensation or health care payments to which      victims are otherwise entitled. In our judgment, the      provisions barring any subrogation are essential to ensuring      that victims receive adequate compensation.       The UAW also is pleased that the Specter-Leahy proposal      establishes a mechanism for defendant companies and insurers      to contribute to the national asbestos compensation fund,      thereby spreading the costs of compensating victims across a      broad section of the business and insurance community. We      believe this broad-based, predictable financing mechanism is      vastly preferable to the current tort system, which has      driven most asbestos manufacturers into bankruptcy and is      threatening the economic viability of many other companies      that used products containing asbestos, thereby jeopardizing      the jobs of tens of thousands of workers.       The Specter-Leahy proposal provides for reversion of      asbestos claims to the tort system in the event the national      asbestos trust fund does not have sufficient funds to pay all      claims, or in the event the compensation system does not      become operational quickly enough. Although the UAW hopes      that these reversion provisions will never be triggered, we      believe these provisions are essential to ensure that victims      will always have some effective recourse for receiving      compensation, and to give all stakeholders an incentive to      help make the compensation system operate properly.       The UAW recognizes that the Specter-Leahy proposal      represents a compromise that reflects countless hours of      negotiations with the key stakeholders in this issue. We      commend Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for their      leadership and persistence in moving forward with efforts to      fashion this compromise. We also understand that some issues      are still under discussion as the Specter-Leahy proposal is      translated into legislative language that will be introduced      next week. We look forward to reviewing the final details of      the legislation when it is available.       It is easy for critics who want to maintain the current      tort system to point to flaws or shortcomings in the Specter-     Leahy proposal. But the issue before the Senate is not      whether this proposal is perfect or solves all problems.      Rather, the issue is whether the Specter-Leahy proposal is      better than the current tort system. The UAW believes that      the answer to this question is clearly yes. In our judgment,      the Specter-Leahy proposal will provide the victims of      asbestos-related diseases with speedier, more equitable and      more certain compensation than the current tort system. For      this reason, we urge you to support the Specter-Leahy      proposal when it is considered by the Senate.       Thank you for considering our views on this important      issue.           Sincerely,                                                     Alan Reuther,     Legislative Director.                                  ____                                                   April 13, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Democratic Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: We are writing today to implore you not      to forget about our Nation's veterans as you continue your      important work of fixing the broken asbestos litigation      system. A lot has been written on this issue in the media      recently. Yesterday, Senator Arlen Specter said he expects to      formally introduce an asbestos victims compensation fund bill      later this week. Even before Specter's announcement, some had      raised questions about whether an asbestos victims      compensation fund is the best solution to the asbestos      crisis.       But the critics often overlook one crucial element: what is      best for asbestos victims?       Clearly, the most important outcome for victims, many of      whom are veterans dying as a result of asbestos exposure, is      a system that provides timely, fair and certain compensation.       We believe the compensation fund approach is the only      solution that will provide veterans suffering from asbestos-     related illnesses with fair and certain compensation.       Asbestos has taken a heavy toll on our Nation's veterans.      This dangerous substance was widely used by the military      during and after World War II, particularly in insulation      aboard U.S. Navy ships. Because of the long latency periods      of asbestos-related diseases, many veterans are still being      diagnosed today with life-threatening diseases that are the      result of exposure that occurred during military service      decades ago.       Veterans are in a unique situation in that we have      virtually no avenue for compensation under the current      system. Veterans with asbestos-related illnesses are      prevented by law from seeking compensation from the U.S.      government through the courts. Since most of the companies      that supplied the U.S. military with asbestos are long gone,      seeking relief from the suppliers is also a dead end.       Some have suggested that a medical criteria bill might      provide a better solution to the asbestos problem. A medical      criteria bill, however, will do little, if anything, to      provide certainty for victims. And because it leaves asbestos      claims in the courts, the medical criteria bill certainly      wouldn't benefit veterans who are sick from asbestos. Under a      medical criteria bill, the asbestos litigation system will      remain unchanged for veterans.       The Senate Judiciary Committee shouldn't let special      interests hijack veterans' only chance to receive the just      compensation they deserve.       We urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to approve the      asbestos victims compensation fund as quickly as possible and      bring this critically important legislation to the floor. Our      Nation's veterans deserve fair compensation--and nothing      less.           Sincerely,         Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States         Military Order of the Purple Heart         Blinded Veterans Association         Veterans of the Vietnam War, Inc.

Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter: The Asbestos Study Group, a group of      U.S. companies representing over 1.5 million workers, is      greatly appreciative of the Chairman's tireless efforts in      working with all interested Senators and private stakeholders      to reach a bipartisan consensus that can bring a much needed      solution to the Nation's asbestos litigation crisis. We are      very pleased and encouraged that the revised April 12th draft      has earned bipartisan support. We believe it brings us      considerably closer to a long-overdue resolution. While our      analysis of the new draft is continuing, we look forward to      working with the Chairman and other Senators to obtain final      passage of this critically important legislation as soon as      possible.       In the last two decades Congress has debated asbestos      litigation reform, the opportunity now before us represents      our best chance for success. Too much progress has been made      and too much is at stake for our Nation to miss this unique      opportunity to finally solve the asbestos problem.       Thank you for your continuing leadership and commitment to      this critically important issue.           Sincerely,                                               Barry B. Direnfeld,     Counsel, Asbestos Study Group.                                  ____    [From the National Association of Manufacturers, April 14, 2005]  Engler Statement on Senator Specter's Latest Asbestos Bill Language                                  Draft       Washington, D.C.--National Association of Manufacturers      President John Engler today issued this statement in support      of Senator Arlen Specter's (R-PA) ongoing effort to end      America's asbestos litigation crisis:       ``Manufacturers and the business community more broadly are      grateful to Chairman Specter for the energy and determination      he has shown in working to craft a legislative solution to      our Nation's economy-sapping problem with asbestos      litigation.       ``The comprehensive Specter draft is now being reviewed by      the NAM and the members of the Asbestos Alliance. Since the      draft has already earned bipartisan support in the Senate, we      are hopeful it will engender similarly broad support in the      nationwide business community. When our review and those of      our Asbestos Alliance colleagues are complete, we hope a      solution will finally be at hand.       ``There is much to like in the Chairman's draft, I'm      encouraged by the renewed commitment on both sides of the      aisle, and I am more hopeful about prospects for consensus      than I have been in weeks.       ``We look forward to working with Chairman Specter and      other Senators toward final     passage of a bill that fairly resolves compensation problems      and ends the scandal of asbestos lawsuit abuse once and for      all.''
