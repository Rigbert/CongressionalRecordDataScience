The problem was, as I see it--and I am asking the distinguished Senator whom I have known for a long time and whom I respect--what would he think about the response--this is the question--where we have only had seven amendments that have been allowed on this bill? I have one on the Medicare advisory board. We have the one on CER here--rationing--and I had another one in regard to a tax matter--about four amendments--all of which have been considered in the Finance Committee.  All were defeated by a party-line vote, so I knew where it was headed, but I thought it certainly deserved some debate and some consideration on the Senate floor. To all of a sudden limit a bill of this size--the health care bill, not the Defense bill--to seven amendments seems to be very untoward and showing a lack of comity in regard to a bill of this size.
