 This publication comes out on a daily basis to tell us which nominations have been sent to the floor of the Senate by the committees. They do not reach the floor of the Senate until a process is followed which involves nomination by the President of the United States, an investigation of the nominee by agencies of the government and by our committees, and then consideration of those nominees.  Many committees have hearings where the nominees are called before them. Questions can be asked. They certainly are in the Judiciary Committee where I serve. Then, at the end of the day the committee decides whether to submit this nominee's name for the consideration of the full Senate.  So the fact that Senator Harkin came to the floor this evening is an indication of the frustration many of us feel about what has happened.  So far since President Obama took office last year, the Senate has had rollcall votes on 51 nominations. There are others who have been approved without rollcalls. But of those 51 nominations which were subjected to rollcall votes, 22 were confirmed with more than 90 votes and 18 were confirmed with 70 votes or more. That means that almost 80 percent of those nominees have passed with overwhelming support.  Many of those votes took place after lengthy delays. In other words, these men and women who agreed to serve our Nation and to serve the President and made personal sacrifices to do that went through the long and arduous process, made it to the Senate calendar, and then had to wait. On average, the President's nominees have languished on this Senate calendar for over 105 days, with many taking much longer; more than 3 months for those who were sent to the Senate floor. I know because some of these nominees are people I have met and worked with, even people I have recommended to the President. It is an uneasy feeling to be nominated, to be waiting for your opportunity to serve in positions large and small, and then to be told, day after weary day, that the Senate just did not get around to it.  This week the Executive Calendar contains more than 107 names of nominees. More than 85 percent of those nominees came through the committee process with overwhelming support. Point of comparison for those who will say: The Republicans may be playing games now with nominations, but I am sure you Democrats did the same thing to President Bush.  Not true. At this time in President George W. Bush's Presidency, there were exactly 13 nominees on the calendar. There are over 107 nominees on the calendar at this moment. There is no comparison.  It is time for the Republicans to stop abusing the Senate's responsibility to provide advice and consent on the President's well-qualified nominees. If I take a look at some of these nominees, it is troubling because they are overwhelmingly qualified for the jobs for which they have been recommended.  The Illinois nominees currently on the calendar include Craig Becker to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board. He was recess-appointed after waiting for 16 weeks on the calendar. Mary Smith to be Assistant Attorney General, she has been on the calendar for more than 16 weeks. Gary Scott Feinerman, to be U.S. district judge for the Northern District of Illinois, has been waiting 6 weeks. He is a man eminently qualified who was passed out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. Sharon Johnson Coleman, another nominee from Illinois to be U.S. district judge, again approved by voice vote unanimously, has been sitting on the calendar for 6 weeks. Robert Wedgeworth to be a member of the National Museum and Library Services Board, has been waiting for 4 weeks; Carla D. Hayden, to be a member of the National Museum and Library Services Board, another 4 weeks; and Darryl McPherson, who we would like to have serve as a U.S. marshal in the Northern District of Illinois. He was just sent to the calendar. This is an indication. In the Northern District of Illinois, several years ago, we had the tragic murder of the family of a U.S. district court judge. So when we talk about filling the position of U.S. marshal in that particular district, it is because we know that there is a vulnerability for the men and women serving the government as judges, a vulnerability which resulted in a tragedy for one of our more celebrated and liked Federal judges in Chicago.  Why would we hold up this man's nomination? Wouldn't we want the U.S. marshal in place doing his job? It is an important responsibility administratively, but it is equally important to protect the men and women in the judiciary. Why would we want to delay that when we have been through the tragic murder of a family in the Northern District of Illinois?  That is why I wanted to join Senator Harkin. We are leaving now for a little over a week over Memorial Day. Many of us will be back home for Memorial Day, then moving around in different places. This calendar will sit here for another 10 or 12 days. The men and women whose names are in nomination will wait another 12 days or 2 weeks before they can be considered. In the meantime, their lives are on hold. Their service to our country is delayed. The President's ability to put his team together has been diminished by this strategy from the Republican side.  Tonight Senator Harkin tried to move 51 of these nominees. Senator McConnell objected. It is unfortunate, truly unfortunate, that we don't step forward and give these men and women a chance to serve the government and give the President a chance to have those in place who will make his administration complete. That is the only fair thing for us to do.  I hope when we return we will come to our senses and take a different strategy. More than 107 men and women whose names are on this calendar are waiting for us to make that decision. In fairness to the President and to the Nation, I hope we make it with dispatch.                          ____________________
