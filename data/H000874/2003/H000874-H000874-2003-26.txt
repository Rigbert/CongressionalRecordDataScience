That is a $4 billion item possible cost to this country.  My understanding is the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) has a bill. As the gentleman knows, there is an alternative available which, I think, frankly enjoys bipartisan support, at least the letters that are being sent around to colleagues would indicate that. In light of the fact that we want to pass legislation, Mr. Leader, can you assure us that the Crane-Rangel-Manzullo alternative would be allowed as a substitute to that piece of legislation to assure that we could, in fact, pass something?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I would anticipate that we would follow regular order and the traditions of the House. And a bill that comes from the Committee on Ways and Means is always tightly held in a rule. I cannot anticipate what the Committee on Rules may write at this particular time, but it has been our tradition in this House that at least one substitute or a motion to recommit, or both, have been allowed on bills that come from the Committee on Ways and Means.
