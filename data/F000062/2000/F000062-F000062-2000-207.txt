 President, I rise today to recognize the great service that Jewish Family and Children's Services has provided the people of San Francisco and the Bay Area for 150 years.  Since its founding in 1850, Jewish Family and Children's Services has been dedicated to alleviating suffering and helping people realize their potential. It has grown into one of the region's largest social service organizations, with more than 2,100 volunteers helping more than 40,000 people a year.  Jewish Family and Children's Services provides a wide range of services from adoption services and child mentoring programs, to programs aimed at helping seniors. They also have many programs designed to help people with special needs such as AIDS counseling and care management, and alcohol and substance abuse programs.  Over the past 150 years, Jewish Family and Children's Services has improved the quality of life for thousands of people. Please join me in honoring this outstanding organization.                          ____________________
