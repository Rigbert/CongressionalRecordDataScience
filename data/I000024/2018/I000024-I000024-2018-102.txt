President, reserving the right to object, first of all, I agree with Senator Paul's amendment and have agreed with his amendment, and I have made it very clear for a long period of time. Procedurally, I want to get to it, and it is my intention to have a vote on it. That will have to come after we are on the bill. We need to get on the bill first.  So I do object.
