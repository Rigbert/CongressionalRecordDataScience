 I thank the Senator from Minnesota, knowing he was about to give me time, which is his nature. I appreciate that.  Mr. President, my mom had an expression. Occasionally, when I was a kid, I think she had a good idea and was well intentioned. She would say, ``Joey, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.''  I have no doubt about the intentions of my friend from Minnesota. I know he knows that as the author of the drug czar legislation for the past, I guess it is about 14 years, I have issued every year a drug report or an alternate drug report laying out a drug strategy for the United States, usually as a counterbalance on the Republican administration and criticism or one of agreement with the administration.  This debate reminds me a little bit of the position in which Democrats have always been put. The Democrats get put in a position where we are told there is a dollar left and it can be distributed among the hearing impaired, the sight impaired, and those children needing emergency medical care. So we have to choose. We have the blind fighting the disabled fighting the hearing impaired. Instead of saying we can choose between building a highway and taking care of all the needs of those in desperate need, or we cannot build a submarine, or an air base, whatever, we are debating about whether or not we can walk and chew gum at the same time.  There is no disagreement. I have, as well as my colleagues, pushed--pushed in the early days when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee--for major increases in treatment. I have issued a total of seven major reports on treatment, its value, its efficacy, and why we should be doing more.  I take a backseat to no one in arguing that we do not give enough treatment here in this drug war.  I point out that the President's budget, unrelated to the Colombian aid package, has $6 billion in it for drug treatment and drug prevention. That total includes $300 million in funding increases in this area. We don't have to take away from the money that, in fact, would have a significant impact on the reduction of product here. That is the bad news.  The good news is that, as we have debated the Andean drug policy for the past 12 years, we used to have to deal with the idea that Colombia was a transiting country as well as a country that turned raw product into the materials sold, and the laboratory work and product used to be produced in Bolivia and Peru.  The good news is, because of eradication programs, because of U.N. leadership, I might add in this area, essentially there has been an elimination of the crop in those two countries.  The bad news is that it has all moved into Colombia. They now are a full-service operation. The product is there, the narcotraffickers are there, the laboratory laboratories are there, and the transiting is there. That is the bad news.  The good news is it is all in one spot for us to be able to hit it. It is all in one spot for us to have a very efficacious use of this money.  I spent days in Colombia. I spent 2 days, 24 hours a day, with the President of Colombia. I ended up actually going with him on his Easter vacation by accident to his summer residence. This is a guy, as my friend from Illinois points out, that is the real deal.  For the first time, we have a President who understands that his democracy is at stake. He is willing to risk his life--not figuratively, literally. I went to dinner with he and his children. He has seven bodyguards around his children because of the death threats. This is a guy who is risking his life. He is willing to do it because he understands what is at stake for his country, unlike previous Presidents.  The next point is, we are making this distinction between police and military. With all due respect to my friend from Minnesota, historically the thugs in South America have been the police. Police are not like police here. There is a national police; we have no national police. The Federales in Mexico were police, not army. Often the police in South America are the biggest abusers of human rights.  What did we do? We gave the Colombian National Police aid, $750 million in aid. What did we say? Purge this police department, purge the national police, and they did. And guess what. If I stood on this floor 5 years ago and said the Colombian police are going to crack the Medellin and Cali Cartel, no one would have said that is possible. No one.  Guess what. They cracked the Medellin Cartel. They cracked the Cali Cartel. They put them in jail. They are extraditing the police. Why? Because we trained their police; they purged 4,000 of them.  Where are we on military? I met here with every major human rights group from Colombia, including the bishops who came up. When we push them to the wall and say to them: By the way, you want us out?  No, no, no, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't do that. You have to stay in. You have to be involved. We don't like the balance the way you have it here.  I say: Fine. No problem.  Tell me, bishop, you want us in or you want us out?  Stay. Stay.  Now, civil war. There is no civil war. We are so caught up in the old logic ofhow we deal with things. There is no civil war. Less than 5 percent of the people of Colombia support the guerrillas. Every other guerrilla movement, every other civil war, you go into the village to recruit people. They go in, as my friend Illinois said, to shoot people. There is no popular sentiment at all. This is not a civil war.  With regard to the paramilitaries, I called President Pastrana a few weeks ago. I said, a lot of the criticism of the plan is you have to be sure that you are only focusing on the FARC and the ELN and only focusing on the guerrillas. What about the paramilitaries? I said, I want a letter guaranteeing that you will, in fact, move on the paramilitary simultaneously. You must change.  He changed it. Here is the letter. I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Santefe de Bogota, May 8, 2000.     Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S.          Senate.       Dear Joe: Thank you again for your visit to Colombia and      your support of my country. I greatly enjoyed our discussions      and valued your insights.       I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate, as I      did personally during your visit here, the commitment of my      government to attack drug trafficking and cultivation in all      parts of the country and not only in the south, no matter      what individual or organization may be promoting them.       This policy has been in effect since the beginning of my      administration, generating very important results. In 1999,      51,415 hectares of coca and poppy were sprayed, 31 tons of      coca and 691 kilos of heroin were seized, and 166 labs and 44      airfields were destroyed. Just this past weekend, in an      extraordinarily successful operation in Norte de Santander on      the border with Venezuela, we were able to destroy 44      laboratories and capture 20 persons, in an area linked to      illegal auto-defense organizations, but where guerrilla      groups and organized drug traffickers also operate.       Plan Colombia is an integral plan for peace designed, among      other goals, to eradicate drug cultivation and to address the      social problems created by the violence associated with drug      trafficking in all the producing regions with an emphasis on      the areas where there is the greatest cultivation and/or a      marked increase in cultivation in the recent past--areas      close to the Ecuadorian border in the south and to the      Venezuelan border in the north. Our priorities and the      sequence of eradication will depend on the resources      available to us, but you are correct in stating the principle      that we want to demonstrate that no trafficking organization      is immune.       Indeed, as you may know the initial effort of the plan      marks combined police, military, civilian operations in the      Department of Putumayo in the south where not only FARC but      also auto-defense organizations are present. In that regard,      the coordinated effort at drug eradication alternative      development, support for the internally displaced, human      rights protection, democratic governance, judicial reform and      promotion of the rule of law will work to diminish drug-     trafficking and violence in this fragile amazon region. We      enjoyed your visit and hope to have you again as our guest.      Your interest and that of your government in my nation's      future strengthens our commitment and gives us crucial      international support.           Sincerely,                                           Andres Pastrana Arango,                                            President of Colombia.
