 President, earlier this month we began and finished the second floor debate on the tax relief reconciliation bill. At that time, I spoke in recognition of Groundhog Day because it was just around the corner. I have next to me that portrait of Punxsutawney Phil. Phil is the groundhog.  In thinking of Phil and his unique form of weather reporting, I thought about that popular film entitled ``Groundhog Day'' starring Bill Murray in which a man relives the same day, Groundhog Day, over and over again. This film has taken on even greater significance for me as I seem to be in a similar situation for the third time. More than just the sense of deja vu, I feel as though I am reliving a couple of past experiences, and before these several votes tonight or tomorrow, I think everybody will agree with me.  I have before you another chart.
