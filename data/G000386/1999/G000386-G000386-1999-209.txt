 President, before the Senator from Vermont leaves the floor, I want to thank him for his comments. He has expressed very well some statements about parts of the bill on which he has questions. I want to assure him, most of those--in fact, the way the Senate works, probably all of those--will have to be addressed in some way through the various amendments which are likely to be adopted. We do have a very close working relationship, even at this point, on some of those things with people on the Senator's side of the aisle. We will try to do that.  If I could also make the Senator from Vermont aware of a study he referenced, the study done by the American Bankruptcy Institute on the utility of chapter 7 debtors to repay their debts--the Senator may not know this, but we have had the General Accounting Office look at this study; in fact, all the studies on this question. The General Accounting Office has concluded that this specific study by the American Bankruptcy Institute was flawed. In fact, it understated the repayment ability in a very significant way.  I do not expect the Senator to accept that right now, just because I have said it. I hope he will be able to take a look at that and see if there are any remaining questions that he might have which we could address, and if we can't do that and the Senator might be considering some amendments that are a direct result of the American Bankruptcy Institute study, that we would have an opportunity to talk about it before he might move in that direction.  Overall, his statement is very accurate, stating some disagreements, some questions he has. Hopefully, we will be able to address those questions.
