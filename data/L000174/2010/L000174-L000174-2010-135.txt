President, I take this opportunity to call the Senate's attention to the imminent opening of the new President Calvin Coolidge Museum and Education Center, a wonderful year-round tribute to President Coolidge, located in the graceful and historic setting of the President's home town of Plymouth Notch, VT. The center's formal opening and dedication ceremony will take place next weekend, on August 7.  Calvin Coolidge, our 30th President, remains the only President born, sworn into office and buried in the State of Vermont. President Coolidge was originally elected to the Vice Presidency in 1920, winning that election alongside Warren G. Harding.  Three years into President Harding's first term, then-Vice President Coolidge received an unexpected messenger one evening while he was vacationing at his family's home in Plymouth Notch. The messenger informed him of President Harding's sudden and untimely death. It was at 2:47 the next morning that Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as President, in the parlor of his family home, alongside his wife Grace Coolidge, a capable and respected First Lady and a leading Vermonter in her own right. The oath of office was administered by President Coolidge's father, a State notary public official, by the light of a kerosene lamp. The new President left for Washington the next morning to assume the burdens of his new office.  President Coolidge was always known as a man of few words--the inspiration for his famous nickname, Silent Cal. Stoic in the New England tradition, President Coolidge also was an eloquent speaker who felt an obligation to communicate often with the American people to explain his policies.  Today, the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation is dedicated to preserving the Nation's memory of Calvin Coolidge. Founded in 1960, the foundation is now celebrating its 50th year. By working closely with the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, the Coolidge Foundation collects and preserves artifacts and resources related to the President. Many of the buildings within the village have become State-owned historical properties, and Plymouth Notch has been named the best-preserved Presidential site in the Nation. The development of the new museum and education center--solid and useful in the Yankee tradition--will expand the accessibility of these archives to the public, while providing a venue for students to learn about their country's history.  We Vermonters take pride in our history and heritage, and we feel the obligations of stewardship in these things. The Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation is faithfully tending to the preservation and dissemination of this part of Vermont's legacy and our country's history. It is my pleasure to congratulate the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation, in partnership with the State of Vermont, on the occasion of the commemoration and dedication of the President Calvin Coolidge Museum and Education Center.                          ____________________
