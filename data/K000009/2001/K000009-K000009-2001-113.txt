Chairman, I just want to thank the chairman for his support of our very able colleague from New York who has such a persevering record on attempting to get the American Heritage Rivers Initiative fully operational for the city of New York and for rivers immediately adjacent to and in his district, so that these local river conservation plans become more than plans, but, in fact, help us to preserve the precious fresh water resourcethat is ours alone in this quadrant of the United States.  I would have to just say as the ranking member on the subcommittee, no Member has fought harder for this program than the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), and the people of New York have sent the right man here to represent them.
