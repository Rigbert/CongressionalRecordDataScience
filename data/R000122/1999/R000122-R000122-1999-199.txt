President, today we celebrate the 178th Anniversary of the revolution that won Greece's independence from the Ottoman Empire. I am proud to join with forty-nine of my colleagues in sponsoring Senate Resolution 20 which designates today ``Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''  The Greeks have been members of the community in Rhode Island for over one hundred years. Over 6,000 residents of the state claimed Greek heritage in the last Census. When the Greeks first came to the New England, they worked in factories and on the waterfront. The descendants of these first immigrants continue to prosper and enrich the Northeast and the rest of the country through their contributions to banking, medicine, the tourism industry, and the arts.  Edith Hamilton praised Greeks in this quote, ``to rejoice in life, to find the world beautiful and delightful to live in, was a mark of the Greek spirit which distinguished it from all that had gone before. It is a vital distinction.''  I have been grateful for this spirit, energy, and support in the Rhode Island Greek community, and, for a very long time, I wished to visit Greece and Cyprus. This summer, I finally had that opportunity. On my trip, I had the pleasure of meeting Ambassador Burns and the U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus, Kenneth Brill. I also met and had candid conversations with Greece's Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Greek Defense Minister. In addition, I had the chance to tour the Green Line in Cyprus and speak with Dame Ann Hercus, the newly appointed Chief of the United Nations mission and General De Vagera, the force commander.  During my visit, I was impressed by the beauty of these countries and the hospitality of the people of Cyprus and Greece. However, I was also overwhelmed by the consequences of Turkey's 1974 invasion of Cyprus. The division of the island saps the economic vitality of a region rich in resources. The inability to move goods, people, or services between the two parts of the island stymies growth.  We must continue to work to resolve the Cyprus problem and reduce the tensions that exist between Greece and Turkey. When I was a member of the House of Representatives, I cosponsored numerous legislative initiatives to this end, and I will continue to advocate for such solutions as a Senator.  For today, let us celebrate the anniversary of Greek Independence, the richness of the Greek heritage and legacy of democracy that country gave to the world.                          ____________________
