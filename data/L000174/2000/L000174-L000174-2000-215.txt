President, today is in effect the anniversary of the onlymeeting of the House-Senate Conference committee on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile crime bill. This is the last day before the August recess this year and last year on August 5, Chairman Hatch convened the conference for the limited purpose of opening statements. I am disappointed that the majority continues to refuse to reconvene the conference and that for a over a year this Congress has failed to respond to issues of youth violence, school violence and crime prevention.  It has been 15 months since the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where 14 students and a teacher lost their lives in that tragedy on April 20, 1999. It has been 14 months since the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25. Our bipartisan bill includes modest yet effective gun safety provisions. It has been 13 months since the House of Representatives passed its own juvenile crime bill on June 17, 1999.  Sadly, it will be 12 months next week since the House and Senate juvenile justice conference met for the first--and only--time on August 5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August recess.  Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an effective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable gun safety provisions, but the majority refuses to act. Indeed, on October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote to Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and Congressman Hyde, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to reconvene the conference immediately. In April 2000, Congressman Hyde joined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as possible in a letter to Senator Hatch, which was also signed by Congressman Conyers.  A few months ago, the President even invited House and Senate members of the conference to the White House to urge us to proceed to the conference and to final enactment of legislation before the anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. But the majority has rejected his pleas for action as they have those of the American people. Apparently, the gun lobby objects to one provision in the bill, even though the bill passed overwhelmingly, and they will not let us proceed with the conference. This lobby was not elected to the Senate or to the House of Representatives, but apparently has enormous influence.  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school or involve their children.  Just last week, a 13-year old student put a gun to a fellow classmate at Seattle middle school. Although the student fired a shot in the school cafeteria, thankfully no one was hurt during this latest school shooting. Unfortunately, that cannot be said about the rash of recent incidents of school violence throughout the country. The growing list of schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, Tennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, and Florida is simply unacceptable and intolerable.  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should not let another school year begin without addressing some of the core issues of youth violence and school violence. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals.  It is ironic that the Senate will be in recess next week on the anniversary of the first and only meeting of the juvenile justice conference. In fact, the Senate has been in recess more than in session since the one ceremonial meeting of the juvenile crime conference committee. It is beneath us. We ought to meet. We ought to get this done.                          ____________________
