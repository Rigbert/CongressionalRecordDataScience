 FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?  Mr. McCONNELL. Not at this time.  There have been a whole series of cases on issue advocacy. It is not in a gray area. In fact, the FEC's enforcement actions and regulatory efforts to suppress issue advocacy have been going on for a number of years.  They have been involved in a number of cases. I am looking at a whole list here, FEC versus AFSCME, in 1979; FEC versus CLITRIM, in 1980; FEC versus Machinists, in 1981; FEC versus Massachusetts Citizens for Life, in 1986; FEC versus----  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator from Kentucky, is our colloquy over or is it going to continue?  Mr. McCONNELL. I apologize to my friend from Arizona. I am now making some observations about issue advocacy.
