 To reiterate, I commend the President of the United States for his speech last night. I said to him after the speech that I thought, as most peopledo, it was the finest speech of his public career. He spoke to us in accordance with constitutional provisions contained in article II, section 3 of our Constitution to report to the Congress on the state of the Union. But, more importantly, he spoke to all Americans.  I was there. My wife Marcelle was in the galleries. Millions upon millions of Americans across the country and people all around the world listened to the President. We knew America had been hit by murderous terrorist acts in New York and at the Pentagon in Virginia, and at the plane crash in Pennsylvania.
