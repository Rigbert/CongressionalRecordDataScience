 President, today I wish to pay tribute to a devoted public servant and tireless friend of the people of Washington State as she moves on from the staff of the United States Senate. Meaghan McCarthy has dedicated nearly 13 years in service to the Appropriations Committee and is widely recognized for her expertise in housing policy. I know that back in Washington State, here in the Senate, and across the country--Ms. McCarthy's important work has helped so many people find affordable housing and get back on their feet. I know so many will miss her compassionate advocacy on behalf of those facing housing challenges, from veterans requiring supportive housing, to working-class families that need a helping hand to remain in safe and affordable homes, and so many more.  A Massachusetts native and graduate of Notre Dame and Johns Hopkins University, Ms. McCarthy began her career in public policy as an advocate for children, working at the Children's Defense Fund. She then joined the Appropriations Committee as professional staff, where she developed a keen understanding of complex Federal housing policy. As a top staff member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, Ms. McCarthy has overseen and helped fund key affordable housing supports that make sure millions of people across the country have access to high-quality affordable housing. From tenant vouchers provided through the section 8 program to homeless assistance grants, supportive HUD-VASH vouchers for our veterans, and public housing funds, Ms. McCarthy has worked hand-in-hand with housing officials in my State to make sure Washington State families receive the resources they need.  It is so clear to me that Washington State has benefited from Ms. McCarthy's hard work, vast knowledge, and compassion for people and families fighting to make ends meet. During my time as the subcommittee's chair, I was always thankful that she was working on my State's behalf. Many of our housing advocates and authorities have reached out to my office to express their appreciation for her work. They have called her a ``critical bridge between Washington state's communities and our nation's big-picture, broad-stroke policy and budget machinery,'' someone who translated real-world neighborhood needs into action in a complex Federal bureaucracy.  Ms. McCarthy's work has had real and measurable impacts in Washington State communities. Stephen Norman, the executive director of the King County Housing Authority, was kind enough to share an anecdote wherein Ms. McCarthy pioneered a program to fund community facilities adjacent to public housing, which he called ``a cross-cutting initiative that recognized the importance of education success for low income children and the opportunities created by partnering schools and Housing Authorities.'' When HUD's draft rules effectively excluded suburban communities, which require a network of smaller facilities, Ms. McCarthy did what she does best: she went to work to solve the problem and change the rules. And change them she did. Now, King County has a network of 14 youth facilities, serving some of the poorest families in the region and helping children to reach their potential and to realize their dreams.  Today I join with others throughout the country, the State of Washington, and this body in thanking Ms. McCarthy for her years of service. I congratulate her on all of her accomplishments and wish her the best of luck in her future endeavors.                          ____________________
