 And I join the Congressman's comments about our veterans, veterans who have served our country so bravely, a great sense of self-sacrifice and national sacrifice. We thank them, particularly during this holiday season, their families, their children, their relatives, their friends, their communities, all their employers, all of those who understand what this requires.  And I wanted to just mention that, in connecting our veterans coming home to the employment question, it's a very serious challenge that we face because, even in a State like Ohio, currently, of all those who remain unemployed in Ohio, and there are many, 52,000 are veterans, already. And it was correct, I think, for President Obama, in going to visit with our veterans and active military at this holiday season, that one of the issues that came up repeatedly was, well, with our veterans coming home, where are they going to work with so many unemployed already?  And to give an example, in Ohio and many other parts of the country, for every job that exists, 100 people apply or more. And even if we filled every job that exists, we would have millions of Americans still out of work.  And yet, we have huge, unmet national needs, and that's why making decisions here, both on the tax side and the spending side, to get our economic house in order and to rein in the abuses in the financial sector on Wall Street that have caused such damage here and abroad, is absolutely critical for us to deal with and to keep those at the top of our priority list.  I think Congressman Garamendi and I agree that some of the partisan wrangling here is really so nonproductive. And if you want to put the country back to work, that's what the debate should be about. We should have job thermometers here showing how well we're doing and how fast we are helping to grow this economy.                              {time}  2030  So as with Congressman Garamendi's support of the veterans tax credit for hiring, I obviously support that as well. But it's not sufficient because, as I understand it, the tax credit will yield about 40,000 openings around the country; 40,000 companies will hire maybe one worker, or however it will ultimately transpire, but we have a need to reinvest in America.  The most important factor in reinvestment is for our banks to have confidence and our people to have confidence that there's going to be stability for people in our economy. I think our party wrangling really works against that.  Wouldn't you agree, Congressman?
