 President, I have discussed with Senator Bennett a proposal for a unanimous consent agreement on a speaking order. I would like quickly to move it as a request for unanimous consent that I be given 15 minutes; Senator Bennett, as ranking member, 15 minutes; Senator Tester, 10 minutes; Senator Lott, if he cares to come down, 10 or 15 minutes which, if it is 15, will balance with 15 on the Democratic side; Senator Nelson, 15; the next open slot for a Republican, 15 minutes; and Senator Salazar, 15 minutes.  I ask that at 2:15, for 15 minutes each, the majority leader be recognized, followed by the minority leader if he requests time.  Mr. President, let me vitiate that last part because we would like to have Senators Lieberman and Collins recognized at 2:15 for 15 minutes each and then Senators Reid and McConnell, if they so desire. That is the unanimous consent request.
