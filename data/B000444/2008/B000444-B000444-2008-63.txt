 President, Senator Vitter has been kind enough to come to the floor. He is trying to help move this process. He has an amendment relating to an inspector general. We have not had a chance to talk to him, but Senator Lugar and I have a second-degree amendment to that amendment that I think it may be worthwhile for the three of us to talk about.  Senator Vitter has indicated he would like--and I have no objection, assuming the second degree is in order--that the pending business, when we return, when the leadership meetings are over, be the Vitter amendment. I forget the number, quite frankly, but the Vitter amendment relating to inspectors general.  Am I correct, I ask the Senator?
