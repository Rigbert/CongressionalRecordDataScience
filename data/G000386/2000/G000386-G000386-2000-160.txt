 President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Plan Colombia Trade Act along with my colleague, Senator Bob Graham. This important bill will supplement Plan Colombia by expanding trade benefits to the countries of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru.  Plan Colombia is an important package that provides about a billion dollars to the government of Colombia, and other countries in that region. These funds will go to fight drugs, eradicate the crops which create them, and provide for alternative development. Unfortunately, Plan Colombia does not provide for an important measure that we can do to help these countries, that is to stimulate their economy. We can achieve this by passing the Plan Colombia Trade Act, which will provide assistance to develop their textile and apparel industries.  Developing the apparel industry of these countries will encourage global trade, and offer the good people of that region a future filled with prosperity. Additionally, the trade benefits outlined in this bill will enhance peace, stability, and prosperity in that region, which will ultimately yield a better quality of life for all involved. This bill will not only benefit the struggling economies of Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, but will advance the economy of the United States as well.  As important as the assistance package to Colombia is, most of the money we provide will not reach ordinary Colombians. They also are engaged in the effort to combat illegal drugs. We need to ensure that they are not penalized for doing so. The current bill helps us help Colombians not with cash but with opportunity. It preserves legitimate jobs in a country sorely beset with problems.  Most garments that are produced in Colombia are subject to a 20-30% duty rate upon importation into the U.S. As an example, swimsuits are subject to a duty rate of 33%. By granting duty-free and quota-free benefits to apparel assembled in these countries from U.S. made yarn, and U.S. made fabric, these countries will now be able to compete with other developing countries that currently enjoy duty-free and quota-free benefits. It will also afford them the opportunity to participate in the global economy. This will encourage additional export of U.S. made cotton and yarn, stimulate U.S. investment in the region and create needed jobs as well.  This bill is an opportunity to help rebuild a region which has been plagued by the drug trade. We can assist these countries, not by giving them more money, but by providing these enhanced trade opportunities. By helping our neighbors in the south to maintain political and economic stability, we will in effect be securing the National Security of the United States. This legislation will provide these countries with the opportunity build their industry and their struggling economies and will improve the quality of their everyday lives.  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill which will have a positive effect on the prosperity of our neighbors in Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.                                 ______                                       By
