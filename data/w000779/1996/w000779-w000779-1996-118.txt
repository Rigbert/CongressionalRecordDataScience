President, this June, Dr. Paul Kreider will be retiring from his position as president of Mount Hood Community College in Gresham, OR. I would like to recognize Dr. Kreider for his exceptional accomplishments and leadership during his many years of service.  Through strategic planning, program review and improvement, staff and organizational development, management information systems, and participatory decisionmaking, Dr. Kreider has played a significant role in the successful development of Mount Hood Community College. His effectiveness as a leader has not gone unnoticed; Dr. Kreider has received a number of awards, among them the National Council for Research and Planning 1991 Management Recognition Award, the National ACCT Marie Y. Martin CEO of the Year Award, and the National Council for Staff, Program, and Organizational Development Leadership Award.  Dr. Kreider's leadership did not stop at the doors of Mount Hood Community College; he has extended his knowledge and expertise to others in the community as well. In particular, he founded and chaired the Consortium for Institutional Effectiveness and Student Success in the Community College, an American Association Community Colleges-affiliated consortium. Additionally, he reached out to assist other community colleges in developing assessment tools to measure student outcomes, strategic planning, and program improvement.  Dr. Kreider remains quite active on State, national, and international levels. In the past, he served as president of the Board of Education Partners for International Cooperation, Inc. and the Oregon Community College Presidents' Council. Presently, he sits on the boards of several organizations including the American Association of Community Colleges and Community Colleges for International Development, Inc.  Again, I would like to both pay tribute to Dr. Kreider and congratulate him for his accomplishments and contributions to the educational community. Mount Hood Community College, as well as Oregon at large, has most certainly benefited from his initiative and leadership. I wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
