 President, like all Americans, I will never forget where I was on September 11, 2001, and I will never forget the way our country responded. In the face of great tragedy,Americans came together with courage and unity.  Eight years later, we continue to face great challenges. As a government--and as a nation--we are working to improve our safety and tackle the many difficulties facing us today.
