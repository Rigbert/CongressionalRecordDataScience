 President, I rise today to express congratulations to all the team members and coaches of Western Kentucky University's William E. Bivin Forensic Society. The group recently was named world champions at the International Forensic Association Championship in Vancouver, BC.  It is my understanding that this is just one of the many titles the team has claimed over the last year. The team won the 2003 Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha National Championship. They defeated 87 other universities to win the 2003 American Forensic Association National Championship. And most recently they captured the National Forensic Association Individual Events Championship. This is an impressive list of victories and a tribute to their hard work and dedication.  I wish to acknowledge each of the winning students: Corey Alderdice, Drew Allen, Elizabeth Au, Margaret Au, Stacy Bernaugh, Chris Blackford, Keith Blaser, Chris Brasfield, Grace Bruenderman, David Burns, Jenny Corum, Ashley Courtney, Justin Cress, Tony Damico, Nicole Estenfelder, Raegan Gibson, Nicole Hawk, Adam Henze, Kate Hertweck, Ryan Howell, Lindsey Nave, Jacob Peregoy, Jennifer Purcell, Hanna Reliford, Alex Rogers, Nick Romerhausen, Evelio Silvera, Rebecca Simms, Courtney Smith, Joel Smith, Jen Taylor, Katie Tyree, Jordon Wadlington, Caleb Williams, Jeff Woods, and Courtney Wright.  I would also like to recognize and thank their outstanding coaches, Judy Woodring, Jace Lux, Bonnie McDonald, Greg Robertson, Matt Gerbig, Doug Mory, Chris Grove, and Joe Day, who provided leadership to this winning team.  Mr. President, Western Kentucky University's William E. Bivin Forensic Society has both national and international successes to be proud of. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I congratulate them on their significant achievements.                          ____________________
