 President since the 1996 welfare reform, our nation has experienced one of the longest economic booms in history, but families are still struggling to make ends meet, and children are still living in poverty.  Now, with the recession, working families are facing even more barriers on the path toward self-sufficiency, and states are struggling to maintain their existing programs. In my own state of Washington, we've seen the results of the recession: good jobs are more difficult to find, welfare rolls are up, and state budget cuts have taken a chunk out of childcare and other critical supports for our most disadvantaged families. It is with this in mind that I introduce Senate bill S. 2876, the Secure and Healthy Families Act of 2002.  The Secure and Healthy Families Act will help build on the successes of welfare reform. This bill gives us an important opportunity to reaffirm that we value America's families and that we will protect our children. This bill takes what we know from our own experiences as parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents and what research has proven to be effective to help us move toward the goal of building healthy families. It does not impose inflexible top-down strategies. Instead, it allows states to support work and engage families on assistance. It will help build secure and healthy families in a number of ways.  First, this legislation will create the Promoting Healthy Families Fund that enables the Secretary of HHS to fund state activities to promote and support secure families. For example, the fund would support state and local efforts to provide family counseling, income enhancement programs for working poor families--like the successful Minnesota Family Investment Program, or teen pregnancy prevention programs that help young people avoid the poverty that often comes with these unplanned pregnancies.  Second, this act will ensure states recognize that secure and healthy families come in all shapes and sizes. The federal government has long led the way in opposing discrimination, and this bill will continue that critical role.  Next, this bill puts in place several provisions to help the parents build a better future for themselves and their children. The bill encourages teen parents to remain in school by not counting the time that they are in school against their five-year lifetime limit. Under this legislation, a teen mother would also be given the chance to get on her feet, get settled in school, and find a safe place for her and her baby to live without losing assistance.  Mr. President, in families where children are chronically ill or disabled, parents are confronted with special challenges. Most cannot find appropriate affordable care, and cannot leave sick and vulnerable children alone. They run from the doctor's office and emergency rooms--trying to keep their jobs while dealing with the sudden and frequent life-threatening health problems that these children face. This bill would offer support for these families by recognizing that full time care of a chronically sick or disabled child is hard work, and by giving parents the opportunity to meet their children's special needs.  The bill also strengthens support for those families who are victims of domestic or sexual violence. We know that as many as 70 percent of welfare recipients are or have been victims of domestic violence. This bills sends a clear message to states that they must protect there vulnerable families in several ways including: having comprehensive standards and procedures to address domestic and sexual violence, training caseworkers so that they are sensitive to the unique needs of victims of domestic violence, and informing survivors of domestic and family violence of the existing protections to ensure their privacy and safety.  Most states are approaching domestic violence prevention and assistance in interesting and innovative ways. The bill will provide funding for a national study of best practices on the ways states are addressing domestic violence. In addition, states will be able to continue to provide services to domestic and family violence survivors without worrying about federal exemption caps. The bill will allow these survivors to receive the services they need when they are making the transition out of dangerous situations to safe and successful lives.  Finally, the bill would support relatives who take in underprivileged children. A growing number of children, 2.16 million in 2000, are being cared for solely by grandparents and other relatives. Although some of these children are involved with the child welfare system, many more of these children are able to remain outside of the system because their relatives are able to care for them.  Last week a young man named Eustaquito Beltran came to my office to talk to me about the importance of supporting foster children. He told me that he had lived in more than one hundred homes since he was a toddler. The results for children like him are heartbreaking. Fewer than half graduate from high school, and many become homeless after they turn 18.  Prior to being abandoned by or taken away from their parents, most of these children live in poverty with families devastated by substance abuse, mental health disorders, poor education, unemployment, violence, lack of parenting skills, and involvement with the criminal justice system. A 1990 studyfound that the incidence of emotional, behavioral, and developmental problems among children in foster care was three to six times greater than the incidence of these problems among children not in care.  If care by a relative can help children like Eustaquito avoid the foster care system, then we should be grateful for the assistance that relative is offering. Instead, relatives who care for children with support form TANF are often trapped in a Catch-22. If a grandmother takes in her grandchild, but needs support herself and receives TANF assistance, federal time limits and work requirements apply. It doesn't make sense to require this grandmother, who may have worked for years and finally reached retirement, to return to work in order to help her grandchild stay out of the foster care system.  My bill would exempt kinship care families from federal time limits and work requirements to help ensure ongoing support for these children. This will allow relative caregivers to provide the additional supervision and care that children who have been abused and neglected often need.  Mr. President, the strength of our nation lies in how we care for our most vulnerable. Coming together to support victims of domestic violence, children abandoned by their parents, and teen mothers can make it clear that welfare reform is about helping all Americans succeed, not about punishing the needy.  The Senate must focus our crucial federal welfare dollars on programs and practices that create a bridge to self-sufficiency and productivity while keeping families secure and healthy. I am committed to strengthening the safety net our families depend on so that parents have the skills they need to find work and succeed once they are in the workplace. This bill will ensure that children grow up in secure and healthy families. It is a critical step in our work to leave no child behind.                                 ______                                       By
