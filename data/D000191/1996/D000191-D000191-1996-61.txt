Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, the so-called ban has been neither the Armageddon for gun owners that was predicted during lastyear's debate nor the panacea for the problem of violent crime in America predicted by the advocates. The truth is, it did not ban much of anything, not the sale, only the future manufacture of a few weapons, chosen for cosmetic reasons. And even if it was not a real ban, have we not learned that prohibition does not work well in America? That is it.  I did not support the ban, because I said it would have little or no effect, it was symbolic; nor will I support the repeal here today and trigger an endless series of debates on this issue, while this House avoids the real debate on the real issues that bring violent crime to the streets of America.  Where are the 100,000 new cops? The majority will not give us the 100,000 new police in America. They say we cannot afford it. Where are the prevention programs, so we do not have another generation of dangerous criminals in America? They have been eliminated by the new majority.  Those are the things we should be debating here today on the floor, and this debate distracts from that.
