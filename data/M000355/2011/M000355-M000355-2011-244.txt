 President, let me echo the remarks of the majority leader regarding the chairman and the ranking members of this subcommittee, who have done a fine job. I commend Senator Kirk, who has served around here for the last couple of years. It is truly remarkable to pass an appropriations bill. We passed it at a level where it is likely to be conferenced successfully with the House. I congratulate both Senators--in particular our new Senator from Illinois.  I also share the view of the majority leader that we should have a vigorous debate over cut, cap, and balance. I look forward to being here Saturday to vote to proceed to that bill.
