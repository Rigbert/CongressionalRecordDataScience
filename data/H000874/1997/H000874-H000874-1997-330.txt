Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to introduce the Child Passenger Safety Act of 1997 with my colleague from Maryland, Mrs. Morella. This legislation, put simply, seeks to save the lives of thousands of children across the country. Every day, parents, grandparents, and concerned citizens take the time and responsibility to place young children in child safety seats. Unfortunately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA] estimates that nearly two-thirds of all child safety restraints are misused.  Because of this alarmingly high rate of misuse and the benefits that can be seen by the proper use of child safety seats, NHTSA commissioned a blue ribbon panel in 1995 to study this issue and make recommendations on ways to solve the problem of misuse. Impressively, safety experts, Government agencies, safety seat manufacturers, and several auto manufacturers sat down together with a common interest and concern, and explored options for communicating the issues of compatibility and proper and secure installation of child restraint systems.  Representing thousands of conscientious and responsible parents who place their children in safety seats every day, unaware of the risks and dangers that their children may face, I took great interest in this issue. I have worked closely with Congresswoman Morella for the past 2 years to raise awareness of the issue, encourage and support the auto manufacturers' voluntary efforts, and participate in education drives. In fact, I have attended two child safety seat check events in my district and the turnout by the public was most encouraging and impressive. I also attended the signing ceremony of a partnership between General Motors and the National Safe Kids Campaign last year which created a major, national grass roots campaign to educate parents about child passenger safety issues. General Motors, and now Chrysler, have voluntarily committed millions of dollars and considerable manpower to this cause and are to be commended for their efforts.  However, Mr. Speaker, resources are scarce and all of the concerned child safety organizations and consumer groups are stretched for dollars to sponsor safety seat check events. Therefore, this legislation would provide $7.5 million in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 to the Secretary of Transportation for the purpose of awarding education and training program grants to agencies and associated organizations on the local, State, and national level.  Mr. Speaker, NHTSA is to be commended for their leadership on this issue. We must support their efforts as they continue to develop guidelines under which there would be a single, uniform attachment system. In the meantime, we must commit the necessary funding to ensure that we inform and educate the public on how to best protect their children.  The number of children who die each year in motor vehicle crashes is truly devastating.However, this number is made all the more egregious because so many young children die as a result of unknown misuse of these devices.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to cosponsor this very important legislation in the days and weeks ahead. And, as Child Passenger safety awareness week, and all of the attention it has received, winds down, we must not relinquish our zeal to ensure that all parents, grandparents, and concerned adults receive any and all of the information and educational tools necessary to protect our Nation's children. Thank you.                          ____________________
