Mr. Speaker, I am deeply saddened by the loss of a former colleague, friend, and mentor, the Honorable Bob Stump of Arizona. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Nancy, his children, Karen, Hoot, and Bruce, as well as his grandchildren, other family members and friends who loved him.  From his enlistment in the Navy during World War II at the age of 16, to his extraordinary leadership as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs and Armed Services Committees in the House of Representatives, Bob Stump was a true American hero.  Bob Stump served with distinction in Congress for 26 years, including 6 years as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and 2 years as chairman of the committee on Armed Services. Chairman Stump used his influence to promote responsible legislation to assist and honor our nation's veterans.  Under Bob Stump's leadership, Congress increased funding for veterans health care; expanded access to long term care for aging veterans, including nonhospital alternative care; reformed eligibility standards for access to VA health care; extended the national cemetery system, including Arlington National Cemetery; increased assistance to disabled veterans and their survivors; and strengthened the Montgomery GI Bill that has helped millions of veterans fulfill their educational and career goals.  A modest man who preferred to shun the spotlight, Bob Stump's life and his legacy will continue to shine brightly for generations of service men and women to come.  Mr. Speaker, Bob Stump was the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs from 1995-2000, and its ranking minority member for the 2 previous years. He served as a member of the Committee for a total of 14 years. During his tenure as chairman, he compiled a distinguished record of legislation that is a major part of his legacy of public service. As his successor as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I particularly know and appreciate all that he did for our Nation's veterans, servicemembers and their families by working on a bipartisan basis in cooperation with veterans' service organizations. I want to take this opportunity to recall the major veterans' legislation he authored, because Bob Stump was not one to trumpet his accomplishments.  In 1996, Chairman Stump initiated and Congress passed important health care eligibility reforms for veterans that removed barriers to outpatient care and allowed greater flexibility to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in paying for care closer to veterans' homes. The savings generated by shifting away from inpatient care and budget increases Bob supported were used to increase ambulatory care visits in fiscal year 2000 to more than 40 million total outpatient visits nationwide, an increase of 5.3 million outpatient visits per year over 1997. As a result of this legislation, the VA established hundreds of new community-based outpatient clinics throughout the Nation to improve veterans' access to health care.  In 1998, Bob Stump initiated and Congress passed the largest benefits expansion for veterans since the Persian Gulf war, including: allowing spouses of veterans who died from a service-connected disability to resume receiving assistance under the Dependency and Indemnity Compensation program if their subsequent remarriage ended; increasing adaptive housing and automobile allowances; increasing the monthly pension benefit for disabled veterans in need of the full time aid and attendance of another person by $600 per year; and increasing the monthly Montgomery GI Bill payment from $440 to $528, a 20-percent increase.  Then in 2000, our former chairman initiated and Congress passed the landmark Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, popularly known by many veterans as the Millennium Act, the most comprehensive benefits improvement legislation in decades. Some of its more significant provisions included: mandating nursing home and long-term care for seriously disabled veterans; allowing the VA to pay for emergency care for veterans lacking access to other health care plans; improving priority health care access for Purple Heart recipients and military retirees; improving benefits for surviving spouses of disabled veterans; and increasing programs providing employment and housing assistance to homeless veterans.  Also, Bob Stump greatly appreciated the value of education, and initiated Montgomery GI Bill benefits enhancements that increased the value of the monthly education benefit for veterans by nearly $100 per month to $650. The resulting 4-year total basic benefit of $23,400 for a full-time student at a 4-year institution in the year 2000 was almost 50 percent higher than it was in 1997. This law also contained provisions that allowed servicemembers to contribute more up front to achieve an $800 per month benefit, and it provided active duty servicemembers a new opportunity to convert their post-Vietnam Era Veterans Educational Assistance Program benefits to the Montgomery GI Bill if they had not done so before or had withdrawn all the funds from their VEAP accounts.  Bob Stump had a particular interest in the national cemetery system, and worked for its expansion. Thanks to his efforts while he was chairman, five new national veterans' cemeteries were opened, adding approximately 835,000 gravesites to our national cemetery capacity. Additionally, legislation he sponsored was enacted to require the VA to plan 6 newnational cemeteries in Atlanta, Miami, Pittsburgh, Oklahoma, Sacramento, and Detroit. He also authorized legislation to expand the boundaries of Arlington National Cemetery, extending its useful life beyond the projected closing date of 2025 so that in-ground burials of veterans can continue until approximately the year 2041.  Mr. Speaker, this impressive record of legislative accomplishment has resulted in immeasurable good for veterans, servicemembers and their families. Bob Stump's leadership was the strongest kind--leadership by example. His lifetime of service to America left this country a better place, and I am honored to have served in the House with our departed colleague, Bob Stump.                          ____________________
