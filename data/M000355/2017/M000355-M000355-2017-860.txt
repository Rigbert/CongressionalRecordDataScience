 President, at the outset of the week, I outlined three issues we needed to address immediately: provide resources for Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma preparedness, ensure that the government remains funded, and ensure that a default is prevented so the emergency resources I mentioned can actually get to Americans who need them.  That is what the legislation I filed cloture on yesterday achieves, and it achieves it all together in one package. It will provide certainty and stability for first responders, State officials, and the many others involved in preparing for and recovering from these storms with critically needed emergency resources that will not be interrupted by the prospect of a shutdown or default.  The recovery effort for a record-setting storm like Harvey has strained resources to the limit already. The advance of another historic storm now makes the need for action even more urgent, so let's work together and act on this legislation very quickly.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
