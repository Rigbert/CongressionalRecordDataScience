Speaker, on Friday, February 9, 2018, I was not present for two votes due to an unavoidable delay. If I had been present, I would have voted:  On Roll Call vote 67, on Ordering the Previous Question, I would have voted Nay.  On Roll Call vote 68, agreeing to H. Res. 734, I would have voted Nay.                          ____________________
