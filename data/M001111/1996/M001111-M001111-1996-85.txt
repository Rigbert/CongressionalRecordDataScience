       Since then, thousands of women and men of good will and      intellect have pursued--passionately, painstakingly--the      compelling mission of our age. Working together, let us      rededicate ourselves to this mission: To shepherd this beast      back into its cage--to bring what was unleashed in a blinding      blast of heat in the New Mexico desert to a fitting end in      the cool atmosphere of reason in Geneva--to ensure that the      first half century of nuclear explosions is the last.  Mr. President, in the next few days, this country may be in a position to celebrate the successful completion of more than 30 years of work to end nuclear testing worldwide. To do this, we must defeat the Kyl amendment. We must turn back the few in this country who continue to believe this Nation must go down the path of nuclear expansion and exploration. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Hatfield motion to table the Kyl amendment.  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Nebraska.
