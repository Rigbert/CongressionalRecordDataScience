The Republican leaders were prodded into this by the narrow ideological extreme right of their party and its allies. They have not brought forward their own bill on affirmative action. They want to talk about it, but they have not brought it forward because they know a majority of Republicans and Democrats would not vote for it.  The Proposition 209 case is over. The Supreme Court has ruled on that. The good people of Houston rejected efforts to abandon those previously discriminated against. So there is nothing left for the extreme right except one trophy, and that trophy is Bill Lann Lee.  What kind of an example does this set? What kind of signal does this send? Bill Lee's life story is an American success story. He is the son of immigrants who struggled against discrimination. His father fought with the American forces in World War II. He spent his professional career working to solve civil rights problems and diffuse conflict. His record of achievement is exemplary. He is a man of integrity and honor, as even those opposing him have to concede.  When he said to the Judiciary Committee that quotas are illegal and wrong and he would enforce the law, no one should have any doubt about his resolve to do what is right. He is a person with great problem-solving skills. Such matters are too important to be used for political purposes or as wedge issues to divide people. What is promising about this nomination is that Bill Lee is the person with the credentials, credibility and creativity to help move America and all Americans forward.  Any fairminded review of his 23-year career shows him to be well-suited to head the Civil Rights Division. It shows where he has been and where the law has been and how we have moved forward to refine remedial approaches to discrimination and its vestiges. One measure of this extraordinary individual are the testimonies of support provided by so many of his litigation opponents over the years, support based on his fairness and good sense, support from Democrats and Republicans alike.  Just this summer, the Senate moved forward to confirm another Assistant Attorney General, someone who had expressly declined to follow the language of the Telecommunications Act House-Senate conference report and raised concerns among a number of Senators. We were told that the standard to be employed in evaluating these nominees was not to hold a nominee hostage to policy differences with the administration but to vote for the nominee, if well-qualified, to permit the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed division chief, and for us in Congress to move forward and work with the administration in the formulation and implementation of effective policies.  Unfortunately, with this nomination, that of the first Asian-American to head the Civil Rights Division, the rules are being changed and the standards are being moved. First, it appeared that the Republicans wished to raise their concerns with the nominee and point out their differences with administration policy, as is traditionally done. Then the focus was on Mr. Lee's possible involvement in Supreme Court consideration of the California proposition 209 case. When Mr. Lee came forward and recused himself from involvement in that case, the suggestion was made that the Department of Justice abstain from filing a brief in that case should certiorari be granted.  That suggestion was properly rejected. Indeed, I would think that the Supreme Court would be likely to request the views of the U.S. Government if they were not tendered in an amicus brief. Surely imposition of this suggested gag rule on the United States on issues of significance and concern inorder to confirm a nominee who would not even be involved in formulating the U.S. position would have been ill-advised.  This week the Supreme Court denied review in the California proposition 209 case. If Bill Lee's recusal did not clear the way for his confirmation surely, one would have thought, this action by the Supreme Court removed the immediate obstacle that had been fastened on by the opposition. Instead, the grounds for opposition shifted. It now appears that in order to be confirmed to lead the Civil Rights Division, the nominee must not only commit to uphold the law but disavow the President who has nominated him to serve in this administration. Before we are done I expect that the nominee would be required to endorse S. 950, a bill that the Senate has not considered nor the Congress enacted.  I think it beneath Senators to suggest that this fine nominee ought be rejected because a previous, unqualified Republican nominee had been rejected by the committee. Tit for tat may be the rule in the alley, but should not govern the actions of the U.S. Senate. Nonetheless, there seems to be a lot of pay back motivating those opposing this fine man.  I regret that a narrow, ideological litmus test is being proposed that would require nominees to disavow remedies and approaches that the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional and necessary to enforce our commitment to equal opportunity. It is the administration's commitment to affirmative action and equal justice that would have to be sacrificed. I know that Bill Lee would not compromise his commitment to enforce the law and to seek equal justice for all Americans.  Moreover, if accepted by a partisan majority, that political litmus test will know no natural limit. It could infect the confirmation of the Associate Attorney General, the Solicitor General and all other nominations.  I regret that some have decided to oppose this good man. He would, in my view, enforce the law, use his problem-solving skills and proven ability to move the country forward and build on the progress that we have been able to make in remedying past discrimination over the last several years. It appears now that for this nomination to prevail in Committee it will take a profile in courage by a couple Republican members. I urge each member to consider his or her vote carefully and what it means for this nomination, for the country and for standards being created for future nominations.  There is a place to consider the important issues involved in the debate over race relations in the country and the constitutionality of affirmative action that the Supreme Court has held to be constitutional. That should not be the issue with respect to the vote on this nominee, however.  When Bill Lee appeared before the Committee with his family he testified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He articulated to us that he understands that as the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division his client is the United States and all of its people. He told us poignantly about why he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for all when he spoke of the treatment that his parents received as immigrants. Mr. Lee told us how in spite of his father's personal treatment and experiences, William Lee remained a fierce American patriot, volunteered to serve in the United States Army Air Corps in World War II and never lost his belief in America.  He inspired his son just as Bill Lee now inspires his own children and countless others across the land. They are the kind of everyday heroes to whom we sing praises.  Mr. Lee told us:       ``My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it      difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching      patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I      did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to      a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance.      But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an      American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside      the momentary ugliness. He knew that the basic American tenet      of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.''  I know that Bill Lee will remain true to all that his father taught him and hope that the momentary ugliness of people opposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test of people distorting his achievements and beliefs and of some succumbing to narrow partisanship will not be his reward for a career of good works. Such treatment drives good people from public service and distorts the role of the Senate.  I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it serves as the conscience of the Nation. In this case, I am afraid that the Senate may show no conscience.  I call on the Senate's Republican leadership to end their targeting of Bill Lann Lee and to work with us to bring this nomination to the floor without obstruction so that the Senate may vote and we may confirm a fine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century.  Why this exemplary Asian-American is singled out, a man who has shown far more qualities than most people and could easily be confirmed, I cannot understand. To allow somebody's career, to allow somebody who has lived the American dream, to allow somebody who has demonstrated what is best about this country, to allow the Senate to react to what is worst about this country in defeating him is absolutely wrong. It is a shame on the Senate. It is a shame on the country. It is a shame on all of us if we allow this to happen. The worst part of that shame, Mr. President, is that if the Senate were allowed to vote on Bill Lann Lee, he would be confirmed, because most Senators in both parties would not allow this shame to go on. Why an ideological ultraright would stop it I cannot understand.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that recent editorials on this matter from the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, and the Washington Post be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 6, 1997]Politics of the Partisan Kill--Hatch Plays the Executioner in the Bill                         Lee Confirmation Process       Sen. Orrin G. Hatch's manipulation of Bill Lann Lee's      confirmation process was a callous performance, nearly a      political beheading for no apparent reason beyond the fact      that Lee is President Clinton's choice as the nation's top      civil rights official.       The Utah Republican himself acknowledged Tuesday that Lee,      nominated to head the Justice Department's civil rights      division, is ``an able civil rights lawyer with a profoundly      admirable passion to improve the lives of many Americans.''       The GOP game seems to be to torpedo even the most      outstanding appointments out of petulance that the Democrat      in the White House has the nominating power. The Senate      Judiciary Committee, headed by Hatch, has turned to stalling      or harassment in the cases of many worthy nominees to the      federal bench, for instance; this continues at a time when      one in nine judgeships are vacant.       Lee, with 23 years of experience in civil rights law, is      well respected and qualified to do the job, but Hatch painted      the Los Angeles attorney as a poster boy for affirmative      action. Ridiculous.       The senator says that much of Lee's work has been devoted      to ``constitutionally suspect, race-conscious public policies      that ultimately distort and divide citizens by race.''       Distorted view of the law? Lee has worked long and      vigorously within the civil rights statutes to uphold the      law. He opposed California's Proposition 209 but has said he      would support the law of the land, including this week's      controversial U.S. Supreme Court decision to let stand      Proposition 209, California's ban on race and gender      preferences in public hiring and university admissions.       Hatch's opposition could doom Lee's appointment unless two      Republicans join the committee's eight Democrats in today's      scheduled vote on Lee, who would be the first Asian American      to manage the 250-lawyer division. Even if the Judiciary      Committee does not recommend Lee, the full Senate should get      the opportunity to vote on the nomination. Clinton      administration officials, who belatedly mounted a full-court      press for their nominee, believe that Lee could be confirmed      by a floor vote.       Barring that, Clinton could courageously circumvent the      Senate and put Lee in the job by making a ``recess      appointment'' after Congress shuts down Friday for its annual      Christmas break. Lee warrants Senate confirmation. He should      not be made a political scapegoat.                                  ____                 [From the New York Times Nov. 6, 1997]                       Affirmative Action in Play       The Supreme Court's most momentous decision of the current      term may turn out to be its refusal this week to hear a      challenge to the constitutionality of California's anti-     affirmative-action initiative, Proposition 209. The Court's      sidestep allows California to proceed unimpeded with its      rollback of remedies that are, regrettably, still needed to     address the nation's persistent problem of race and gender      discrimination. It may also encourage other states to follow      California.       Had it taken the case, this Court might well have agreed      with the Ninth Circuit's decision upholding Proposition 209,      which applies to affirmative action programs in public      education, employment and contracting. But the opposing      arguments are also weighty and deserved a timely and      respectful airing by the justices.       In the absence of any guidance from the Supreme Court, the      nation is now embarking on a far-reaching legal and social      experiment that holds as much potential to exacerbate racial      differences as to minimize them. Clearly, many fair-minded      Americans are uncomfortable with race-based preferences. But      they cannot feel sanguine that alternative steps, such as      basing affirmative action on income instead of race, will be      adequate to preserve black access to the elite public      universities, and the career opportunities and higher pay      that follow from it.       The only encouraging development on this contentious issue      was seen in Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, in      Tuesday's elections when voters defeated a measure similar to      Proposition 209 that would have prohibited affirmative action      in Houston's contracting and hiring. The heavy minority      turnout for the city's mayoral election was evidently a big      factor in mobilizing opposition, as was a clearly worded      measure that avoided inflammatory and misleading language.      Houston's retiring Mayor, Bob Lanier, a wealthy white      developer, did the nation a service by emphasizing the unfair      result if affirmative action were eliminated. ``Let's not      turn back the clock to the days when guys who look like me      got all the city's business,'' he urged voters.       It was hoped that the Supreme Court's refusal to take up      Proposition 209 would at least persuade Senator Orrin Hatch      to clear President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lann Lee as      Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. Earlier Mr.      Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, broached      the idea of trading Mr. Lee's confirmation for a promise from      the Administration not to file a brief with the Court in      support of the challenge. Once the 209 challenge was dead,      however, Mr. Hatch announced he would vote against Mr. Lee      anyway, based on his affirmative-action views.       Yet those views are also the President's, and no one, not      even Senator Hatch, disputes that Mr. Lee is well qualified.      Mr. Hatch seems to be abusing the confirmation process to      bolster his standing with the right wing of his party.      Sensible Republican senators need to join quickly with their      Democratic colleagues to make sure that Mr. Lee's nomination      survives this offensive kind of end-of-session maneuvering.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 1997]                           The Lee Nomination       In July, the president nominated Bill Lann Lee, western      regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational      Fund, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. The      post had then been vacant for half a year. On Wednesday, Mr.      Lee had his confirmation hearing. The nomination now should      be approved.       The choice of Mr. Lee has drawn some limited opposition, as      civil rights nominations by either party almost always seem      to do these days. In this case, however, even opponents, some      of them, have acknowledged that, from a professional      standpoint, Mr. Lee is qualified. The issue is not his      professional competence. The objection is rather to the views      of civil rights that he shares with the president, and which,      in the view of the critics, should disqualify him.       Mr. Lee's views appear to us to be well inside the bounds      of accepted jurisprudence. He is an advocate of affirmative      action, as you would expect of someone who has spent his      entire professional career--23 years--as a civil rights      litigator. The president has likewise generally been a      defender of such policies against strong political pressures      to the contrary. But Mr. Lee himself observed that the      assistant attorney general takes an oath to uphold the law as      set forth by the courts, and so he would. The range of      discretion in a job such as this is almost always less than      the surrounding rhetoric suggests.       Mr. Lee over his career has brought a considerable number      of lawsuits in behalf of groups claiming they were      discriminated against, and has sought and won resolutions      aimed at making the groups whole, somehow defined. It is that      kind of group resolution of such disputes that some people      object to, on grounds that the whole object of the exercise      should be to avoid labeling and treating people as members of      racial and other such groups. There is surely some reason for      the discomfort this group categorizing generates. But the      court's themselves continue to uphold such actions in limited      circumstances. And Mr. Lee has won a reputation for resolving      such cases sensibly. Los Angeles's Republican Mayor Richard      Riordan is one who supports the nomination. ``Mr. Lee first      became known to me as opposing counsel in an important civil      rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los Angeles,'' he      has written. ``The work of my opponents rarely evokes my      praises, but the negotiations could not have concluded      successfully without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and      expertise . . . Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights      law.''       There are lots of legitimate issues to be argued about in      connection with civil rights law. Mr. Lee's nomination is not      the right vehicle for resolving them. Senators, including      some who no doubt disagree with some of his views, complain      with cause about the continuing vacancies in high places at      the Justice Department. This is one they should fill before      they go home.
