Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6400, introduced by my colleague, Mr. Pallone, makes boundary adjustments to multiple units of the Coastal Barrier Resources System along the coast of his New Jersey congressional district. I have no objection to this bill and compliment the gentleman for introducing the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
