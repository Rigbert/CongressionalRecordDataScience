President, before I go on to that, I would note that many have come to this floor to talk about the deficit and things of that nature. I ask anybody who is decrying our deficit if they voted for a needless war in Iraq and then voted to put it on the credit card.  The war in Iraq has cost this Nation nearly $1 trillion so far, and with all the wounded who have come back from this unnecessary war, we will, beyond the lifetime of most of us, still be paying for that.  The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the only wars in America's history we did not have a special tax to pay for--both were put on a credit card. They were begun at a time when the last administration had inherited a large surplus from the Democratic administration before it. Since I have been old enough to vote, only Democratic administrations have left surpluses. But they took that surplus, wasted it on the war in Iraq, and because they were unwilling to pay for this war--a war that was paid for only by the men and women who served and their families; we don't have a draft--most people can say: It didn't affect me. Well, it affected those families enormously, and it will affect every single taxpayer for the rest of their lives because it will take that long to pay for a war that so many in this body and the other body voted for but then stood up and said: We cannot possibly have taxes to pay for things we are spending money on. That is one thing they voted for--for the first time in the history of this country, they voted to not pay for a war.  I urge everybody not to lose sight of the fact that a major part of our deficit was caused by the House and Senate voting for a war we never should have been in, one I voted against. In fact, everybody who actually read the intelligence material voted against it. Now our children and our grandchildren will have to pay for our mistakes.  I don't want to hear lectures about our deficit from people who voted to help create that deficit by voting for an unnecessary war.  On the subject we are on, S. 47, after more than a week of consideration, the Senate will finally vote on the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. This is a good bill that makes needed changes recommended by victims and those who work with themevery day. I urge all those Senators who have opposed reauthorizing VAWA to end their opposition and join with us. Despite the predictions by some that the Republican House of Representatives will refuse to consider the Senate bill, as it did last year, I see reason for hope.  Just yesterday 17 Republican members of the House wrote to their own leadership urging immediate reauthorization of VAWA. They rejected the ideological opposition of Heritage and the Family Research Council. They recognize that VAWA is effective, efficient and successful ``in curbing domestic violence and supporting victims,'' and that ``VAWA programs save lives.'' They also note, as I have said repeatedly on this floor: ``VAWA must reach all victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in every community in the country.''  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Republican members' letter to Speaker Boehner be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  The Senate has rejected the Republican substitute and defeated the Coburn amendment to strip the tribal jurisdiction provisions that have been included in the Senate bill for the past two years. Those amendments would have greatly narrowed VAWA's ability to prevent crime and help victims and would have undercut our commitment to all victims of rape and domestic violence. I hope Senators will continue to vote against amendments that weaken this important legislation.  This morning the Senate has the opportunity to vote for an amendment that goes in the opposite direction from the Coburn amendments by allowing us to help more victims of serious crime in the United States and around the world. This morning the Senate is to vote on the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. That is another bipartisan bill that was written with the input of victims and service providers to make critical improvements to existing law. Last year, this legislation had 57 cosponsors--including 15 Republicans. In particular, I thank Senator Rubio who has been a strong cosponsor of this important measure.  Today is February 12, the day on which Abraham Lincoln was born. It was 150 years ago that he delivered the Emancipation Proclamation and it would be fitting that the Senate pass the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act on his birthday. Although the 13th amendment to our Constitution was ratified long ago, making slavery illegal, we continue to fight human trafficking, which can amount to modern day slavery. This terrible crime still occurs throughout the world--including in the United States of America. The Polaris Project estimates that there are more than 27 million victims of human trafficking worldwide today.  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act will help us continue to make real progress on this issue. It is a parallel effort to our reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. Our effort is to stop human trafficking at its roots by supporting both domestic and international efforts to fight against trafficking and to punish its perpetrators. We provide critical resources to help support victims as they rebuild their lives.  This measure strengthens criminal anti-trafficking statutes to ensure that law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to effectively combat all forms of trafficking. It ensures better coordination among Federal agencies, between law enforcement and victim service providers, and with foreign countries to work on every facet of this complicated problem. It includes measures to encourage victims to come forward and report this terrible crime, which leads to more prosecutions and help for more victims.  We have included accountability measures to ensure that Federal funds are used for their intended purposes, and we have streamlined programs to focus scarce resources on the approaches that have been the most successful. A Senator asserted yesterday that trafficking programs have been wasteful and duplicative. In fact, the programs supported by this amendment have been carefully tracked and shown to be effective. Nonetheless, the amendment reduces authorization levels by almost a third from the levels in the last reauthorization because we are determined to ensure efficiency and respond to concerns. We have made similar efforts to streamline VAWA.  The United States remains a beacon of hope for so many who face human rights abuses. We know that young women and girls often just 11, 12, or 13 years old are being bought and sold. We know that workers are being held and forced into labor against their will. I urge all Senators to join in passing the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. People in this country and millions around the world are counting on us.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2013.     Speaker John Boehner,     Majority Leader Eric Cantor.       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor: We are writing to      urge you to immediately reauthorize the Violence Against      Women Act (VAWA). As you know, we are long overdue in passing      a reauthorization of this landmark piece of legislation which      seeks to reduce instances of domestic violence and protect      women who are victims of such violence.       Over the course of the past several years, we have met with      constituents in our districts who agree that VAWA programs      are an important part of a larger criminal justice framework      that seeks to reduce abuse against women and children. We      appreciate the need to make efficient and effective use of      federal dollars, and believe that VAWA programs in our      districts have met that threshold and have been a success in      curbing domestic violence and supporting victims. Now is the      time to seek bipartisan compromise on the reauthorization of      these programs. VAWA programs save lives, and we must allow      states and communities the opportunity to build upon the      successes of current VAWA programs so that we can help even      more people.       It is unfortunate that states are already preparing for      Congress's inaction. In New Jersey, for example, the state      legislature recently passed a bridge fund bill to fill the      void left by a lack of federal funds in the event VAWA is not      reauthorized.       We believe a bipartisan plan to reauthorize VAWA is more      important than ever. Last year, in a bipartisan letter many      of us in the Republican Conference wrote to the Judiciary      Committee, we said: ``VAWA must reach all victims and      perpetrators of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault, and stalking in every community in the country.''      This statement still holds true, and underscores the need to      reauthorize this critical legislation. If you have any      questions, or if we can be of additional assistance, your      staff may contact Joe Heaton with Rep. Runyan.           Sincerely,         Jon Runyan, Charlie Dent, Dave Reichert, Richard Hanna,            David Joyce, Shelley Moore-Capito, Frank LoBiondo,            Michael Fitzpatrick, Jim Gerlach, Chris Gibson, Rodney            Frelinghuysen, Leonard Lance, Patrick Meehan, Rodney            Davis, Tom Reed, Lee Terry, Michael Grimm, Members of            Congress.
