Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will yield further, the point I am trying to make is that in a Dear Colleague that was sent to every Member on the Hill, every House Member, the statement has been made that the UNFPA manages its own program in China. That is demonstrably false.  As I pointed out earlier in this discussion, the United Nations Population Fund on January 7, 1998, assigned by Dr. Sadik what will be the role of the U.S. government or the Chinese government was the question. The answer: The Chinese government at the central and provincial levels would be in charge of coordination in terms of monitoring, guidance, and evaluation. It also points out that the local government; that is, the Chinese government, will be in charge of the actual implementation of project activities at the county level. The UNFPA will not be managing this program, so that it is false and misleading, and I hope Members will take that into consideration.
