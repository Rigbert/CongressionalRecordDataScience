 In the Senate Judiciary Committee, we recently conducted open hearings on the nomination of John G. Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States. We raised this matter with Judge Roberts. I have long believed in sunshine in government. Our democracy works best when our citizens have access to their government. I have supported efforts to make all three branches of our Federal Government more accessible. Except for rare closed sessions, the proceedings Congress and its committees are open to the public and carried live on cable television and radio. In addition, Members and committees are using the Internet and Web sites to make their work available to their constituencies and the general public.
