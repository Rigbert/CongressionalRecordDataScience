President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment, which I strongly support.  I will be brief. Senator Byrd has already described in detail what the amendment does.  It has only been a few weeks since the White House sent us a bill for $87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan. This amendment deals with the $21 billion that the President wants for reconstruction activities in these countries. Of that amount, only $799 million--less than \1/20\th--is for reconstruction in Afghanistan, a country where the standard of living for most people is reminiscent of the Middle Ages.  It is also a country whose former Taliban government harbored Osama bin Laden, and in doing so enabled al-Qaida to plan the attacks of September 11. But for whatever reason, and despite the difficulties and dangers that our troops and our aid workers are facing in Afghanistan, the White House has only asked for a tiny fraction of these supplemental funds to be provided to Afghanistan.  I have looked at what the administration wants this $21 billion for. Much of it makes sense. But there are expenses here unlike any I have seen before in a foreign aid bill.  Let me be clear. We all want to help Iraq. But we also have a duty to protect the taxpayers' money, and this request is extravagant.  Let's look at just a few examples.
