Mr. Chairman, we are discussing the amendment of the gentleman from New York under 1 hour of the rule. The time should be divided equally between the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon) 30 minutes and the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller) 30 minutes, yielding 15 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana; is that correct?
