I used to work for an old fellow in Illinois politics named Cecil Partee, and Cecil said: For every issue in politics, there is a good reason and a real reason. We hear a lot of good reasons on the floor for this McCain amendment and the future of Medicare. The real reason is on the first line of Senator McCain's motion to commit. He says: Send this back to committee and don't touch Medicare Advantage.  I want to ask the Senator from Connecticut about Medicare Advantage, because some of the things I have read around the country about Medicare Advantage tell me this plan, run by private health insurance companies, costs more than basic Medicare. These companies promised us, when they got involved, they would show us how to run a health insurance plan. They would show us how to provide Medicare benefits and they would save us money. Some have. But by and large, if I am not mistaken, isn't the verdict in--a 14-percent increase in cost for Medicare benefits under this Medicare Advantage?
