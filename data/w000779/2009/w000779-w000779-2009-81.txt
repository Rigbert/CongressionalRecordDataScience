President, I am reintroducing the Independence at Home Act together with colleagues in the Senate and the House. Mr. Burr, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Cardin and I are proud to join forces with our House colleagues, Mr. Markey, and his cosponsor, Mr. Smith, to move forward with this important legislation to provide a coordinated team-based approach to primary care for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries in their own homes. Returning to basics like paying doctors for home visits to vulnerable patients, and following them through the course of their illness while saving taxpayers money, is the kind of legislation I am proud to introduce.  The Independence at Home, or IAH, Act comes at the perfect time. The American people and the federal government need to save money on health care, while having more choices and getting better results. This delivery model has a proven track record of doing just this. Similar ``house calls'' programs, currently operating across the country, are reducing costs, improving care quality, and helping people remain independent as long as possible. This delivery model is also providing much needed relief to caregivers who are often juggling a full-time job while caring for their very ill family member. This is medical care Americans want and deserve.  It is not too often that health policy has good outcome results before the pilot program phase begins, but that is exactly the case with the IAH Act. Similar home health delivery models, such as the Veterans Administration's Home-Based Primary Care, Boston, Massachusetts' Urban Medical's House Calls Program, and Portland, Oregon's Housecall Providers have been so successful in improving quality and reducing costs, that our bill guarantees 5 percent savings to Medicare.  These successful home health programs have demonstrated that the optimal way to address the challenges of caring for persons with chronic conditions is to better integrate their care and to work with their caregivers. Medical problems are best managed and coordinated by health care professionals who know their patients, their problems, their medications, and their other health care providers. Using this approach, the Independence at Home Act provides a better, more cost-effective way for Medicare patients with chronic conditions to get the care they need. It further advances Medicare reform by creating incentives for providers to develop better and lower cost health care for the highest cost beneficiaries.  This bipartisan, bicameral bill would create a pilot program to improve in-home care availability for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. This is a win-win for all involved. It will help people remain in their homes for longer periods of time, it will improve the quality of care, and physicians will receive a bundled payment for coordinating this care with a team of healthcare providers.  More specifically, the Independence at Home Act establishes a two-phase three-year Medicare pilot project that uses a patient-centered health care delivery model to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions can remain independent for as long as possible in a comfortable environment. By incorporating lessons from past Medicare demonstration projects and from current home healthmodels, this bill provides for programs that hold providers accountable for quality, mandatory annual minimum savings, and patient satisfaction. Savings are generated by providing better care to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and reducing duplicative and unnecessary services, hospitalization, and other health care costs.  Persons eligible for the program include Medicare beneficiaries with functional impairments, two or more chronic health problems, and recent use of other health services. Each IAH patient will receive a comprehensive assessment at least annually. The assessment will inform a plan for care that is directed by an IAH physician, nurse-practitioner, or physician's assistant. The plan is developed by an IAH plan coordinator in collaboration with the patient and caregiver. Medication management is provided by pharmacists due to their expertise in pharmacology, and electronic medical records and health information technology will be employed to improve patient care and reduce costs.  The two-phase pilot program will take place in the thirteen highest-cost states plus thirteen additional states. After review of Phase I and the evaluation report, the Secretary may elect to expand the program nationwide so it could then become an ongoing benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.  A shared-savings agreement incentive program allows this innovative delivery model to attract and maintain providers. The IAH organization will be required to demonstrate savings of at least 5 percent annually compared with the costs of serving non-participating Medicare chronically ill beneficiaries. The IAH organization may keep 80 percent of savings beyond the required 5 percent savings as an incentive to maximize the financial benefits of being an IAH organization. Any savings beyond 25 percent would be split, with 50 percent directed to the IAH organization and 50 percent to Medicare. In Phase II, the Secretary may modify the payment incentive structure to increase savings to the Medicare Trust Fund only if it will not impede access to IAH services to eligible beneficiaries.  I would like to thank my fellow Senate cosponsors, Richard Burr, Sheldon Whitehouse, and Benjamin Cardin, and my cosponsor in the House, Representative Ed Markey, and his cosponsor, Chris Smith, for their support. I also thank Rahm Emanuel for his support of IAH in the last Congress. I would also like to thank all our staff who worked so hard on this legislation, particularly Gregory Hinrichsen in my office. Finally, I would like to thank the following groups for voicing their support for this legislation: The American Academy of Home Care Physicians; The American Academy of Neurology; The AARP; The Alzheimer's Association; The Alzheimer's Foundation of America; The American Academy of Nurse Practitioners; The American College of Nurse Practitioners; American Academy of Physician Assistants; The American Society of Consultant Pharmacists; The National Family Caregivers Association; The Family Caregiver Alliance/National Center on Caregiving; The American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging; The Housecalls Doctors of Texas; The Maryland-National Capital Home Care Association; The Visiting Nurse Associations of America; Housecall Providers, Inc. of Portland, OR; Intel Corp.; The National Council on Aging; U.S. PIRG; Massachusetts Neurologic Society; Naples Health Care Associates; Urban Medical House Calls of Boston, MA; MD2U Doctors Who Make Housecalls (Louisville, KY); Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to help Medicare patients get better care at lower cost.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows;                                S. 1131       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Independence at Home Act of      2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to the November 2007 Congressional Budget      Office Long Term Outlook for Health Care Spending, unless      changes are made to the way health care is delivered, growing      demand for resources caused by rising health care costs and      to a lesser extent the nation's expanding elderly population      will confront Americans with increasingly difficult choices      between health care and other priorities. However,      opportunities exist to constrain health care costs without      adverse health care consequences.       (2) Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions      account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending      compared to their representation in the overall Medicare      population, and evidence suggests that such patients often      receive poorly coordinated care, including conflicting      information from health providers and different diagnoses of      the same symptoms.       (3) People with chronic conditions account for 76 percent      of all hospital admissions, 88 percent of all prescriptions      filled, and 72 percent of physician visits.       (4) Studies show that hospital utilization and emergency      room visits for patients with multiple chronic conditions can      be reduced and significant savings can be achieved through      the use of interdisciplinary teams of health care      professionals caring for patients in their places of      residence.       (5) The Independence at Home Act creates a chronic care      coordination pilot project to bring primary care medical      services to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with      multiple chronic conditions in their home or place of      residence so that they may be as independent as possible for      as long as possible in a comfortable setting.       (6) The Independence at Home Act generates savings by      providing better, more coordinated care across all treatment      settings to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with      multiple chronic conditions, reducing duplicative and      unnecessary services, and avoiding unnecessary      hospitalizations, nursing home admissions, and emergency room      visits.       (7) The Independence at Home Act holds providers      accountable for improving beneficiary outcomes, ensuring      patient and caregiver satisfaction, and achieving cost      savings to Medicare on an annual basis.       (8) The Independence at Home Act creates incentives for      practitioners and providers to develop methods and      technologies for providing better and lower cost health care      to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with the greatest      incentives provided in the case of highest cost      beneficiaries.       (9) The Independence at Home Act contains the central      elements of proven home-based primary care delivery models      that have been utilized for years by the Department of      Veterans Affairs and ``house calls'' programs across the      country to deliver coordinated care for chronic conditions in      the comfort of a patient's home or place of residence.
