President, I would like to speak briefly about an announcement the administration is making today to increase funding for humanitarian demining programs and appoint a demining czar. This is, of course, on the subject of landmines, which has been a concern of mine for many years. I have not received all the details, but I understand the administration plans to spend $80 million on humanitarian demining programs next year, which is a significant increase over the current level.  They also plan to seek additional support from other governments, corporations, and foundations. Their goal is to raise $1 billion to clear most of the world's landmines by the year 2010. I also understand Ambassador Karl Inderfurth, our Assistant Secretary for South Asia and formerly the U.S. Alternate Representative to the United Nations, is to become the new demining czar.  I can think of no better person to lead this effort than Ambassador Inderfurth. The Ambassador, known as Rick to his friends, is a long-time friend of mine. I have immense respect and admiration for him. I have watched him prowl the halls of the United Nations and buttonhole other representatives, as did Secretary of State Madeleine Albright when she was our U.N. Representative, to get support for an international ban on antipersonnel landmines.  Rick has been a passionate voice for the victims of landmines. I am very grateful that he has agreed to take this on, especially as he already has a full-time job that would be more than enough for most people. He will do a superb job.  This announcement is being made today by Secretaries Albright and Cohen. I commend them both, and I say that it is welcome news.  While its goals sound awfully ambitious, some may say even unrealistic, time will tell. They have my full support. This is an area in which not nearly enough has been done, and the United States has a great deal to offer.  Mr. President, today we clear landmines much the same way that we did in World War II or Korea. It takes an enormous amount of time and it is extremely dangerous. There is very little money, especially as most of these landmines are in the Third World.  Our leadership in this area could help immeasurably. Look what we did after World War II with the tens of millions of landmines spread all over Europe. We cleared most of them in a decade. There are still parts of Europe that have landmines today, but most of them are gone.  The administration's plan builds on what the Congress began some years ago. We established humanitarian demining programs at both the Departments of Defense and State. At the beginning, the Pentagon did not want to do it. They said it was not their mission. They said their job was breaching mine fields, not clearing mines. That is one reason there are so many unexploded landmines killing and maiming innocent people around the world.  What happens, of course, Mr. President, is that the world's militaries leave millions of landmines behind once the wars end, the soldiers go home, the guns are unloaded, the leaders sign the peace agreements, and hands are shaken.  But the landmines stay, and some unsuspecting child or farmer steps on them--a child going to school or someone going to gather water or firewood. Someone trying to raise crops to feed their family. Or an unsuspecting missionary.  There are so many victims, long after anybody even remembers who was fighting whom, or why. There are Russian mines, American mines, Italian mines and mines from other countries in hundreds of varieties in over 68 countries. It is estimated that it would cost, at the rate we are going now, billions of dollars over decades and decades to get rid of them.  Over time, the Pentagon has become more supportive. I hope this new initiative means that they are now fully on board. They have the expertise and technology to make an important contribution. They could cut years, years off the time it would take to demine the world.  Again, as I have said, we are using the same demining technologies that were common years ago. We are not taking advantage of some of the technology and expertise available today. And the demining programs that we now use have been in place for several years have a mixed record. The administration says they have spent some $150 million to date. I wonder how many landmines have been removed for all that money? I suspect if anyone did the arithmetic it would come to hundreds of dollars, possibly even thousands of dollars, to remove each landmine. Of course, the tragic irony of that is that it only costs $3 or $4 to put the landmine in the ground in the first place.  So I suggest, in building on what Secretary Albright and Secretary Cohen said today, that we begin with a top-to-bottom review of our demining efforts. They are too uncoordinated among government agencies. This should include a thorough review of the program that is in the Pentagon itself.  The Pentagon should play a central role, but I am concerned that some Pentagon officials have been more interested in using this program to make contacts with foreign military personnel than to build the sustainable demining capabilities in these other countries. The soldiers we send to do the training in places like Eritrea and Mozambique and other mine-infested countries are among our best, and they do a terrific job. There is no one more proud of them than I am. But we need to be sure that when they leave, the people they have trained have the knowledge and the equipment and the support to carry on.  We have the Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program. This program funds research and development on new demining technologies. This program, again, established by the Congress three years ago, has the potential to revolutionize the way we detect and destroy landmines and other unexploded ordnance.  This may be what enables us to make that quantum leap forward so that instead of taking decades and decades to get rid of the mines, we cut that time substantially. The Pentagon also has a lot to offer in this area, but it has not been fully supportive of it despite the best efforts of the people involved. As one who has spent nearly 10 years working to ban anti-personnel landmines, to support programs to clear mines and care for the victims, I must say that there should be some thought given to moving this program elsewhere or reorganizing it, because there needs to be much more coordination with the private sector and with other governments that are also working in this area.  Mr. President, there is another part of this that needs to be mentioned. Two years ago, the President of the United States went to the United Nations to urge the world's nations to negotiate a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines.  In December, over 110 governments will sign such a treaty in Ottawa. But the United States is not going to be among them. In fact, not only will we be absent, now we find the Pentagon is backtracking on the pledge it made a year ago to find alternatives to anti-personnel landmines.  So taken in this context, it is no surprise that the administration feels it must do something to counter the growing impression around the world that the United States has become an obstacle to an international ban.  Thirteen members of NATO and most of the world's producers and users and exporters of landmines will sign the treaty in Ottawa, but not the world's only superpower. We have taken the position that even though we are the most powerful nation history has ever known, we cannot give up our landmines but we want everybody else to give up theirs. Rather than lead this effort, we risk being left behind with a handful of pariah states with whom we do not belong. We are too great a nation for that.  No one should suggest that a ban is a substitute for demining. There are some 100 million unexploded landmines in the ground, and whether there is a ban or not they will go on maiming and killing until we get rid of them. We have to do that. But neither is demining a substitute for a ban. Why spend billions of dollars to get rid of the mines if they are simply replaced with new mines?  We need to destroy the mines that are in the ground. We need to stop the laying of new mines. Both are necessary to rid the world of these insidious weapons.  So I welcome this initiative. I will do everything I can to support it. But let us not fool themselves. The United States is about to miss a historic opportunity. We should sign the Ottawa treaty, just as we should do everything we can to lead an international demining effort to get rid of the mines in the ground.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's Washington Post, which describes how the Pentagon is walking away from its pledge last May to find alternatives to antipersonnel landmines, a pledge that at the time they said reflected their ``complete agreement'' with the President's goal of an international ban, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 31, 1997] Administration Drops Plans to Find Substitutes for Antipersonnel Mine                            (By Dana Priest)       The Clinton administration has dropped its effort to find      alternatives to a certain type of antipersonnel land mine, a      move that has angered advocates of banning mines who say the      president has retreated from his pledge to find a substitute      for the weapon.       ``There wasn't anything that conceptually made any sense,''      said a high-ranking Defense Department official who declined      to be named. ``And there is no humanitarian need for such an      alternative.''       Caleb Rossiter, director of Demilitarization for Democracy,      which advocates an international land mine ban, said: ``This      is a huge policy change.''       At issue are the millions of antipersonnel land mines used      by U.S. troops to protect anti-tank minefields.       Since May 1996, Clinton has pledged to find alternatives to      all mines this country uses, and the Pentagon has been      studying various approaches. In January, when Clinton      announced he would not sign an international treaty banning      land mines, he directed the Defense Department ``to develop      alternatives to antipersonnel land mines, so that by the year      2003 we can end even the use of self-destruct land mines.''       He also directed the Pentagon to find alternatives to the      mines used on the Korean Peninsula by 2006.       At the same time, Clinton redefined the only type of      antipersonnel land mine used by U.S. troops outside Korea--     mines that are scattered around anti-tank mines to protect      them from being breached by enemy troops. This is called a      ``mixed system'' of anti-tank and antipersonnel mines. The      administration now calls these antipersonnel land mines      ``devices'' and ``submunitions.''       The practical result of this definitional change is that      the Pentagon is no longer actively trying to come up with an      alternative for these mines, of which the United States has      more than 1 million.       ``We are looking for alternatives to the Korean      situation,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``The      mixed packages are not a humanitarian threat.''       The reason the mixed packages are not a humanitarian threat      is because they turn themselves off after a set period of      time, usually three hours. Even so, from May 1996 until this      January, Clinton still wanted to find alternatives to them in      hopes of inducing countries that use the troublesome non-     self-destructing mines to give them up.       Non-self-destructing mines, also known as ``dumb mines,''      are responsible for injuring or killing 25,000 people a year,      many of them civilians.       U.S. negotiators working on the Ottawa treaty tried      unsuccessfully to convince other countries to create an      exemption for the antipersonnel mines used in anti-tank      minefields.       Abandoning the search for alternatives, said Bobby Muller,      president of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation,      would make it impossible for the United States to ever sign      the treaty as it is written.       ``Our bottom line is for the U.S. to sign the treaty,''      said Muller, who also is part of the International Campaign      to Ban Landmines, which won the Nobel Peace Prize this year.      ``We are going to be in his [Clinton's] face. We are not      going away.''       Yesterday the international campaign began airing eight      days of Washington-broadcast television ads aimed at      pressuring Clinton to sign the treaty or to pledge to sign it      at a specified date.
