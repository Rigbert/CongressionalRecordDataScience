 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Does my friend from California, and I will have to ask him to use his own time to answer the question, really feel that it is appropriate that when last year the average American worker saw a 2.8 percent increase in his income, which means that millions of workers in the so-called boom saw a decline in their real wages, do you really think there is something appropriate or right about our economic system when one man saw a $24 billion increase in his income while millions of working people saw a decline in their real wages? This, I should tell my friends, is in the midst of an economic boom.  Do we think it is appropriate that the United States continues to have by far the most unfair distribution of wealth and income in the industrialized world, with the richest 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent? Is this something we are proud of? The fact that we have the highest rate of childhood poverty while millionaires and billionaires in the country proliferate and that this tax bill would only make that gap between the rich and the poor even wider?
