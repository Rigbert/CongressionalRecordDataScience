 President, reserving the right to object, there is no need for a conference when you have an overwhelming bipartisan majority of the Senate in favor of the bill and a bipartisan majority of the House in favor of the same bill that the Senate has already passed. There is no need to go to conference because we know where the majority of the Senate is and we know where the majority of the House is. Why would we want to have a conference when the work the Senate has done, the Rockefeller-Bond bill, is supported by a bipartisan majority in the House? Therefore, I object.
