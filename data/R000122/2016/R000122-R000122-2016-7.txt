President, today I wish to recognize and honor the life and significant accomplishments of Henry Shelton, a tireless advocate for Rhode Island's poorest citizens, who passed away on September 21, 2016. Our world is a better place because Henry was in it, and he will be sorely missed.  Born and raised in Central Falls, RI, Henry served as a priest in Providence, where he began his lifelong fight for those in need. After leaving the priesthood, he led the Coalition for Consumer Justice and founded the Pawtucket-based George Wiley Center, where he served as director for over 30 years. Henry empowered low-income Rhode Islanders to push for social change and policies to alleviate poverty and provide access to basic needs. He truly put the word ``active'' into activism. From protesting in the street to arguing in the courtroom, Henry made a difference in the causes he championed, including securing bus passes for the elderly, working to provide free school breakfast and summer meals for low-income children, and promoting access to unemployment services, to name a few.  Henry Shelton's legacy is perhaps most felt in his work to lower utility costs and to help low-income families with their energy bills so that their heat or electricity was not turned off. New England winters can be particularly brutal. Henry understood that paying utility bills is a real struggle for those who are trying to make ends meet. His mission was to make sure that no one was left out in the cold. He was a vocal supporter of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, which I too have long championed, to provide vital assistance to help low-income households, seniors, and veterans pay their energy bills. Accessing this assistance is not automatic and each year individuals have to prove their eligibility. That takes a lot of work by dedicated individuals on the ground who help people enroll and get the assistance they need. Henry was unrelenting in working for each and every person who needed help.  Henry played this essential role by bringing LIHEAP funds and protections across the finish line. He worked to make sure families understood their rights, could navigate the utility assistance process, and were able to access payment forgiveness plans when needed. Indeed, Henry was such an effective advocate that when Rhode Island State lawmakers passed a bill allowing for a utility payment-forgiveness program for low-income, disabled, and elderly Rhode Islanders, they named it the Henry Shelton Act.  Henry received a number of awards for his work, including the Providence Newspaper Guild's John F. Kiffney community service award, which is given to a Rhode Islander ``whose caring, courage and humor light the way for those who follow,'' and he was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2015. Despite his many accomplishments, Henry was exceptionally humble, never seeking praise or recognition for his work to help others.  I ask that my colleagues join me in remembering Henry Shelton, who was kind, caring, courageous, and passionate about helping and empowering those who were less fortunate. I offer my heartfelt condolences to Mr. Shelton's wife, Carol; his sisters Rosemarie and Catherine; his five children, Joseph, James, Patrick, Eamon, and Caitlin; and grandchildren, Benjamin, Mathew, Henry, Emmett, Frederic, and Felicity. I know that Henry's constant example of good will and selflessness will continue to sustain and inspire his family and all of us.                          ____________________
