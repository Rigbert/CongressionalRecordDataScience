. House of Representatives.  Rob began serving the House of Representatives in 1998 as the Branch Manager and Graphic Artist within House Information Resources (HIR), preparing visual communications for Members of Congress. In 1999 he was promoted to HIR's Director of Client Services, where he managed the COA's centralized, non-partisan technology support team that provides infrastructure support for the entire House of Representatives and the more than 950 district offices across the country.  Rob was selected as the recipient of the 2006 Chief Administrative Officer's Excellence Award for his role managing the Client Services team. Rob has guided the House's technological infrastructure through periods of significant transition and strain. Within his role as manager of the Client Services team Rob has been involved in many milestones and business changing events of the House. They include the House's Y2K transition, the anthrax crisis and September 11th attacks, the House Mobile Computing Project, House Active Directory Project, CAO Seat Management for computers and the House Information Hosting Service.  Rob has served in a nonpartisan role as one of the senior problem solvers for House operations. Blending an artful balance of technical knowledge with compassion and a keen focus on delivering results, he instilled a sense of quality customer service with his teammates that earned him the reputation as a person who gets things done fast, right and always with a smile. Mr. von Gogh served the House and our country with distinction. On behalf of the entire House community, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Rob for his service and years of dedication to the United States House of Representatives.                          ____________________
