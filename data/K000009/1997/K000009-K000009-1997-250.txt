Speaker, I rise today to recall the life of Dr. Robert Jackson of Toledo, OH, a rare and outstanding citizen, a man of letters. In special tribute to his life and work, he will be remembered in a memorial service in Toledo on September 6, 1997. Our dear friend, Bob, died to this life on July 30, 1997 at age 88.  Bob Jackson was a generous and gifted human being, a genuine brother to us all, a confidante, a soulmate. He relished being a trusted political advisor to many including myself. He understood that community involvement requires commitment. Perhaps it was this sense of civic responsibility which prompted him--at age 85--to be the precinct captain for his neighborhood and work hard to get out the vote. He loved politics and he loved being a Democrat. He pondered the endless possibilities presented to each of us as Americans. He mused always with piercing humor about our body politics, its greatness and its foibles.  A voracious reader and devoted educator, Bob Jackson was elected to the Toledo Board of Education and had retired from the mathematics department of the University of Toledo. An Arkansas native, Bob graduated from the University of Oregon, was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, and earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from Harvard University. A complicated man with a boundless sense of humor, he also was a retired naval officer along with being a proud member of the ACLU. While his education and social position could have taken him to elite surroundings, he used his considerable talent to teach youth at Scott High School in Toledo.  Bob and his wife, Agnes, together pursued commitments to causes dear to their hearts, especially to help those whose voices in the public weal were weak. They advocated on behalf of family planning initiatives for which they labored in order that mothers and fathers and children would have a better chance at successful family life, childhood, and adulthood. Even after Agnes' passing, Bob carried on their work. In poignant tribute to his wife, Bob created a living testament to her while at the same time dedicating himself to their mutual love of nature and of neighborhood: he created the Agnes Reynolds Jackson Arboretum, a truly splendid yet tranquil garden setting adjacent to what was their home in an area of grand old homes in the central city. The arboretum is a place to find true beauty and peace, and now stands as a most fitting memorial to both Agnes and Bob, their love for each other and their lives of service.  When his friends and family gather to memorialize Bob Jackson--and remember Agnes as well--we will do so in that arboretum. As we share stories and remembrances, together we will recall and enjoy the legacies left by two who lived spirited lives dedicated to others. How we will miss him as we miss her and know we are privileged to have considered them friends.                          ____________________
