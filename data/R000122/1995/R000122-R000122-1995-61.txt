Chairman, I rise in opposition to the rule before us today. Welfare reform is one of the most important issues we will consider in this Congress, and yet, of the more than 150 amendments filed with the Rules Committee, only 30 amendments have been made in order. And furthermore, most Democratic amendments have been shut out of the debate.  I had filed an amendment, not allowed to be considered under the rule before us today, that would have made the two nutrition block grants more flexible to changing economic conditions within states. My amendment would have established a trigger which would have made States with rising unemployment eligible for increased funding to expand its nutrition programs during economic downturns.  I offered this amendment in markup of the Opportunities Committee, and it has received bipartisan support. In addition, both Republican and Democratic Governors are on record as supporting a block grant trigger.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this restrictive rule.
