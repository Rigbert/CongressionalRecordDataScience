President, Senators should expect the first vote to occur at or about 2:30 p.m. That vote would be in relation to an amendment I will offer relating to bankruptcy.  We were also able to reach an agreement to consider the nomination of Thomas Strickland to be Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife, with up to 3 hours for debate prior to a vote.                          ____________________
