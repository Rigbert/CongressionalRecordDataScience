President, I rise to commemorate the 84th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.  This weekend, members of Armenian communities around the world will gather together to remember the spring morning of April 24, 1915, when the Ottoman Empire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal policy of deportation and murder. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million Armenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another 500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their homeland.  Despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and hardship, the people of the Armenian Republic still suffer today. The peace talks have regrettably made little progress toward the resolution of the Karabagh conflict. Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid to Armenia.  However, the Armenian people look hopefully to the future. Their quest for peace and democracy continues to inspire people around the world. On May 30th, Armenia will again hold democratic elections. Armenians who have emigrated to other countries, especially those in my home state of Rhode Island, bring their traditions with them. They enrich the culture and contribute much to the society of their new homelands.  Although each year's commemoration of the Armenian genocide is important, I believe this year's observance is particularly significant--because of the crisis in Kosovo. Each night the television shows images of hundreds of thousands of refugees forced from their homes and each morning the paper is filled with stories of innocent civilians robbed and killed. These stories and images are heartwrenching--but the people of Kosovo have not been abandoned. The nineteen nations of NATO are united in their resolve that another genocide will not be tolerated.  One of the reasons the world could not stand idly by watching events unfold in the Balkans is because of commemorations like the observance of the Armenian Genocide. We must stand as witnesses to protect those who are persecuted because they are different. We must remain vigilant as long as hate and intolerance exist in our world.  Menk panav chenk mornar. Thank you, Mr. President.                          ____________________
