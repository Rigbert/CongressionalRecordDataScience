President, I am very pleased to join with my Senate colleagues from Vermont and New York as we reintroduce the Lake Champlain Heritage Act of 2003. Last year, we took a significant step in helping all Americans better appreciate Lake Champlain with the passage of Daniel Patrick Moynihan Lake Champlain Basin Program Act. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to the continuing preservation of Lake Champlain's important historic sites and artifacts.  The role of Lake Champlain cannot be overlooked. From the earliest human habitation 10,000 years ago, to the Revolutionary War and the conduct of trade in the 19th and 20th centuries, this 120-mile-long basin has played a pivotal role in the Course of American history.  It was on Lake Champlain that Benedict Arnold's motley group of 15 American ships engaged a much larger and far superior British fleet in the Battle at Valcour Island. While the battle ended in a loss for the Americans, it successfully delayed the British fleet and became known as one of the most crucial engagements of the American Revolution.  This act is intended to promote and preserve these centuries of struggle in the Lake Champlain Valley. It will advance the cultural heritage goals of ``Opportunities for Action,'' a comprehensive pollution prevention, control, and restoration plan developed by the Lake Champlain Basin Program. And it will also promote such things as locally planned and managed heritage networks and a management strategy for the lake's underwater cultural resources. With the 400th anniversary of Samuel De Champlain's arrival in the valley coming up in 2009, this bill could not be more needed.  Vermonters and New Yorkers have a serious responsibility to preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the Lake Champlain Valley for future generations. Local communities on both sides of the lake have helped us develop a bold vision to enhance the conservation, interpretation, and enjoyment of our shared history. We can help revitalize local economies, promote heritage tourism, and improve the valley's cultural legacy by making additional resources available to communities and organizations through the Lake Champlain Basin Program.  It is with great pride that I stand here today with my colleagues fromVermont and New York to reassert our partnership for Champlain Valley National Heritage Act and continue our cooperative effort to conserve, interpret, and honor our common heritage.                                 ______                                       By
