President, America's founders recognized and valued the creativity of this Nation's citizens such that intellectual property rights are rooted in the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 8 of the Constitution states that ``The Congress shall have power * * * [t]o promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' The Continental Congress proclaimed, ``Nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his study.''  Protecting intellectual property rights is just as important today as it was when America was a fledgling nation.  It is for this reason I am pleased that the Senate is considering H.R. 2265, the ``No Electronic Theft [NET] Act of 1997.'' I introduced the first legislation on this subject in 1995. The bill was the ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995,'' and it stood as the only legislation on this issue in the 104th Congress. I then made some changes to that bill and introduced it this session as the ``Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997,'' S. 1044. Senator Kyl is an original cosponsor of S. 1044 and I thank him for his support.  Like the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1997, the NET Act of 1997 would close a significant loophole in our copyright law and enhance the Government's ability to bring criminal charges in certain cases of willful copyright infringement. By insuring better protection of the creative works available online, this bill will also encourage the continued growth of the Internet and our National Information Infrastructure. It will encourage the ingenuity of the American people, and will send a powerful message to intellectual property pirates and thieves that we will not tolerate theft.  For a criminal prosecution under current copyright law, a defendant's willful copyright infringement must be ``for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain.'' Not-for-profit or noncommercial copyright infringement is not subject to criminal law enforcement, no matter how egregious the infringement or how great the loss to the copyright holder. This presents an enormous loophole in criminal liability for willful infringers who can use digital technology to make exact copies of copyrighted software and other digitally encoded works, and then use computer networks for quick, inexpensive and mass distribution of pirated, infringing works. The NET Act would close this legal loophole.  United States versus LaMacchia, 871 F. Supp. 535 (D. Mass. 1994), is an example of the problem this criminal copyright bill would fix. In that case, the defendant had set up computer bulletin board systems on the Internet. Users posted and downloaded copyrighted software programs. This resulted in an estimated loss to the copyright holders of over $1 million over a 6-week period. Since the defendant apparently did not profit from the software piracy, the Government could not prosecute him under criminal copyright law and instead charged him with wire fraud. The District Court described the student's conduct ``at best * * * as irresponsible, and at worst as nihilistic, self-indulgent, and lacking in any fundamental sense of values.''  Nevertheless, the Court dismissed the indictment in LaMacchia because it viewed copyright law as the exclusive authority for prosecuting criminal copyright infringement. The Court expressly invited Congress to revisit the copyright law and make any necessary adjustments, stating:       Criminal as well as civil penalties should probably attach      to willful, multiple infringements of copyrighted software      even absent a commercial motive on the part of the infringer.      One can envision ways that the copyright law could be      modified to permit such prosecution. But, ``[i]t is the      legislature, not the Court which is to define a crime, and      ordain its punishment.''  I introduced the Criminal Copyright Improvement Act of 1995 on August 4, 1995 in response to this problem. The NET Act is the result of our efforts. It would ensure redress in the future for flagrant, willful copyright infringements in the following ways: First, it amends the term ``financial gain'' as used in the Copyright Act to include ``receipt, or expectation of receipt, or anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.'' This revision would make clear that ``financial gain'' includes bartering for, and the trading of, pirated software.  Second, it amends Section 506(a) of the Copyright Act to provide that any person who infringes a copyright willfully by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of one or more copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works with a total retail value of more than $1,000, shall be subject to criminal liability.  A misdemeanor offense under the bill is defined as an offense in which an individual reproduces or distributes one or more copies or phonorecords of one or more copyrighted works with a total value of more than $1,000.  The felony threshold under the bill is defined as an offense in which an individual reproduces or distributes 10 or more copies of phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works with a total retail value of $2,500 or more.  Section (2)(b) of the bill clarifies that for purposes of subsection 506(a) of the Copyright Act only, ``willful infringement'' requires more than just evidence of making an unauthorized copy of a work. This clarification was included to address the concerns expressed by libraries and Internet access to services because the standard of ``willfulness'' for criminal copyright infringement is not statutorily defined and the court's interpretation have varied somewhat among the Federal circuits.  This clarification does not change the current interpretation of the word ``willful'' as developed by case law and as applied by the Department of Justice, nor does it change the definition of ``willful'' as it is used elsewhere in the Copyright Act.  Third, the bill requires that any criminal proceeding brought under the Copyright Act must commence within 5 years from the time the cause of action arose. The current limit, as contained in section 507(a) of the Copyright Act, is 3 years. This brings copyright crimes into conformance with the statute of limitations for other criminal acts under title 18 of the United States Code.  Fourth, the bill would insert new subsections in title 18 of the United States Code requiring that victims of offenses concerning unauthorized fixation and trafficking of live musical performances and victims of offenses concerning trafficking in counterfeit goods or services be given the opportunity to provide a victim impact statement to the probation officer preparing the presentence report. The bill directs that the statement identify the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered, including the estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim.  The NET Act reflects the recommendations and hard work of the Department of Justice and the Copyright Office. Specifically, Scott Charney and David Green of the Department of Justice and Marybeth Peters, Shira Perlmutter, and Jule Sigall of the Copyright Office helped me on this legislation. The Department of Justice and the Copyright Office provided valuable input as far back as 3 years ago, when I introduced the first legislation on this subject, and they have worked with me through the drafting of this year's Senate bill and with me and all the interested parties on this year's House version to ensure that the final product was one that could be widely accepted. In fact, just today the Senate received a letter from the Department of Justice providing its views on the NET Act and strongly supporting the enactment of this legislation.  I also want to thank Mr. Hyde, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Coble, Mr. Frank, and Mr. Goodlatte for their fine work on this matter.  By passing this legislation, we send a strong message that we value intellectual property, as abstract and arcane as it may be, in the same way that we value the real and personal property of our citizens. Just as we will not tolerate the theft of software, CD's, books, or movie cassettes from a store, so will we not permit the stealing of intellectual property over the Internet.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2265, and I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. Department of Justice dated November 7, 1997, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 1997.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman, This provides the views of the      Department of Justice on H.R. 2265, the ``No Electronic Theft      (NET) Act,'' which was passed by the House of Representatives      on November 4, 1997, and which we understand may shortly be      considered in the Senate. We strongly support enactment of      this legislation.       As introduced, H.R. 2265 built upon, and closely resembled,      S. 1044 and its predecessor bill that was introduced in the      104th Congress. The Department of Justice testified in      support of H.R. 2265 while the bill was being considered by      the House Judiciary Committee. We worked extensively with the      bill's sponsors to ensure that it would meet the concerns of      interested parties, including the Department of Justice, the      copyright community, and those non-profit organizations and      Internet Service Providers concerned about the possibility      that the new legislation might sweep too broadly. The result,      in our view, is an excellent bill that protects copyrights in      the digital age in a careful and balanced manner. The House-     passed bill accomplishes several important goals, including:       Permitting the Department to prosecute large-scale illegal      reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works where the      infringers act without a discernible profit motive, while      making clear that small-scale non-commercial copying      (copyrighted works with a total retail value of less than      $1,000) is not prosecutable under federal law;       Clarifying that ``willful'' infringement must consist of      evidence of more that the mere intentional reproduction or      distribution of copyrighted products;       Defining ``financial gain'' to include the ``receipt, or      expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the      receipt of other copyrighted works,'' to ensure that persons      who illegally traffic in copyrighted works by using barter      rather than cash are covered by the statute;       Clarifying that ``reproduction or distribution'' includes      electronic as well as tangible means;       Extending the statute of limitations from three to five      years, bringing the criminal copyright statute into line with      most other criminal statutes;       Establishing a recidivist provision that raises penalties      for second or subsequent felony copyright offenses;       Recognizing victims' rights by allowing the producers of      pirated works to provide a victim impact statement to the      sentencing court; and       Enhancing the deterrent power of the copyright criminal      laws by directing the Sentencing Commission to amend the      Sentencing guideline for copyright and trademark infringement      to allow courts to impose sentence based on the retail value      of the good infringed upon, rather than the often lower value      of the infringing good.       The Department of Justice believes that the differences      between S. 1044, as introduced, and H.R. 2265, as passed by      the House of Representatives, are not significant. We      therefore recommend that the Senate expedite final passage of      this important piece of legislation by adopting the House-     passed bill before the end of the first session of the 105th      Congress.       Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of      additional assistance in connection with this or any other      matter. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that      there is no objection from the standpoint of the      Administration's program to the presentation of this report.           Sincerely,                                                      Andrew Fois,                                       Assistant Attorney General.
