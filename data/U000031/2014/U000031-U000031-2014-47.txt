Speaker, today I rise in support of five bipartisan public health bills that will help individuals with traumatic brain injuries, newborns, burn patients, and those with autism. The Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, under the leadership of Rep. Joe Pitts, has been a workhorse that boasts an outstanding record of bipartisan accomplishment on legislation that truly touches people's lives. With a number of bills alreadysigned into law, and these under consideration this evening, the 113th Congress is shaping up to be known as the public health Congress.  I would like to take this opportunity to highlight each of the five bills before us this evening.  H.R. 1098, the Traumatic Brain Injury Reauthorization Act, would address a problem that affects millions of Americans, including both veterans and children. Introduced by Mr. Pascrell, this bill would assist states in developing and expanding service delivery capacity for individuals with a traumatic brain injury. According to some estimates, the economic burden of such injuries is more than $70 billion, and the physical and emotional toll endured by patients and their families is even more burdensome. This bill would help alleviate the problems associated with this unique and complex health problem, providing peace of mind to families across the country.  H.R. 1281, the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act, introduced by Reps. Roybal-Allard and Simpson, funds grants to allow states to expand their newborn screening programs, educate parents and health care providers, and improve follow-up care for infants diagnosed with a condition. Before the first passage of this bill in 2008, the number and quality of newborn screening tests varied from state to state. Today, with guidelines created by the bill, screenings reach 4 million babies in the United States every year. Reauthorization will continue this important program and encourage more timely efforts to identify diseases, such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and ensure best practices. Early screening and diagnosis often means better disease management and better outcomes for these children.  H.R. 3548, the Improving Trauma Care Act, introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee member Rep. Bill Johnson, is designed to correct the inconsistencies in the definitions of trauma that have resulted in gaps in care and coverage. This bill will help important trauma centers like Bronson Methodist Hospital's Burn Center in Kalamazoo, Michigan to better care for their patients.  We will also consider H.R. 4080, the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization. Introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee members Dr. Burgess and Rep. Green, the bill reauthorizes two programs related to the planning and development of regional emergency care. Both of these programs will improve trauma care so that Americans can promptly receive specialized, life-saving treatment after a traumatic injury.  Finally we will consider H.R. 4631, the Autism CARES Act of 2014, introduced and championed by Reps. Chris Smith and Mike Doyle. The sad reality is that in the United States, autism now affects 1 in 68 children and can cost a family approximately $60,000 annually. H.R. 4631 continues autism-related research, early identification and intervention, education, and the activities of the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee. It also asks the Secretary of Health and Human Services to collaborate with other federal agencies to prepare and submit a report concerning young adults with autism spectrum disorder and the challenges related to their transition into adulthood. Finally, the research funded by this legislation also permits diagnosing and intervening earlier and thus help improve the quality of life for children with autism.  This bill is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Autism Society, and the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which includes over thirty different organizations including Autism Speaks, the Autism National Committee, and the Council for Learning Disabilities.  We began our day in a bipartisan manner advancing the 21st Century Cures initiative and I am pleased to conclude the day by continuing our efforts to advance legislation to improve the public health. It is through these bills and this initiative that we can truly have an impact on the lives of all Americans.  I urge my colleagues to support these bills.                          ____________________
