 President, I rise to speak in opposition to the Grassley amendment to the fiscal year 1997 budget request.  The budget provides the Congress with a framework in which it must work. By overly restricting the margins of that framework, we eliminate our ability to make the broad budget decisions necessary to meet our future defense needs. Senate Concurrent Resolution 57 preserves the Senate's flexibility to consider funding for those programs in the defense budget that should be eliminated and to make increases based on military evaluations and needs for the future.  The level of funding the President requested this year has been questioned by many individuals, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili and the service Chiefs. We need the flexibility in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution to consider the additions these leaders of our Armed Forces have requested and accept or reject them on their own merits, not through a sweeping budget cut.
