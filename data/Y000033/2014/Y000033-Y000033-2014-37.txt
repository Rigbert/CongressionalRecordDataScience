Mr. Speaker, I can only compliment the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) for his work on this legislation, and it is a practical solution to a problem. Again, I agree with him.  I hope that there is an expedited process which we can fulfill our obligations to this lodge owner and, of course, the intent of the act itself and that the Congress had intended so this could continue.  I yield back the balance of my time.
