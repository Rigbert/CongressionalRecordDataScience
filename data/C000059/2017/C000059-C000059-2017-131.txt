Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an extraordinary man, Joseph John ``Joe'' Carvalho. Joseph passed away on May 22, 2017 at the age of 88. A resident of Hacienda Heights, California, he was a pillar of the community and will be deeply missed.  Joe was born on June 3, 1928, in Tiverton, Rhode Island and grew up in North Dighton, Massachusetts. He served in the Navy for two years and obtained the rank of Engineerman Third Class while working in a POW camp in World War II. In 1951, he enrolled in the Massachusetts Maritime Academy where he received his degree in Marine Engineering. Upon graduation, he served with the Merchant Marines for two years.  Joe married the love of his life Audrey Enos on November 21, 1953. They moved to California and welcomed the birth of their children: Catherine, Cynthia, Barry, Pamela, and Janet. He worked for the Department of Water and Power for 33 years as an Electrical Engineer. At 55, Joe retired and worked for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics Organizing Committee while also maintaining his own real estate business. He was a founding member of Saint John Vianney Parish and was a dedicated usher and volunteer. He was a dedicated Red Sox fan and was able to see his dreams realized with the 2004, 2007, and 2013 World Series Championships. Joe's greatest joy was his family. He became known as Poppi to his five grandchildren: Danielle, Tara, Nicole, Hope Willard, and Brennan Carvalho, and two great grandchildren: Emma and Quinn Massari.  On Friday, May 26, 2017, a memorial honoring Joe's extraordinary life will be held in Hacienda Heights, CA. Joe will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, contributions to the community and love of family. His dedication to his family, work, and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Joe's family and friends. Although Joe may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
