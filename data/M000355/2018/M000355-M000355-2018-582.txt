 President, on one final matter, it has been a rough week for our Democratic colleagues who claim that the Republican policy agenda wouldn't lay a good foundation for a strong economy, but it has been a great week for America's workers and middle-class families.  The evidence keeps piling up. Tax reform and regulatory reform have helped create the conditions for one of the best economic moments the American people have seen in recent memory, and some measures are at their best levels in decades.  Here is just a small sample:  ``U.S. job growth accelerated in August and wages notched their largest annual increase in more than nine years.''  Another headline reads: ``Job openings hit record high.''  Another: ``Small business optimism surges to highest level ever.''  This economy is literally flying through all-time records faster than I can come to the floor and discuss them. Many of these numbers are unprecedented. They are exactly the opposite of what some gloom-and-doom Democrats insisted would happen if this unified Republican government put our opportunity agenda into effect.  Fortunately, my Republican colleagues and I know that getting Washington, DC, out of the way helps make good things happen for the American people, and that is exactly what we will continue to do.                          ____________________
