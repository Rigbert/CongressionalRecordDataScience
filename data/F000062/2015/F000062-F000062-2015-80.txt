 I appreciate it.  The Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee also received a misleading increase in its allocation. While the Subcommittee received an extra $965 million on paper, it actually needed $1.1 billion just to account for last year's credit from the Toyota settlement that is no longer available this year. As a result, the subcommittee was forced to cut numerous important programs below last year's levels.  They include the U.S. Marshals Service, which was cut by $141 million; legal representation for immigrant children, reduced by $55 million; and Federal assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies, cut by $139 million.  Here is my conclusion. My good friend and colleague Senator Alexander is rightly proud of the work he and his staff have put into the Energy and Water bill, and, as I said, it is a good bill.  I sincerely wish the circumstance we find ourselves in today were different. Those of us on this side of the aisle should have a voice in what happens and how we can solve this problem.  So what I plead for is, in these negotiations that are starting, by Leader McConnell, to move ahead, let's get it started and let's stop the CRs, let's stop the omnibuses, and let's stop the fights over the debt limit and shutting down the government. Let's go back to an appropriations process that this country did well by and that worked.  I thank the Presiding Officer for his forbearance, and I yield the floor.
