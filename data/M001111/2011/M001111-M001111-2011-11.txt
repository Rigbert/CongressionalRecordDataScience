 President, I recognize the incredible impact of the disasters in your States and other States across the country this year and agree that CDBG is an effective tool in helping aid recovery efforts. The Senators from North Dakota and the Senator from Vermont have been strong advocates for this badly needed assistance. I pledge to work with them to ensure that communities impacted by this year's disasters have the support they need to recover.
