President, I want to speak about a matter of urgency and extreme concern to me that is going on right now in Uganda.  As my colleagues may know, I have spent much time in Africa, particularly in Uganda, talking with President Museveni.  The major issue that he and I discussed is the ongoing terrorist tragedy in his country. The Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, is a rebel paramilitary group formed in 1987 operating mainly in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. The group is engaged in an armed rebellion against the UgandanGovernment in what is now one of Africa's longest-running conflicts.  It is led by a man named Joseph Kony who claims to be a spiritual medium and uses his influence to kidnap and murder thousands of innocent civilians, most of them children. Because of this twisted man and his army, the region has become one of the darkest spots of human atrocities worldwide.  Between 20,000 and 50,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA for use as soldiers and sex slaves.  More than 1.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes, living in Internally Displaced People, IDP, camps. Every week 1,000 people die in the camps from the appalling conditions.  Though the Internally Displaced People camps were meant to provide security against the LRA attacks, they are now where most abductions take place.  It is estimated 40,000 children flee every night to bigger towns, seeking the safety in numbers, sleeping on street corners and in other public spaces. I recently saw a documentary on this titled ``Invisible Children.''  Up to 200,000 people have been killed in the violence, with many more dying from disease and malnutrition as a direct result of the conflict.  The conflict continues to retard Uganda's development efforts, costing the poor country's economy a cumulative total of at least $1.33 billion, which is equivalent to 3 percent of Uganda's GDP.  Last night, in his State of the Union address, President Bush declared we must, ``take the offensive by encouraging economic progress, and fighting disease, and spreading hope in hopeless lands.'' He is absolutely right. We can no longer allow these atrocities in Uganda to go unnoticed and unaddressed; we must become more involved.  To that end I am supporting a resolution, S. Res. 366.  Further, I will include for the Record a letter to Secretary of State Rice signed by 34 organizations. This letter urges high-level attention to the situation in northern Uganda.  I will also include the text of United Nations Security Council, UNSC, Resolution 1653 dated January 27, 2006. This resolution ``strongly condemns'' the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army. The Resolution also reiterates the Security Council's demand ``that all such armed groups lay down their arms and engage voluntarily and without any delay or preconditions in their disarmament and in their repatriation and resettlement.''  UNSC Resolution 1653 ``[r]equests the Secretary-General to make recommendations to the Council, as appropriate, on how best to support efforts by States in the region to put an end to the activities of illegal armed groups, and to recommend how United Nations agencies and missions--the United Nations Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), MONUC and ONUB--can help, including through further support for the efforts of the governments concerned to ensure protection of, and humanitarian assistance to, civilians in need.''  These words are long overdue, and are only the beginning. Thus far the action of the United Nations has been woefully inadequate. Words are not nearly enough. We need more action from the UN. If the United Nations is to be useful for the peoples of the world, this sort of problem is its highest and best use.  As for the role of the United States, I suggest that Secretary Rice and Permanent Representative Bolton actively engage in drafting the aforementioned recommendations to the Security Council.  I also strongly suggest to President Bush and our administration that they examine every aspect of his executive authority to relieve this suffering, including the new authorities Congress provided under Section 1206 of Public Law 109-163, the train-and-equip legislation.  I believe these will be significant steps toward shedding light into the darkness that has cloaked the ongoing Ugandan tragedy, ending the conflict, and drawing the region into a positive future. I ask members for their support and thank the dozens of Senators who have joined me as cosponsors of this bipartisan resolution.  Let us pray for a cessation of the horrors and evils in Uganda and the Sudan.  I ask unanimous consent to print the above-referenced documents in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 January 30, 2006.     Re Crisis in Northern Uganda     Dr. Condoleezza Rice,     Secretary of State, Department of State,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rice: We, the undersigned organizations call      on the U.S. government to dedicate high-level attention to      the situation in northern Uganda in order to help bring an      end to the intractable conflict and catastrophic humanitarian      conditions.       As you know, for the past 20 years, the people of northern      Ugandan have endured a conflict involving the rebel Lord's      Resistance Army (LRA) and the Government of Uganda. More than      1.7 million people--eighty percent of the population--are      displaced and forced to live in squalid internally displaced      persons (IDP) camps. These camps remain largely unprotected      and vulnerable to LRA attacks and abductions. The LRA has      kidnapped more than 30,000 children from their homes--holding      them hostage as soldiers, sex slaves, and bondservants. An      estimated 35,000 children commute nightly to sleep in town      centers in order to avoid violence and abduction.      Nonetheless, these children, known as ``night commuters'',      remain vulnerable to exploitation and sexual and physical      abuse.       This deplorable humanitarian and human rights situation is      the result of an ongoing conflict that continues to be a      cause of instability in southern Sudan and, now, the broader      Great Lakes. Threats to regional security are growing: the      LRA has expanded its area of operation deeper into southern      Sudan and, for the first time, into the Democratic Republic      of the Congo (DRC). LRA attacks against southern Sudanese      civilians threaten implementation of the Comprehensive Peace      Agreement (CPA), and recent LRA incursions into the DRC have      heightened existing tensions between the Ugandan and      Congolese governments. Within this context of increasing      regional instability, multiple actors regrettably continue to      provide covert support to the LRA.       Establishing a secure environment requires urgent      leadership from the U.S. Government to put in place a      comprehensive regional approach that addresses LRA cross-     border movements and prioritizes a resolution to the      conflict, while simultaneously ensuring civilian protection,      humanitarian access, and the reintegration of former      combatants. To reduce civilian suffering, help consolidate      peace in Sudan, and prevent further destabilization of the      region, our organizations recommend the following actions:                 United Nations Security Council Action       The continued presence of the Lord's Resistance Army in      southern Sudan and its recent expansion into the DRC      underscores the urgency for United Nations Security Council      (UNSC) engagement. Under Secretary-General Jan Egeland's      December 19, 2005 briefing on the humanitarian situation and      the passage of UNSC Res. 1653 are welcome first steps towards      engaging the Security Council on this issue, but greater      action is required. We urge the US to take a leadership role      at the United Nations to place northern Uganda on the UNSC      agenda. The February 2006 US presidency of the UNSC would be      an opportune time to galvanize action on this important      issue. Specifically, the UN should do the following:       Continued encouragement and support for a regional solution      to disarming groups within eastern DRC, Uganda, and southern      Sudan. With the UNMIS mandate up for renewal in March, the      United States should call on all relevant actors to      accelerate the deployment of UNMIS and ensure that threats to      civilians and disruption of humanitarian aid addresses the      destabilizing presence of the LRA. Continued consideration      should be given to the recommendations of the regional      Tripartite Commission on Disarming groups in eastern DRC.       Appoint a Special UN Envoy for Northern Uganda who will      work collaboratively with all local, regional, and      international stakeholders to help mediate between all      parties to end the conflict.       Create a panel of experts to investigate and monitor the      activities of the LRA, as well as the networks supporting the      LRA, and its impact on regional peace and security.       Call on all parties to declare an immediate ceasefire;      encourage greater international diplomatic and financial      support for on-going mediation efforts, while ensuring a      coordinated response to LRA activity in the area.       Call on the government of Uganda, in accordance with its      national IDP policy, to adopt a security strategy that      focuses on protection rather than confrontation, prioritizes      civilian and aid convoy protection, and holds protection      personnel accountable for crimes they commit.                   Direct U.S. Support for Mediation       After 20 years of conflict, military victory is unlikely.      Recent overtures made by the LRA leadership to negotiate are      promising and greater international political pressure on all      parties is needed to explore a peaceful solution.      Approximately ninety percent of the LRA is comprised of      children; further military aggression against the LRA only      serves to inflict more violence upon these     children. Former Ugandan Government Minister Betty Bigombe's      mediation efforts deserve greater U.S. support. Accordingly,      we strongly recommend that the State Department appoint a      senior level advisor to coordinate efforts within the U.S.      government, among the donors, and ensure that greater      resources and material support are available for Bigombe as a      negotiation strategy is developed.           Protection for Civilians and Humanitarian Workers       Efforts to protect civilians have languished and high-level      involvement by the international community is needed. Eighty      percent of the population is displaced and primarily      dependent on limited international food assistance and      services. The delegation of civilian protection and      humanitarian worker security to local defense units (LDUs)      both hinders humanitarian access and leaves IDPs vulnerable      to LRA attacks. For example, at times LDU personnel have been      inebriated while escorting humanitarian agencies, or      sometimes have refused to provide escort unless provided with      food. This gap in protection significantly hinders relief      efforts and the population's ability to access employment,      basic healthcare and education. Through US leadership, donor      governments must work with the Ugandan government to devise a      security strategy that prioritizes civilian protection      instead of confrontational operations. This strategy must      expand the area of protection around IDP camps to allow for      greater civilian movement, so that the displaced can gain      access to basic services and income generating opportunities.     Disarmament, Demobilization & Reintegration (DDR) Enhancement       In coordination with the government of Uganda, donors must      develop and enact a comprehensive plan to draw LRA fighters      out of this conflict and back into the community. Donors must      provide adequate funding for DDR, including support for      communities and children abducted by the LRA.       To conclude, we firmly believe that high-level engagement      and sustained leadership by the United States will help bring      an end to this conflict, which traps millions of children and      families in despair and threatens ongoing peaceful      transitions in Sudan and the DRC. We look forward to hearing      from you about the Administration's plans to address this      conflict.

            ____Resolution 1653 (2006)--Adopted by the United Nations Security Council                at Its 5359th Meeting, on 27 January 2006       The Security Council, Recalling its resolutions and the      statements by its President on the Great Lakes region of      Africa and concerning the situation in the Democratic      Republic of the Congo and in Burundi, and in particular

prevention and resolution of armed conflict,      particularly in Africa,       Further recalling its resolution 1631 (2005) on cooperation      between the United Nations and regional organizations and      General Assembly resolution 59/213 (2004) on cooperation      between the United Nations and the African Union,       Reaffirming its respect for the sovereignty, territorial      integrity, unity and political independence of all States in      the region, and recalling the importance of the principles of      good-neighbourliness, non-interference and cooperation in the      relations among States in the region,       Reiterating its condemnation of the genocide in Rwanda of      1994 and the armed conflicts which have plagued the Great      Lakes region of Africa in the past decade and expressing its      profound concern at the violations of human rights and      international humanitarian law resulting in wide scale loss      of life, human suffering and destruction of property,       Aware that the link between the illegal exploitation of      natural resources, the illicit trade in those resources and      the proliferation and trafficking of arms is one of the      factors fuelling and exacerbating conflicts in the Great      Lakes region of Africa, and especially in the Democratic      Republic of the Congo,       Expressing its deep concern at the devastating impact of      conflict and insecurity on the humanitarian situation      throughout the Great Lakes region and their implications for      regional peace and security, especially where arms and armed      groups move across borders, such as the long-running and      brutal insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in      northern Uganda which has caused the death, abduction and      displacement of thousands of innocent civilians in Uganda,      the Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo,       Welcoming the efforts undertaken by the Tripartite Plus      Joint Commission comprising Burundi, the Democratic Republic      of the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda as a significant contribution      to heightened dialogue between the countries of the Great      Lakes,       Recalling its previous resolutions that reaffirmed the      importance of holding an international conference on peace,      security and stability in the Great Lakes region and      recognizing the

    Dar es Salaam Declaration of 2004 adopted by the first Summit      of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region,       Recognizing the significant achievements and progress in      the peace processes in the Great Lakes region, the recent      installation of a democratically elected government in      Burundi and progress in the transition to democratic      institutions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,       Expressing its gratitude to the United Nations Organization      Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) and      to the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) for their      significant contribution to peace in the region,       Paying tribute to the donor community for the assistance it      is providing to the countries in the region, and encouraging      it to maintain that assistance,       Welcoming General Assembly resolution 60/1 on the 2005      World Summit Outcome and in particular the commitment to      address the special needs of Africa,       1. Commends the positive role played by the Secretary-     General, the African Union, the Group of Friends of the Great      Lakes region and other stakeholders in organizing and      participating in the First Summit of the International      Conference on Peace, Security, Democracy and Development in      the Great Lakes Region of Africa;       2. Urges the countries of the Great Lakes region to      continue in their collective efforts to develop a subregional      approach for promoting good relations, peaceful coexistence,      peaceful resolution of disputes as envisaged in the Dar es      Salaam Declaration and encourages them, in partnership with      the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and other      stakeholders, to finalize the preparations for the second      Summit to be held in Nairobi, including a clear focus on      peace and security issues, with a view to adopting a      Security, Stability and Development Pact for the countries of      the Great Lakes region;       3. Calls upon the countries of the region to agree on      confidence-building measures based on effective and concrete      actions;       4.

Expresses its support for the efforts by States in the      region to build independent and reliable national judicial      institutions in order to put an end to impunity;       8. Strongly condemns the activities of militias and armed      groups operating in the Great Lakes region such as the Forces      Democratiques de Liberation du Rwanda (FDLR), the Palipehutu-     Forces Nationales de Liberation (FNL) and the Lord's      Resistance Army (LRA) which continue to attack civilians and      United Nations and humanitarian personnel and commit human      rights abuses against local populations and threaten the      stability of individual States and the region as a whole and      reiterates its demand that all such armed groups lay down      their arms and engage voluntarily and without any delay or      preconditions in their disarmament and in their repatriation      and resettlement;       9. Stresses the need for the States in the region, within      their respective territories, to     disarm, demobilize and cooperate in the repatriation or      resettlement, as appropriate, of foreign armed groups and      local militias, and commends in this regard the robust action      of MONUC, acting in accordance with its mandate, in support      of the Forces Armees de la Republique Democratique du Congo      (FARDC) in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the      Congo;       10. Underscores that the governments in the region have a      primary responsibility to protect their populations,      including from attacks by militias and armed groups and      stresses the importance of ensuring the full, safe and      unhindered access of humanitarian workers to people in need      in accordance with international law;       11. Calls upon all States in the region to deepen their      cooperation with a view to putting an end to the activities      of illegal armed groups, and underlines that these States      must abide by their obligations under the Charter of the      United Nations to refrain from the threat or use of force      against the territorial integrity or political independence      of their neighbours;       12. Urges the international community, non-governmental      organizations and civil society to increase humanitarian      assistance to civilians affected by displacements and      violence from years of protracted conflicts in the Great      Lakes region;       13. Commends the efforts of the United Nations Organization      Missions in the region in accordance with their respective      mandates, to protect civilians, including humanitarian      personnel, to enable delivery of humanitarian aid and to      create the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of      refugees and internally displaced persons;       14. Requests the Secretary-General to make recommendations      to the Council, as appropriate, on how best to support      efforts by States in the region to put an end to the      activities of illegal armed groups, and to recommend how      United Nations agencies and missions--the United Nations      Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS), MONUC and ONUB--can help,      including through further support for the efforts of the      governments concerned to ensure protection of, and      humanitarian assistance to, civilians in need;       15. Calls upon the countries of the region to continue in      their efforts to create conducive conditions for voluntary      repatriation, safe and durable integration of refugees and      former combatants in their respective countries of origin. In      this regard, calls for commensurate international support for      refugees and reintegration and reinsertion of returnees,      internally displaced persons and former combatants;       16. Calls upon the countries of the region to reinforce      their cooperation with the Security Council's Committee and      with the Group of Experts established by resolution 1533      (2004) in enforcing the arms embargo in the Democratic      Republic of the Congo and to combat cross-border trafficking      of illicit small arms, light weapons and illicit natural      resources as well as the movement of combatants, and      reiterates its demand that the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda,      the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi take      measures to prevent the use of their respective territories      in support of the activities of armed groups present in the      region;       17.

Decides to remain seized of the matter.
