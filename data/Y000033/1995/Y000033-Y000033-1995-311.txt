Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on International Relations and its subcommittees be permitted to sit tomorrow while the House is meeting in the Committee of the Whole under the 5-minute rule.  It is my understanding the minority has been consulted and there is no objection to this request.
