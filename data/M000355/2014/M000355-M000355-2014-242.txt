 President, today is an important day. It is the last day of the so-called comment period when Americans can officially register their opinions on the IRS's latest effort to suppress free speech. So far, nearly 100,000 comments have come through--100,000. Nearly every one I have seen is opposed.  Just to put things in perspective, that is basically the largest number of comments ever--ever--for a rule like this. Even the head of the IRS said he saw more comments on this proposal than ever before ``on any regulation,'' and that was 70,000 comments ago; 70,000 comments ago the Commissioner of the IRS said this was the most comments he had seen on any regulation.  So people are certainly making their voices heard--and loudly--and the message they are broadcasting is pretty clear: Leave the First Amendment alone. Leave it alone. Get out of the censorship and harassment business. Stick to the job you are actually supposed to be doing.  Let's be clear.
