 I reassure the Senator of concerns expressed. First, the random audit would have to be approved by the majority of commissioners. This is not something that would be inherently abusive, since it requires four commissioners, at least one of whom has to be from the opposing party.  In addition, the audits would be subject to strict confidentiality rules and only when the audits are completed would they be published, and not try to insinuate an audit into the newspapers for political campaign purposes.  I do believe this is a good way to reach compliance, and it is something that has been suggested by those people who look closely at the Federal Election Commission.  With respect to the lengthening of the time period for audit, the length is increased from 6 months to 12 months for those audits for cause. I think that is a reasonable amendment to the current practice. I hope it is accepted.  As the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Kentucky suggest, I have no opposition to thinking on this overnight and coming back.
