President, since there has been an objection, which I think is very unfortunate, the technical correction will be included in the final Republican package that will be offered.  As I said, I think the intent is very clear. The majority of the language is very clear. But there is an ambiguity in one section which will be cleared up in the final language.  Also, at this time I request the yeas and nays on the underlying Collins amendment which was set aside.
