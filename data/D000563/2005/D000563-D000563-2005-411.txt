President, I rise in support of the Cantwell amendment and in opposition to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In 1960, under the leadership of President Eisenhower, we created this nearly 20-million-acre Refuge. President Eisenhower and Congress said to the American people: We are going to hold this piece of America in trust. It will be held for future generations because it is a special place. It is one of the few places in America where we are going to restrict development. We are going to protect it because we want generations to come to know that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a special place, a place deserving of our honor, our respect, and our protection.  With the provision in this bill before us today, we will turn our back on that promise made by President Eisenhower and by our Nation 45 years ago. We will authorize, in this reconciliation bill, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is a sad day. It troubles me that some have come to the Chamber and argued that this really is not that big a deal.
