Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of the clergy in my district, the Imam Khattab of the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo. The Imam is retiring as the congregation's director, having served the Muslim community of Northwest Ohio for sixteen years.  Born in Egypt, Abdelmoneim Mahmoud Khattab completed his undergraduate degree at Al-Azhar University, where he received his Bachelor's Degree in Theology. He later received Masters Degrees in Social Services and Theology, and completed three years in the College of Law at Cairo University. After immigrating to Canada, he obtained a Masters Degree in Sociology and went on to complete his PhD coursework. A true scholar and learned man, Imam Khattab has directed his expertise to the fields of education, health, and foreign affairs, as well as directing Islamic Centers in Edmonton, Alberta and London, Ontario prior to his tenure in Northwest Ohio.  Imam Khattab has profoundly affected each congregation to which he devoted himself. With his guidance, the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo has fostered an interfaith understanding with the community, and it has become a centerpiece of Muslim faith and culture in our region. Those who visit the mosque, whether members of the Muslim community or not, cannot help but be swept up in the reverence, humility, faith, and sense of the world which reverberates within its walls.  Imam Khattab has been a leader in every sense of that word, directing the members of the mosque in his quiet, humble manner and with the greatest dignity. He takes his leave to pursue other important ventures, but leaves all of those who knew him during his stay here richer for the experience. We wish him well in his journey. Assalamu Alaikum, a friend to each of us who strive for a world of greater understanding, peace, and fellowship.                          ____________________
