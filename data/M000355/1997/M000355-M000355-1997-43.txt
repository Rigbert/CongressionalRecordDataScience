 President, this would be a good time, in the beginning of the debate, to thank my colleague from Nevada for his kind words. I appreciate that very much. Also, Mr. President, I would like to insert a number of things into the Record with some explanation, just to make the Record complete, before we go to further debate later this afternoon. There are a number of Senators on my side of this issue who want to speak, and they will be coming over at various times during the course of the afternoon's debate.  First, Mr. President, I would like to submit a sampling of the opinion pieces I have authored in the past year. One is from January of this year, published by the Washington Times, in which I had a premonition that President Clinton, as his own campaign finance scandal deepened, would become campaign finance reform's No. 1 fan. Frankly, it's not that I am particularly clairvoyant, but rather that they are so predictable.  As the Clinton administration and the Democratic National Committee have sunk in a scandalous quicksand of their own making, the more they publicly thrashed around groping for a campaign finance bill as if it were a life preserver. Unfortunately for America, the President and Vice President Gore seek to save themselves from their own embarrassing malfeasance in raising money from foreigners and theother episodes which have been so much in the newspapers. They want to save themselves at the expense of core constitutional freedoms for all Americans.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article I wrote for the Washington Times be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 30, 1997]                       Keep Campaign Reform Legal                          (By Mitch McConnell)       ``Offense is the best defense'' is a cliche and a      frequently employed political tactic. Diversion, skillfully      applied, also can have great utility in politics. President      Clinton is hoping both work for him in deflecting attention      from the waves of campaign finance scandals lapping up on the      White House lawn. That is why Mr. Clinton strives to become      campaign finance reform's No. 1 fan.       Mr. Clinton's newfound zeal for campaign finance reform is      transparent and dangerous. The McCain-Feingold bill around      which he belatedly rallies is a convenient fig leaf. It is      also a tremendous threat to political freedom, as it would      restrict political speech and participation. The president's      party hopes it will prevent collateral damage arising from      the latest Clinton scandals. They contend, wrongly, that the      campaign finance shenanigans making today's headlines merely      illustrate a systemic problem solvable only through      comprehensive ``reform.'' Never mind that the foreign      contributions and contribution-laundering reportedly done on      behalf of the Clinton reelection campaign are illegal, under      current law.       Mr. Clinton's ``reform'' agenda, while a clever      diversionary tactic, is unconstitutional. It is that element      which should disturb us most of all.       The Constitution's First Amendment is America's premier      political reform. It should be the touchstone for campaign      finance reform. But the McCain-Feingold bill and the      president instead treat it as an impediment to be undermined,      circumvented, even diminished. The McCain-Feingold bill, with      its coerced campaign spending limits and restrictions on      independent speech, is a square peg reformers try in vain to      pound into the First Amendment's round hole. In tacit      recognition of this, the Democrats' House and Senate leaders      recently endorsed a constitutional amendment to narrow the      First Amendment so that the unconstitutional (the McCain-     Feingold bill) could, thus, become constitutional. Audacious,      to say the least.       The Supreme Court has for years ruled, in no uncertain      terms, that campaign spending is protected by the First      Amendment because communication with voters costs money.      Hence, spending limits are speech limits which Congress      cannot constitutionally mandate. Congress must also tread      lightly on the ability of private citizens and groups to      participate in campaigns and affect elections via independent      expenditures.       Regrettably, while striking down mandatory spending limits,      the court ruled two decades ago that the government could pay      candidates large sums from the U.S. Treasury in exchange for      candidates' agreeing to forgo their First Amendment right to      unlimited spending (i.e., speech). However, the spending      limit system must be purely voluntary. That is the state of      play in the billion-dollar presidential campaign finance      system, where every major candidate except John Connally and      the circa-1992 Ross Perot (in 1996, Perot's campaign received      $30 million from the taxpayers) has opted into the taxpayer-     financed spending limits program. Have the tax dollars      limited spending or so-called ``special interests''? No. Like      a rock on Jello, the spending limits merely redirect the      spending into other, unlimited, channels--including party and      labor ``soft'' money. Spending limits promote subterfuge,      which the 1996 Clinton reelection campaign may have taken to      new lows (or highs, depending on your perspective).       Just as it seized upon the Keating Five scandal seven year      ago, so does Washington's reform industry now exploit the      emerging Clinton campaign finance scandal. The media-anointed      reformers seek to complete a job they started 20 years ago--     that is, to put (via the McCain-Feingold bill) the      discredited presidential model of spending limits on      congressional campaigns. It is an absurd proposition, but      reform groups and politicians reap gains--including fawning      editorials--from the battle. They are adept at massaging the      press with snappy soundbites and voluminous ``studies'' to      build a case for creating a bureaucratic regulatory regime of      extraordinary proportion to micromanage and ration the speech      of candidates and millions of private citizens. Why? Because,      they contend that: 1) campaigns spend too much; 2)      ``legalized bribery'' is rampant; and 3) special interests      influence is pervasive.       The truth is, Americans spend far more on yogurt than      political campaigns, bribery is illegal and the U.S. always      has been and will be a teeming cauldron of ``special      interests.'' It is government that is pervasive. It is little      wonder that virtually every American has a host of      ``special'' interests in their government.       In his State of the Union speech, Mr. Clinton will call for      campaign finance reform, specifically, the McCain-Feingold      bill. He may be so audacious as to bemoan ``special      interest'' influence, leaving unspoken his own culpability in      rewarding contributors with White House access and nights in      the Lincoln bedroom. It will take great restraint on the part      of Congress and the country not to hoot and howl during this      brazenly hypocritical call for systemic reform.       President Clinton can do much to restore confidence in the      political process by cleaning up his own act. That is why on      the subject of campaign finance I have two words of advice      for the president: Reform yourself.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed of mine which appeared in the Boston Globe in a somewhat altered form on Sunday, September 7, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       As with a Rorschach test, different people can view the      same campaign finance data and come away with wildly      divergent conclusions. Supporters of the McCain-Feingold      campaign finance ``reform'' scheme look upon the record      spending in the 1996 election cycle and profess to be      horrified--hysterically seeing malevolent ``special''      interests at every turn, poised to plunder our democracy. I      look upon that same election as the culmination of a fierce,      and healthy, philosophical battle over how best to ensure a      prosperous future for our nation.       Where I see a vibrant democracy-in-action, the ``reform''      agitators see chaos crying out for a big government remedy.      In the 1996 election cycle, the liberal status quo came      roaring back from the 1994 elections in which they had been      so profoundly rejected. The conservative insurgents of 1994      responded in-kind, fighting to prevail in the 1996 elections      with their recently acquired power intact, and the addition      of a Republican-held White House. With Democrats desperate to      regain control of Congress, Republicans having (after four      memorable decades in minority exile) savored majority status,      and momentous decisions to be made about the role of      government in our society, you may be assured that the next      few elections will be similarly boisterous. This political      energy should be applauded, not condemned, and certainly not      reformed away.       McCain-Feingold proponents have long believed that there is      ``too much'' campaign spending, a notion that finds, at first      blush, a receptive audience in cynical times. What makes the      task of limiting spending so daunting for the reformers and      so dangerous for our nation is that, as the Supreme Court has      repeatedly ruled, in political campaigns spending limits      function as speech limits of the most undemocratic and      nefarious sort. Ergo, what the campaign finance reform debate      is really about are First Amendment freedoms of speech,      association and the right to petition the government. In our      modern society, exercising these freedoms is an expensive      endeavor. That is why McCain-Feingold's convoluted provisions      to limit the speech of private citizens, groups, candidates      and parties would surely be struck down as unconstitutional.       The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected the goals of      McCain-Feingold's proponents. On whether government can      intervene to limit spending, the court has said: ``The First      Amendment denies government the power to determine that      spending to promote one's political views is wasteful,      excessive or unwise.'' As to the reformer contention that      campaign spending breeds corruption, the Court held that      there is ``nothing invidious, improper or unhealthy'' in      campaigns spending money to communicate. And on the      reformers' appealing argument that McCain-Feingold would help      ``level the playing field,'' the Court is contemptuous: ``. .      . the concept that government may restrict the speech of some      elements of our society in order to enhance the relative      voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.''       In addition to failing the constitutional test, McCain-     Feingold cannot, as a practical matter, achieve its stated      aims. Level the playing field? What is a famous family name      worth? What is the value of incumbency? Spending limits do      not take such non-monetary factors into account. Reduce      ``special'' interest influence? The reformers cannot even      define ``special'' interests (the truth is everyone has      ``special'' interests), let alone shoo them out of a      democracy. Banish ``legalized bribery?'' That is an oxymoron.      Bribery is illegal, period. Restore confidence in government?      That is a tall order for any ``reform'' and unlikely to be      achieved by a measure such as McCain-Feingold which would      necessitate a huge bureaucracy to regulate the political      speech of private citizens, groups, parties and thousands of      candidates in every election.       To illustrate the absurdity of the McCain-Feingold approach      to reform, consider its bizarre spending limit formula. For      Senate general elections, reformer nirvana is achieved by      limiting campaigns to spending an amount equal to: 30 cents      times the number of the state's voting-age citizens up to      four million, plus 25 cents times the number of voting-age      citizens over four million, plus $400,000. However, if you      are running in New Jersey, 80 cents and 70 cents are      substituted for 30 and 25. The formula notwithstanding, for      all states, regardless of population, the minimum general      election limit would be $950,000 and the maximum, $5,500,000.      The primary election limit is set at 67 percent of the     general and runoffs are limited to 20 percent. In the      unlikely event this atrocity was deemed constitutional, it      would be a mess to administrate, a nightmare to comply with,      and a blight on the Republic.       To propel their effort to have the government ration      political speech, McCain-Feingold proponents have seized upon      the White House-Democratic National Committee campaign      finance scandal which centers on violations of existing law.      They exploit legitimate outrage over illegal foreign      contributions in order to restrict political speech and      participation by American citizens. It is a brazen and      despicable strategy.       Curiously, those most associated with the First Amendment--     the news media--display a callous disregard for the political      freedom of private citizens, groups, candidates and parties      in McCain-Feingold's cross hairs. Newspapers spew forth reams      of editorials endorsing McCain-Feingold. Television's talking      heads pontificate on the dire need to limit the political      speech of non-media political participants. Why is the media      an eager accomplice in advancing this unconstitutional and      undemocratic ``reform'' agenda? One might reasonably conclude      that media poobahs see an opportunity to fill the void left      when the political speech of every other player in the      political process is limited by McCain-Feingold. Newspaper      editorials and articles, not to mention television, exert      tremendous influence on elections. Most media outlets are      subsidiaries of corporate conglomerates (i.e. ``special''      interests), yet they would not be limited by McCain-Feingold.      On this one point alone is McCain-Feingold sensitive to the      First Amendment.       That there is no media conspiracy to snuff out competitors      in the political sphere makes this confluence of support for      a legislative assault on their core First Amendment freedom      no less lamentable. Those in the media should consider that      they are but one ``loophole'' away--a special exemption under      the Federal Election Campaign Act--from having their product      regulated by the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Assuming,      of course, that the Courts did not intervene. Perhaps some      experience with the FEC speech police would sensitize      editorial writers, reporters and TV talking heads to the      insidious effects of regulating election-related speech.       The Supreme Court astutely observed six decades ago that      First Amendment freedom of speech is the ``matrix, the      indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of      freedom.'' Recognizing this, an extraordinary alliance of      citizens groups has coalesced to oppose the McCain-Feingold      bill. Ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and the      National Education Association on the left, to the Christian      Coalition, National Right to Life and the National Rifle      Association on the right, this coalition has little in common      except a determination to preserve these core political      freedoms for all Americans. In fighting the McCain-Feingold      juggernaut, they are doing America a great public service.       No one is arguing that the current campaign finance system      is ideal but like so many things in life, ``reform'' is in      the eye of the beholder. I believe the current scandal-ridden      presidential system of squandered taxpayer funding and      illusory spending limits should be repealed. Circa-1974      contribution limits should be updated to make fundraising      less time-consuming for all candidates and less formidable      for challengers who usually do not have a large base of      contributors from which to draw support. All contributions      should be purely voluntary which is why union members'      compulsory dues should not be diverted to politicking. And      more citizens should be encouraged to participate in      campaigns through volunteer activities and financial      contributions to the candidates and causes of their choosing.      Campaign contributions are a laudable and honorable means of      participation in campaigns and so long as they are publicly      disclosed and continue to be scrutinized by the media, voters      can judge for themselves what is appropriate.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a piece I authored and which appeared in the National Review in its June 30 edition. This op-ed starts out with the observation that proponents of spending limits are stuck between a rock and a hard place: The Constitution and reality.  It is my hope that some of the signatories to the Project Independence petition drive will read this, and particularly paying attention to the McCain-Feingold bill's absurd spending limits formula--and refrain from signing such a misleading and shallow document in the future.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             The Money Gag                          (By Mitch McConnell)       Proponents of campaign-spending limits are stuck between a      rock and a hard place: the Constitution and reality.       It is impossible constitutionally to limit all campaign-     related spending. The Supreme Court has been quite clear on      this matter, most notably in the 1976 Buckley v. Valeo      decision: ``The First Amendment denies government the power      to determine that spending to promote one's political views      is wasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society      ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the      people--individually as citizens and candidates and      collectively as associations and political committees--who      must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on      public issues in a political campaign.''       For those who do not at first blush see the link between      the First Amendment and campaign spending, the Court      elaborates: ``A restriction on the amount of money a person      or group can spend on political communication during a      campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by      restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of      their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This      is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in      today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.''       The reformers do not care or, in some cases, cannot accept      that spending limits limit speech. They believe that spending      limits are justified and necessary to alleviate perceived or      actual corruption. But the Court slapped that argument aside,      holding that there is ``nothing invidious, improper, or      unhealthy'' in campaigns spending money to communicate. The      reformers cannot that spending limits are essential because      campaign spending has increased dramatically in the past two      decades, a woefully lame premise the Court easily dispatched:      ``The mere growth in the cost of federal election campaigns      in and of itself provides no basis for governmental      restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.''      Appealing to Americans' instinct for fairness, the reformers      passionately plead for spending limits to ``level'' the      political playing field. The Court was utterly contemptuous      of this ``level playing field'' argument. ``The concept that      government may restrict the speech of some elements of our      society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is      wholly foreign to the First Amendment.''       There you have it. The reformers cannot achieve their      objectives statutorily. To realize the reformers' campaign-     finance nirvana would require essentially repealing the First      Amendment--blowing a huge hole in the Bill of Rights--via a      constitutional amendment. Frightfully undemocratic? Yes. Out      of the question? No; 38 United States senators voted to do      just that on March 18, 1997. These 38 senators voted, in the      name of ``reform,';' for S.J. Res. 18, a constitutional      amendment to empower Congress and the states to limit      contributions and spending ``by, in support of, or in      opposition to, a candidate.'' Thus would the entire universe      of political speech and participation be subjected to      limitation by congressional edict, and enforcement by      government bureaucrats.       This wholesale repeal of core political freedom registered      barely a ripple in the nation's media. Perhaps reporters and      editorial writers do not appreciate that their campaign      coverage could be construed as spending ``by, in support of,      or in opposition to, a candidate'' and, therefore, could be      regulated under a Constitution so altered. It is not a      stretch. The television networks and most major newspapers      are owned by corporate conglomerates (a/k/a ``special      interests'' and the blurred distinction is already      acknowledged in federal campaign law, which currently exempts      from the definition of expenditure ``any news story,      commentary, or editorial'' unless distributed by a political      party, committee, or candidate.       I do not advocate regulating newspaper editorials,      articles, and headlines. I do not believe that government      should compensate candidates who are harmed by television      newscasts or biased anchors. However, the political playing      field can never be ``level'' without such regulation, and it      is the only area of political speech upon which the vaunted      McCain-Feingold bill is silent. McCain-Feingold has      provisions to enable candidates to counteract independent      expenditures by every ``special interest'' in America, except      the media industry. This ``loophole'' is the only one which      editorial writers are not advocating be closed by the      government.       Such regulation of the media may strike one as an absurd      result of the campaign-reform movement, but it is a logical      extrapolation of McCain-Feingold's regulatory regime. The      McCain-Feingold bill's spending-limit formula for candidates      is itself ludicrous. For Senate general elections: 30 cents      times the number of the state's voting-age citizens up to 4      million, plus 25 cents times the number of voting-age      citizens over 4 million, plus $400,000. However, if you are      running in New Jersey, 80 cents and 70 cents are substituted      for 30 and 25 because of the dispersed media markets.      Moreover, the formula notwithstanding, for all states the      minimum general election limit is $950,000 and the maximum      $5,500,000. McCain-Feingold sets the primary-election limit      at 67 per cent of the general-election limit and the runoff      limit at 20 per cent of the general-election limit.       Reading the Clinton-endorsed McCain-Feingold bill, one can      only conclude that the era of big government is just      beginning. The Courts have repeatedly ruled that      communications which do not ``expressly advocate'' the      election or defeat of a candidate (using terms such as ``vote      for,'' ``defeat,'' ``elect'') cannot be regulated, yet      McCain-Feingold would have the Federal Election Commission      policing such ads if ``a reasonable person'' would      ``understand'' them to advocate election or defeat. Out of      260 million Americans,     just which one is to be this ``reasonable person''?       The McCain-Feingold bill seeks to quiet the voices of      candidates, private citizens, groups, and parties. Why?      Because, it is said, ``too much'' is spent on American      elections. The so-called reformers chafe when I pose the      obvious question: ``Compared to what?''       In 1996--an extraordinarily high-stakes, competitive      election in which there was a fierce ideological battle over      the future of the world's only superpower--$3.89 per eligible      voter was spent on congressional elections. May I be so bold      as to suggest that spending on congressional elections the      equivalent of a McDonald's ``extra value'' meal and a small      milkshake is not ``too much?''       The reformers are not dissuaded by facts. Their agenda is      not advanced by reason. It is propelled by the media, some      politicians, and the recent infusion of millions of dollars      in foundation grants to ``reform'' groups. Fortunately, the      majority of this Congress is not ideologically predisposed      toward the undemocratic, unconstitutional, bureaucratic      finance scheme embodied in McCain-Feingold. Further, a      powerful and diverse coalition has coalesced to protect      American freedom from the McCain-Feingold juggernaut.       Ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union and the      National Education Association on the left to the Christian      Coalition, the National Right to Life Committee, and the      National Rifle Association on the right, the individual      members of the coalition agree on little except the need for      the freedom to participate in American politics. There is      perhaps no better illustration of the Supreme Court's      observation in 1937 that freedom of speech ``is the matrix,      the indispensable condition, of nearly every other form of      freedom.'' These groups understand that the First Amendment      is America's greatest political reform.       Where do we go from here? After ten years of fighting and      filibustering against assaults on the First Amendment      advanced under the guise of ``reform,'' I am heartened by the      honest debate in this Congress. In the House of      Representatives, John T. Doolittle's bold proposal to repeal      government-prescribed contribution limits and the taxpayer-     financed system of (illusory) presidential spending limits      has more co-sponsors than McCain-Feingold's companion bill,      the Shays-Meehan speech-rationing scheme. In the Senate,      McCain-Feingold's fortunes cling pathetically to the specter      that the Government Affairs investigation into the Clinton      campaign-finance scandal will fuel public pressure for      reform.       My goal is to redefine ``reform,'' to move the debate away      from arbitrary limits and toward expanded citizen      participation, electoral competition, and political      discourse. McCain-Feingold is a failed approach to campaign      finance that has proved a disaster in the presidential      system. McCain-Feingold would paper over the fatal flaws in      the presidential spending-limit system and extend the      disaster to congressional elections. Experience argues for      scuttling it entirely.       The best way to diminish the influence of any particular      ``special interest'' is to dilute its impact through the      infusion of new donors contributing more money to campaigns      and political parties. Those who get off the sidelines and      contribute their own money to the candidates and parties of      their choice should be lauded, not demonized. The increased      campaign spending of the past few elections should be hailed      as evidence of a vibrant democracy, not reviled as a      ``problem'' needing to be cured.       My prescription for reform includes contribution limits      adjusted, at the least, for inflation.       The $1,000 individual limit was set in 1974, when a new      Ford Mustang cost just $2,700. The political parties should      be strengthened, the present constraints on what they can do      for their nominees, repealed. These would be steps in the      right direction.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is also an op-ed which I did for USA Today--a publication whose word limits force you to distill your arguments.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Beware So-Called Fixes                          (By Mitch McConnell)       The First Amendment of the Constitution is America's      premier political reform. To reformers, it's a ``loophole.''      The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that because      communication with voters costs money, campaign spending is      protected by the First Amendment and cannot be rationed by      the government. That does not stop the so-called reformers      from trying.       The presidential system of campaign finance is the monument      to reform excess. Thanks to the Democratic National      Committee's apparent penchant for illegal foreign      contributions, it is also scandal-ridden. A post-Watergate      ``reform,'' the presidential system gives candidates tax      dollars for which, in exchange, they agree to campaign      spending limits. But like a rock placed on Jello, the      spending limits merely shift the money into other channels--     notably party and union ``soft'' money.       Political parties, unions and newspapers have a      constitutional right to spend as much as they choose to      affect elections. Some newspapers want to neuter the      political parties under the guise of ``reform.'' The parties      are vital components of the electoral process, the only      entities that will consistently support challengers--of all      ideological stripes. Their only litmus test is party      affiliation. They do not have a vote in Congress. They are a      buffer between so-called ``special interests'' and      government.       The presidential system of taxpayer-funded spending limits      is a disaster that should be repealed. But so-called      reformers instead want to extend that debacle to      congressional elections and exploit the Democrats' scandal to      justify eviscerating the political parties.       Rather than admit spending limits have failed, the      reformers want to add even more layers of bureaucracy to      police American political speech and participation by      candidates, political parties, private citizens and groups.      Why? The reformers say ``too much'' is spent on elections.      Americans spend more on yogurt. The reformers bemoan      ``legalized bribery,'' an oxymoron. Bribery is illegal,      period. They say special-interest influence is pervasive. Yet      they cannot define ``special interest.''       Disclosure--not arbitrary, bureaucratic limits--should be      the linchpin of reform. Voters can decide for themselves what      is appropriate. Taxpayers should not be called upon to fund a      campaign-finance scheme in which the First Amendment is      regarded as a ``loophole,'' and so long as America is a      democracy, the spending limits can never be more than a      facade.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, further, I submit for the Record four illuminating documents from the American Civil Liberties Union. Say what you will about this organization--one that Members on my side, including me, are infrequently aligned with--they take some gutsy positions. It is tough for a liberal group--a label usually given to the ACLU--to go against the liberal grain, particularly on an issue this high-profile, as this one which we are debating today.  Particularly, Mr. President, I want to single out Laura Murphy, director of the ACLU's Washington office, and no doubt others in that organization, have taken a lot of grief for their brave and resolute position in defense of political freedom for all Americans--liberals, conservatives, and every ideological shade in between. I cannot say enough good things about the work that Laura, Joel Gora, Ira Glasser, and other folks in the ACLU have done on this issue. Their effort against McCain-Feingold has been truly heroic. Two-hundred and sixty million American beneficiaries of the first amendment owe these people a debt of thanks.  With a few notable and admirable exceptions, I have been sorely disappointed by the willingness of liberal groups to walk off a cliff for this blatantly unconstitutional reform effort. I'm told some have made the calculated decision that if the McCain-Feingold bill passed, liberal causes would benefit.  I think they are right on that score but it is shameful that so many would eagerly jettison 200 years of core political freedom--which benefits all citizens and makes America a uniquely free country--in order to stick it to conservatives and anyone else who does not support the liberal agenda.  These liberal, Democrat-leaning groups know McCain-Feingold is outrageous--that its issue advocacy provisions, to name just a few, are unconscionable assaults on the first amendment right of all Americans to petition the government as individuals, and as groups, and to weigh in on public issues. But still some actively promote McCain-Feingold, more simply look the other way--acquiescing on the sidelines of this critical debate over core constitutional freedoms they get paid to exercise.  Perhaps they believe, correctly I might add, that Republicans will save the Nation from McCain-Feingold. I predict that will be the outcome.  Mr. President, I will now read into the Record some highlights of the ACLU's most recent denunciation of the McCain-Feingold bill, dated October 1, 1997:       Ever since the very first version of the various McCain-     Feingold campaign finance bills was introduced in the Senate,      the ACLU has gone on record to assert that each version was      fatally and fundamentally flawed when measured against      settled First Amendment principles. Now the Senate is      debating a new ``revised'' incarnation of the bill. While we      are pleased that the sponsors of the new version have      abandoned some of the more egregious provisions that appeared      in earlier versions, the ``pared down'' bill still cuts to      the core of the First Amendment. We once again urge you to      reject McCain-Feingold's unconstitutional and unprecedented      assaults on freedom of speech and association.       Although the bill has a number of constitutional flaws,      this letter focuses on those     that impose restrictions primarily on issue advocacy. It is      important to note at the outset that the recent letter from      126 law professors, commenting on McCain-Feingold, was silent      on the issue advocacy restrictions in the bill, which are the      subject of this letter.       1. The unprecedented restrictions on issue advocacy      contained in the McCain-Feingold bill are flatly      unconstitutional under settled First Amendment doctrine.  Last week there was a lot of discussion of a law professor named Burt Neumann at the Brennan Center of New York. I believe it is interesting that everyone believes Brennan wrote the Buckley case, one of the ironies of this debate. Mr. Neumann for 24 years had said the Buckley decision was wrong. And he is free to say that. He wishes it were otherwise. But his position and the position of the man he presumably admires the most, William Brennan, not only prevailed in the Buckley case but has been further elaborated on in 21 years of litigation. Thus, the ACLU says under settled first amendment doctrine:       What we are talking about here is not the law as some wish      it were but the law as it is. And that is what the ACLU is      referring to.  Further, in another place in the letter, Mr. President, they say:       The unprecedented and sweeping restraints on the ``soft      money'' funding of issue advocacy and political activity by      political parties raise severe first amendment problems.  At another point in the letter, the ACLU says, ``The same principles that protect unrestrained issue advocacy by issue groups safeguard issue advocacy and activity by political parties.''  So, if issue advocacy has been well laid out by 21 years of court cases for groups, the same thing applies for political parties.  By the way, Mr. President, this letter was signed by Ira Glasser, executive director; Laura Murphy, director, Washington office; Joel Gora, professor of law at Brooklyn Law School.  I might just say a word about Joel Gora. He was cocounsel in the Buckley case. So my side in this argument is that they didn't have to go out and find somebody to certify that they wish the law were what it isn't. These folks know what the law is, were involved in litigating these cases, and are simply certifying as to their opinion based upon deep experience in this field as to the constitutionality of the measure before us.  So, here is what they say at the end of the letter.       Accordingly, we submit that McCain-Feingold's sweeping      controls on the amount and source of soft money contributions      to political parties and disclosure of soft money      disbursements by other organizations continue to raise severe      constitutional problems. Disclosure, rather than limitation,      of large soft money contributions to political parties, is      the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.       McCain-Feingold's labyrinth of restrictions on party      funding and political activity can have no other effect but      to deter and discourage precisely the kind of political party      activity that the First Amendment was designed to protect.       . . . While reasonable people may disagree about the proper      approaches to campaign finance reform, this bill's restraints      on political party funding and issue advocacy raise profound      First Amendment problems and should be opposed. The bill has      a number of other severe flaws, some old, some new, which we      will address in a future communication. But we wanted to take      the opportunity to share our assessment of two of the most      salient problems with the bill now.  So, Mr. President, there it is from America's experts on the first amendment, one of whom was one of the lawyers in the Buckley case. These are people who are experts on this kind of litigation, and that is their opinion about the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold, as revised.  Now, Mr. President, a September 25, 1997, letter from the Christian Coalition. It says:       Dear Senator: The Christian Coalition has long supported      campaign finance reform that encourages citizen participation      and nonpartisan voter education. Any reform of our system of      campaign financing should allow for educational tools such as      nonpartisan voter guides, issue advertising, congressional      scorecards and newsletters. Christian Coalition vigorously      opposes the McCain-Feingold legislation which      unconstitutionally restricts these types of issue advocacy.  I will just read one other sentence, Mr. President, from this particular letter. This organization says:       Voter education should be encouraged, not discouraged. An      informed electorate is part of the solution, not part of the      problem.  I could not agree more.  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Christian Coalition,                                          Capitol Hill Office,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1997. Support First Amendment--Free Speech Oppose McCain-Feingold Campaign                               Finance Bill       Dear Senator: The Christian Coalition has long supported      campaign finance reform that encourages citizen participation      and non-partisan voter education. Any reform of our system of      campaign finance should allow for educational tools such as      non-partisan voter guides, issue advertising, congressional      scorecards, and newsletters. Christian Coalition vigorously      opposes the McCain-Feingold legislation which      unconstitutionally restricts these types of issue advocacy.       Issue advocacy is constitutionally protected free speech.      Expressing opinions on issues and informing voters where      candidates stand on the issues are constitutionally protected      free speech, so long as the election or defeat of a candidate      is not ``expressly advocated.'' For over 20 years, the      Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the test must be      objective, not subjective. ``Express advocacy'' is defined by      using such words as, ``vote against,'' and ``oppose.'' The      McCain-Feingold bill imposes an unconstitutional subjective      test.       Voter education should be encouraged, not discouraged. An      informed electorate is part of the solution, not part of the      problem. Without voter education efforts, our supporters      would be forced to rely entirely on slick political      advertising and the news media. In fact, newspapers and other      media outlets express opinions and even expressly advocate      the election or defeat of candidates through editorials.      While the media is totally unregulated, as it should be under      the First Amendment, some want to prohibit and heavily      regulate issue organizations from exercising similar free      speech.       Restrictive speech provisions will not withstand      constitutional challenge. Therefore we oppose any proposals      which attempt to bring constitutionally protected issue      advocacy under the regulatory control of the federal      government. Thank you for considering our views.           Sincerely,                                                 Heidi H. Stirrup,                                   Director, Government Relations.  (
