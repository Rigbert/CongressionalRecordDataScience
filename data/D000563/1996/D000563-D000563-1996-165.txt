Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Centralia High School Boys Basketball Program's legacy of excellence. For over 80 years, this program, from the 20th congressional district, has been a dominant force within the great tradition of Illinois high school basketball. The hard work, determination, and commitment to excellence of past and present players and coaches has led to the Centralia High School Boys Basketball Program being named the United States all-time winningest boys basketball program.  The National Federation of High School Associations recognized this national title in its National High School Sports Record Book. According to the 1996 edition, the Centralia Orphans amassed a record of 1,760 wins to 755 losses from 1908 to 1995. This athletic achievement is testament to the program's dedication to excellence that has made the Centralia High School Boys Basketball Program an outstanding success.  I ask my colleagues to join me in a salute to all of the Orphan players, coaches, supporters, and parents who worked to achieve this extraordinary accomplishment.                          ____________________
