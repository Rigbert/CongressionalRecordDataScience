Speaker, I voted in favor of the Small Business Job Protection Act yesterday because it provides several advantageous new tax benefits for small businesses and their employees. By creating simplified retirement plants, extending the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance and encouraging employers to hire workers from economically and otherwise disadvantaged groups through the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, this legislation can contribute to the vitality of small businesses.  Despite the positive attributes of this bill, two provisions trouble me. First, by repealing section 956A of the Tax Code, Congress is reinstating an incentive for U.S. companies to move operations and jobs to foreign tax havens, accumulate unlimited passive assets, and avoid paying U.S. income taxes.  Congress put section 956A in the Code in 1993 to curb the ability of controlled foreign corporations to accumulate excess passive assets and shelter them from U.S. taxation. By repealing this provision, we are giving yet another tax break to multinational corporate giants and a paid-for-ticket to run to tax havens. And oddly enough, we're doing it in a ``small business'' bill.  Secondly, I do not favor the wholesale repeal of the Section 936 tax credit which encourages economic investments in Puerto Rico. This action would have a detrimental impact on American citizens in Puerto Rico. I do endorse reform of the credit, focused on establishing effective mechanisms to foster and improve job creation, and using the projected revenue savings for social and employment and training needs in Puerto Rico.  I urge House conferees to carefully reassess these provisions and seek alternative revenue sources to pay for the valuable small business tax reforms in this legislation.                          ____________________
