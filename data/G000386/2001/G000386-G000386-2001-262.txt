 President, the Senator from Michigan described his amendment. I am not going to go back through that. We have a very good package of educational assistance, tax incentives in our bill, of which the deduction of tuition is a major portion, and that major portion was put in to make this a more bipartisan bill, particularly under the leadership of Senator Torricelli.  What is wrong with this amendment is not that it does not do more but the fact that it increases billions of dollars for small business men and women. The revenue loss for the tuition deduction in our bill is $11 billion. We don't have this one scored, but this would be much higher.  Once again, I plead with people. We have a bipartisan bill. How many times do we have to defeat the same amendment? It has been 37 times now.
