I thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He has been exceptionally kind to me as a new Member of the Senate. I thank him for yielding to me this time.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that I be permitted to offer my amendment to prohibit secret Senate holds which was agreed to previously in the Senate D.C. appropriations bill.
