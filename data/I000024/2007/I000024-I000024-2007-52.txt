President, I had to come down here. Quite frankly, I didn't find out until last night--actually, until this morning, really--any of the parameters of this bill. My good friend from Connecticut just said they have been working on it for months and months, and yet nobody knows what it is. So only this morning I received some information.  I see it is very similar to the McCain-Lieberman bill that passed. I remember we stood here and debated that bill for 5 days, I guess it was, a couple of years ago. I hope--and with the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee here--that we are going to have hearings on this legislation and spend some time, get into it because we do not get into something this big without hearing very significant issues.  I will give a couple examples. First, let me ask a question. How much time do I have, I ask my friend from Virginia?
