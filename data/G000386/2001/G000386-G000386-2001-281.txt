 However, in addition to this amendment, we have had others that don't seem to recognize the Senate Finance Committee's function. We have held hearings on this very subject.  As I said, I am very committed to working at finding solutions to long-term financing challenges. In fact, I have introduced such a bill with Senator Graham of Florida. The impending retirement of baby boom generations presents a great incentive to act soon.  What this motion doesn't recognize is that we do taxes one time and we will do long-term health care another time. We can do both. This bill is not the appropriate vehicle. This amendment will delay the tax reduction for working families.  I hope we can defeat this motion. I see it as a continuing effort to kill the bill.  I raise a point of germaneness. The amendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation measure. I therefore raise a point of order against the amendment under section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
