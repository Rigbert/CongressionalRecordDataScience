It goes to the founding of our Republic. When the Founding Fathers decided that this body of 100 people would have the last word, to advise and consent on appointments to the Federal bench of judges who were seeking lifetime appointments, this is no trivial thing. It is not a personal thing when it comes to Miguel Estrada.  I think the point I tried to make to the Senator from Nevada: We have approved 103 nominees from the Bush White House without fail, each one of them conservative politically. I am sure I disagree with them on many issues, but so be it. That is the nature of the system.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, what is at stake in this debate, the reason it is taking so much time? Is it not a constitutional principle that goes beyond a cute political phrase as to whether or not this Senate is going to meet its constitutional responsibility to make sure that every nominee is honest and open and candid with the American people and the Senate so we do not end up with a secret judiciary, men and women who skate through by keeping their mouths shut?  I am sorry your grandson has become the object of this debate, but his answer to the question is a priceless one. When he was asked if he was guilty of mischief, he said: I don't remember the name of the person who was. That is the kind of evasive answer we have with Miguel Estrada. It goes way beyond a catchy political phrase. It goes way beyond political posturing.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, did we not sit here yesterday, both of us, going to the Constitution itself, to read again our constitutional responsibility when it comes to advice and consent on the judges nominated by any President?
