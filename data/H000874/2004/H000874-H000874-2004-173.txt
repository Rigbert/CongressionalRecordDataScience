Can I ask one other question on the Intelligence bill first? Does the gentleman know, if we consider Defense on Tuesday, when does the gentleman think we would consider the Intelligence authorization?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I would anticipate that the Department of Defense appropriations bill would not take very long; it does not usually, and if that is the case, the Intelligence bill would follow right after that. It could be Tuesday if things go well. If they do not, then I would imagine the Intelligence bill would be on Wednesday.
