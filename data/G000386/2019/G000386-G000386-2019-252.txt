 The FBI apparently had highly classified information potentially relevant to the Clinton investigation in its possession.  The FBI drafted a memo in May of 2016 to get access to the information. That memo said review of the information was necessary to complete the investigation. Sadly, that memo was never sent.  How could the FBI finish the investigation of the Clintons if they never got access to all of the potentially relevant information?  Congress needs to know what happened in that instance.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
