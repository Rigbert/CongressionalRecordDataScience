 It is a typical Democratic response to a budget: Raise taxes. They happen to think that Americans are crying, ``We areundertaxed.'' I don't hear that from my constituents. I bet they don't hear it in California either.  If those taxpayers she is talking about were only coupon-clipping, Park Avenue millionaires or somebody from Rodeo Drive, a resident of Beverly Hills, I would not be concerned. But we are talking about taxing small business people 80 percent by the Treasury Department. The people that fall into this category whom she wants to tax are the small business people that create 70 to 80 percent of the jobs in America. There is no reason, when we finally have the individual tax rate at 35, the same as the corporate tax rate, to treat small business the same as we treat corporations--not have a bias in the tax bill. We shouldn't go back to that bias.
