I do want to finish this story.  What had happened in the case of Keith Carter is that Keith Carter had moved his location from his basement up the street three houses for a larger place. He told the EPA regional office in Texas about it, but he did not tell the office in Washington, and so they took away his number. So we got his number back. It took 3 weeks to do it. Finally, we got his number back.  He called me back. He said, ``Congressman, I have another problem; now I can't use my inventory, 25,000 dollars' worth of silkscreen bottles, because they have the old number on them.'' Well, this is the type of harassment that has taken place.  Lastly, since the Senator from Tennessee brought this up, there is a brilliant guy, a Dr. Bruce Yandle from Clemson University, that made a discovery that everyone should focus on at this time. We are all concerned about deficits. What he discovered was--and he skewed this draft out for us--that there is a direct relationship between the number of pages in the Federal Register, which indicates the number of regulations, and the deficit. These yellow bars down here signify and represent the deficits during these years starting all the way back in 1950 going up to the current year. And if you look at this, it follows exactly along the line of the pages in the Federal Register. So, I would say to those individuals, if you are looking for another excuse, if you do not believe that we have an obtrusive, abusive Government, then look at it from a fiscal standpoint. If you really want to balance the budget, to eliminate the deficit, there is no single greater thing we can do than stop the excessive regulations in our society. And this is our opportunity to do it.  Thank you, Mr. President.
