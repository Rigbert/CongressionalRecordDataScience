If we are doing anything, we ought to be strengthening conflict-of-interest standards. The provisions Senators Sarbanes and Warner and I seek to modify are fundamentally at odds with the work of the Congress and the SEC, fundamentally at odds with the work to restore public confidence in financial and corporate transactions. I thank them for offering this with me.  All we want to do is to make sure we increase the confidence and accountability in our public markets for millions of Americans whose economic security is threatened by corporate greed and not have the Senate put an imprimatur on the use of people with enormous conflicts of interest, especially when consumers are hurting so badly.  I see the senior Senator from Maryland. He is far more familiar with how these things have worked in these major corporations. He is the author of the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. I yield the floor to the Senator from Maryland.
