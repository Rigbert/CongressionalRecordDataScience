Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I think the gentleman misstated. It is 10 percent per year for 5 years. It is a 50 percent reduction in fleet. So that seems, without much more granular data, pretty radical. And I wouldn't want to see that the next time I have got a major fire, the Forest Service doesn't have adequate vehicles in the Willamette Forest or in any other forest in my State to dispatch all the people they need to command and control and to deal with that fire.  So I think the idea of the study has merit. I think it is an arbitrary cut of 50 percent, particularly with two land management agencies that manage millions of acres of land. I know of Forest Service and BLM employees that, on a given day, their duty may require them to drive 4 hours to a remote spot to do a particular function, spend an hour there, and drive back; and there is no way around it because they had to do something at that particular point. So saying, ``Gee, you are going to have to ride share or thumb or call Uber and see if they will take you out there for a couple hundred miles in the mountains,'' it just doesn't work for me.  I think a study is a good idea, and we may find, indeed, there are efficiencies. But to arbitrarily reduce the fleets of the two largest land management agencies in the Federal Government, the Forest Service and the BLM, by 50 percent, I think could cause very unanticipated and potentially disastrous problems.  I urge opposition to the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).  The amendment was rejected.               Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. Schweikert  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25 printed in part A of House Report 114-326.
