 Speaker, two-and-a-half weeks ago we celebrated Veterans Day, and we told the veterans of America how much we respect them and how grateful we are for the sacrifices that they have made for this Nation. Well, two-and-a-half weeks have come and gone and how quickly we have forgotten.  This bill cuts $43 million from the VA programs, a larger cut than the House version, but that is just the beginning. The Republicans' 7-year budget, which begins with a funding bill we are discussing today, cuts entitlements for veterans by $6.7 billion over 7 years. Under the Republican budget, many veterans would pay more for their prescription drugs. In some cases, the cost that veterans pay for prescription drugs would double, and the cuts do not stop there.  The Republican budget demands that, in addition to the $6.7 billion veterans' cuts, all discretionary spending, including veterans' programs, be reduced by 20 percent over the 7-year combined period.  Let us defeat this bad bill. It is unfair to our veterans.
