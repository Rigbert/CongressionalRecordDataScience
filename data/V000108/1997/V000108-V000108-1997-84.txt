Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that will help correct a gross oversight within our Nation's pension system.  Under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, pension benefits from multiemployer pension plans are limited to the average of the retired employee's three highest consecutive years of income. This compensation-based limit makes perfect sense for many types of corporate pension plans, where pensions are based on compensation and income levels are relatively steady and tend to increase over time. But for many participants in multiemployer pension plans, limiting pension benefits in this way is both unfair and inequitable.  Unlike their corporate counterparts, benefits earned under multiemployer pension plans have very little relationship to actual compensation. Rather, benefits are generally based on a worker's years of covered service and the collectively bargained dollar amount of contributions made into the multiemployer plan. But the compensation-based limits contained in section 415 override the benefit rates set in the multiemployer plan, often decreasing a retiree's pension benefit well below what was negotiated.  Workers in the building and construction industries are particularly disadvantaged by section 415. Compensation for these workers can fluctuate dramatically from year-to-year, with the availability of work in these mobile, cyclical industries. For workers in these industries, section 415 often has the effect of driving the compensation-based limit much lower than the worker's average income. What's more, finding the 3 highest years of consecutive compensation often means basing the benefit limit on a period well before the date of retirement, which can mean a dramatic drop in income and lower standard of living once the worker retires.  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress, Public Law 104-188, which provided a long-overdue increase in the minimum wage, also exempted public employees from the pension benefit limits contained in section 415. But for reasons that have gone unexplained, Public Law 104-188 did not extend this exemption to multiemployer pension plans.  Mr. Speaker, no one should misinterpret either the intention or the effect of this legislation. These plans are not tax shelters and exempting multiemployer plans from section 415 will not result in an unfair windfall of pension benefits. Instead, my legislation would take a necessary step to ensure that benefits from multiemployer plans are not artificially reduced, and that every retired worker covered by these plans receives the pension benefits that he or she rightly deserves. I urge you and my other colleagues to cosponsor and support this important measure.                          ____________________
