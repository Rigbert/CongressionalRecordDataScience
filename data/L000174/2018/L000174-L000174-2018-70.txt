President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his remarks. I do appreciate the encouragement he has given both Senator Shelby and me in getting the appropriations bills through. He has been here long enough. He knows this is the way the Senate should work. We have done it in a bipartisan way, and we are way ahead of where we have been at any time in the past 2 years.  I also want to applaud the senior Senator from Maine. She sits on the Appropriations Committee. We have served together there throughout our careers, and she is a valuable member of that committee. She is one who has helped put together, with her Democratic counterpart, good legislation that is included. In fact, there was nearly a unanimous vote in the Appropriations Committee. Most of this has been either unanimous or virtually unanimous. I say that because some have felt that, in the Senate lately, you could not get a majority vote even to say the Sun rises in the East. But here we have been doing majority votes on things that involve everywhere from Alaska to Vermont. I am pleased with it.                     Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh  Mr. President, I take the floor in my role as vice chairman of Appropriations in managing this bill, but I am going to digress, as others have, for a few minutes and speak about something else.  We are now less than 2 weeks away from Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. We are 2 weeks away, and according to the National Archives, the committee has received only 6 percent of his total White House records. This is virtually unprecedented--6 percent of his records and not a single one of the records we have received has been provided by the National Archives. That is because the Archives will not complete its review of the limited number of records requested by Chairman Grassley until October, which is a month after the majority leader intends to hold a final vote on Judge Kavanaugh.  Actually, to date, every single record that we have received from the Judiciary Committee has been hand selected by a political lawyer representing President George W. Bush. He is a partisan lawyer who reported directly to Judge Kavanaugh in the Bush White House, a lawyer who also represents White House Counsel Don McGahn, Steve Bannon, and Reince Priebus in the Russia investigation. I mention this because he has been very selective in the very few things we have been allowed to see.  I mention this because this is in stark contrast to past precedent. Let me talk about the vetting of Justice Kagan, who, like Judge Kavanaugh, had served in the White House prior to her nomination. I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee at that time. I worked hand in hand with then-Ranking Member Jeff Sessions to ensure that we received every document of interest to the committee. Certainly, on behalf of the Republicans, Senator Sessions demanded an awful lot of records, and I worked with him to get them. In fact, when we were 12 days away from Justice Kagan's hearing, we had already received a full 99 percent of her White House records--99 percent.  I mention that because now, at the same time with Judge Kavanaugh, we are at 6 percent.
