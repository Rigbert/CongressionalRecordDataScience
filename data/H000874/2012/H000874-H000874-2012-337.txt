Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Southern Maryland Electric Cooperative--known colloquially as ``SMECO''--on 75 years of serving communities in Maryland's Fifth District. Since its humble beginnings bringing power to a handful of farmers, SMECO has become a major utility that fuels economic growth across Southern Maryland.  In 1937, SMECO was first incorporated in the wake of President Roosevelt's New Deal initiative to connect rural areas with electricity. With assistance from Roosevelt's Rural Electrification Administration, SMECO brought affordable light and power to families in Charles, St. Mary's, and Calvert Counties for the first time. Over the years, SMECO expanded its service and brought electrical power to communities the major urban and suburban utilities had left in the dark.  As one of the oldest and largest electricity cooperatives in the country, SMECO is owned by the families and businesses it serves, with all profits reinvested in infrastructure improvements or as rebates to shareholders. What began with 400 families just before the Second World War today provides power to over 147,000 homes and businesses across Southern Maryland.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all the people of our District, I want to thank the men and women of SMECO for their hard work throughout the years. Whether it is a snow storm or a hurricane, they immediately go to work and, within days, restore power for most shareholders who have lost their connections as a result of downed wires. I commend them for their focus and diligence during these emergencies and for continuing to earn praise from shareholders for their preparedness and responsiveness along with respect from utility management professionals across the country.  I also join in celebrating this milestone of 75 years of creating opportunities for rural Marylanders. For three quarters of a century, the men and women of SMECO have played a vital role in the economy and community of Southern Maryland for which they are to be commended.                          ____________________
