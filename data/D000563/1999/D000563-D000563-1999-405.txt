I listened carefully to his presentation and asked for a copy of the amendment to read it more closely.  One of the things I have found in working with law enforcement officials--I think the Senator from Minnesota has highlighted it--is they come upon a scene where a violent crime, maybe a very serious violent crime has been committed, and among all of their concerns, preserving evidence, making certain, if possible, to save any victim who might be battered or injured, there is that tiny little person who has just witnessed this scene.  When I spoke to the International Association of Chiefs of Police, one of the things which we discussed was to put on each investigative report from a violent crime a section that would indicate that the police know that minor children witnessed the violent crime and perhaps a method, then, of providing confidential information to counselors or social workers who would know. Then there is a heads-up, there is a red flag, that there has been a child involved. That child may be so young as to be overlooked as part of the investigation report, and they have suggested--and I think it is valuable, and perhaps at some point we can make it part of this effort--that law enforcement officials would be looking for this because, as the Senator from Minnesota has so eloquently given to the Senate today in his presentation, these kids witnessing violence can have their lives changed dramatically. An intervention at that point could not only make things better for them but could ultimately save their lives.  I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he would be kind enough to consider that either as a suggestion as part of this legislation or in separate correspondence with those who would administer the programs he has suggested.
