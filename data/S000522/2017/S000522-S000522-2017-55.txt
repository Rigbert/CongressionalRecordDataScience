Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of four critical pieces of legislation that will significantly strengthen our efforts to counter the Iranian menace in the Middle East.  Appropriately, these measures follow the President's determination, announced two weeks ago, that the suspension of sanctions under the Iran nuclear deal no longer serves the national security interests of the United States. President Trump's determination simply acknowledges the reality that has existed since day one of the deal--the nuclear deal put the United States on a perilous course to confronting a nuclear armed Iran.  By agreeing to submit to a minimal and inadequate standard of inspections, Iran earned international recognition of its enrichment program, reaped billions of dollars in sanctions relief, and positioned itself to become a nuclear threshold power by the time the deal expires in less than a decade. In addition to these unacceptable concessions, Tehran managed to secure an agreement that ignores its massive support for international terrorism and its pursuit of nuclear blackmail through an advanced ballistic missile program.  Mr. Speaker, the bills we are considering today are a first step towards correcting the balance in our relationship with the Iranian regime--a balance that must have as its first priority the national security interests of the United States and its regional allies, especially Israel.  My good friend and Chairman, Ed Royce, introduced two of these pieces of legislation that will expand and refine sanctions against Iran's ballistic missile program, its trade in conventional weapons, and the illicit network of financial support for its regional terrorist proxy Hezbollah. H.R. 1698, the Iran Ballistic Missiles and International Sanctions Enforcement Act, and H.R. 3329, the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Amendments Act of 2017, target the money and resources that enable Iran and Hezbollah to terrorize the State of Israel and other civilian populations across the region. Both of these bills rightly enjoy large bipartisan support--I am proud to join more than 320 of my colleagues in co-sponsoring H.R. 1698 and more than 110 have co-sponsored H.R. 3329.  Mr. Speaker, I also stand today in support of H.R. 3342, the Sanctioning Hezbollah's Illicit Use of Civilians as Defenseless Shields Act, introduced by my good friend Mike Gallagher, and H. Res. 359, introduced by my friend Ted Deutch, urging the European Union to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization. These bills expose Hezbollah for what it is: a merciless organized crime organization wrapped in a terrorist organization, masquerading as a political party. H.R. 3342 directs the President to apply penalties, principally visa bans, against individuals determined to direct Hezbollah's use of innocent human lives to protect its cruel mechanisms of murder. Meanwhile, H. Res. 359 urges the European Union to recognize what should be plain as day: there is no merely political wing to Hezbollah. Rather, the entire organization is dedicated to expanding Iranian influence in the region and threatening Israel's existence by all means possible.  Mr. Speaker, the United States Congress must get these bills to the President's desk as soon as possible. Just this week, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed the Israeli Knesset and underscored the urgent task of denying Iran's attempts to secure strategic footholds in Syria and acquire nuclear weapons. Also this week, Defense Minister Lieberman told Israeli legislators that a volley of rockets fired into the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights from Syria was ``intentional . . . carried out by a cell operated by Hezbollah.''  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that Monday was the 34th anniversary of the horrific 1983 bombing. of the U.S. Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut perpetrated by Hezbollah with Iranian support that killed 241 Americans. Just a few blocks away from here, at the Marine Corps Barracks in Washington D.C., Vice President Pence commemorated this anniversary on Monday, vowing that America will never forget those who gave everything in service to their country. Our fight against Hezbollah began that October day in Beirut and we must see it through until the evil of Iran and Hezbollah are completely vanquished.  I urge my colleagues to pass these critical measures to honor the memory of our fallen soldiers and our unfinished work against this pernicious threat.                          ____________________
