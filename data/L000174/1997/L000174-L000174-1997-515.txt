President, I want to commend the senior Senator from Maine for her statement. It demonstrates, as we have said before, that this is not a partisan issue. This is an issue of good sense. Whether people believe that abortion should be legal or whether people believe there should not be abortion, it makes no difference. We should be trying to join together in this to avoid all abortion. If you have family planning, that, to me, is a far greater alternative than using abortion as family planning.  As we also showed in this, in Russia, where just increasing our foreign aid over a relatively short period of time and increasing the availability of contraceptives by about 5 percent, that cut out 800,000 abortions. I mean, the fact of the matter is, if we hold the money back for family planning, abortions go up. If we release the money for family planning, abortions go down. Holding back the money, just because it may make some feel like they are being a purist on the abortion issue, flies in the face of reality. It is rhetoric over reality. The reality is, spend money for family planning and you reduce abortions.  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts. I yield to him.
