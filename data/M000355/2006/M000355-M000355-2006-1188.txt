 President, we have had a lot of talk about the security of our ports over the last few weeks, a lot of talk about where the containers originate, what boats are to get here, and who manages the ports but very little talk about who unloads the cargo. What this amendment would also do is provide for background checks on people working in our ports who are unloading the cargo. It makes no sense to ignore the personnel and the quality of personnel in our ports in the United States.
