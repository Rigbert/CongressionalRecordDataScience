Chairman, I would point out to the Chair that we do not have a copy of the gentleman's amendment.  I would also point out to the Chair, if I would be given permission to, that this is the second time in the first hour of debate we have not been supplied with an amendment offered on the floor.  I would certainly appreciate the courtesy of making sure that we are noticed as far as the content of these very important amendments, so we can give them the appropriate consideration that they are due.  I appreciate the Chair's indulgence.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will distribute copies of the amendment.  Pursuant to House Resolution 628, the gentleman from Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.
