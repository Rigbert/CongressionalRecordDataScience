We have done summersaults since last night. I called the chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran, half an hour before we went in in an effort to try to work it out. I have been supportive of Senator Salazar's request. But what we saw in the last few minutes is the ball game--you can't get a vote up or down in the Senate on a ripoff of taxpayer money. It is not me who concluded it; the General Accounting Office has done that. The Shell Oil Company says we don't need this particular incentive right now.  In the other body, the chairman of the natural resources committee says you don't need it. Even the author of the bill says it is not working as he intended.  But what we saw as a result of the request of the Senator from Nevada is that the Senate is not going to take a position on the granddaddy of all oil company subsidies. This is the biggest, folks. This is the one that really counts.  I want to respond briefly to the distinguished chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici. Senator Domenici essentially said a little bit ago that there were great problems in 1998 and 1999 with some in the Clinton administration who weren't watchdogging the program. I very much share the chairman's view. I talked about this probably two or three times over the course of the morning and early afternoon.  Where I take exception with my friend, however, is he essentially said the Clinton administration caused all of these problems, and along came Secretary Norton who cleaned it up. That was essentially the argument.  I would like to read verbatim and then enter into the Record a discussion in the New York Times of what happened under Secretary Norton. While I respect the chairman of the committee tremendously, I want the Senate to know what happened over the last few years.       Gale Norton, who stepped down this month as Interior      Secretary, moved quickly to speed up approval of new drilling      permits. Starting in 2001, she offered royalty incentives to      shallow-water producers who drilled more than 15,000 feet      below the sea bottom. In January 2004, Ms. Norton made the      incentive far more generous by raising the threshold price.      Her decisions meant that deep-gas drillers were able to      escape royalties in 2005 when prices spiked to record levels      and would probably escape them this year as well.  Continuing to quote:       She also offered to sweeten less generous contracts the      drillers had signed before the regulation was approved.  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Mar. 27, 2006]       Vague Law and Hard Lobbying Add Up to Billions for Big Oil                         (By Edmund L. Andrews)       Washington, March 26.--It was after midnight and every      lawmaker in the committee room wanted to go home, but there      was still time to sweeten a deal encouraging oil and gas      companies to drill in the Gulf of Mexico.       ``There is no cost,'' declared Representative Joe L.      Barton, a Texas Republican who was presiding over      Congressional negotiations on the sprawling energy bill last      July. An obscure provision on new drilling incentives was      ``so noncontroversial,'' he added, that senior House and      Senate negotiators had not even discussed it.       Mr. Barton's claim had a long history. For more than a      decade, lawmakers and administration officials, both      Republicans and Democrats, have promised there would be no      cost to taxpayers for a program allowing companies to avoid      paying the government royalties on oil and gas produced in      publicly owned waters in the Gulf.       But last month, the Bush administration confirmed that it      expected the government to waive about $7 billion in      royalties over the next five years, even though the industry      incentive was expressly conceived of for times when energy      prices were low. And that number could quadruple to more than      $28 billion if a lawsuit filed last week challenging one of      the program's remaining restrictions proves successful.       ``The big lie about this whole program is that it doesn't      cost anything,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, a      Massachusetts Democrat who tried to block its expansion last      July. ``Taxpayers are being asked to provide huge subsidies      to oil companies to produce oil--it's like subsidizing a fish      to swim.''       How did a supposedly cost-free incentive become a      multibillion-dollar break to an industry making record      profits?       The answer is a familiar Washington story of special-     interest politics at work: the people who pay the closest      attention and make the fewest mistakes are those with the      most profit at stake.       It is an account of legislators who passed a law riddled      with ambiguities; of crucial errors by midlevel bureaucrats      under President Bill Clinton; of $2 billion in inducements      from the Bush administration, which was intent on promoting      energy production; and of Republican lawmakers who wanted to      do even more. At each turn, through shrewd lobbying and      litigation, oil and gas companies ended up with bigger      incentives than before.       Until last month, hardly anyone noticed--or even knew--the      real costs. They were obscured in part by the long gap      between the time incentives are offered and when new offshore      wells start producing. But lawmakers shrouded the costs with      rosy projections. And administration officials consistently      declined to tally up the money they were forfeiting.       Most industry executives say that the royalty relief      spurred drilling and exploration when prices were relatively      low. But the industry is divided about whether it is      appropriate to continue the incentives with prices at current      levels. Michael Coney, a lawyer for Shell Oil, said, ``Under      the current environment, we don't need royalty relief.''       The program's original architect said he was surprised by      what had happened. ``The one thing I can tell you is that      this is not what we intended,'' said J. Bennett Johnston, a      former Democratic senator from Louisiana who had pushed for      the original incentives that Congress passed in 1995.       Mr. Johnston conceded that he was confused by his own law.      ``I got out the language a few days ago,'' he said in a      recent interview. ``I had it out just long enough to know      that it's got a lot of very obscure language.''                       a subsidy of disputed need       Things looked bleak for oil and gas companies in 1995,      especially for those along the Gulf Coast.       Energy prices had been so low for so long that investment      had dried up. With crude oil selling for about $16 a barrel,      scores of wildcatters and small exploration companies had      gone out of business. Few companies had any stomach for      drilling in water thousands of feet deep, and industry      leaders like Exxon     and Royal Dutch Shell were increasingly focused on      opportunities abroad.       ``At the time, the Gulf of Mexico was like the Dead Sea,''      recalled John Northington, then an Energy Department policy      adviser and now an industry lobbyist.       Senator Johnston, convinced that the Gulf's vast reservoirs      and Louisiana's oil-based economy were being neglected, had      argued for years that Congress should offer incentives for      deep-water drilling and exploration.       ``Failure to invest in the Gulf of Mexico is a lost      opportunity for the U.S.,'' Mr. Johnston pleaded in a letter      to other lawmakers. ``Those dollars will not move into other      domestic development, they will move to Asia, South America,      the Middle East or the former Soviet Union.''       Working closely with industry executives, he wrote      legislation that would allow a company drilling in deep water      to escape the standard 12 percent royalty on up to 87.5      million barrels of oil or its equivalent in natural gas. The      coastal waters are mostly owned by the federal government,      which leases tens of millions of acres in exchange for      upfront fees and a share of sales, or royalties.       Mr. Johnston and other supporters argued that the      incentives would actually generate money for the government      by increasing production and prompting companies to bid      higher prices for new leases.       ``The provision will result in a minimum net benefit to the      Treasury of $200 million by the year 2000,'' Mr. Johnston      declared in November 1995, denouncing what he called      ``outrageous allegations'' that the plan was a giveaway.       He won support from oil-state Democrats, Republicans and      the Clinton administration. Hazel O'Leary, the energy      secretary at the time, said the assistance would reduce      American dependence on foreign oil and ``enhance national      security.''       Representative Robert Livingston of Louisiana, then a      rising Republican leader, declared that the inducements would      ``create thousands of jobs'' and ``reduce the deficit.''       Many budget experts agree that the rosy estimates were      misleading. The reason, they say, is that it often takes      seven years before a new offshore field begins producing. As      a result, almost all the costs of royalty relief would occur      outside of Congress's five-year budget timeframe.       Opponents protested that the cost estimates were wrong,      that the incentives amounted to corporate welfare and that      companies did not need government incentives to invest.       ``They are going to the Gulf of Mexico because that's where      the oil is,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of      California, during a House debate. ``What we do here is not      going to change that. We are just going to decide whether or      not we are going to give away the taxpayers' dollars to a lot      of oil companies that do not need it.''       Industry executives and lobbyists fanned out across Capitol      Hill to shore up support for the program, visiting 150      lawmakers in October 1995. The effort succeeded. A month      later, Congress passed Mr. Johnston's bill.                        a missing escape clause       To hear lawmakers today, they never intended to waive      royalties when energy prices were high.       The 1995 law, according to Republicans and Democrats alike,      was supposed to include an escape clause: in any year when      average spot prices for oil or gas climbed above certain      threshold levels, companies would pay full royalties instead.       ``Royalty relief is an effective tool for two things:      keeping investment in America during times of superlow      prices, and spurring American energy production when massive      capital and technological risks would otherwise preclude      it,'' said Representative Richard W. Pombo, Republican of      California and chairman of the House Resources Committee.      ``Absent those criteria, I do not believe any relief should      be granted.''       But in what administration officials said appeared to have      been a mistake, Clinton administration managers omitted the      crucial escape clause in all offshore leases signed in 1998      and 1999.       At the time, with oil prices still below $20 a barrel, the      mistake seemed harmless. But energy prices have been above      the cutoff points since 2002, and Interior Department      officials estimate that about one-sixth of production in the      Gulf of Mexico is still exempt from royalties.       Walter Cruickshank, a senior official in both the Clinton      and Bush administrations, told lawmakers last month that      officials writing the lease contracts thought the price      thresholds were spelled out in the new regulations, which      were completed in 1998. But officials writing the regulations      left those details out, preferring to set the precise rules      at each new lease sale.       ``It seems to have been a massive screw-up,'' said Mr.      Northington, who was then in the Energy Department. No one      noticed the error for two years, and no one informed Congress      about it until last month.       Five years later, the costs of that lapse were compounded.      A group of oil companies, led by Shell, defeated the Bush      administration in court. The decision more than doubled the      amount of oil and gas that companies could produce without      paying royalties.       The case began as a relatively obscure dispute. Shell paid      $3.8 million in 1997 for a Gulf lease and soon drilled a      successful well. But the Interior Department denied the      company royalty relief, saying that Shell had drilled into an      older field already producing oil and gas. The decision      hinged on undersea geography and the court's interpretation      of language in the 1995 law.       A typical field, or geological reservoir, often encompasses      two or three separately leased tracts of ocean floor.      Interior Department officials insisted that the maximum      amount of royalty-free oil and gas was based on each field.      Shell and its partners argued that limit applied only to each      lease.       Perhaps shrewdly, the oil companies sued the Bush      administration in Louisiana, where federal courts previously      had sided with the industry in spats with the government.       The fight was not even close. In January 2003, a federal      district judge declared that the Interior Department's rules      violated the 1995 law. If the department ``disagrees with      Congress's policy choices,'' Judge James T. Trimble Jr.      wrote, ``then such arguments are best addressed to      Congress.''       What might have been a $2 billion mistake in the Clinton      administration suddenly ballooned into a $5 billion headache      under Mr. Bush.       But even as the Bush administration was losing in court, it      was offering new incentives for the energy industry.       Mr. Bush placed a top priority on expanding oil and gas      production as soon as he took office in 2001. Vice President      Dick Cheney's task force on energy, warning of a deepening      shortfall in domestic energy production, urged the government      to ``explore opportunities for royalty reduction'' and to      open areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to      drilling.       Gale A. Norton, who stepped down this month as interior      secretary, moved quickly to speed up approvals of new      drilling permits. Starting in 2001, she offered royalty      incentives to shallow-water producers who drilled more than      15,000 feet below the sea bottom.       In January 2004, Ms. Norton made the incentives far more      generous by raising the threshold prices. Her decision meant      that deep-gas drillers were able to escape royalties in 2005,      when prices spiked to record levels, and would probably      escape them this year as well.       ``These incentives will help ensure we have a reliable      supply of natural gas in the future,'' Ms. Norton proclaimed,      predicting that American consumers would save ``an estimated      $570 million a year'' in lower fuel prices.       Ms. Norton's decision was influenced by the industry. The      Interior Department had originally proposed a cut-off price      for royalty exemptions of $5 per million British thermal      units, or B.T.U.'s, of gas. But the Independent Petroleum      Association of America, which represents smaller      producers, argued that the new incentive would have little      value because natural gas prices were already above $5.      Ms. Norton set the threshold at $9.34.       Based on administration assumptions about future production      and prices, that change could cost the government about $1.9      billion in lost royalties.       ``There is no cost rationale,'' said Shirley J. Neff, an      economist at Columbia University and Senator Johnston's top      legislative aide in drafting the 1995 royalty law. ``It is      astounding to me that the administration would so blatantly      cave in to the industry's demands.''                        Incentives Keep Growing       Last April, President Bush himself expressed skepticism      about giving new incentives to oil and gas drillers. ``With      oil at $50 a barrel,'' Mr. Bush remarked, ``I don't think      energy companies need taxpayer-funded incentives to      explore.''       But on Aug. 8, Mr. Bush signed a sweeping energy bill that      contained $2.6 billion in new tax breaks for oil and gas      drillers and a modest expansion of the 10-year-old ``royalty      relief'' program. For the most part, the law locked in      incentives that the Interior Department was already offering      for another five years. But it included some embellishments,      like an extra break on royalties for companies drilling in      the deepest waters.       And energy companies, whose executives had long contributed      campaign funds to Republican candidates, pushed to block any      amendments aimed at diluting the benefits.       The push to lock in the royalty inducements came primarily      from House Republicans. The only real opposition came from a      handful of House Democrats, in a showdown about 1 a.m. on      July 25, according to a transcript of the session.       ``It is indefensible to be keeping these companies on the      government dole when oil and gas prices are so high,''      charged Representative Markey of Massachusetts, who proposed      to strip the royalty provisions. ``We might as well be giving      tax breaks to Donald Trump and Warren Buffett.''       Mr. Barton, the Texas Republican, brushed aside the      objections. He reassured lawmakers that the new provisions      would not cost taxpayers anything.       When Mr. Markey proposed a more modest change--having      Congress prohibit incentives if crude oil prices rose above      $40 a barrel--Republicans quickly voted him down again.       ``The only reason they waited until after midnight to bring      up these issues is that they couldn't stand up in the light      of day,'' Mr. Markey said in a recent interview. ``They all      expected me to give up because it was so late and I didn't      have the votes. But if nothing else, I wanted to get these      things on the record.''                         A Royalty-Free Future?       It is still not clear how much impact the reduced royalties      had in encouraging deep-     water drilling. While activity in the Gulf has increased      since 1995, prices for oil and gas have more than quadrupled      over the same period, providing a powerful motivation,      experts say.       ``It's hard to make a case for royalty relief, especially      at these high prices,'' said Jack Overstreet, owner of an      independent oil exploration company in Texas. ``But the oil      industry is like the farm lobby and will have its hand out at      every opportunity.''       The size of the subsidies will soar far higher if oil      companies win their newest court battle.       In a lawsuit filed March 17, Kerr-McGee Exploration and      Production argued that Congress never authorized the      government to set price cut-offs for incentives on leases      awarded from 1996 through 2000. If the company wins, the      Interior Department recently estimated, about three-quarters      of oil and gas produced in the Gulf of Mexico will be      royalty-free for the next five years.       Mr. Markey and other Democrats recently introduced      legislation that would pressure companies to pay full      royalties when energy prices are high, regardless of what      their leases allow.       But Republican lawmakers and the Bush administration have      signaled their opposition.       ``These are binding contracts that the government signed      with companies,'' Ms. Norton recently remarked. ``I don't      think we can change them just because we don't like them.''                                  ____                  Giving Away $7 Billion in Royalties       November 1995--Deep Water Royalty Relief Act is passed,      allowing companies to avoid paying some royalties on oil and      gas produced in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico. Bill has      bipartisan support.       1998-99--Interior Department makes big mistake on leases      awarded in these two years. The department omits price      thresholds that would cut royalty relief if oil and gas      prices rose above about $34 a barrel for crude and about $4      per thousand cubic feet of natural gas.       2000--Interior realizes the error and quietly adds price      thresholds into new leases--but the old leases remain valid.       2001--A vice presidential task force issues National Energy      Policy recommendations, urging the government to open up more      federal lands and waters to oil and gas development to      ``explore opportunities for royalty reductions.''       March 2003--U.S. District Court in Louisiana knocks down a      restriction on the volume of royalty-free oil and gas a      company can produce. This effectively doubles or triples the      incentives.       Jan. 23, 2004--Interior expands royalty incentives for deep      gas producers, letting them avoid royalties if price is below      $9.34 per million B.T.U.'s--higher than average price to      date. Decision could cost $1.9 billion in royalties over next      five years.       April 2005--President Bush says no need for more      incentives. ``With oil at $50 a barrel,'' he says, ``I don't      think energy companies need taxpayer-funded incentives to      explore.''       July 25, 2005--House and Senate conferees on energy bill      vote to extend and slightly enhance royalty incentives for      oil and gas. Bush signs energy bill Aug. 8.       February 2006--Interior Department budget shows that      royalty breaks could cost government more than $7 billion      over next five years, even though it expects oil prices to      remain above $50 a barrel.       March 17, 2006--Kerr-McGee, a large Gulf of Mexico      producer, sues the federal government in a test case to      receive all deepwater royalty incentives, regardless of how      high prices are, for all leases signed from 1996 through      2000. If suit is successful, government projections indicate      taxpayers could lose more than $28 billion over five years.
