 Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1370, the Export-Import Bank reauthorization bill, because I believe that the Export-Import Bank will have been made better as a result of amendments which were added to its authorization bill during its consideration of the Banking Committee.  I am very pleased that the committee approved an amendment that directs the Export-Import Bank [Exim] to establish procedures to ensure that, when selecting firms to provide financial assistance, preference is given to any firm which has shown a commitment to reinvestment and job creation in the United States. Because the purpose of Exim is to support U.S. jobs through exports, the Bank should give preference to U.S. corporations which reinvest and support jobs in the United States, as opposed to corporations which are laying off American workers only to locate production and other facilities in countries which have less expensive, unprotected workforces.  This preference provision gets at, I believe, the heart of the issue of the relationship between the U.S. Government, the taxpayers of this country and corporate America. A number of Federal programs are being criticized, inside and outside Congress, as corporate welfare and these programs are being targeted for spending cuts by people with widely different political philosophies. The Export-Import Bank is one of those programs.  The Journal of Commerce reported on June 12, 1997, that Exim, like the rest of the country, is presently facing a money crunch. The journal reports that Exim: ``faced with strong exporter demand, may run out of money this fiscal year as early as July, officials indicate. Next year, the money squeeze could be worse.'' It seems clear that it is time for the Export-Import Bank to prioritize; this money squeeze should indicate to us that there is actually a need for a system of priorities, such as that in this amendment, to ensure that companies which are the most committed to jobs in the U.S. are given preference over companies that are not.  It is becoming too common for U.S. corporations, including corporations which are supported by Exim, to downsize their U.S. workforce and move their production facilities to take advantage of cheap labor in other countries. According to information from Exim, among the top 25 companies which receive assistance from Exim are Boeing, General Electric, and AT A brief look at the employment practices of these corporations underscores the need for an amendment which gives preference to corporations that show a commitment to employment in the United States.  Boeing is the top recipient of Exim loans and guarantees. Reports indicate that in 1990 Boeing had 155,900 employees. In 1996, it had 103,600 employees--a decline of 52,300 jobs during that period. In other words, it laid off \1/3\ of its workforce, despite being the top recipient of Exim aid.  General Electric [GE] is listed as the No. 2 recipient of Exim aid. In 1975 GE had 667,000 American workers. Twenty years later, it had 398,000, a decline of 269,000 jobs. General Electric is well known for its politics of moving GE jobs to anyplace in the world where it can get cheap labor--Mexico, China, and other poor Third World countries.  As for AT, in 1995 AT laid off 40,000 workers. Interestingly enough, reports show that in that same year, AT provided its CEO, Robert Allen, with $15 million in options plus a $11 million grant.  The point here is that the entire approach of Exim in terms of job creation is too narrow. They approach the idea of jobs through exports on a project-by-project basis, and ignore the totality of what the company is doing. This amendment, on the other hand, expands Exim's focus when making the determination as to how many jobs a transaction will support. This amendment directs the Export-Import Bank's to look at the totality of the situation regarding a company's commitment to job creation in the United States, and not just a particular project. In other words, if there is a company that is showing a commitment to job creation and reinvestment in the United States, then that company should receive preference for assistance.  At a time when the Congress is working very hard to balance the budget, it seems only right that if U.S. taxpayer funds are to be used to support U.S. corporations' exports, then incentive and priority must be given to those corporations to reinvest and support jobs in the United States. A preference system, as provided by this amendment, would provide such an incentive to corporations, while at the same time, allowing the Bank some discretion in implementation, to ensure that both the purpose of the Bank and this amendment are fulfilled. two representatives from the labor community on the advisory board of                          the export-import bank  The committee also approved an amendment which directs the Export-Import Bank to include upon its advisory committee no less than two representatives from the labor community.  Because the purpose of the Export-Import Bank is to support U.S. jobs through exports, it is important to have two members representing the American workforce on the advisory committee to ensure that the influence of the advisory committee is more evenly balanced for the sake of U.S. workers.
