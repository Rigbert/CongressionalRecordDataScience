President, I also want to join Senator Reid in acknowledging the cosponsors of this resolution, and I am sure this list will grow as our colleagues come forward and ask to be added, but I thank Senator Johanns for joining me in this effort. I give special thanks to Senator Mikulski. We know of her pride in her Polish heritage and we know of her deep respect for the people of Poland and our shared grief over the loss to that great nation. Senators Kerry, Voinovich, Brown of Ohio, Cardin, and others have also joined me in considering this resolution.  I come to the floor of the Senate, Mr. President, with a heavy heart. I express my sympathy to the people of Poland and to Ambassador Kupiecki who is here representing them. I shared a moment with him earlier this morning and mentioned that when I heard the news of this tragic loss, my thoughts went back immediately to 47 years ago when we lost our President, John Kennedy, and what it meant to our Nation and how devastating it was. This city ground to a halt on that day, and the bells began to peal in the church towers all across Washington every hour on the hour as our Nation reflected on its great loss. It was a time of great sadness, as it should have been in our history, and as I am sure it is now in Poland, as people reflect on the morning of Saturday, April 10, when a plane carrying Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife Maria, and 94 other high-ranking government, military and civilian leaders crashed while traveling to a memorial service in Russia that was to recognize and memorialize the dreadful Katyn massacre.
