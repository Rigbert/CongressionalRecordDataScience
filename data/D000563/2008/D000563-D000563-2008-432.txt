ENSIGN. In a moment. I would say in closing that people have said--we can't do this. The House of Representatives would object because it isn't ``paid for.'' Well, there is $2.4 billion in unoffset tax provisions included in the Dodd/Shelby amendment and a large amount of this does not even relate to housing. Why should the House of Representatives accept $2.4 billion worth in tax incentives not paid for and object to our clean energy tax provisions at the same time? That is an example of why there is inconsistency in objecting to our amendment being voted on.  I yield for a question.
