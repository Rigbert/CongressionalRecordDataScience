Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague and my friend Mr. Cummings for yielding. I will not take the 5 minutes.  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution to name the annex building at the United States Courthouse on Forsyth Street in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, as the ``John C. Godbold Federal Building.''  Judge John C. Godbold was born in 1920 in Coy, Alabama, about 100 miles to the west of my hometown of Troy.  In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Judge Godbold to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a key post due to the many civil rights cases before the circuit during the fifties, the sixties and seventies.  Judge Godbold holds the distinction of being the only judge in the history of the United States to be the chief judge of two separate judicial circuits, the Fifth, and then later the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. It is with this legislation that we recognize the significant achievement of Judge Godbold and thank him for his many years of service to this country.  Madam Speaker, I would especially like to express my sympathy to Judge Godbold's family, friends, and colleagues on the judge's recent passing in December 2009.
