 President, this amendment is offered on behalf of Senators Warner, Schumer, DeWine, Levin, Chafee, Dodd, Jeffords, Boxer, Clinton, Reed, Lautenberg, and Mikulski.  This is an ad from this morning's Washington Post. It says:       Senators, if police officers sat in your seats today, do      you think they'd vote to put Uzi's and AK-47's back on the      streets?  That clearly is the question before the Senate this morning.  It is going to be a very close vote. However, that is the issue. That will be the result, if this legislation is not reauthorized for another 10 years.
