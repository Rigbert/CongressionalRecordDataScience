 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin, and I look forward to working with him so that we can protect the farmers in Vermont and Wisconsin and every other region in this Nation.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson).
