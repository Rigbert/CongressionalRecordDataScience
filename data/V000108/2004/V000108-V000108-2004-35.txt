Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend five dedicated individuals who have made significant contributions to Northwest Indiana. These loyal and dedicated individuals, Rosa Vega, Valeta Brannon, John Bakota, Daniel Lowery, and Leonard Tomaszewski, will be honored for their dedication to justice and to the people of Northwest Indiana by the Calumet Project at an awards luncheon at the Social Hall of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Parish in Hammond, Indiana on Friday, November 19, 2004.  The Calumet Community Hero Award is being presented to three individuals for their tireless efforts in promoting justice in Northwest Indiana. This year's first honoree is Rosa Vega, a graduate of Gary West Side High School. She has been a member of the executive board of SEIU Local 73 Division 208 since 1979 and has been employed by the Gary School Corporation since 1971. Rosa is also very active in the Cub Scouts and is a past recipient of the George Meany Scouting Award.  Also receiving a Calumet Community Hero Award is the youngest of this year's award recipients, Valetta Brannon. Valetta is a 1999 graduate of Bishop Noll Institute, where she organized the Black History Club, and a 2004 graduate of Purdue University Calumet, where she earned her B.A. in Psychology. She is employed by the Family & Youth Services Bureau as a Residential Counselor and with Porter-Starke Children Services as a Behavioral Specialist. Her future plans include pursuing an MSW and continuing to fight for social justice for the people of Northwest Indiana.  The third Calumet Community Hero Award is being presented to John Bakota. John is a graduate of East Chicago Roosevelt High School and is a veteran of the United States Army. John spent 38 years as a millwright at LTV Steel, and he has always been extremely active in promoting the enrichment of his community. John is a compassionate activist with the Coalition for a Clean Environment, and he is being honored for his ongoing quest to see to it that justice prevails.  This year's Unity Award is being presented to Daniel Lowery, Ph.D. Dr. Lowery is a graduate of Valparaiso University, holds a Master's Degree in Business Administration from Indiana University Northwest, and received a Ph.D. in Public Administration from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2001. He is currently Executive Director of the Northwest Indiana Quality of Life Council and has received numerous awards for his outstanding performance throughout his career.  The final award, the Lifetime Achievement Award, is being presented to Leonard Tomaszewski for his outstanding service to the Northwest Indiana Community. Leonard is a graduate of Emerson High School and a veteran of the Korean War. Prior to his retirement in 1996, Leonard was employed by U.S. Steel and Gary Works Sheet and Tin for over 46 years. Since his retirement, Leonard has been an active member of the Steelworkers Organization Active Retirees (SOAR). He has led the fight on behalf of retirees for healthcare, prescription drugs, social security, and other issues of concern to retirees. Leonard's lifetime of service continues as he is a member of the Board of Directors of the Northwest Indiana Community Action Corporation, whose mission is to change lives and build communities. For his lifetime of commitment to fairness and justice, Leonard Tomaszewski is being commended with this prestigious award.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending these individuals for their outstanding contributions to Indiana's First Congressional District. Their commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________
