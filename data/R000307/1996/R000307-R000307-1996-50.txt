That is not the intention of this language. There are excellent capabilities within NASA and the private sector to use remote sensing data for crop forecasting, precision agriculture, and projectingfood yield. We do want to find innovative ways of bringing these capabilities to the benefit of the American farmer. Under Subparagraph (b), NASA and the Secretary of Agriculture should work with the private sector to teach farmers how to obtain and use remote sensing data from commercial data providers for the purposes you mentioned. The NASA Administrator or the Secretary of Agriculture should not interpret this to mean that they are to provide farmers with remote sensing data that the private sector is making available on the market.
