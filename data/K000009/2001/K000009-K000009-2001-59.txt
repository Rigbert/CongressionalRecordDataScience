Chairman, I rise to bring attention to a vital national issue, our energy security. America's greatest strategic vulnerability remains our dangerous dependence on foreign fuels.                              {time}  2330  Imagine, we import over one-half of what it takes to fuel this Nation.  The President's energy plan presented earlier this year gave precious little attention to the viability of renewable biofuels as an answer to our predicament, and it did not offer a single charge directly to our U.S. Department of Agriculture to lead us out of the woods. At a minimum, I would say that is gross negligence.  American agriculture has the enormous capability to break our dependence on imported petroleum, but the bill before us today, with all due respect to the hardworking committee, does not lead us toward the maximization of biofuels and higher value-added production for our farmers.  Forty years ago in this Chamber, President Kennedy made his famous speech challenging our Nation to think broadly. He set the goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of that decade. I will just read some of his words where he said, ``It is time for the Nation to take longer strides, time for great new American enterprise to clearly play a leading role in space achievement which, in many ways,'' he said, ``holds the key to our future on Earth.'' But he admitted we as a Nation had never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required of such leadership. Indeed, on the energy front, we are in the same predicament.  It is time for us to take longer strides and create a new American enterprise. We have the resources and talent on every farm and field in this country; we have talent at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We have our land grant universities, but we do not have a specified goal. We do not have a time schedule. Our resources are spread around with questionable coordination and, truly, no urgency.  Consider that in 1985 we imported 31 percent of our fuel imports. Today, that is nearly double, nearly 58.5 percent. Our population is growing, our energy demands are growing, our energy dependency on foreign sources is growing.  So what is our answer? What is our plan? How long can we wait? Do not the events of recent weeks remind us of how vulnerable our dependency has made us? In fact, the current recession was directly due initially to the rising cost of petroleum, imported petroleum that has rippled through this marketplace. Have we not heard from farmer after farmer that they would rather get their income from the marketplace rather than from government payments? Are we afraid of the challenge? Are we unable to commit to a goal?  Mr. Chairman, the amendment before us today seeks to do two primary things. It seeks to establish a farmer-held biofuels feedstock energy reserve held by our farmers. By devoting a portion of our abundance to biofuels production, which is renewable and belongs to us, we provide the assurances that a fledgling industry needs to expand. Second, it gives the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to make or guarantee loans for the development, production, distribution, and storage of biofuels.  If all corn, just taking corn, currently being planted was used for ethanol, based on current technology, we would get one-fifth of our vehicle fuel from ethanol, which is all we import. Obviously, as research improves and other cellulose and oil sources from our fields are added, we will get much more, just as we went from Mercury to Gemini to Apollo. So the farmer gets paid by the marketplace instead of government payments.  We have also seen the positive impact of biofuels programs on the farm balance sheet. Last month, I was able to travel to Minnesota, the leading State in our country for ethanol andbiofuels production, to see for myself what a difference the States' program, working hand-in-hand with the private sector and farmers in that State, has made over the last decade. It is truly impressive. Everyone in Minnesota is using ethanol, and farmers have found that they can get a dollar more per bushel because of the increased demand.  Every one of our auto manufacturers produces vehicles that can use these fuels. It is a matter of national security, and I ask for support of the amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).
