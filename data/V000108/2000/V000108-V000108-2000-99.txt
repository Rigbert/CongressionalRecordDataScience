Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise before you to congratulate Purdue University Calumet as it holds its Chancellor's Gala and Hall of Fame Reception tonight, September 28, 2000, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana.  Part of the internationally renowned Purdue University system, Purdue University Calumet, located in Hammond, Indiana, is a comprehensive regional university with some 9,300 students and 80 academic programs focused on the educational needs of the people in Northwest Indiana. Tonight's dinner will be in recognition of the people who helped make Purdue Calumet what it is today. As part of the gala event, Purdue Calumet Chancellor James Yackel and new Purdue University President Martin Jischke have the honor and privilege to induct this year's honorees into Purdue Calumet's Hall of Fame. The Purdue University Calumet Hall of Fame was founded in 1996 in honor of Purdue Calumet's 50th Anniversary. It is awarded to alumni and friends of Purdue Calumet who have made significant accomplishments and have displayed a lifelong dedication to the university, the community, and the world. This year's honorees include Steven C. Beering, the recently retired Purdue University President, Adam Benjamin, Jr., the late Northwest Indiana Congressman, and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company.  Steven C. Beering, Purdue University President Emeritus, will receive the Chancellor's Award for Dedication to Higher Education and Extraordinary Public Service, and will be inducted into the Purdue University Calumet Hall of Fame for his long-time support of the Purdue Calumet campus. He served as president of Purdue University for 17 years before his retirement last month. During his tenure, the Purdue system experienced significant growth in both enrollment and facilities. Clear examples of his commitment to expanding facilities and services at Purdue Calumet can be seen in the development of the Donald S. Powers Computer Education Building, the Classroom Office Building, the Charlotte R. Riley Child Center, the Challenger Learning Center of Northwest Indiana, and Purdue Calumet's newest facility, the Center at Purdue University Calumet, a conference and special events facility. His colleagues at Purdue Calumet will sincerely miss President Beering and his commitment to educational and administrative excellence.  The Chancellor's Award for Extraordinary Public Service will be presented posthumously to Congressman Adam Benjamin, Jr. Congressman Benjamin represented Indiana's First Congressional District from 1976 until his death in 1982. Prior to his election to Congress, Benjamin served as the zoning administrator and the executive secretary to the mayor in Gary, Indiana. He was elected to the Indiana State House in 1966 and to the Indiana State Senate in 1970. The late Congressman Benjamin tirelessly devoted himself to advancing the interests of his constituents in Northwest Indiana. He was characterized by many as a dedicated and effective public servant, sharing the hopes and dreams of the people he served and the community he represented.  Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) will receive the Carl H. Elliott Award for exceptional Philanthropy for its extensive support of non-profit organizations in Northwest Indiana. Notably, NIPSCO has established an endowed scholarship at Purdue Calumet, and has provided start-up funding for the University's Resource Center and Entrepreneurship Center. The company's investment in the educational opportunities of those in its community has earned it the acclaim of students, educators, and administrators at Purdue Calumet.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Purdue University Calumet and this year's Hall of Fame inductees for their lifetime dedication not only to the university, but to all of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
