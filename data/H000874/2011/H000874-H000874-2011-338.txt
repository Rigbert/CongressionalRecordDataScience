Speaker, I rise to honor Angela Z. McCollough, an employee of the Congressional Budget Office, who is retiring on June 3, 2011 after nearly 40 years of service to the Federal government. Angie started her federal career in 1972 when she began working for the Environmental Protection Agency. In August of 1975, Angie joined the Congressional Budget Office, just a few months after CBO was founded. From 1975 until 2008, she served as the secretary and administrative assistant to the Assistant Director of the Natural Resources and Commerce Division (since renamed the Microeconomic Studies Division). In October of 2008, Angie was promoted to Executive Assistant to the CB0 Director.  Angie has been an invaluable member of the CB0 team. She received two CB0 Director's Awards--in 1984 and again in 2003. She has also received several STAR awards for her work in the Microeconomic Studies Division and the Office of the CBO Director. Angie was honored in 2001 for her role in recreating CBO's timekeeping and payroll system and for ensuring that CBO's employees were paid during that difficult period in the Fall of 2001 when the Ford House Office Building, where CBO is located, was closed for the anthrax investigation in the weeks following the tragic events of 9/11.  Angie is one of the longest serving employees in the history of the Congressional Budget Office. Her tenure at CB0 spans the agency's lifetime. She has served under all 8 CB0 Directors. And throughout her time at CBO, Angie has exemplified the highest standards of dedicated public service. I thank her for her service and wish her all the best in her retirement.                          ____________________
