President, if the Senator will yield for another question without losing his right to the floor, the Senator knows that three years ago the Judiciary Committee reported out these commonsense measures. We actually had broad support for measures to stop illegal gun trafficking, provide for universal background checks, and provide grants for schools to improve their security and ban assault weapons. The Senate Republicans filibustered our effort, which a majority of Americans supported, to make commonsense reforms that would make our country safer. I do not even want to think about how many Americans--although I do every day--have been killed since then.  I believe I speak for most Americans when I say we are tired of the status quo. Congress has to act to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists. My question to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is, in order for background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists, do we need to give law enforcement new tools--in other words, the tools we have now are not enough--to stop a suspected terrorist, or somebody who has recently been under investigation for terrorism, from buying a gun?
