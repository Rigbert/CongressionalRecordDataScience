Speaker, today, my constituent and personal friend, Debbi Huffman Guthrie of Roy O. Huffman Roof Co. has been recognized by the U.S. Small Business Administration as the 1997 Small Business Person of the Year for Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties in California. This honor comes after years of hard work. Debbi took on the family business when she was 26 years old after her parents and grandparents were killed in a plane crash. She has been dedicated to learning the business and developing a strong workplace for her employees. Under Debbi's watch, the company has grown from 15 employees to 28 with little employee turnover and sales have multiplied by six. She serves as an inspiration for all women who strive to succeed in a male-dominated industry, and as testimony that businesses who choose to work within the community will achieve success.  Through incentive programs, she has encouraged employees to construct the highest quality roofs for their customers. With heavy attention on employee safety, she has been awarded the State Compensation Insurance Fund's Safety Award. Quality, safety, and reliability are key to her success and to the success of her business. Her customers have come to depend on this reputation.  Debbi has maintained a commitment to the community where she lives, works, and raised her children. Her family has always believed in giving back to the community and she has continued that tradition through helping the Riverside youth, disadvantaged, and educational institutions. Debbie provided the human resources and project materials for a new roof on the Centro De Ninos nonprofit preschool center in a joint donation with three local Kiwanis Clubs and 45 volunteers. She also helps others who are pursuing their business and career goals through the Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce's Leadership Riverside Program and the National Association of Women in Construction. As a volunteer, she has served as a board member with the Kiwanis Club of Riverside and worked on the Longfellow Elementary Schools' Adopt a School program, the Special Olympics, and the Boy Scouts.  In an effort to help the community's economy, she has served as president of the Roofing Contractors Association for Riverside/San Bernardino Counties and Director of Provident Saving Bank in Riverside. She also helped endow the University of California Riverside's College of Engineering, Center for Environmental Research and Technology [CE-CERT], and is a founding member of the Riverside Educational Enrichment Foundation. Also, at the University of California Riverside, Debbi is working to establish a hall of fame to recognize recipients of the Athena Foundation's Women of the Year Award.  Today's award will be added to her list of honors including the 1996 California Association of Leadership Programs Distinguished Leadership Award, the 1994 GRCC Small Business of the Year Eagle Award, the 1993 YWCA's Women of Achievement Athena Award-Corporate and the 1994 Entrepreneur of the Year Small Business Award from Ernst & Young, Inc. Magazine, and Merill Lynch.  On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I would like to offer my sincerest congratulations to Debbi Huffman Guthrie, not only on this revered award, but her entire career. Thank you Debbi for maintaining the commitment to our community and to your customers.                          ____________________
