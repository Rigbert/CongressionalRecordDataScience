Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, prior to our last recess, the other body was frantically applying their finishing touches to H.R. 1417, a bill to reform the copyright royalty arbitration process which we will consider in a few minutes. When we get to that bill, I will describe the core amendments that were developed there. For now, I will just state that they are acceptable to the House Committee on the Judiciary.  Unfortunately, in the rush to send the amended bill back to the House, some inadvertent drafting errors were included in the text. The purpose of this concurrent resolution which passed the other body yesterday is to correct these provisions before the fact in the enrollment of the bill. In other words, the concurrent resolution will automatically make the appropriate changes to H.R. 1417, thereby ensuring that the measure will work as intended.                              {time}  1700  The most expeditious way to address this matter is by concurring in the Senate concurrent resolution. Because we cannot approve H.R. 1417 conditionally, it is important that we consider and support the enrolling resolution first.  The concurrent resolution is especially important because of the interaction of the present language in H.R. 1417 with that of H.R. 4518, the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, which passed the House on October 6. Among other things, that measure extends the copyright compulsory license for satellite broadcasts for another 5 years.  As the Committee on the Judiciary moved H.R. 4518 through the legislative process, the major developers of copyrighted programming and the satellite carriers arrived at a voluntary agreement on the use and compensation of this programming.  However, the relevant Senate text in H.R. 1417 inadvertently required rate-making proceedings under the satellite license to be conducted pursuant to the rules and practices in place prior to the enactment of the CARP performed bill. This conflicts with those provisions in the satellite bill that take into account the voluntary agreement. In other words, unless the error is corrected, the voluntary agreement will not work as intended once the satellite bill is adopted.  Senate Concurrent Resolution 145 will ensure that the voluntary agreement and the text of the satellite bill will operate as intended by Congress and the parties to the rate-making negotiations.  This major fix aside, the concurrent resolution makes other noncontroversial tweaks to additional drafting errors. These tweaks include developing language that clarifies certain definitions; imposing time deadlines on the Copyright Office when reviewing legal matters; and tightening those rules that prevent claimants from ``gaming'' small-claim proceedings.  Finally, the concurrent resolution eliminates typographical errors and adopts other grammatical and stylistic changes where appropriate.  Mr. Speaker, after 3 years of the excruciating process, it is time to put CARP reform to bed. I urge Members to support this concurrent resolution and the underlying bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
