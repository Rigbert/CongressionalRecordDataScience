 SPECTER. My time is running out. Let me finish my statement. Then you have quite a bit of time left. Let me just finish the thought.  I do not think it goes far enough to say: We request that you not do it unless we give you prior authorization. Because that kind of a gentle suggestion--and I can understand the gentility of my colleague from Delaware--would not go very far, I think, with this President or might not go very far with the Senator from Delaware or would not predetermine what the Senator from Pennsylvania would do.  When the Senator from Delaware talks about the President flying in the face of a cutoff of funds, I think that the President would be loath to do that. I think there he might really get into the Boland amendment or challenging the Congress on the power of the purse.  The Presidents have gotten away with disregarding the congressional mandate that only Congress can declare war. They have gotten away with it for a long time. It has been eroded. Presidents feel comfortable in doing that. But if the Congress said: No funds may be used, as this amendment does--maybe it needs to be a little tighter here or there--I think the President would proceed at his peril to violate that expressed constitutional authority in Congress to control the power of the purse. I am very much interested in my colleague's response, but I hope it will be on his time.
