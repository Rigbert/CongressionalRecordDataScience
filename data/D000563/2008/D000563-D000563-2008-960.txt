President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m. Tuesday, February 12; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and that the Senate then resume consideration of S. 2248, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, as under the previous order; and that the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus luncheons.
