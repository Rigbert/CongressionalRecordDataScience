President, I was pleased that the Chamber of Commerce today wrote to Members of the House of Representatives in support of the America Invents Act. The Senate-passed companion legislation was approved in March in a 95-5 vote. This bill will create jobs and grow the economy without adding a penny to the deficit. Today's announcement by the Chamber of Commerce is a strong indication of a growing consensus that this legislation is what America needs to win the future through innovation. I applaud the work that Chairman Smith, Mr. Watt, and others have done to move the legislation forward in the House, and I encourage the full House to act swiftly.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a full copy of the Chamber's letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Chamber of Commerce,                                     United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2011.     To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives:       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business      federation representing the interests of more than three      million businesses and organizations of every size, sector,      and region, supports H.R. 1249, the ``America Invents Act,''      which would encourage innovation and bolster the U.S.      economy. The Chamber believes this legislation is crucial for      American economic growth, jobs, and the future of U.S.      competitiveness.       A key component of H.R. 1249 is section 22, which would      ensure that fees collected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark      Office (PTO) fund the office and its administration of the      patent system. PTO faces significant challenges, including a      massive backlog of pending applications, and this backlog is      stifling domestic innovators. The fees that PTO collects to      review and approve patent application are supposed to be      dedicated to PTO operation. However, fee diversion by      Congress has hampered PTO's efforts to hire and retain a      sufficient number of qualified examiners and implement      technological improvements necessary to ensure expeditious      issuance of high quality patents. Providing PTO with full      access to the user fees it collects is an important first      step toward reducing the current backlog of 1.2 million      applications waiting for a final determination and pendency      time of 3 years, as well as to improve patent quality.       In addition, the legislation would help ensure that the      U.S. remains at the forefront of innovation by enhancing the      PTO process and ensuring that all inventors secure the      exclusive right to their inventions and discoveries. The bill      shifts the U.S. to a first-inventor-to-file system that we      believe is both constitutional and wise, ending expensive      interference proceedings. H.R. 1249 also contains important      legal reforms that would help reduce unnecessary litigation      against American businesses and innovators. Among the bill's      provisions, Section 16 would put an end to frivolous false      patent marking cases, while still preserving the right of      those who suffered actual harm to bring actions. Section 5      would create a prior user right for those who first      commercially use inventions, protecting the rights of early      inventors and giving manufacturers a powerful incentive to      build new factories in the United States, while at the same      time fully protecting universities. Section 19 also restricts      joinder of defendants who have tenuous connections to the      underlying disputes in patent infringement suits. Section 18      of H.R. 1249 provides for a tailored pilot program which      would allow patent office experts to help the court review      the validity of certain business method patents using the      best available prior art as an alternative to costly      litigation.       The Chamber strongly opposes any amendments to H.R. 1249      that would strike or weaken any of the important legal reform      measures in this legislation, including those found in      Sections 16, 5, 19 and 18. The Chamber supports H.R. 1249 and      urges the House to expeditiously approve this necessary      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                  R. Bruce Josten,     Executive Vice President, Government Affairs.                          ____________________
