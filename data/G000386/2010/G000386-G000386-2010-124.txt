 Due to these      market conditions, we have made the difficult decision to      idle our facility. Today we are laying off 15 full-time      employees. This represents more than 50 percent of our staff.  On February 10, Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, and I worked in a bipartisan fashion to develop an $84 billion jobs package that included a 1-year extension of several energy tax credits, including the biodiesel tax incentive. Before the ink was even dry on the paper, Majority Leader Reid scuttled our bipartisan package in favor of a partisan approach. That delayed passage of an extension in the Senate for well over a month, until the month of March.  Now it has been languishing for 6 weeks. Where is the urgency? This Congress jammed through a stimulus bill that spent $800 billion to keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent, and of course it didn't stay below 8 percent. Yet we can't find the time to pass asimple tax extension that will likely reinstate 20,000 jobs overnight. We are 4 months delinquent in our obligation to these biofuel producers with no end game in sight. The lack of action on this issue defies logic or common sense.  So while the Democratic leadership talks about creating green jobs, their action has led to job cuts. Americans are unemployed today because of the action--or more aptly the inaction--of the Democratic congressional leadership, particularly on this biodiesel issue.  The United States is more dependent upon foreign oil because of the inaction of the Congress. Automobiles are producing more pollution because we have essentially eliminated this renewable, cleaner-burning biofuel. Rural economies are being stripped of the economic gain of this value-added agricultural product.  So I urge the Senate to take immediate action to extend this tax incentive and reduce our dependence upon foreign oil and save green jobs.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1           President Obama Gets Biodiesel Message in Ottumwa   IRFA Secretary Albin Uses 90 Seconds with the President to Share                          Urgency of Tax Credit       Ottumwa, IA.--During his Iowa visit on April 27, 2010,      President Barack Obama heard firsthand of the urgency to      reinstate the biodiesel tax credit from Brad Albin, Vice      President at Renewable Energy Group and Secretary of the Iowa      Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA).       Following President Obama's speech and town hall session at      Indian Hills Community College, Albin grabbed the President's      attention. During a 90 second exchange, Albin shared the      message of the biodiesel industry's state of disruption and      uncertainty resulting from the lapse of the federal biodiesel      blenders tax credit since January 1, 2010.       ``I shook his hand and told him that we're losing jobs as      we stand here, which seemed to get his attention,'' explained      Albin, who had been sitting in the second row. ``I told him      about plants idling and that more than 90 percent of      manufacturing staff at U.S. biodiesel plants have been laid      off as a result of the tax credit lapse.''       President Obama acknowledged that his biodiesel tax credit      updates are coming through USDA Secretary Vilsack. The      President continued to listen as Albin explained that for 20      years Americans have worked to meet the challenge of      increasing energy independence, that farmers and families      have invested billions, and that now companies are bleeding      to death or bankrupt. Albin further explained that the five      month lapse of the tax credit could not have come at a worse      time as the Renewable Fuels Standard goes into effect July 1,      2010.       ``We're going to die without this tax credit,'' Albin added      even after the President's assurances. ``The President then      responded, `We won't let you die.' ''       ``Those that know me know I want to make sure my message is      clearly understood; so as the President was walking away to      shake another hand, I asked him if he could commit to the tax      credit being in place by May 31,'' Albin said. May 31, 2010,      the start of the Memorial Day recess, is the date Chairman      Sander Levin of the House Ways and Means Committee promised      as a reinstatement deadline for the biodiesel tax credit      during an energy hearing earlier this month.       ``The President heard me ask him again about the May 31      date. He turned back to me and said, `I'm the President and I      promise I'll do whatever I can,' '' Albin recalled of the      exchange. ``President Obama then assured me of his commitment      to clean energy by saying, `Look, I'm on your side, but I've      got a Congress to deal with.' ''       ``I believe he now has our urgent message straight from the      state where the tax credit lapse is having the most impact--     the nation's top biodiesel state,'' Albin said. ``It really      was a miracle to be in that right spot at the right moment to      be able to get the biodiesel message straight to the      President of the United States of America.''       The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association was formed in 2002 to      represent the state's ethanol and biodiesel producers. The      trade group fosters the development and growth of the      renewable fuels industry in Iowa through education,      promotion, legislation and infrastructure development.
