 My friend from Kentucky wants to speak on this matter, and I will in 10 seconds yield to him.  I say to my friend from Texas, it is always a joy to listen to him. The fairy tales he remembers always warm my heart. But I think he sometimes gets it mixed up. I think the Goliath here was the tobacco companies with their millions of dollars, and in the health care fight it was the insurance companies with their millions of dollars. I have no doubt my friend, with a small sling and a small stone, with his skill could take down Goliath, but in this case he had a few cruise missiles. The cruise missiles were the $40 million the tobacco companies are spending on advertising to kill this bill and the $14 billion that Harry and Louise spent on television to kill health care reform.  I don't doubt his prowess, but I acknowledge he probably had a little bit of help. It was a nuclear bomb in that little sling that David had, and it was worth tens of millions of dollars. It works every time in this town, and I just find it absolutely fascinating.
