Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.  I rise today to be the voice of the citizens of the First District of West Virginia and support House bill H.R. 3350. Let me share just two of the messages of the thousands that we have received.  Linda from Philippi, West Virginia, writes:       I am losing my health insurance due to ObamaCare. My policy      has been canceled, and I am being forced to enter the      exchange. I like my current policy. Under the exchange, I      will be forced to pay $200 more. I am being hurt by      ObamaCare. This simply isn't fair.  And Sherry from Weirton, West Virginia, tells us:       My parents, both retired, received a letter from their      insurance company letting them know their new rate starting      in January. The increase is so much they can't afford it. I      pray that they can continue to receive the health care that      they choose so they can continue to be healthy. They deserve      better.  Mr. Speaker, these are only two of the stories out of the thousands we could share. Consequently, I am urging my colleagues to support this particular legislation.
