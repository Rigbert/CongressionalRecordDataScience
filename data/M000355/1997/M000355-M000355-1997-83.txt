 President, I see the Senator from Virginia is on his feet. I just want to make one wrapup observation about what the Senator from Utah was just talking about.  The George Will column to which he referred was in the Washington Post yesterday. And just to pick out some excerpts, Mr. Will said, ``Nothing in American history * * * matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by campaign `reforms' * * *''  Further, Mr. Will said, ``Thus is the First Amendment nibbled away, like an artichoke devoured leaf by leaf,'' which is what the Senator from Utah was talking about.  And toward the end of the article he called this ``the most important [debate] in American history'' because really what we are talking about here is core political discussion in this country, as the Senator from Utah has pointed out.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that George Will's column, the headline of which says ``Here Come the Speech Police,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1997]                      Here Come The Speech Police                          (By George F. Will)       Almost nothing that preoccupies Washington is as important      as Washington thinks almost all its preoccupations are. But      now Congress is considering some version of the McCain-     Feingold bill, which raises ``regime-level'' questions. It      would continue the change for the worse of American      governance. And Washington's political class hopes the bill's      real importance will be underestimated.       With a moralism disproportionate to the merits of their      cause, members of that class--including the exhorting,      collaborative media--are mounting an unprecedentedly sweeping      attack on freedom of expression. Nothing in American      history--not the left's recent campus ``speech codes,'' not      the right's depredations during 1950s McCarthyism or the      1920s ``red scare,'' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the      1790s--matches the menance to the First Amendment posed by      campaign ``reforms'' advancing under the protective      coloration of political hygiene.       Such earlier fevers were evanescent, leaving no      institutional embodiments when particular passions abated.      And they targeted speech of particular political content.      What today's campaign reformers desire is a steadily      thickening clot of laws and an enforcing bureaucracy to      control both the quantity and the content of all discourse      pertinent to politics. By the logic of their aims, reformers      cannot stop short of that. This is so, regardless of the      supposed modesty of the measure Congress is debating.       Reformers first empowered government to regulate ``hard''      money--that given to particular candidates. But there remains      the ``problem'' of ``soft'' money--that given to parties for      general political organizing and advocacy. Reformers call      this a ``loophole.'' Reformers use that word to stigmatize      any silence of the law that allows unregulated political      expression. So now reformers want to ban ``soft'' money. But      the political class will not stop there.       Its patience is sorely tried by the insufferable public,      which persists in exercising its First Amendment right of      association to organize in groups as different as the Sierra      Club and the National Rifle Association. One reason people so      organize is to collectively exercise their First Amendment      right of free speech pertinent to politics. Therefore      reformers want to arm the speech police with additional      powers to ration the permissible amount of ``express      advocacy,'' meaning speech by independent groups that      advocates the election or defeat of an identifiable      candidate.       But the political class will not stop there. Consider mere      issue advocacy--say, a television commercial endorsing      abortion rights, mentioning no candidate and not mentioning      voting but broadcast in the context of a campaign in which      two candidates differ about abortion rights. Such      communications can influence the thinking of voters. Can't      have that, other than on a short leash held by the      government's speech police. So restriction of hard money      begets restriction of soft, which begets regulation of issue      advocacy--effectively, of all civic discourse.       The political class is not sliding reluctantly down a      slippery slope, it is eagerly skiiing down it, extending its      regulation of political speech in order to make its life less      stressful and more secure. Thus is the First Amendment      nibbled away, like an artichoke devoured leaf by leaf.       This is an example of what has been called ``the Latin      Americanization'' of American law--the proliferation of      increasingly rococo laws in attempts to enforce fundamentally      flawed laws. Reformers produce such laws from the bleak,      paternalistic premise that unfettered participation in      politics by means of financial support of political speech is      a ``problem'' that must be ``solved.''       One reason the media are complacent about such restrictions      on (others') political speech is that restrictions enhance      the power of the media as the filters of political speech,      and as unregulated participants in a shrunken national      conversation. Has the newspaper in which this column is      appearing ever editorialized to the effect that restrictions      on political money--restrictions on the ability to buy      broadcast time and print space and other things the Supreme      Court calls ``the indispensable conditions for meaningful      communications''--do not restrict speech? If this newspaper      ever does, ask the editors if they would accept revising the      First Amendment to read:       ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the      press, but Congress can restrict the amount a newspaper may      spend on editorial writers, reporters and newsprint.''       As Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and      others filibuster to block enlargement of the federal speech-     rationing machinery, theirs is arguably the most important      filibuster in American history. Its importance will be      attested by the obloquies they will receive from the herd of      independent minds eager to empower the political class to      extend controls over speech about itself.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield for a question to the Senator from Virginia.
