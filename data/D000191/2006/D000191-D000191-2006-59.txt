Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, again, this is about public-private partnerships. It is about cost-effective and innovative production. The large defense manufacturers are not exactly known as paragons of innovation or cost-effectiveness, so diversifying into the small and midsized businesses in the Pacific Northwest is a great investment for the Federal taxpayers, and we are providing vital products to our troops. Hydration technologies was already mentioned, based in my district. Body armor is produced in my district. We have a stealth boat manufacturer, missile silos up in Darlene's district. These are all members of the coalition. Night vision goggles, critical to our troops.  So if you support cost-effective, innovative and effective equipment for our troops, you will oppose this amendment and support the initiative.
