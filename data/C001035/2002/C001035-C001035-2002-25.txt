And I am very pleased to see that the Defense Appropriations bill places a high priority on addressing the chemical and biological weapons threat that we face and provides additional funding beyond the President's request for a number of high priority research programs.  As the Senator knows, I have been actively supporting vigorous research efforts in this area since my first days in the Senate because the threat from these weapons is serious and it is growing day by day. I am pleased to see that the Committee is recommending to the Senate that a chem-bio defense initiatives fund be established with an initial funding increment of $25 million. The Committee has listed a number of technology initiatives for consideration, but is providing the Secretary of Defense with the discretion to allocate the funds.  It seems logical to ensure that the most promising, maturing technologies are seen through to their completion, particularly if the technology shows a high potential to yield benefits in defending our troops, Nation, and our global interests. Is it the Committee's intent to ensure that such on-going programs that are nearing completion receive a priority for consideration of these funds?
