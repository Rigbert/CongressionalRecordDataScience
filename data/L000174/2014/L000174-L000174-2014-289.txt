President, today I remember a dear friend to Marcelle and me. Stratton ``Stratty'' Lines was for more than 40 years the proprietor of the Oasis Diner in Burlington, VT. Throughout its history, the diner was the center of many a political discussion over a hearty breakfast or tasty lunch and lots of laughs too. At the center of all the activity was Stratty, a first-generation American who, with his family, built a successful business in downtown Burlington. One of Stratty's sons, David, describes his father as the ``quintessential Vermonter.'' Stratty was that and so much more. He was a good family man and a hard worker who cared about working people.  I have many fond memories of the Oasis Diner, perhaps chief among them, eating breakfast there, celebrating with Stratty, and thanking voters the morning after I was first elected to the Senate in 1974. The diner was a popular stop among visitors to Vermont, including President Bill Clinton and Vice President Walter Mondale. During their visits and during my many trips to the diner, Stratty imparted the wisdom and common sense for which he was so well known and will be long remembered.  In memory of Stratty Lines, I ask that the article by Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press, ``Oasis Diner proprietor Stratton `Stratty' Lines remembered as quintessential Vermonter,'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 17, 2014]  Oasis Diner Proprietor Stratty Lines Remembered as ``Quintessential                               Vermonter'' Stratty Lines, longtime owner of Burlington's Oasis Diner, remembered                        for food and conversation                           (By Mike Donoghue)       When Stratton ``Stratty'' Lines helped opened the Oasis      Diner more than 40 years ago, coffee was a dime, and      hamburgers cost 25 cents. Over the years, Lines served up      food to the rich and the poor, the famous and the infamous.       His customers included local politicians and the president      of the United States. The food was always good, and so was      the conversation.       ``I could learn more in 20 minutes with Stratty then I      could with any polls,'' said U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.      ``Stratty heard everything. He knew what was gossip and what      made sense.''       Lines often was spotted in a white short-order-cook hat      trimmed in red, a white shirt and an apron over his pants. He      also was a well-known Democratic supporter.       His health had been failing in recent months, one of his      sons, David, said, and he was found dead of natural causes      Friday at his Williston home. He was 84.       ``He was the quintessential Vermonter, a first-generation      American who established a small business that became an      institution in this community,'' David Lines said.       The Oasis Diner was a popular breakfast and lunch spot just      east of Church Street for     the movers and shakers of greater Burlington, but also for      common folks. The draw was more than just the food--and more      than just politics. Stratty Lines would follow sports,      community events and all the other headlines of the day.       Leahy said a visit to Burlington was incomplete without a      stop at the Oasis to learn the latest. When he offered      condolences to David Lines, ``I said I loved going in      there,'' Leahy recounted. ``I could learn more going in there      by having breakfast.''       The Oasis remained a local institution until 2007, when the      business was sold to become a New York-style delicatessen.      The building now is home to El Cortijo.       Even in death, Lines sought to ensure people were properly      fed. The Chittenden County Meals on Wheels, along with the      Department of Veterans Affairs, are two organizations the      family has suggested people make donations in Lines' memory      instead of sending flowers.       Lines was born in Greece, graduated from Burlington High in      1947 and served as a military policeman in the U.S. armed      forces in Germany from 1951-53.       Leahy, Vermont's senior senator and a former Chittenden      County prosecutor, said lots of political debates were held      in the 17-by-40-foot diner. He said Lines enjoyed hearing the      hot-button topics of the day.       Lines was a gracious host, Leahy said, and always asked      about his wife, Marcelle, and their children before anything      else. Leahy said he believes he began frequenting the Oasis      as a student at St. Michael's College, where he graduated in      1961, but he became more of a regular following law school      and returning to Vermont in the mid '60s.       When he served as Chittenden County state's attorney, Leahy      said, he would sometimes run names of potential jurors past      Lines.       ``He'd say, `You might want to avoid that one,' or `That      would be a good one,' '' Leahy said.       Lines was as popular with house-painters as he was with      politicians. Alden Cadwell, 56, of Burlington said he always      enjoyed his stops at the diner.       ``Stratty was a big-hearted man with the biggest welcoming      smile in Burlington,'' Cadwell said. ``He ran a diner that a      regular patron came for the theater as much as the food.''       Cadwell said patrons got to hear cooks, waiters and other      customers exchanging orders and quips.       ``You did not leave the Oasis hungry or un-entertained,''      Cadwell said.       Former federal Judge Albert W. Coffrin often could be seen      sitting on a revolving stool at the counter. Coffrin once      confided to a Burlington Free Press reporter that the Oasis      was among his favorite stops.       Lawyers, bankers, merchants, the clergy and others also      frequented the Burlington landmark.       Leahy said he brought President Bill Clinton into the diner      during a visit to Burlington on July 31, 1995, to speak at      the National Governors Association convention in South      Burlington.       After a picture-taking event that included Clinton, Leahy,      Lines and then-Gov. Howard Dean outside the diner, the      nation's commander-in-chief stepped inside to enjoy lunch.      The Oasis served up a hand-carved, overstuffed sandwich of      fresh turkey on seeded rye, a Diet Coke and a slice of apple      pie.       ``Thanks for a great lunch,'' Clinton said when he      departed.       ``This was the highlight of my life, after the birth of my      children,'' Lines would say later--especially significant, he      added, for the son of Greek immigrants who arrived in the      country without a dime.       His parents opened the diner in 1954, and Lines, who worked      briefly at General Electric, soon joined the family business.       Lines would later say proudly he picked up the tab for      President Clinton's meal.       ``I don't think he ever got over that,'' Dean said Monday      as he recalled the presidential visit.       ``Stratty was an important guy. The ordinary person      listened to him. He would rarely endorse somebody. He would      say, So and so was a good guy,''' the former Vermont governor      said.       ``He would be more blatant once he got to know you better.      He was the best of the old guard. He was socially      conservative and business conservative,'' Dean said. ``He was      very much for the working class. It was a family business,      and his kids were working in there. It was kind of cool.''       Clinton wasn't the only brush with greatness for Lines.       A picture of him shaking hands with President Jimmy Carter      also was displayed at the diner.       Vice President Walter Mondale stopped for pancakes shortly      before the March 1980 primary. Tipper Gore, wife of Vice      President Al Gore, enjoyed a slice of apple pie and ice cream      in July 1999. A few other celebrity customers included Susan      Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Lyle Lovett and Elliot Gould.       Lines was a longtime New York Yankees fan, but he said in      1977 that he converted to the Toronto Blue Jays after his      veteran sportscasting friend Tom Cheek left WVMT-AM in      Colchester and became the voice of the Blue Jays. Lines would      visit Cheek during spring training and during the regular      season.       Leahy said after he was elected to Congress, he would      receive phone calls from the White House or from ambassadors      and others while he was having breakfast at the Oasis. The      ambassador from Russia called once.       A few days later, a political friend called the diner and,      speaking with a put-on Russian accent, claimed to be a phone      operator in Moscow. He confirmed with Lines that Leahy had      taken the ambassador's call. The prankster told Lines the      politician's call was made collect, and he owed $437.84, and      then he hung up.       ``Stratty loved to tell the story to everyone about the      calls,'' Leahy said.       A celebration of Lines' life is planned for 4-7 p.m.      Thursday at the Corbin and Palmer Funeral Home in Essex      Junction. A brief service is planned at the funeral home at      10 a.m. Friday followed by a private interment.       Survivors include three sons, Jon, Gary and David, all in      the Burlington area, and daughter Maria in California.                          ____________________
