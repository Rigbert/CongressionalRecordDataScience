 The Congress has an obligation to see to the well being of the men and women who are defending this Nation even now. For these reasons, the committee has adopted S. 351, and we would like to pass that legislation immediately. I know it contains provisions of deep interest to the Senator from Louisiana, and she would agree that the sooner they are enacted the better. However, I share her concern about the need to take whatever steps we can to support our troops and their families. For a variety of reasons, I do not believe that the S. 351 is the correct vehicle to address this problem. I do recognize that the issue appears to have drawn broad support as similar proposals have been introduced by Senators DeWine and Allen. I say to my friend from Louisiana, I will work with her and Senators DeWine and Allen on including the Reservists and Guardsmen Pay Protection Act in the reconciliation package that we will bring to the floor soon.
