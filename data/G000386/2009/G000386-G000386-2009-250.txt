 President, the second point I wish to make before I get to my formal remarks is on the question the Senator from Arizona raised about how big of an incentive is enough to get reported. That is a legitimate question.  Here is my experience with 22 years of the False Claims Act, dealing with whistleblowers, Government agencies listening to whistleblowers or not, the Justice Department taking a case or not taking a case, or whether the whistleblower initiates the case on their own. What I have found is that the False Claims Act does not come up early in anybody's thought process--about initiating a thought process that there might be fraud out there and somebody ought to be investigating and get to the bottom of it. Usually,the whistleblower has ample evidence of that or they wouldn't be doing it in the first place.
