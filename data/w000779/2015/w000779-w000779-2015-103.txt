President, I wish to speak this afternoon about a controversial proposal, the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, otherwise known as CISA, which was filed yesterday as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill.  I want to begin by saying to the Senate that I believe tacking this legislation onto the Defense bill would, in my view, be a significant mistake. I expect our colleagues are going to have a wide range of views about this legislation, and I hope the Senate can agree that bills as controversial as this one ought to be subject to public debate and an open-ended process, not stapled onto unrelated legislation with only a modest amount of discussion.  This is particularly true given the issue of cyber security, which is going to have a significant impact on the security and the well-being of the American people and obviously the consumer rights and the privacy of law-abiding Americans. Because it is designed to increase government collection of information from private companies, I am of the view that for the Senate to have this expansion of collecting so much information about the people of the United States, for it to have real legitimacy in the eyes of the public, it is important to have open debate, with votes on amendments from Senators who have a wide variety of opinions on the issue of cyber security. Trying to rush this bill through the Senate, in my view, is not going to increase public confidence.  So let me be clear about the process and talk a bit about the substance of the legislation as well. I believe tacking it onto the Defense bill is a flawed process. But I think there are also significant flaws with the substance of the legislation as well. Dozens of independent experts agree this legislation will have serious consequences and do little to make our Nation more secure at a time when cyber threats are very real. The issue of cyber threats requires more than a placebo, and this legislation is a bandaid on a gaping wound. I believe the Senate, having the time for adequate reflection and amendment, can do better.  In beginning, I would like the Senate to know just how much controversy and concern this legislation has generated among those who are considered independent experts on cyber security. Shortly before the Intelligence Committee, which I have been honored to serve on for more than 14 years--shortly before the committee marked up this legislation, a coalition of nearly 50 organizations and security experts wrote to the members of the Intelligence Committee expressing serious concerns about the legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Re Cyber Threat Information Sharing Bills                                                   April 16, 2015.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Congressman Adam Schiff,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Congressman Michael McCaul,     Cannon House Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Senator Richard Burr,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Congressman Devin Nunes,     Longworth House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Burr, Senator Feinstein, and Representatives      Nunes, Schiff, and McCaul: We are writing you today as      technologists, academics, and computer and network security      professionals who research, report on, and defend against      Internet security threats. Among us are antivirus and threat      signature developers, security researchers and analysts, and      system administrators charged with securing networks. We have      devoted our careers to building security technologies, and to      protecting networks, computers, and critical infrastructure      against a wide variety of even highly sophisticated attacks.       We do not need new legal authorities to share information      that helps us protect our systems from future attacks. When a      system is attacked, the compromise will leave a trail, and      investigators can collect these bread crumbs. Some of that      data empowers other system operators to check and see if      they, too, have been attacked, and also to guard against      being similarly attacked in the future. Generally speaking,      security practitioners can and do share this information with      each other and with the federal government while still      complying with our obligations under federal privacy law.       Significantly, threat data that security professionals use      to protect networks from future attacks is a far more narrow      category of information than those included in the bills      being considered by Congress, and will only rarely contain      private information. In those rare cases, we generally scrub      the data without losing the effectiveness of the threat      signature.       These are some common categories of data that we share to      figure out if systems have been compromised (indicators of      compromise, or IoCs) and to mitigate future threats:       Malware file names, code, and hashes       Objects (code) that communicate with malware       Compile times: data about the conversion of source code to      binary code       File size       File path location: where on the computer system malware      files are stored       Registry keys: configuration settings for low-level      operating system and applications       Memory process or running service information       Attached to this letter is an actual example of a threat      signature containing data that helps system administrators      secure their networks. You'll see that the information does      not contain users' private information.       Waiving privacy rights will not make security sharing      better. The more narrowly security practitioners can define      these IoCs and the less personal information that is in them,      the better. Private information about individual users is      often a detriment in developing threat signatures because we      need to be able to identify an attack no matter where it      comes from and no matter who the target is. Any bill that      allows for and results in significant sharing of personal      information could decrease the signal-to-noise ratio and make      IoCs less actionable.       Further, sharing users' private information creates new      security risks. Here are just three examples: First, any IoC      that contains personal information exacerbates the danger of      false-positives, that innocent behavior will erroneously be      classified as a threat. Second, distribution of private data      like passwords could expose our users to unauthorized access,      since, unfortunately, many people use the same password      across multiple sites. Third, private data contained in      personal emails or other messages can be abused by criminals      developing targeted phishing attacks in which they masquerade      as known and trusted correspondents.       For these reasons, we do not support any of the three      information sharing bills currently under consideration--the      Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA), the Protecting      Cyber Networks Act (PCNA), or the National Cybersecurity      Protection Advancement Act of 2015. These bills permit      overbroad sharing far beyond the IoCs described above that      are necessary to respond to an attack, including all      ``harms'' of an attack. This excess sharing will not aid      cybersecurity, but would significantly harm privacy and could      actually undermine our ability to effectively respond to      threats.       As a general rule, when we do need to share addressing      information, we are sharing the addresses of servers which      are used to host malware, or to which a compromised computer      will connect for the exfiltration of data. In these cases,      this addressing information helps potential victims block      malicious incoming connections. These addresses do not belong      to subscribers or customers of the victims of a security      breach or of our clients whose systems we are helping to      secure. Sharing this kind of addressing is a common current      practice. We do not see the need for new authorities to      enable this sharing.       Before any information sharing bill moves further, it      should be improved to contain at least the following three      features:       1. Narrowly define the categories of information to be      shared as only those needed for securing systems against      future attacks;       2. Require firms to effectively scrub all personally      identifying information and other private data not necessary      to identify or respond to a threat; and       3. Not allow the shared information to be used for anything      other than securing systems.       We appreciate your interest in making our networks more      secure, but the legislation proposed does not materially      further that goal, and at the same time it puts our users'      privacy at risk. These bills weaken privacy law without      promoting security. We urge you to reject them.
