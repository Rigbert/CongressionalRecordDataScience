We are in a process where we are trying to clear amendments, and we are making good progress on this bill. I understand Senator Paul has raised an issue that is issue, but it does not belong on this bill and indeed would result in this bill not progressing.  We are trying to get back to regular order on the appropriations process. With cooperation, I am confident we could finish this important appropriations bill today. We could show the American people that we can govern and fund essential transportation and housing programs that are included in this bill. By and large, we have had excellent bipartisan cooperation. I was hoping we could move to the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas--a member of the Republican leadership--and cosponsored by the Senate Democratic leader. It is an amendment that I believe we could dispense with quickly, and we would then be able to continue to work through the amendments on this bill.  Since the amendment from the Senator from Kentucky would grind this bill to a halt and does not belong on this bill--and there will be other opportunities to deal with this issue because the House is going to be passing legislation this week dealing with the issues raised by the Senator from Kentucky--I will object.
