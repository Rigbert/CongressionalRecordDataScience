 President, it is my understanding that we are now on the hate crimes amendment which takes the form of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act introduced by Senator Kennedy. I wish to speak on that amendment.  I begin by commending and thanking Senator Kennedy for his leadership and dedication on this issue for a long time. He has been the leader, he has been persistent, and I know he remains fully supportive.  This has been offered as an amendment to the Defense authorization bill.
