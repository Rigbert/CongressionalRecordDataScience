Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, so-called private savings accounts do nothing to improve our public schools. They are a way of using the Federal Tax Code to undermine public education. Private saving accounts drain resources from our public schools and hurt the vast majority of our students.  Our public schools need help. One out of every 3 schools need major repair and reconstruction; 90 percent of our students attend public schools; private savings accounts do nothing to help these students. Instead they deny the many and reward the privileged few.  Instead of draining our public schools of resources, we should be devoting our resources to improve public schools for every student.  In the words of Thomas Jefferson, education is the foundation of our democracy. Education is the great equalizer.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on the motion to instruct offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel). Vote for school construction and modernization. Repair our crumbling school buildings. Support an education system in America that all of our Nation's children can use.
