 President, you are chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I do not often have an opportunity to speak when the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, also the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is in the chair. I am in the middle of a series of speeches on the defense budget, and I know that the Senator from South Carolina is very much for a strong national defense. I am also for a strong national defense. But I have some questions about the amount of money we ought to spend and whether or not it has been used in the most well-managed way. And so I am addressing that issue.  So today I wish to resume my presentation on the integrity of the Department of Defense budget.  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)
