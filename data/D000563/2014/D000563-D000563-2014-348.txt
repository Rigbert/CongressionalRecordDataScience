. territory of Puerto Rico and recruits from other Latino backgrounds.  Today, President Obama has signed into law a bill honoring the Borinqueneers with a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor our Nation can bestow. The Gold Medal is awarded as a national expression of gratitude to men and women who perform outstanding acts of service that advance the security, prosperity, and national interest of the United States of America.  American minorities have a proud history of serving their country with honor and distinction even in the faceof racism and exclusion. As the largest and longest standing segregated unit in our military's history, the 65th Infantry Regiment is no different. In the face of segregation and discrimination, the Borinqueneers demonstrated valiant service to our Nation. From World War I to Korea, the Borinqueneers represented the United States and Puerto Rico proudly. They were often among the first into battle and have been the recipients of numerous awards and commendations.  The 65th Infantry Regiment was originally formed as a battalion of volunteer infantry in Puerto Rico in 1899 and first saw combat in World War I. The unit fired the first shot of the war by U.S. regular Armed Forces while defending the harbor of San Juan against a ship flying the colors of the Central Powers. Members of the Regiment also served in World War II and, with particular distinction, in the Korean war, where they earned 10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256 Silver Stars, 606 Bronze Stars, and 2,771 Purple Hearts by war's end.  The Borinqueneers now join the ranks of the Tuskegee Airmen, the Navajo Code Talkers and other distinguished minority units who have received the prestigious Gold Medal. This day is long overdue but well deserved.  I congratulate the Borinqueneers on their honor. These brave men deserve recognition befitting their contributions to our Armed Forces. The unit's story is one of service and honor beyond even the usual highest standards to which we hold our men and women in uniform.  Of the surviving Borinqueneers I would like to recognize and give special thanks to those who have made their home in Illinois: Diego A. Figueroa Reyes, Santiago Perez, David Ramirez-Granado, Ramon Rodriguez, Juan Vasquez, and Onil G. Velez. I commend you and all of the Borinqueneers for your steadfast service to our country and wish you and your families all the best.                          ____________________
