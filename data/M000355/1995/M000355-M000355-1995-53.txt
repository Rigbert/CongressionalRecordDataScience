 President, by way of very brief response to my friend from Arizona, the cable to which he referred was prepared a few days after Suu Kyi's release back in July. She subsequently learned that we provided information to SLORC on an alleged drug caravan which turned out to be used to attack ethnic groups on the border. Her views 2 days after being totally isolated for 6 years has since been fully informed by facts, which are that the money in all likelihood will end up with SLORC. She has since repeatedly opposed this cooperation, and in interviews, both with the press and with Congressmen who have been there, believe that it may threaten Burmese citizens.  Again, let me say reasonable people can differ about this. I totally respect my friend from Arizona and his interest in involvement in this issue. Fundamentally, it seems to me, the question is whether we should be cooperating with the SLORC, one of the worst regimes in the world, if not the worst.  I think we have probably debated this amendment fully. I am not aware of anybody else who wishes to speak.  Mr. President, I move to table the McCain amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there a sufficient second?  There is a sufficient second.  The yeas and nays were ordered.
