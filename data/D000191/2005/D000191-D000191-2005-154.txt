Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. She has been a very able advocate for the economic interests of her State, as have other Members of the Florida delegation. I want to assure her that at least on this side of the aisle, and I am certain on the other side of the aisle, we understand these problems and assure her we will work with her to try to reach some resolution that is fair to all.
