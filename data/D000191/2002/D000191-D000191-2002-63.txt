Speaker, I rise today to recognize and to congratulate the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe of Indians on the twentieth anniversary of their federal restoration. Saturday, April 27, 2002, will be a day of joyous celebration of their renewal.  In 1954, the Termination Act severed the trust relationship between the Federal Government and the small tribes and bands of western Oregon, Including the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe. If you can imagine losing your home and having your identity expunged by an action of Congress, you can begin to understand the consequences of termination for the Cow Creek Umpqua.  The termination of the Cow Creek Band of the Umpqua Tribe was only one of many catastrophic events in the history of their relationship with the United States Government. By 1954, they had been stripped of their homelands, survived relocation, and suffered the loss of their reservation lands. Yet, despite great tragedy and unimaginable loss, the Cow Creek Umpqua endured.  In 1982, the Cow Creek Umpqua were restored as an Indian tribe and established formal relations with the Federal Government. The Recognition Law was a tribute to the indomitable spirit of countless tribal elders and tribal leaders, like Ellen Furlong Crispen and Sue Crispen Shaffer, who refused to let the Cow Creek Umpqua be extinguished.  Recognition of the Cow Creek Umpqua enriched the lives of tribal members, and local communities gained a strong and active partner in their efforts to help youth and families. The Cow Creek Umpqua Foundation and the Tribal Council have given nearly three million dollars to the Special Olympics, local schools, community organizations, and civic projects.  The history of the Cow Creek Umpqua is an impressive story of remarkable perseverance in the face of overwhelming challenges. I am pleased to offer my warmest congratulations on this historic anniversary and my good wishes for continued.                          ____________________
