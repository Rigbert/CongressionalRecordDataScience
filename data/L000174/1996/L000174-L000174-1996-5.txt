President, the Senate version of the Foreign Operations bill included my amendment to provide $410 million for international family planning assistance, an increase of $54 million above last year's level. That amendment also deleted a House provision which would have penalized private organizations that use their own funds for abortions, even where abortion is legal.  This is the remaining issue to be decided in the conference on this bill, and it is now in the hands of the White House and the House and Senate leadership. I appreciate the White House's support for my position. This is an issue of critical importance to the welfare of hundreds of millions of women around the world, especially in poor countries where family planning services are often lacking or inadequate.  Last year, after going back and forth with the House several times on this same issue, the House sent us a provision that resulted in a drastic cut in funding for family planning. Chairman Hatfield, who has consistently voted pro-life, opposed that provision, as did I, because it cut family planning services to millions of women with the inevitable result that there would be an increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions.  But the House recessed immediately after, and in order to avoid another Government shutdown the Senate reluctantly acquiesced in the House provision. I, and I know others feel likewise, do not want to see a repeat of that fiasco.  This year, the House included a provision which not only continues the one-third cut in funding for familyplanning, but it also included a version of the Mexico City policy by imposing restrictions on what private organizations can do with their own money in order to receive U.S. Government funds.  Why we would want to do that when there are hundreds of millions of people who want family planning services but cannot get it, and the world is struggling with the enormous pressures of over a billion people living in poverty already, is beyond me.  I understand the herculean efforts that Congressman Callahan and others on the House side have made to try to resolve this matter in a way that does not damage the Agency for International Development's family planning program. I also greatly appreciate the tireless efforts of Senator Hatfield, who has tried every conceivable approach to reconcile the House and Senate provisions.  However, I urge the administration to stand firmly on the side of women, on unrestricted access to family planning, and on the right of private organizations to use their funds as they see fit--including for abortions, consistent with the laws of the countries where they operate. At a time when the world's population will double in the next 50 years and 90 percent of the new births will occur in countries that cannot even feed and care for their own people today, there is no more pressing issue for American leadership.                          ____________________
