  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the President has spoken and I do not take, unfortunately, much solace in what he had to say. He talked about a lot of voluntary reforms on Wall Street. He talked about the fact he has been waiting for months for a little bit of money from Congress for the SEC. Yet he denied his own toothless watchdog, Harvey Pitt, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, $91 million just 3 months ago.  The President is born again into wanting to do something politically about the problem we have, but not really deal with the problems on Wall Street because that will offend some very powerful and very wealthy people, no matter how ill-gotten their gains.  The fox is still guarding the henhouse and the President did not offer us anything today except political rhetoric.                          ____________________
