 President, I rise today to call my colleagues' attention to a guest editorial by a long-time friend of mine, Mr. Sam Shipley, which recently appeared in the Wilmington News Journal. I think he makes some very important points about the presidential tax check-off box, and I commend the article to my colleagues. I ask that it be printed in the Record.  The editorial follows:         [From the Wilmington (DE) News Journal, Mar. 11, 1998]                    $3 Election Check-off Can Add Up                         (By Samuel L. Shipley)       The presidential tax check-off needs promoting by the      Federal Election Commission. It's been a secret to most      Americans. One of the most effective strategies to increase      taxpayer awareness would be through public service      announcements in the news media, particularly national      television.       And there would be no better time to air them than now,      when Americans have their 1040 forms in hand, complete with      instructions on making the check-off.       This year, the 1040 forms for 1997 taxes will allow each      taxpayer to check off $3 as a matching contribution to the      presidential campaign. This can be doubled to $6 on joint tax      returns, even if only one spouse is employed.       The money from the presidential campaign check-off on Form      1040 is allocated equally among presidential candidates,      after they raise a certain amount of funds on their own.       In the 1990s, despite a national decline in voting      participation, more than 100 million Americans turned out to      cast ballots for president. No doubt the overwhelming      majority of these people file annual income tax returns.       This means that this year alone, there is the potential for      hundreds of millions of dollars from citizens of all walks of      life to be set aside for the 2000 elections.       It has been estimated that $1 billion or more was spent on      the 1996 presidential election by the respective candidates      and their parties. If taxpaying Americans would begin using      the presidential campaign funding check-off this year and      next, federal election funds to presidential races could      replace a large percentage of the money that candidates see      fit to seek from the special interests.       As a Delaware state Democratic Party chairman for many      years and participant in many national political activities      and campaigns, I am absolutely convinced of one point. The      overwhelming majority of candidates for high national office      do not like to go, hat in hand, asking people--particularly      special interests--for money. Some absolutely detest it. But      with the high cost of staff, organization and particularly      media, they see no other alternative.       The American people have it in their hands, now more than      ever, to give presidential candidates the opportunity to back      off from special interests--if they will only use the      voluntary $3 tax check-off. This would go a long way to let      presidential contenders campaign and serve with honor and      dignity. This is the beginning of an answer to the cancer of      politics, if only the people will take a scalpel to sleazy      special-interest money. This could act as a catalyst to      pressure on Congress to overhaul campaign spending      practices.                          ____________________
