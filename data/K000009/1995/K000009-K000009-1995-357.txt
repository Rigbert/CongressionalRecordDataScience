Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory of an educator, a mother, a wife, a devoted citizen, a woman ahead of her time, and a friend. Mrs. Dolores A. [Bodnar] Kurek. Dolores Kurek was a woman of great dedication in my community and throughout the Nation. On June 2, 1995, she passed away, much too young, at the age of 59 after a long courageous struggle with cancer. Her presence will be greatly missed by the thousands of lives she touched, and continues to touch.  Dolores Kurek was an exemplary leader in the field of science. She was the recipient of numerous awards including the engineering and math award in 1987, the exemplary women in science award, the teacher of the year award in 1991, and the Sears grant for science and engineering in 1993. However, for everyone who knew her, Dolores greatest award was not one she received, but one she gave. Her illustrious teaching career spanned over 20 years of care, commitment, and devotion to spreading her personal love for science. Her commitment to advancing women in the sciences was unmatched. She personally organized Women in the Sciences Career Day for thousands of young women in high school throughout our region.  Even to the day of her passing, her personal quest for knowledge never faltered. Dolores Kurek was working on another Ph.D, this time in physics. She was continually learning for, and from, those around her. If the quote, ``Read not to contradict and confute nor believe and take for granted, but to weigh and consider'' ever had any one in mind, it might just have as well been for Dolores Kurek. She was a life-long learner.  She was a devoted wife of 38 years, a loving mother of six children, nine grandchildren, and a career educator at the high school and college level. The loss of Dolores Kurek is deeply felt throughout our community. It has been a personal gift and honor to have learned from her. I and all who knew her feel great privilege to have shared in her life and we express our gratitude for her life of dedication, commitment, and love. She will be missed.                          ____________________
