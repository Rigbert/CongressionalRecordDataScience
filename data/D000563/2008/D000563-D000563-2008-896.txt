President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer be recognized for 5 minutes; followed by Senator Tester for 5 minutes; and then Senator McCaskill for 5 minutes; she wanted an opportunity to speak; and then I be given the remaining 15 minutes. That consumes the half hour between now and 2 o'clock.
