President, I ask unanimous consent that four letters written in support of the nomination of Jerome Holmes to the Tenth Circuit be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       State Capitol Building,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 19, 2006.     Re recommendation of Jerome A. Holmes, U.S. Court of Appeals          for the Tenth Circuit.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Specter: As Governor of the State of Oklahoma,      and as a former Chair of the State Senate Judiciary      Committee, I have had a lot of experience in the selection of      judges. In our modified Missouri system of appointment of      judges, the Governor plays a key role when judicial vacancies      occur. Not only does the Governor appoint members to the      Judicial Nominating Commission, but he or she also is      forwarded the final three names of judicial applicants for      gubernatorial selection. I take this responsibility very      seriously, and I have personally intervewed every single      candidate forwarded to me.       I have come to know and respect Mr. Jerome Holmes, a      nominee for the Tenth Circuit vacancy created by the      retirement of my friend, Judge Stephanie Seymour. Jerome is a      highly qualified candidate, a superb lawyer with a reputation      for fairness, ethics and integrity. Indeed, I recently      appointed his former supervisor, Judge Arlene Johnson, to our      court of last resort on criminal matters, the Oklahoma Court      of Criminal Appeals. When Arlene was Chief of the Criminal      Division of the U.S. Attorney's office in the Western      District of Oklahoma, Jerome was her chief deputy. Their      division was considered a model division of the U.S.      Attorney's office. Jerome handled this difficult task with      competence and honor, and he was part of the prosecution team      that brought charges against the perpetrators of the Oklahoma      City federal building bombing.       I have also come to know Jerome on a personal basis through      the Oklahoma Symposium, a sort of ``think tank'' gathering of      top Oklahomans that meets formally once a year, and      informally in small groups from time to time. It is an honor      to be invited to join the Symposium, and Jerome was among the      first to be invited for membership.       Jerome is uniquely qualified for this position. He served      as a law clerk for Federal District Judge Wayne Alley and      then for the then-Chief Judge of the Tenth Circuit Court of      Appeals, the honorable Judge William Holloway. Jerome then      practiced for several years in civil litigation before      devoting himself for eleven years to the U.S. Attorney's      Office in Oklahoma City. For several months, he has been      practicing at Crowe & Dunlevy, one of the largest and most      respected law firms in Oklahoma. In short, I do not think you      could have a candidate more highly qualified and regarded      than Jerome Holmes.       I hope you will see fit to appoint this remarkably talented      young man to this important position. I know of the Tenth      Circuit, as well, because my cousin, Judge Robert Henry, will      become the Chief Judge of that Circuit in 2008. I know he      shares my high regard for Jerome, as he has told me of      Jerome's excellent professional appearances before that      court.       I continue, Senator, to appreciate the very important work      that you do. Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be      of service, or, of course, if you should come to Oklahoma.           Sincerely,                                                       Brad Henry,     Governor.                                  ____                                      Ryan, Whaley & Coldiron,                                 Oklahoma City, OK, June 21, 2006.     Re nomination of Jerome A. Holmes to the Tenth Circuit.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I am writing in      support of the nomination of Jerome A. Holmes for the United      States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.       I am a lifelong Democrat. For six years I was fortunate to      work on the United States Senate staff of Senator David Boren      and the Senate Agriculture Committee. During this time I met      Senator Leahy and personally witnessed his leadership as a      committee chairman. I was the Democratic nominee for     an Oklahoma congressional race in 1994. I later became a      federal prosecutor and eventually served as the United States      Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, first through      appointment by Attorney General Janet Reno and then through      nomination by President Clinton.       I have known Jerome Holmes for over ten years through our      work together in the United States Attorney's Office and now      in private practice. I believe his intellect, experience and      character make him an excellent choice for a position on the      appellate court. I saw these qualities firsthand as Jerome      carried out his many responsibilities as a prosecutor. One of      the most important duties he performed was that of the      office's legal ethics and professional responsibility      counselor. Jerome acted ably in this capacity during a time      of heightened scrutiny for federal prosecutors following the      passage of the Hyde Act and the McDade Amendment. Since both      of you are former prosecutors, I trust that you can      appreciate the degree of confidence in Jerome's abilities and      integrity that were required in order to be given such an      assignment by me and other United States Attorneys.       Jerome's nomination has apparently triggered concern from      groups that have focused on his writings on affirmative      action. In this regard. I can offer three observations.      First, I have known Jerome to be open-minded and respectful      of different views. More importantly. I know Jerome to be      respectful of the role of the courts, as opposed to the role      of the advocates, and I believe this understanding to be      partly the result of his three years of service as a law      clerk for federal appellate and district judges. Finally. as      noted above. I know Jerome to be a person of unwavering      integrity. Therefore, when Jerome states under oath that he      will put his personal views aside and follow the law. I      believe he will do just that.       I hope these observations are helpful as you consider      Jerome's nomination. which I hope you will act upon      favorably. I respectfully request that this letter be made      part of the committee record regarding his nomination. If I      can be further assistance or if you or your staff have any      questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,     Daniel G. Webber. Jr.                                  ____                                            Oklahoma City, OK,                                                    June 21, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Specter and Leahy: I am writing in reference      to the nomination of the Honorable Mr. Jerome A. Holmes,      Esq.'s judicial appointment. I appreciate the concern that      has been expressed about his nomination based upon his      writings and positions on affirmative action. In all honesty      I stand in a position that is contrary to the interpreted and      most likely actual personal stance of Mr. Holmes, yet my      relationship with him moved me to write and to express my      support for him.       I have known Mr. Holmes for many years and believe that he      does have a high regard for the views of those who maybe      different from his own. That in and of itself is enough for      me to believe that he would ``hear'' fairly. In addition, Mr.      Holmes has displayed a level of integrity in all his dealings      that I have been aware and has shown in our personal      conversation willingness to listen and respect differing      views. I trust Mr. Holmes and so in light of our differences      I support his nomination.       I do realize the responsibility that is upon me as a      Pastor, Community Leader and a concerned citizen. This is no      light matter for me, indeed it is with much prayer and      struggle that I searched out the right words to convey the      right tone to reinforce my message. As a member of the NAACP,      Urban League and many other organizations that fight for the      rights of minorities, I am moved to ask your continued      approval of this nomination.           Sincerely,                                             George E. Young. Sr.,     Pastor, Holy Temple Baptist Church.                                  ____                                 Oklahoma County District One,                                                Oklahoma City, OK.     Re nomination of Jerome Holmes, 10th Circuit Court of          Appeals.     Hon. Arlen Specter, Chairman,     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Ranking Member,     U.S. Senate, Judiciary Committee,     Washington, DC.       Dear Distinguished Senators: It is truly an honor to offer      this Letter of Recommendation for your consideration on      behalf of Jerome Holmes, a nominee for the 10th Circuit Court      of Appeals.       I have known Jerome Holmes for several years, both      professionally and personally, as I am also a member of the      Oklahoma Bar Association. I know him to be a person of      Integrity and Character and I have always appreciated Mr.      Holmes' fairness in our dealings. What's more, I have      witnessed Mr. Holmes' efforts in our local community to      improve the lives of those around us; all people regardless      of where they live, what they look like or how much money      they have. He has an altruistic spirit that makes him a      standout in this world.       I serve Oklahoma County as one of three elected County      Commissioners, am a proud Democrat and consider Jerome Holmes      to be a principled leader who demonstrates mutual respect for      all people. In particular, he is respectful of views that      differ from his own and he enjoys tremendous bipartisan      support and respect.       If I can provide any further information or perspective,      please do not hesitate to contact me at your convenience.           Respectfully yours,                                                         Jim Roth,     County Commissioner.                          ____________________
