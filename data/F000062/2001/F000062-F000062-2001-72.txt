 President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership. We have consulted together on this bill, and I am very proud to join him as the lead Democratic cosponsor.  I ask unanimous consent to put the following Members from this side of the aisle on the bill: Senators Daschle, Schumer, Mikulski, Clinton, Carnahan, Boxer, Torricelli, Edwards, and Cleland.
