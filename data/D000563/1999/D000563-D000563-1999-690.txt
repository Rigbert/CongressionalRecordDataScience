President, let me try to explain, if I can, the predicament we face. Many of the States that filed lawsuits against tobacco companies tried to recover in those lawsuits moneys that had been spent for Medicaid. Medicaid is, of course, health insurance for the poor and disabled. Across the United States, on average, out of every dollar spent on the Medicaid health insurance program, 57 cents of it comes from Washington, and 43 cents comes from the local State.  In my State of Illinois, it is a 50/50 split. But including all States, it is an average of 57 percent coming from the Federal Government. Now, we send the money to the States and ask them to administer the Medicaid funds. We also say to the States that if there are lawsuits to be filed relative to Medicaid, it is your responsibility as a State to do it. They are obligated to recoup any cost that they recover in these lawsuits against third parties back to the Federal Government, proportionately based on the Federal Government's contribution.  So the suggestion that a State would file a lawsuit against the tobacco company claiming expenditures for Medicaid funds and recover, and then be asked to send some of that money back to Washington is not a novice suggestion. It is not radical. It is what happens by normal course. That is what has happened in the past.  But there have been some who have argued that when it comes to the tobacco settlement we should suspend that and say that the moneys recovered by the States against the tobacco companies for Medicaid expenditures should belong entirely to the States and not come back to the Federal Government at all. I have a problem with that inasmuch as I am concerned about how the money will be spent by the States.  Some Senators have come to the floor and said it is really none of our business. The States filed the lawsuit; let them spend the money the way they want. I think that is the wrong way to approach this. The lawsuits were filed because of a public health problem with tobacco. The money that was recovered--at least a portion of it--is Federal in nature. I think it is reasonable for us to say that the money recouped from these tobacco companies should at least be spent for the public health purposes of the lawsuit. That is what the Specter-Harkin, and now Durbin, amendment seeks to achieve.  I am also concerned, because, as part of their settlement, many of the States relinquished their right to file claims in the future against tobacco companies for Medicaid expenditures. In other words, they said they would give up the right of the Federal Government to recover funds under Medicaid against tobacco companies in the future. They have, in fact, surrendered a right of the Federal Government. I think that is noteworthy, because it means that, basically having settled these future claims, we have no opportunity to pursue them if we wanted to. The Federal Government has paid, and will continue to pay, one-half or more of Medicaid costs associated with treating tobacco-caused diseases, even though the States have now waived the Federal Government's right to any further tobacco-related Medicaid recovery. This further underscores the Federal right to have, if not a share of the settlement proceeds, at least a voice in how they are spent.  Let me say that the States routinely follow the requirements of the Medicaid statutes when it comes to money that they collect.  For those who argue that the tobacco suits should be treated somewhat differently, let me give them some evidence to consider.  In March 1996, five States--Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and West Virginia--settled a lawsuit with the Liggett tobacco company. In fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997, the total reported to HCFA, the Federal agency, as the Federal share, was $465,359. This is the precedent for a Federal claim for the tobacco proceeds.  It is important to keep in mind that if we don't recoup this money from the State in some form, we also create a budget problem on our own.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates, for scoring purposes, that we would recover from State tobacco suits $2.9 billion over 5 years and $6.8 billion over 10 years. Any legislation that allows the States to keep all the funds is going to require some more on our part to offset this budget priority, this budget assumption.  Having said that, let me try to address my point of view on what I believe the Specter-Harkin amendment will achieve.  It is less important to me who spends the money from the Tobacco companies than how it is spent. It is not as important to me that a Federal agency achieve the results so much as the results are achieved. And the results I am seeking are several.  First, it reduces the number of young people who are taking up tobacco and becoming addicted to it. Ultimately, one out of three die. If we can bring that percentage down by innovative, creative, and forceful State programs, that is all the better as far as I am concerned.  But I worry about suggestions in the underlying Hutchison amendment that we not be specific in terms of what we ask of the States. I am happy to see that the amendment that has been proposed by Senators Specter and Harkin will try to address this by putting 20 percent of the proceeds into tobacco control to reduce the number of young people who are addicted to the product. I think that is sensible.  Second, I think it is reasonable to ask that a portion of the money recovered go toward public health purposes, particularly children's health programs. And it is my understanding that the Specter-Harkin amendment does that. It says that another 30 percent will go for those purposes.  This is consistent with the National Governors' Association, which I already identified, as their priorities at their 1999 winter meeting for the tobacco settlement money. Let me quote from the statement that they released:       The Nation's Governors are committed to spending a      significant portion of the settlement funds on smoking      cessation programs, health care education and programs      benefiting children.  The Specter-Harkin-Durbin amendment seeks to follow the recommendations of the National Governors' Association--to say the Federal Government will not claim a share of these proceeds so long as they are spent for this purpose, and then to make certain that we are doing something with the money that is consistent with the goals of the initial litigation.  It would be troubling to me, and to many others who have been involved in this battle for a long time, if the net result of the tobacco lawsuits by the States should result in a windfall to the State treasuries and are spent on other things that really forget these important elements, important priorities of smoking cessation, as well as children's health care.  So I will be supporting the amendment being offered by Senators Specter and Harkin.  I can tell you that when the American people were asked through a poll conducted by the American Heart Association last November, that 74 percent of the voters supported at least half of the Medicaid dollars to go to tobacco addiction treatment and to efforts to educate teens about the dangers of tobacco.  I am hoping that Members on both sides of the aisle will join us in this bipartisan amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill.  At this point, I yield my time on this issue.                          ____________________
