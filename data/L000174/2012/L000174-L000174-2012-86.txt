President, I have had the privilege of serving in this body every day that Tom Harkin has been here. Nobody has spoken more eloquently for the needs of the disabled than Senator Harkin. He learned sign language so he could communicate with his brother. I have seen him with members of the disabled community. He is loved and respected.  This was not the Senate's finest day. It was not ``Profiles in Courage'' to see what happened. I am glad the Senator mentioned the veterans, as though any of them would stand for something that would take over our country. Many of them lost limbs fighting for this country and fighting for the security of this country. They represent people who died fighting for this country.  So this is one Senator who will be here next year. I pledge to the Senator from Iowa and to Senator Kerry, my seatmate--actually, I have both Senators on either side of me--that I will be here, and I will support the Senators every step of the way.
