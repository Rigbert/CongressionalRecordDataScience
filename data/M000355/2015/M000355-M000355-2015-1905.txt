 President, let me just say one more time, I think everybody understands. What we have here are at least six Democratic amendments that presumably they understand because they offered them. I assume they know what is in them because they wrote them and offered them. Yet they do not want to vote on them.  We have been on this bill for a while. We have already had more rollcall votes on this bill than the entire Senate had on every bill through the whole year of 2014. I think it is time that we start moving forward.  So since there is an objection to setting votes on the pending amendments, there is really only one way to ensure a vote on these amendments absent a cloture motion, which I was explaining earlier. If we had to file cloture on each of these amendments, we would be on them for weeks trying to help our friends on the other side get votes on amendments they offered.  So given the fact that they are reluctant to vote on their own amendments, which presumably they understand, the only way to go forward is to table their amendments. So I, therefore, intend to begin tabling the pending amendments, ensuring a vote on the proposals they have offered, which presumably they understand, but moving the process along tonight.
