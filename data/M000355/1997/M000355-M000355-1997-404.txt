 BENNETT. I agree completely that the Congress might do that. Now, to be honest, I would have to say to myfriend from Kentucky, the outcry that would arise from the press, the groups who watch what we do, would be very, very severe if Congress were to do that, and they would scream that that was not reasonable and would demand that the limit be raised.  But you would create, in that circumstance, a political thicket, to use a phrase that the Supreme Court, I understand, has used on occasion, wherein the threads of intelligent debate would be lost completely. You would spend all of your time in that election arguing whether a $5,000 limit or a $10,000 limit or a $100,000 limit, or wherever it might be, was the right limit, and you would never spend your time talking about the important issues facing your country.  Frankly, we are in a microcosm of that right now. We are arguing about the things that get in the way, I think, of more substantive issues.  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield, I wonder if the press would argue for more spending. They seem to believe--most of them--that spending is a tainting thing in our democracy. To the extent the campaigns are, basically, out of business, in terms of their own expenditures, to convey their own message to their own constituencies, would that not enhance the power of the press enormously?
