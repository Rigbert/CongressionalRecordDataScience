 President, I wish to pay tribute to my constituent COL Robert J. McAleer for his exemplary dedication to duty and his service to the U.S. Army and to the United States of America. He has served his last 2 years in the Army as Chief of the Army's Senate Liaison Division, representing the Army on Capitol Hill.  A native of Washington State, Colonel McAleer earned a commission as a distinguished graduate from the U.S. Military Academy in 1988. Colonel McAleer has served in a broad range of challenging operational assignments and an unusually diverse set of Army units: cannon artillery, rocket and missile, air defense, light infantry, cavalry, Ranger, Special Forces, and Stryker.  Colonel McAleer spent more than a decade overseas, including two tours each in Germany and Korea, and two 15-month tours in Iraq. As a lieutenant, he completed critical assignments in austere locations on the Demilitarized Zone in Korea. As a captain and major with the Army Special Operations Command, he participated in the detention of Bosnian war criminals, served as a fire support officer for twenty AC-130 gunship and similar missions in Kosovo, an operation to rescue American hostages in South America, and numerous exercises that served as blueprints for post-9/11 operations. In Iraq, as battalion operations officer and, later, Squadron Commander, he worked to secure dangerous areas in southwest Baghdad, Abu Ghraib, and then Diyala Province. His units were marked by their discipline, determination, purposeful operations, and focus on the needs of the civilian population. He led efforts in intelligence, governance, essential services, and reconciliation. As a colonel, serving as Chief of Future Operations for Combined Forces Command in Korea, he synchronized the U.S. and South Korean response to North Korea's artillery shelling of Yong Pyong Island, the death of Kim Jong Il, and a North Korean ballistic missile launch. He led major joint and international planning efforts on the Korean Peninsula to prepare military forces and governments for contingencies, especially in the areas of rear area logistics, noncombatant evacuation, and countering and preventing the use of weapons of mass destruction.  With the exception of his current assignment as an Army legislative liaison, Colonel McAleer spent his entire career in combat units, either in command or operations positions. He spent 6 years in command of four units: Bravo Battery 1-39 Field Artillery, Airborne; Bravo Battery 1-321 Field Artillery, Airborne; 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery; and Fires Squadron, 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment. A soldier's soldier, focused on his assigned mission and the wellbeing of those under his command, he touched thousands of lives, developing countless leaders and young soldiers in his units.  On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my colleagues today in recognizing and commending Colonel McAleer for over 26 years of service to his country. He played a key role in defending our national interests while positively impacting the soldiers and families under his command. He has been an excellent Army liaison to the Senate. We wish Bob, his wife Kate, daughter Catherine, and son Colin all the best as they continue their journey of service.                          ____________________
