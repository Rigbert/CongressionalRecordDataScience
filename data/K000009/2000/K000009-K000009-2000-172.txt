Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The amendment I am offering today would require the Department of Veterans Affairs by March 30 of next year to report to the Congress on the establishment and operation of their mental illness research, education and clinical centers. In addition, the report would include an accounting of the funds allocated by the Department for these centers and a description of the research activities carried out by these facilities.  Let me say that serious mental illness remains one of the most debilitating and costly scourges facing individuals who suffer, their families and friends and our Nation's communities. Among those who suffer are thousands and thousands of veterans. Nearly 2 years ago right outside these doors, Officers Gibson and Chestnut were gunned down just inside this Capitol by a man who suffered from serious mental illness. I asked myself then when would we as a Nation look this set of illnesses squarely in the eye and do what is required to unlock the mysteries that shroud medical understanding and treatment.  Importantly, at the direction of this Congress, the Department of Veterans Affairs has now opened eight mental illness research, education and clinical centers across our country. The Department is noted for so many scientific breakthroughs. I just want to also state for the record that three of the centers that currently operate were opened in 1997, three more in 1998, and the last two in 1999. In the 1999 selection process, there were eight applicants and of these, five merited site visits and two were considered outstanding and were approved.  But it is estimated that even with the opening of these centers, the Veterans Affairs budget for mental health research has remained flat for a decade and a half.  VA mental health research remains disproportionate to the utilization ofmental illness treatment services by veterans. In fact, in 1988 only 11 percent of all VA research was dedicated to chronic mental illness, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress syndrome, despite the fact that nearly 25 percent of patients in the system receive mental illness treatment. That is one system where people are actually being treated. The problem is we do not have answers to so many of these serious illnesses, illnesses like schizophrenia, illnesses like bipolar disorder, illnesses that do not go away but are in fact chemical imbalances of the central nervous system.  My amendment is an attempt to get the Department of Veterans Affairs to carefully focus on what they are doing to provide this Congress with a better understanding on the mission of each of the centers, their funding as well as their achievements so we can work hand in hand with the Department to help not just find answers for America's veterans but indeed to use the Department of Veterans Affairs to find answers for all those who suffer from these horrendous diseases here in our country.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1645
