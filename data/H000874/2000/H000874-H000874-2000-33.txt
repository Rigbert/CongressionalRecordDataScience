Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, there has been back and forth about who is responsible for this and who is responsible for that. Unfortunately, we do not have the time to fully develop those issues. We ought to in the long run. This is about passing a CR.  Everybody on my side of the aisle has voted for the last three CRs. They passed overwhelmingly. Keep the government functioning. We ought to keep the government functioning, but we ought to also, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) said, do the people's business.  What this debate is about, Mr. Speaker, is about the fact that we do not think we are doing the people's business. With all due respect to the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Young), the issue is not the funeral on Friday of my good and close friend and a great leader of this country who was tragically lost to us in an airplane crash, Governor Mel Carnahan, Saturday is available to us, Sunday is available to us, Monday is available to us, Tuesday is available to us. But we are not coming back until Tuesday at 6 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, essentially what our side of the aisle is saying, through the debate on this continuing resolution, is we ought to address some of the critical issues that had been pending in this House for 8 months and pending inthe Senate, pending in the Congress for 8 months. Yes, my colleagues have heard us talk about prescription drugs. Everybody says they are for prescription drugs, because we know the costs of drugs is driving seniors to Draconian choices in their lives.                              {time}  1645  But we are not passing a prescription drug bill, we are having a CR on going home for 5 days. We do not think that is right, Mr. Speaker. That is what this debate is about.  We talk about a Patients' Bill of Rights, so that HMOs are not telling doctors and patients what kind of medical care they ought to get, and that they have access to emergency care and they can make choices.  The gentleman from Arizona says our educational debate is about who makes the choices, ``bureaucrats,'' used as an epithet, or the people at home. The fact of the matter is on the school construction program, guess what, who makes the choices? The people at home. If they do not build schools, that is their choice. If they do not want to put on more classrooms, that is their choice. We do not force them to do anything. If they do not need teachers and do not hire teachers, we do not force them to.  Get off my back with this rhetoric that is phony on choices. None of these programs we are talking about force locals to do anything, and the gentleman knows it, but he thinks it is good political rhetoric. I understand that.  This CR is about whether we are going to do the people's business. That is what this debate is about. I think, as I said, that this CR may pass. If it does not pass, then we ought to pass a second CR until Monday night and come back Saturday, after we observe the funeral for Mel Carnahan, and do our work on Saturday; and yes, go to church Sunday morning, come here in the afternoon, and do the people's business.  Mr. Speaker, that is what this debate is about, not about a CR which says we have not done our business, and therefore we are going to continue government in operation until Tuesday night or Wednesday night. We all agree on that. It is about whether we are going to go away from here 2\1/2\ weeks after we said we were going to adjourn without doing the critical business on the public's agenda.  That is what this debate has been about, that is what this discussion is about; not to look at the past, at what has been done and who is responsible or who is not. It is about, Mr. Speaker, whether we are going to pass these critical programs: prescription drugs, campaign finance reform, education, more teachers, more classrooms, smaller sizes, particularly for young children, which all the experts say need specific attention.  If they get it, we will lift them up and make them better students in the upper grades. We will therefore have a better America and a more competitive America. That is what this discussion on this CR is about.  I would hope we would defeat this CR, Mr. Speaker. I would hope we would defeat this CR. Then, Mr. Speaker, because I know the gentleman is a man of such good will and purpose and responsibility, I would ask the chairman that we come back on the floor, pass the CR until Monday night, as the gentleman from Massachusetts wanted to do, come back here Saturday, do our work, come back here Sunday afternoon, do our work, come back here Monday, and perhaps be able to leave.  If the gentleman does not agree with the President, fine, send him a bill. Let him veto it, and criticize him. I do not know why Members do not send the bills. I have a hunch that they are afraid that the American public will say he is right and they are wrong, so they do not send the bills down. I hope this CR is defeated, Mr. Speaker.
