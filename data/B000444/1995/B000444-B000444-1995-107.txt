 When the terrorism bill passed several months ago, Senator DeWine, with the unanimous consent of the U.S. Senate, authorized a technical assistance program for the FBI to upgrade their computers and a number of other things, a technical upgrade for the FBI. Senator DeWine has come to me and asked me whether I would be willing to include not the full funding of that amount, but $60 million as opposed to the $200 million that was authorized. I am more than happy to do that.  The offset for that is the money that, quite frankly, has been saved as a consequence of the adoption of the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico relating to Legal Services. So it does not require an offset. It has been agreed to by Senator Hollings--agreed to in the sense that I am able to modify this amendment, and I believe it has been agreed to by the majority to modify it.  I am asking to be able to modify my amendment, which is pending, with the DeWine language that I have sent to the desk.
