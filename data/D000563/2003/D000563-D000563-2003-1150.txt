President, I say to my colleague from the State of Ohio, I tuned in to that game in the final minute of the regular game and was watching as one of the Miami running backs was injured. It appeared the game was going to end with Miami being the winner. I agree with the Senator from Ohio, it was one of the most exciting college football games I have ever seen. Of course, being from Illinois, since our signature university is one of the 11 members of the Big Ten, we are particularly proud that another team from the Big Ten is the national champion, and the Ohio State Buckeyes certainly did us proud that evening. I am sure Senator DeWine is very happy about that outcome and proud of what they did as well.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I appreciate my colleague's comment. I just knew my colleague from Illinois, another Big Ten school, would be rooting for the Buckeyes that day.
