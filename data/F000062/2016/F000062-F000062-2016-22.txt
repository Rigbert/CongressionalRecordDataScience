 President, I wish to speak about the importance of recognizing the reality of climate change.  The truth is that manmade climate change is real. This past May was the planet's warmest May in the 136-year history of weather records. In fact, the last 13 months in a row all set world records for hottest average temperatures. Last year was the planet's hottest recorded year, and the last two decades include the 19 hottest years on record. Sea levels rose 7 inches in the last century. And, since the beginning of the industrial era, the acidity of the oceans has increased by 26 percent, which could destabilize the food chain.  My own home State of California is seeing firsthand the effects of higher temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. We are in the midst of an epic drought, which scientists say has been made 15-20 percent worse due to human-induced changes in the climate. This has made a drought into a disaster. The wildfires in California are made even more terrifying by the hot, dry conditions. And the fire season now lasts 75 days longer than just 10 years ago, resulting in more and larger fires.  As urgent as this issue is, it is not a surprise. We have seen these changes coming from a long way off. Scientists employed by the oil company Exxon were warning the company's leadership about climate change as early as 1977, writing that: ``There is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels.''  Even before that, White House scientific advisers first cautioned about climate change in 1965, explaining that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels would ``almost certainly cause significant changes'' and ``could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings.''  And as far back as 1956, the New York Times reported early evidence connecting climate change with greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion. That prescient article concluded with a sad commentary: ``Coal and oil are still plentiful and cheap in many parts of the world, and there is every reason to believe that both will be consumed by industry as long as it pays to do so.''  Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, many in the Senate refuse to accept that climate change is caused by human activity. During the Keystone Pipeline debate at the end of 2014, a majority of Senators revealed they were in denial about climate change. Over the course of three votes on resolutions concerning climate change. All but one Senator could agree that climate change is ``real.'' However, only 14 Republican Senators agreed that human activity contributes to climate change, and only five of those Republican Senators would agree that human activity significantly contributes to climate change. This denial of the link between our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change makes political action very difficult.  Several of my colleagues have spoken about organizations and industries that have actively contributed to the political denial of climate change. These coordinated campaigns to obscure the facts and defeat legislative solutions have succeeded in delaying action.  However, whether we act now to forestall the worst changes or we are forced to react to the refugees and the floods and the fires after the fact, there is no escaping that we must reckon with the reality of climate change.  Fortunately, we have already demonstrated that political progress is possible. For example, California has implemented several policies to address the problem, including a cap-and-trade program to return statewide emissions back to their 1990 levels by 2020, a renewable portfolio standard requiring 50 percent renewable electricity by 2030, regulations to double energy efficiency by 2030, a low-carbon fuel standard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels at least 10 percent by 2020, and a program to reach 1 million zero-emission vehicles by 2020.  Here is the thing: Even as California is implementing these policies, the State continues to grow. The State's economy grew by 2.8 percent last year, and unemployment was reduced by 1.3 percent. Both of those figures are better than the national average.  Combating climate change will grow our national economy; ignoring the reality will only weaken it. We will all be forced to recognize the reality of climate change sooner or later. The faster we act, the easier it will be to avoid catastrophic disasters, disruptions, and dislocations.  This problem requires the sincere, informed collaboration individuals, businesses, and every level of government. It is hard to undertake such a collaboration, however, when well-financed special interests dig in their heels, and place profits over the public's needs.  We are out of time.  Let's end the denial of climate change and start building sustainable energy, water, and transportation infrastructure. This transformation will be good for our businesses and communities, and it is what the next generation needs.                          ____________________
