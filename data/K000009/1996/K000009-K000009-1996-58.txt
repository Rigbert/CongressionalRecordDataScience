Speaker, I would like to yield to the distinguished Member from the great State of Montana, Mr. Williams, who announced a little earlier in the month that he would not be returning after this year, and that is a great disappointment, not just to myself as a Member of this body, but to every person in this country.  Few know this man. Let me say to the people of Montana, you sent the best.  Now you can say whatever you want to say.
