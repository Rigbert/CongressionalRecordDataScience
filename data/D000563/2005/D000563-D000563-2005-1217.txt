I would like to ask a question through the Chair. I am heartened by the fact that this is such a strong bipartisan effort. I salute Senator Craig, in particular, who joined us in the press conference as soon as there was an announcement of this shortfall, and I salute your efforts to bring this issue before the Senate which you have worked on diligently for months.  You made a particular reference to post-traumatic stress disorder, which is a concern I have within the Veterans' Administration. I would like to ask you if you believe these additional funds will allow the Veterans' Administration to put appropriate professional staff at clinics and hospitals to deal with veterans not only from wars in the past but currently coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as family therapy for their families, if they are faced with this disorder.
