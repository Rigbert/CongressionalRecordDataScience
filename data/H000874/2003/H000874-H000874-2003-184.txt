Chairman, I thank the chairman for his comments and would remind my colleagues that we have given billions of dollars to the airlines, these are billion dollar corporations, as a result of 9-11. These three little airports, plus National Airport, are the only private business people so situated in the airline industry who have not received compensation. And they, unlike the airlines per se, are losing their entire investments because of their inability to operate these airlines.  I appreciate the chairman's observations with respect to the equities of the claim here. I also appreciate the observation of the chairman and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia that we may be subject to a lawsuit which we would lose because this is in fact an effective taking of their property without due process. None of these folks want to damage the security of this region or the White House or the Capitol. They understand our concern. But we certainly need to compensate them.  In light of the fact the chairman has indicated his willingness to work with us to try to ensure the funding, I believe $8.2 million which we have in here is the approximate amount for National, a larger sum, and then a much smaller sum for the other three; and I believe that the sum from which we have taken it will not in any way adversely affect the Transportation Department's building going forward because of the scheduling of those expenditures; but because the chairman has made that representation, I will withdraw the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment at this time.
