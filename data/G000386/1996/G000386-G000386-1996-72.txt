 President, my amendment says that H.R. 1350 subsidies, and that is $1 billion in total, cannot be used for campaign contributions, cannot be used for lobbying and cannot be used for so-called public education. Congress has supported similar restrictions on different bills and programs in the past, but we have no such restrictions for this $1 billion subsidy in this bill.  It was suggested last week that we provide for this. It could be done by a line item. If that is what is wanted, then I suggest to the proponents to put that in the bill, but it isn't in the bill.  So, consequently, I think we should make sure we don't allow these funds to be back-doored by the Maritime Administration for campaign contributions and for lobbying. Without this restriction, that is not certain.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
