 President, earlier this year, millions of people were affected when the Obama administration was hit by a devastating cyber attack. It is an attack that has been described as ``one of the worst breaches in U.S. history,'' but it is hardly the last one we will face.  The challenges posed by cyber attacks are real, and they are broad. They threaten governments, businesses, and individuals. Americans see these threats in the public sector. For instance, as reports have indicated, the sensitive personal information of millions who purchase insurance through ObamaCare is especially vulnerable. Americans see these threats in the private sector as well. For instance, despite the cyber deal recently agreed upon between China and the administration, press reports indicate that Chinese hacking attempts on American companies and businesses appear to be continuing unabated. Americans also know that a cyber attack is essentially a personal attack on their own privacy. It is violating to think of strangers digging through our medical records and emails. It is worrying to think of criminals accessing credit card numbers and Social Security information.  That is why the Senate will again consider bipartisan legislation to help Americans' most private and personal information. It would do so by defeating cyber attacks through the sharing of information. It contains modern tools that cybersecurity experts tell us could help prevent future attacks against both public and private sectors. It contains important measures to protect individual privacy and civil liberties. It has been carefully scrutinized by Senators of both parties. In short, this legislation is strong, transparent, and bipartisan. Republicans and Democrats joined together to pass this legislation through committee, the administration supports it, and the House has already passed similar legislation. With a little cooperation, we can pass it here shortly as well.  The chair of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, is working to set votes on pending amendments and has accommodated other Senators in the form of a substitute amendment. I wish to thank him for his hard work on this legislation. I wish to also thankthe vice chair, Senator Feinstein, as well. Every Senator should want to protect Americans' most private and personal information, which means every Senator should want to see this bill pass. With a little cooperation, we will.                          ____________________
