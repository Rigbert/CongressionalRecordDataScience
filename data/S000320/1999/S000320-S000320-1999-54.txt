 President, I was pleased to support that designation in the drafting of S. 1143, and was particularly impressed that it is projected to reduce the cost of winter storm maintenance by 10% in Southeast Michigan, reduce weather-related accidents by 10%, as well as reduce by 5% the amount of salt used on those roads, while also creating a model for other states to improve their snow removal operations. Because of that, I believe that the Federal Highway Administration should consider the SEMSIM project as the top priority project within that $4 million distribution to Southeast Michigan.
