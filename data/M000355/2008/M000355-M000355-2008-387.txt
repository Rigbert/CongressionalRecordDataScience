 President, let me say my expectation is that the amendments that will be offered to the bill will be housing-related, but I am not in a position at the beginning of the bill to enter into such a consent agreement. I think there is a widespread feeling on both sides of the aisle that we need to get an accomplishment here, that we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. But I am not in a position other than to say to my good friend that is my expectation. I am not in a position to agree to such a consent here at the outset of the bill.
