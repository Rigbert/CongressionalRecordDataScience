Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 223, line 22, after the dollar amount, insert      ``(increased by $4,356,000) (reduced by $4,356,000)''.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 436, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico.  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, today I rise to speak on behalf of the bipartisan amendment No. 41 to division C of the Defense appropriations division to H.R. 2740.  My amendment seeks to provide an increase of $4,356,000 to further support the Department of Defense's Innovative Readiness Training program, bringing its total recommended funding level for fiscal year 2020 to $30 million. This proposed increase is made possible by reducing the Operation and Maintenance, Defense-wide account by the same amount.  The Innovative Readiness Training program, IRT program, is a Department of Defense military training opportunity, exclusive to the United States and its territories, that delivers joint opportunities to increase deployment readiness.  Simultaneously, IRT provides key services with lasting benefits for communities across our Nation, thus strengthening the bonds between the American people and the U.S. military.  Each year, this program enhances deployment readiness for approximately 7,000 servicemembers by providing hands-on, real-world training experience for mission-essential tasks, often in remote or underserved areas across the country.  Military units have an opportunity to refine their engineering, healthcare, diving, and transportation skills by performing services and developing projects for American communities that otherwise would not have the resources to conduct them on their own.  In 2018, the services led 39 missions across the United States. My constituents in Puerto Rico are among those who have greatly benefited from this program.  A year after Hurricane Maria devastated our island, 200 servicemembers participated in two of these missions to provide no-cost medical and construction services to local residents.  Through the Ola de Esperanza Sanadora mission, they assisted local authorities in providing medical, dental, and optometry care to over 3,800 patients. Similarly, they partnered with Habitat for Humanity to build a three-family home designed to resist hurricanes in the Quintana neighborhood of San Juan.  Earlier this year, the 1st Mission Support Command and the U.S. Army Reserve Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico soldiers joined more than 500 members from different DOD components in a mission on the island that provided medical service to over 9,000 patients, delivered over 2,000 eyeglasses, and completed over 10,000 medical procedures.  Participating units, therefore, increased their readiness and obtained valuable, hands-on training experience while helping thousands of their fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico receive the care they need.  Other communities across the Nation have also benefited greatly from this program. In Alaska, as an example, the program supports missions like Operation Arctic Care, which provided roving medical and dental care to rural and Alaska Native villages.  In the Northern Mariana Islands--and I want to thank Congressman Sablan for being an original cosponsor of this amendment--these missions have helped renovate and improve the Tinian Health Clinic.  In Mississippi, this mission has partnered with a local foundation in a multi-year mission to build a special-needs camp.  Given how these missions have been vital in improving our servicemembers' readiness while simultaneously offering quality services to thousands of Americans, I strongly believe Congress should provide as much support as possible for the program. This amendment seeks to do that.  I commend Chairman Visclosky, Ranking Member Calvert, and the House Appropriations Committee for including a $10 million increase above the President's budget request, and my amendment simply seeks to complete this effort by providing an additional increase to bring the program total budget to $30 million, consistent with the recommended funding level in the Senate version for the fiscal year 2020.  Madam Chair, I want to conclude by thanking my colleague CongressmanSablan from the Northern Mariana Islands for cosponsoring my amendment. I urge my colleagues to join this effort, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR.
