President, the Greater Tulsa Area Hispanic Affairs Commission was established in 1979 by law by the city of Tulsa and Tulsa County. The commission was established due to the leadership and commitment of its founding members who include Mrs. Aurora Ramierez Helton, Mr. Jack Helton, Rev. Victor Orta, Dr. Luis Reinoso, Dr. Chris Romero, Mr. Joe Rodriguez and Mr. Carlos Vargas. The commission also was established thanks to the unconditional support of the then mayor of the city of Tulsa, James M. Inhofe, his chief of staff, Richard Soudriette, and the members of the Tulsa County Commission.  This year the Greater Tulsa Hispanic Affairs Commission celebrates its 25th anniversary. On this occasion it is important to recognize the accomplishments of the commission such as it was only the second commission of its type to be established in the U.S.A. The commission has helped countless people in the Hispanic community in Tulsa to find help in the areas of health, education and economic development. Also, the commission has played a fundamental role in promoting the values and cultural richness of the Hispanic community in Tulsa. The commission has organized numerous community festivals and cultural programs and has actively promoted teaching of Spanish, as well as English. Finally, the commission aided in the establishment of the sister city program between Tulsa, OK, and San Luis Potosi, Mexico, that to this day promotes friendship and understanding between the people of the United States of America and Mexico.  Today, I, James M. Inhofe, United States Senator (R-OK) on behalf of my colleagues, do hereby congratulate the members of the Greater Tulsa Hispanic Affairs Commission on the occasion of their 25th anniversary. Also, I wish the commission well in its important work to promote greater understanding and appreciation of Hispanic heritage. Furthermore, I want to recognize the work of the commission to promote the cultural diversity of our Hispanic community, which plays such a vital part of the history of the city of Tulsa, the State of Oklahoma, and the United States of America.                          ____________________
