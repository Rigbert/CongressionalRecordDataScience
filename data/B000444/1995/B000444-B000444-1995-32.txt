 And there is one other piece of this. After years of hearings, extensive hearings on the issue of violent crime in America--I realize it does not mean much in the new process; you just do appropriations--but after years of hearings, there are only a few things that we know about crime. The Senator, as a former prosecutor, knows this better than the Senator from Delaware. If there is a cop on one corner, and there is not a cop on the other, it is much more likely that the crime will be committed where the cop is not. I mean it sounds bizarre. We do not know that much about criminal behavior except we know that where there are cops and where there is light there is less crime--prevention of crime; let alone the arrest and prosecution, prevention of crime.  So the purpose of the 100,000 cops and the purpose for the request from the cops was that they are outmanned, they are outgunned, and they are outwitted because of all the array of technology, the new and the different nature of crime in America. That is why we need more cops. That is why they asked for them.
