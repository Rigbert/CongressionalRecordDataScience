 President, let me say briefly a warm welcome to the new Senator from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso. He has big shoes to fill with our departed colleague Craig Thomas. I am sure he is up to it. Given the average age of this institution, it is certainly good to have another physician in the Senate. An orthopedic surgeon may be particularly useful. I had a chance to meet with the new Senator this morning. He is a bright, capableperson. I commend the Governor of Wyoming for an outstanding choice and look forward to serving with the Senator for many years.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The majority leader is recognized.
