Mr. Speaker, what happened in New York at the World Trade Center and at the Pentagon yesterday is unreal. It is shocking. It is unbelievable. But it did happen.  Mr. Speaker, we stand together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as citizens of the world, as Americans, as brothers and sisters. We are a circle of trust that cannot be broken. We are one people. We are one family. We are one Nation.  But we must send the strongest possible message to the terrorists and to all of those who participated in this unbelievable conspiracy, this madness. Terrorists may destroy our buildings, terrorists may harm and kill our people, but terrorists will never, ever destroy the spirit of freedom and our love for democracy.  Our Nation is strong and determined. We will never turn back; no, we will never turn back from our commitment to a free and open society and our determination for a world community at peace with itself.  Those who engage in this madness will be tracked down, and they will be brought to justice. And for those who are hurt and for the families who lost loved ones in this unspeakable tragedy, they are in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time.  Mr. Speaker, today on this day, we pray for our people and we pray for our Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution.
