The answer the vast majority of Americans would give is no. That is one of our amendments.  Do my colleagues think we should put more resources into protecting the United States through the Department of Homeland Security and through law enforcement, even local law enforcement, and the FBI? I think so. That is another one of our amendments.  A third amendment is going to change the effort and zero in on what we consider to be gaps in the law that allow the possibility of foreign travelers to come to the United States and engage in violence and terrorism.  The fourth one is pretty controversial, but I think we need a vote in the Senate. There has been a proposal by one Republican Presidential candidate, for the first time in the history of the United States of America, to exclude any immigrant of a specific religion, and that religion, of course, is for those who are in adherence to the Muslim religion. We should have a vote on that. I think it is important for us to be on the record. Those are the amendments we would like to offer.  We said to Senator McConnell: Bring up your Syrian refugee bill, if you wish, and give us these four votes. If you will give us these four votes--of course, you will want to offer some of your own amendments. Be our guest. But let's have a real debate about making America safe. Let's not just zero in on Syrian refugees. Let's zero in on ISIS, on terrorism, and on the real threat to the United States.  That is what we will decide between now and 2:30. Will Senator McConnell, who has said over and over that he wants to open the Senate floor to an amendment process, allow our votes on these measures? If he will, we can engage in this debate. If he won't, then, frankly, there is going to be resistance to moving to this measure. I hope Senator McConnell will join us and open this debate to a real sincere effort to stop the threat of terrorism in the United States.  I yield the floor.
