 President, I am sorry the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Virginia, has to listen to me twice on the same subject.  When I am referring to a bill, I am referring to the 2,000-page House bill.  Small business is very vital to the health of our economy. The President and I agree that 70 percent of new private sector jobs are created by small business. Small business is the employment machine of the American economy. However, where the President and I differ is, I believe small business taxes should be lowered, not raised, to get our economy back on track. You will hear from my discussion, this 2,000-page bill raises taxes on small business.  The President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have proposed increasing the top marginal tax rates from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, respectively. We can see that on the chart under the proposed Obama budget, 39.6 percent is where they would raise them. They have also proposed increasing the tax rates on capital gains and dividends to 20 percent and providing for an estate tax rate as high as 45 percent and an exemption of that estate tax of $3.5 million. Also, the President and congressional Democrats have called for fully reinstating the personal exemption phase-out. I will refer to the personal exemption phase-out as PEP. They would do that for those making more than $200,000 a year. In addition, they have called for fully reinstating the limitation on itemized deductions, which is known as Pease after a former Congressman Pease of Ohio, for those making also more than $200,000.  Under the 2001 tax law, PEPs and Pease are scheduled to be completely phased out in 2010. That means the tax rate for current 35-percent-rate taxpayers would go up, as we can see on the chart, to 41 percent. For the vast majority of people who earn less than $200,000, raising taxes on high earners might not sound so bad. However, this means many small businesses will be hit with a higher tax bill. From the standpoint of it being where they create 70 percent of the new jobs, that is bad not only for those taxpayers, that is bad for the entire economy.  As if this was not bad enough for small business, the tax increases I have already talked about, the House Democrats, in this 2,000-page health care reform bill, have proposed a new surtax of 5.4 percent. With this small business surtax, a family of four in the top bracket will pay a marginal tax rate of 46.4 percent by the year 2011. So we go from current law of 35 percent to automatically, if Congress doesn't intervene, 39.6 percent; and then eliminate the PEPs and Pease, 41 percent; and then do what the House Democrats want to do, 46.4 percent, a marginal tax rate that is very high and very negative to employment by small business.  This tax change would result, cumulatively, in an increase of marginal tax rates of 33 percent, a 33-percent increase over what taxes people pay right now.  Owners of the many small businesses, whether regular--which could be so-called C corporations--or other entities that receive dividends or realize capital gains, would face a 25-percent rate increase under this House bill. So we have a 15-percent capital gains rate today on dividends going up almost 70 percent by January 1, 2011.  Campaign promises are pretty important. Candidate Obama pledged on the campaign trail that:       Everyone in America--everyone--will pay lower taxes than      they would under rates Bill Clinton had in the 1990s.  That is quite a promise. That is good for business, if it is lower than what Bill Clinton had. The small business surtax proposed by House Democrats, however, violates President Obama's pledge he made as a candidate. Therefore, I want Members to know I stand with President Obama in opposing the small business surtax proposed by House Democrats in this bill, this 2,000-page bill.  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses--they made a survey--their data shows that 50 percent of the owners of small businesses that employ 20 to 249 workers would fall into the top bracket. The red bar shows 50 percent of all small employers fall into that bracket. According to the Small Business Administration, about two-thirds of the Nation's small business workers are employed by small businesses with 20 to 500 employees.  Do we want to raise taxes on these small businesses that create new jobs and employ two-thirds of all small business workers?  In his radio address a few months ago, the President noted small businesses are hurting. They are hurting because we are helping Wall Street, but we are not helping Main Street with all the things we are doing in Congress. Of course, there is no argument from this side of the aisle on that point.  President Obama recognized in that speech the credit crunch on small businesses continues, despite hundreds of billions in bailout money to big banks. With these small businesses already suffering from the credit crunch, do we want to think it is wise to hit them with a double whammy of a 33-percent increase in their marginal tax rate?  Just yesterday, we received data from the nonpartisan official congressional tax scorekeepers, the Joint Committee on Taxation, that said $1 out of every $3 raised by the massive $461 billion House surtax--and that is in this 2,000-page bill--would come from small businesses. That is a conservative, a very conservative estimate because other kinds of income that these business owners receive, such as capital gains and dividends, are not included in that figure.  If the proponents of the marginal rate increase on small business owners agree that a 33-percent tax increase for half--half--the small businesses that employ two-thirds of all small business workers is not wise, then they should either oppose these tax increases or present data that shows different results.  This House bill of 2,000 pages and the surtax included in it piles on the heavy taxes small businesses will face. In a time when many businesses are struggling to stay afloat, does it make sense to impose an additional burden on them by raising their taxes? Odds are, they will cut spending. In other words, the small businesses will cut spending. They will cancel orders for new equipment, cut health insurance for their employees, stop hiring, and lay off people.  Instead of seeking to raise taxes on those who create jobs in our economy, our policies need to focus on reducing excessive tax and regulatory barriers that stand in the way of small businesses and the private sector making investments, expanding production, and creating sustainable jobs--creating sustainable jobs, which is what I refer to as small business being the job-creating miracle of our economy.  So I want you to know, regardless of this 2,000-page House bill, with these big tax increases in it, I will continue to fight to prevent a dramatic tax increase on our Nation's job engine, the small businesses of America.  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will follow accordingly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the Joint Committee on Taxation, backing up some of the figures I used in my speech, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2009.                               Memorandum     To: Mark Prater, Nick Wyatt, and Jim Lyons     From: Tom Barthold     Subject: Revenue Estimate       This memorandum is in response to your request of October      30, 2009, for an estimate of the percentage of revenue raised      from the 5.4-percent AGI surtax included in the ``Affordable      Health Care for America Act'' attributable to business      income.       For purposes of this analysis, business income consists of      income from sole proprietorships (Schedule C); farm income      (Schedule F); and income from rental real estate, royalties,      partnerships, subchapter S corporations, estates and trusts,      and real estate mortgage investment conduits (Schedule E), as      would be reported on lines 12, 17, and 18 of the 2008 Form      1040. We do not count as ``business income'' income from      interest, dividends, or capital gains that may flow through      certain pass-through entities but which is reported elsewhere      on an individual's return.       Under the ``Affordable Health Care for America Act,'' a      5.4-percent surtax would be imposed on adjusted gross income      (``AGI'') in excess of $500,000 ($1,000,000 in the case of a      married taxpayer filing a joint return). For purposes of      responding to your request, we have assumed that net positive      business income is ``stacked'' last relative to the other     income components of AGI. For example, a married taxpayer      filing jointly with $2 million of AGI including $500,000 of      net business income would have one-half of the taxpayer's      $54,000 surtax liability under the ``Affordable Health Care      for America Act'' attributed to the taxpayer's net business      income.       We estimate that one-third of the $460.5 billion estimated      to be raised in fiscal years 2011-2019 from the 5.4-percent      AGI surtax under the ``Affordable Health Care for America      Act'' is attributed to business income.
