Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Riverside Community College District, located in Riverside, California, for their innovative education initiative, Passport to College, which makes college education a reality for the students of six school districts in Riverside County. The Passport to College program is being honored at a White House ceremony today as one of ten exemplary educational programs in the United States. The president is using this ceremony as an opportunity to demonstrate to the nation educational programs that are worthy of duplication.  In 1996, Riverside Community College District began the program working with fifth graders in the Riverside, Alvord, Corona-Norco, Jurupa, Moreno Valley and Val Verde unified school districts. If the fifth graders follow the program guidelines and graduate from high school, Riverside Community College District has pledged free tuition and fee assistance. This amounts to 12,000 eligible students participating in the program. In addition, working with local universities, the Passport to College Program has secured the commitment of La Sierra University, California Baptist College, and the University of California, Riverside to provide $2,500 a year in scholarships for graduates of the program who transfer to their schools. The University of Redlands has pledged $5,000 per year in scholarship assistance.  Today's youth are our leaders of tomorrow, and Passport to College is a model program that demonstrates what can be achieved when a community comes together. Riverside Community College District recognized a need to help children understand at a young age that college is available for everyone. All that is required is some hard work and commitment. When we hear about the poor state of education in our country, or the problems with the youth of today, think about the success of this program and the lofty goals it is working hard to accomplish. The program achieves two very important objectives by involving parents in their childrens' education from a very early age, and making students begin to think about the importance of college early in their academic careers.  Dr. Salvatore Rotella, President of the Riverside Community College District, Amy Cardulo, Director of the Passport-to-College program, and all of those participating are to be commended for their dedication and hard work to ensure the success of future generations. The success of this program is due to the hard work and tenacity of both administrators and students. On behalf of the residents of the 43rd Congressional District, I would like to congratulate them on the Passport-to-College program and wish them continued success in the future. They are a credit to their community, their state, and their nation.                          ____________________
