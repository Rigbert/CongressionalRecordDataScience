Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I will compliment the gentleman on the statement. He and I worked very closely on these issues in committee, and he is a great friend of Alaska natives and most people involved in American native group.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
