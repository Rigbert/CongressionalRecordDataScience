Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand before you today to commend Boni Fine for her service to the community. Boni will be recognized for her outstanding commitment to the residents of the First Congressional District by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of Northwest Indiana, at its annual Circle of Friends Event, held on October 19, 2011.  Throughout her accomplished career, Boni has held several prestigious positions, allowing her to demonstrate the skills and business acumen developed as she earned her Master of Business Administration degree from Pepperdine University. Her professional experience includes Director of Personnel for the Daily Telegraph in London; President and Publisher of the Post-Tribune in Merrillville, Indiana; and Vice President of Strategic Development/Advertising for the Sun-Times News Group in Chicago, Illinois. Moreover, her bachelor degree in social work from Syracuse University and her work as a child welfare caseworker established the foundation upon which Boni built her tireless enthusiasm for improving the quality of life for our area's youth.  Boni's resume highlights many of the organizations in which she participates and children in Northwest Indiana are most fortunate to have benefitted from her championing their cause. Not only has she previously chaired the Juvenile Diabetes Association's Walk to Cure, she was a founding member of the Children's Literacy Academy at Indiana University Northwest. Further, she has served on the Executive Board of the Boys and Girls Club of Northwest Indiana. Most recently, Boni served as the Interim Executive Director for the YWCA of Northwest Indiana, and it is for her work with this organization that she is being honored.  The YWCA of Northwest Indiana traces its roots to a branch office that had been located at 30 East 6th Avenue in Gary. Founded in 1921 with a strong commitment to serve, the organization has become a well-established institution serving the community for ninety years. Currently, the YWCA of Northwest Indiana is governed by an all-female Board of Directors committed to offering programs to young women that foster their talents and serving as professional role models whom these young women may emulate. Under Boni's leadership, this local YWCA has provided programs such as the Yes We Can, a youth program to promote academic achievement among at-risk children. Additionally, the YWCA of Northwest Indiana offers a mentoring program for teen girls in Gary in which students are paired with professional women in order to empower them and set them upon a path of success. Although this is only a brief overview of the extraordinary efforts undertaken by all individuals involved in the day-to-day operations of the YWCA of Northwest Indiana, it is important to note that they illustrate Boni's genuine devotion to its vision: to transform lives by mobilizing our diverse community to provide vibrant opportunities and experiences that strive to diminish racial and gender disparities in health, education, and wealth attainment, while preparing future generations to sustain these endeavors.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Boni Fine for her exceptional community service. I know that Boni will continue to touch the lives of numerous people, and for her selfless, lifelong service, she is to be commended.                          ____________________
