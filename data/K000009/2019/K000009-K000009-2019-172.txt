Chair, I thank the Gentlewoman from New York for writing such a strong State Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill. You are a truly able chair. The base bill and report contain $500,000 for Grass Carp control and this amendment doubles down on that investment, by providing an additional $500,000 for a total of $1 million for the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission to manage Grass Carp.  Much of the countries Asian Carp focus has been on stopping the Big-Head Carp, but let us not forget that the Grass Carp pose an existential threat to the economic future of the Great Lakes.  This threat is not theoretical. Just a few weeks ago, we found Grass Carp larva in the Maumee River. Every day, fisherman remove Grass Carp from the Lakes.  To understand just how dangerous the Grass Carp are, it is important to understand that on average, they consume 50 percent of their body weight of vegetation in just one day.  Think about those numbers. A five-pound grass carp consumes 2.5 pounds of vegetation in a single day.  While Grass Carp present a deadly threat to the Great Lakes fishery today, far too few resources have been allocated to the Grass Carp.  The Great Lakes Fisheries commission is an ideal partner to control this bi-national threat. The commission operates in coordination across our national borders to protect both American and Canadian fisheries.  The biodiversity, commercial and recreational fishery on the Great Lakes are threatened by the Grass Carp.  The Great Lakes Fishery Commission has a long history of controlling invasive species across the American-Canadian border.  This amendment fills critical gaps and I urge my colleagues to support it.                          ____________________
