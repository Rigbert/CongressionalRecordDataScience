The Canadians have said that they are going to increase production up in Alberta. They want to go to four to five million barrels a day. And they have the buyers. Let's face it. Wouldn't we rather have that pipeline come down to the Midwest and have us refine it here and be able to sell a cheaper product to Americans than have it come from overseas some place else? And if we're not going to buy it from them, and the Canadians told me this, they are going to build a pipeline out to the Pacific. They are going to put it on one of those big freighters. They're going to spend a lot of carbon going up into the air shipping it to someplace else, China, Korea, Japan or some place else. Let's have it come here. We'll actually save energy. We will help pollution wise in terms of reducing greenhouse gases from where it otherwise would have gone. And our consumers will be a lot better off.  And with that, I yield now to the gentleman from Georgia.
