 President, I rise today to celebrate the remarkable season recently completed by the Lady Tigers of Campbellsville University, located in the town of Campbellsville, Kentucky. While many are more familiar with the Kentucky basketball dynasties built in places like Louisville and Lexington, Campbellsville has a pretty impressive run of its own going.  Nationally ranked all year, the Lady Tigers completed their regular season with a record of 21-7. Winning both the Mid-South Conference Regular Season and Tournament titles earned Campbellsville an automatic bid to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) championship tournament in Jackson, Tennessee. This is the ninth consecutive season that Campbellsville has qualified for the national tournament.  The Lady Tigers opened the NAIA national tournament by defeating Big State Conference Tournament Champion LeTourneau University 95-56 in the first round and then defeated Oklahoma City University in the Second Round by a score of 69-51. The Lady Tigers were finally stopped in the quarterfinals by four-time defending National Champion, Southern Nazarene University of Oklahoma, in a heartbreaker, 72-67.  Throughout the season, the Lady Tigers were led by Mid South Conference Player of the Year Shannon Wathen, and All-Conference teammates Julie Jeffries and Farrah Sullivan. Together, this senior triumvirate combined to average over thirty nine-points and fifteen rebounds per game. Post-season honors were also bestowed on Coach Donna Wise, who has led Campbellsville to nine consecutive national tournament births and ranks second in wins among active NAIA coaches with 475.  Mr. President, Coach Wise has built a national powerhouse women's basketball program in Campbellsville, a small town in Central Kentucky. I hope my colleagues will join me in offering congratulations to Coach Wise, her players, and everyone associated with the Campbellsville Lady Tigers on another great season.                          ____________________
