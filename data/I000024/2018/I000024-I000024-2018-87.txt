President, first of all, I appreciate the comments by the Senator from South Dakota. I think the point is, this is the most important bill of the year.  I want to make only a couple of comments, and I was hoping to make these comments while the Senator from Tennessee was still here. One is that I have a disagreement because he mentioned that this bill--the most important bill of the year--is very often not considered until November or December. The absolute deadline is the end of December. I can remember getting within 2 or 3 days of that deadline in the past, and, if that happened, then our flyers wouldn't get flight pay or there would no longer be any hazard pay. There were a lot of things we would have to give up that we couldn't afford to give up.  We made a commitment--and it wasn't just me by myself; it was with the Senator from Rhode Island, who is handling the bill on the Democratic side--that we wanted to have amendments. We preferred not to have nongermane amendments, and that would be my goal, if I am around here next year when we do this, to lay groundwork so that we don't have nongermane amendments. As I said, this is a bill that will pass. Normally, for things that don't pass any other way, if they can get them on as amendments, they can get them passed.  We have the same situation happening right now, not just with Senator Corker but also with Senator Rand Paul and the Senator from Utah. That wasn't going to work either way. The problem I had with Senator Corker's change was it was a very long change that changed the underlying bill, and, as was pointed out by the Senator from South Dakota, that would mean we would have to go back over to the House. I don't feel comfortable doing that when we have all of those kids out there who are looking at pay raises and wondering what is really happening in Washington. Is there really not the support we anticipated that they all had?  I am sincere when I say this; he isn't here now, but I said it when he was here. If Senator Corker wants to get this done, and I know he does, I will help him. We have a lot of time to find another bill that might be more germane, but it would not be on this bill that we really can't afford to jeopardize. I feel strongly about that. We were attempting to help him get a vote initially, and then, when he changed the underlying bill, that meant we would have to go back to everyone. He mentioned his coauthors, and we don't know how many of those coauthors would still be supporting his amendment if they knew it was changing the underlying bill.  Those are the problems we have here, and I think we want to get on with, as rapidly as possible, getting these amendments opened up so that people can vote on the amendments and hopefully get the bill done this week. I don't know if it will be this week or not.  Senator Corker was also implying we are doing something for this President with this amendment, and I wish to remind everyone of the fact that there are several things the President--our new President--had in mind. He wanted to privatize air traffic control. I almost singlehandedly stopped that, and that was one of his main objectives. Also, he wanted to have a BRAC round in this bill that is on the floor now, and we stopped that. Many of the provisions that he wanted we have taken out of the bill.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Minnesota.                                STOP Act
