Wilson entitled ``One Man's Fight for a Better World.'' It is about a man I admire as much as anyone I have met in my years in the Senate, and that is Bobby Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation.  The article, written by George Wilson in his usual definitive and exacting manner, speaks about Bobby probably far better than I could and I am going to shortly ask to have the article printed in the Record. The reason I want to do that--though I doubt that there are many people in Washington who do not already know Bobby Muller, is because I hope those who read the Congressional Record will see this. He has been my inspiration and really my conscience on so many issues. But the thing that I think sets him apart from so many others is the fact that for well over a decade he has fought so hard to rid the world of landmines. He has done it not only in this country, in working with those of us who have sponsored and backed legislation to ban landmine use by the United States, but he has done it worldwide. He founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. He was its inspiration.  I talked with him early one morning a couple of weeks ago after hearing that the Nobel Committee awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which was shared with its coordinator, Jody Williams of Putney, VT. I said to Bobby at that time how proud he must be because he is the one who started this campaign, and who hired Jody to coordinate it worldwide. Because of his vision and the hard work of so many people, in Ottawa this December some 100 countries will sign a treaty banning landmines.  I am extremely proud of Bobby. I feel privileged to be his friend. I have certainly been helped over the years by his advice and by his conscience.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Army Times, October 13, 1997]                   One Man's Fight for a Better World                         (By George C. Wilson)       ``Oh my God! I'm hit! My girl. She'll kill me. I can't      believe I'm dying on this piece of ground.'' Those were the      last conscious thoughts of Marine 1st Lt. Bobby Muller as he      lay bleeding on top of the hill he just taken in Quantri      Province, Vietnam, in 1969. An enemy bullet had pierced this      chest tumbled through his lungs and severed his spinal cord.       He woke up in a military hospital, astonished he was still      among the living. ``I'm here!'' his mind silently screamed at      him in astonishment, ``I didn't die.''       Like any 24-year-old, especially a former athlete, Muller      inventoried his body while lying in the hospital bed. He      discovered he was paralyzed from the chest down. He would      walk again, much less run with this old teammates or dance      with that girl back home.       The rest of this story could have been like that of so many      other Vietnam veterans that you and I have known, and perhaps      helped get through the night. An all-consuming bitterness      that eats away at everything: jobs, marriages, self-respect.      Nothing matters any more. The Vietnam War, for thousands of      young men, trivialized everything after it.       Not so with Bobby Muller. He is one of those welcome,      shinning Vietnam success stories, which I want to tell here,      because it is both timely and timeless. Doesn't matter if you      agree with him or not. To everyone from President Clinton,      who has sought his counsel, to the secretaries who work for      him at the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, Bobby      Muller is a man committed to leaving the world better than he      found it.       Of late, Muller, from his wheelchair, has been the most      credible and powerful voice arguing for ridding the world of      anti-people land mines, which kill or maim somebody somewhere      every 22 minutes. Years ago, he railed against the Vietnam      War, calling it an ``atrocity'' and demanded that the      Veterans Administration stop treating the men who got hurt in      it like lepers. Many VA hospitals really were as bad as the      one portrayed in the movie ``Born on the Fourth of July''.       ``People would call me a traitor,'' he told a television      audience, in recalling the reaction to his anti-war      statements in the 1970s. ``It's harder for me to repudiate      the war,'' the paraplegic told his detractors. ``Don't you      think I'd love to be able to wrap myself in the mantle of      being a hero? Don't you think I'd love to be able to say that      what happened to me was for a reason--it's a price you got to      pay for freedom? When I have to say what happened to me, what      happened to my friends, what happened to everybody over there      was for nothing and was a total waste, that's a bitter pill      to swallow.''       Muller did swallow the pill. It still burns in his gut. But      he has managed to use the burn to fuel his drive, not consume      it.       ``The reality of that war has stayed with me every day,''      Muller has said. ``I know what it is to have people around me      die. I know what it is to hear the screams in the recovery      room. The most important thing for me in life is dealing with      those issues     that come out of war. And particularly the Vietnam War.''       Muller learned the hard way that he had to mobilize not      only himself, but also other Vietnam veterans before he could      take the new hills he set out to conquer. He was thrown out      of the Republican convention in 1972 for shouting at      President Nixon to stop the war. He needed comrades and soon      got them, founding the Vietnam Veterans of America in 1978.      He left that membership organization in 1980 to found and      head the more broadly involved Vietnam Veterans of America      Foundation. Nobody throws Bobby Muller out of anywhere      anymore.       White-haired but still passionate about his causes, the 52-     year-old Muller has led the battle against land mines from up      front. How would you like to be Clinton and--in refusing to      sign the treaty banning anti-personnel land mines--pit your      thin credibility and bureaucratic rhetoric against such      penetrating statements as these from Muller, who had a mine      blow up near him before he was shot in Vietnam:       Land mines, mostly our own, were ``the single leading cause      of casualties'' to U.S. service people in Vietnam. ``Land      mines are not a friend to the U.S. soldier. They are a threat      to the U.S. soldier. The Pentagon is institutionally      incapable of giving up a weapon.''       I don't fault the Joint Chiefs of Staff for fighting to      keep their weapons, including certain types of land mines.      That's their job. And it was ever thus. But it's the      president's job to stand up to the chiefs if the Mullers of      the world have the more persuasive case.       ``I can't tolerate a breach with the Joint Chiefs,'' Muller      says Clinton told him. You can, and should, Mr. President.      You're our only commander in chief. And Bobby won't let you      forget it as he takes this new hill.
