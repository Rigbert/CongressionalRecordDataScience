Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 792) recognizing the 40th anniversary of the independence of Guyana and extending best wishes to Guyana for peace and further progress, development, and prosperity.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 792       Whereas Guyana gained independence from the United Kingdom      on May 26, 1966;       Whereas since Guyana became an independent country, the      interests of Guyana and the United States have been closely      aligned;       Whereas Guyana is a supporter and ally of the United States      in the Global War on Terror, and joins the United States in      promoting political and economic freedoms, combating poverty,      crime, disease, and drugs, and promoting security, stability,      and prosperity;       Whereas the bonds of association and friendship between the      peoples of the two countries have been strengthened by the      large number of Guyanese who have migrated to the United      States, where they make significant contributions to both the      United States and Guyana; and       Whereas Guyana is an integral member of the Caribbean      region and a constructive partner of the United States in      fulfilling the agenda of the Western Hemisphere: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the      40th anniversary of the independence of Guyana and extends      best wishes to Guyana for peace and further progress,      development, and prosperity.
