  The University of Kentucky Wildcats men's team won their 31st SEC title--their fourth straight, by the way. Hall of Fame coach John Calipari is leading Big Blue Nation back to the NCAA tournament and, we hope, to the school's ninth national championship.  At Western Kentucky University, the Lady Toppers just brought home a second straight Conference USA title. They are hoping the hardware keeps on coming as they head to their school's 20th showing in the NCAA tournament.  I proudly join many Kentuckians in congratulating both UK and WKU. We will be rooting for them in the Big Dance.                          ____________________
