Mr. Speaker, today I remember Dr. Li Baiguang who diedunexpectedly on February 25, 2018. Dr. Li was a father and a husband, a lawyer and scholar, and he was a committed Christian who used his legal skills to defend the poor and oppressed in China. He was a true friend of freedom and a kindred spirit in the fight to protect religious freedom and other human rights in China. Though his work made him a frequent target of harassment and violence, until his death he remained passionately committed to the fight for the rights of Chinese citizens under the law. Dr. Li was truly one of China's best and brightest. He will be missed.  Li Baiguang was born in Hunan province in 1968 and received his doctoral degree in law from Peking University in 1997. Motivated by his Christian faith, Dr. Li defended farmers, migrant workers, and those persecuted by the Chinese government because of their religious belief. In 2006, Dr. Li met with President George W. Bush in the Oval Office. In 2008, he received the Democracy Award from the National Endowment for Democracy (NED).  Dr. Li was in Washington DC, just a few weeks before his death. He expressed concern about the Chinese government's brutal crackdown on human rights lawyers and the possibility that new religious regulations would give the government an excuse to close all Protestant ``house churches.'' I share these concerns and find China's deteriorating human rights situation deeply problematic. President Xi has presided over an extraordinary assault on the rule of law and civil society using repressive policies and new laws that threaten rights defenders in China and challenge both U.S. interests and U.S.-China cooperation and goodwill.  Dr. Li also spoke that day about a savage beating he received in October at the hands of Zhejiang province police. He was taken to a forest and tortured and warned to end his defense of a group of farmers dispossessed of their land by the Chinese government. To his credit, he did not back down from this threat.  He faced such dangers willingly and with a strong Christian faith. He fought daily for what was good and what was right and dreamed of a day when China would be more democratic and free. For his courage, he should be admired as a true champion of liberty and the rule of law.  Dr. Li is survived by his wife, Xu Hanmei, and their eight-year-old son Li Quingxin.  I believe that someday China will be free. Someday, the people of China will be able to enjoy all of their God-given rights. And a nation of free Chinese men and women will honor Li Baiguang as a hero. He will be honored along with all others like him who have sacrificed so much, and so long, for freedom.                          ____________________
