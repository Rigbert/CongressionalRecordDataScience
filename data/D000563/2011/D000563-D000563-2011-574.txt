President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate an extraordinary Illinoisan, Luis C. Tigera. After serving with distinction for 26 years with the Illinois State Police, First Deputy Director Tigera is retiring as the highest ranking career member of the organization and the first Cuban American to hold such a position in the agency.  Throughout his time with the Illinois State Police, First Deputy Director Tigera has served in a variety of positions with the organization. He started his career in law enforcement by patrolling the interstate system of the Chicago area suburbs. He worked his way up to overseeing the statewide guns, drugs, gangs and money laundering unit. Mr. Tigera also managed and regulated the operations of the gaming industry in Illinois. And he served as senior policy adviser to the Illinois State police director.  In addition to his extensive experience in law enforcement, First Deputy Director Tigera was selected to attend the FBI National Academy in Quantico, VA, where he successfully completed executive management training. He also holds a masters degree in criminal justice administration from Lewis University.  One of the reasons the Illinois State Police has grown and flourished under First Deputy Director Tigera's leadership is his commitment to community. He led an initiative to work collaboratively with community groups and others within the public safety arena. He has always emphasized the importance of team-building and problem-solving as he served as second-in-command of a full-service police agency of 3,500 employees. In addition to his leadership in the Illinois State Police, First Deputy Director Tigera is a member of the Illinois Terrorism Task Force, the Governor's Interstate Gun Trafficking Task Force, and previously served as the Chairman of the Board of the Chicago High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area.  First Deputy Director Tigera has been married to Ana for 26 years and is the proud father of two sons, Luis, Jr., who has followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an Illinois State Police trooper, and Zachary.  I would like to congratulate First Deputy Director Tigera on his retirement and thank him for his service to the State of Illinois.                          ____________________
