Speaker, it is with gratitude but heavy heart that I, on behalf of the people of the United States, the Polish Caucus of this House, and our region of Ohio, in particular, extend deepest sympathy to the people of Poland on the passing of ex-Premier of Poland Tadeusz Mazowiecki.  During his exceptional and transformative life, Premier Mazowiecki played a leading role in ushering in the first era of liberty that Poland had been afforded in modern history. Poland has assumed a pivotal and leading role in the European Union. History is still recording its rich, elegiac, and poignant history in the struggle to defeat tyranny and give rebirth to freedom.  As The New York Times reported this week, Premier Mazowiecki became the first non-Communist to head an Eastern Bloc nation since the late 1940s. Solidarity in Poland grew with his engagement as Poland led the anti-Communist movement in occupied Europe. Premier Mazowiecki's leadership of Poland at a time of critical change toward a democratic state has secured for him a permanent place in the history of a free Poland in Europe. He lived to see Poland's admission to NATO and Poland's growing cooperation within the world of nations.  An accomplished literary figure, intellectual, and Roman Catholic thinker and writer, Premier Mazowiecki embodied the meaning of a renaissance man. His imprisonment by the Communist Party for his progressive beliefs never dampened his spirit. He was a freedom fighter in word and deed.  Mr. Speaker, may his legacy inspire future generations to live with the courage and intellectual rigor he demonstrated in each decade of his life; and may white eagles fly over his memory and Poland's historic accomplishments as she walks with free nations in liberty's march.                [From the New York Times, Oct. 28, 2013]          Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Ex-Premier of Poland, Dies at 86                          (By Douglas Martin)       Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who went from editing small Roman      Catholic intellectual publications to becoming prime minister      of Poland--and the first non-Communist to head an Eastern      bloc nation since the late 1940s--died on Monday in Warsaw.      He was 86.       The Polish government announced the death. President      Bronislaw Komorowski, ordered flags on government buildings      to be flown at half-staff.       Mr. Mazowiecki, a journalist by profession, worked quietly      for years to ease restrictions on individual rights and      helped form the Solidarity trade union movement, which gained      the leadership of Poland's national legislature in August      1989. By the end of that year, the Berlin Wall had fallen,      Communist governments in Moscow's other satellite states had      collapsed and the Cold War division of Europe was over.       In a message of condolences, Chancellor Angela Merkel of      Germany, who grew up in Communist East Germany, said that Mr.      Mazowiecki made ``an unforgotten contribution to overcoming      authoritarian injustice and to the unity of Europe.''       In the summer of 1980, a chain of labor disturbances rocked      Poland. The focus was the Gdansk shipyard, where Lech Walesa      led a strike to demand higher pay and the restitution of a      fired worker. Mr. Mazowiecki (his     full name is pronounced tah-DAY-oosh mah-zoh-VYET-skee)      helped broaden it into an antibureaucratic social movement      that became known as Solidarity.       He and his friend Bronislaw Geremek, a historian, persuaded      64 leading intellectuals, scholars, scientists and cultural      figures to sign a petition that read in part: ``In this      struggle the place of the entire progressive intelligentsia      is at their side. That is the Polish tradition, and that is      the imperative of the hour.''       Mr. Walesa thanked Mr. Mazowiecki and told him that he had      a continued need for help from intellectuals in addressing      government officials. Mr. Mazowiecki helped write the      historic Aug. 31 agreement that ended the strike and      established Solidarity by guaranteeing workers' rights to      form independent trade unions with the right to strike.       The Communist government nonetheless felt threatened by      Solidarity's mounting influence, and declared martial law on      Dec. 13, 1981, making Solidarity and other pro-democracy      groups illegal. As tanks rolled through Warsaw, Mr.      Mazowiecki was arrested and imprisoned for more than a year.      After his release, he was again one of Mr. Walesa's closest      advisers.       The Polish economy worsened, and in 1988 Mr. Walesa and Mr.      Mazowiecki coordinated a strike at the Gdansk shipyard. That      strike brought no concessions. But a second, bigger strike      brought the Communists to the negotiating table.       The Polish primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, appointed Mr.      Mazowiecki a mediator, and he arranged the series of talks      between the Communists and Solidarity that led to plans for      quasi-free parliamentary elections in which a newly legal      Solidarity would be allowed to participate.       In the June 1989 vote, Solidarity won overwhelmingly in the      districts it was allowed to contest and, after parliamentary      maneuvering with minor parties, was able to form a      government. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head of the Communist      government, asked Mr. Walesa for three candidates, of which      he would select one as a Solidarity prime minister. He chose      Mr. Mazowiecki. Many believed the Vatican influenced his      choice, given Mr. Mazowiecki's role as an influential editor      of Catholic weeklies and monthlies that promoted the social      gospel underlying Solidarity's ideology.       Mr. Mazowiecki's V-for-victory sign to the chamber on      appointment became the symbol of Poland's triumph over      Communism.       The Communists retained control of the armed services, the      police and the secret service, and Mr. Mazowiecki had to      pledge to keep Poland in the Warsaw Pact, Moscow's military      alliance. Still, he said in 2004, ``I had this very strong      conviction that we will make it, that we will be able to      build the foundations for a democratic state.''       He promised no ``witch hunts'' against the old government,      saying it was ``right and wise'' to offer democracy to all      Poles. When asked if he would be a Catholic prime minister or      a prime minister of Solidarity, he replied: ``Is there any      contradiction between the two? I would like to reconcile the      two.''       At first, Mr. Mazowiecki told an interviewer, he was      ``terrified.'' With Poland facing staggering foreign debt,      hyperinflation and a bankrupt treasury, he had reason to be.      He had no choice but to accept harsh, unpopular conditions--     including a wage freeze and an end to consumer subsidies--to      secure a $700 million loan from the International Monetary      Fund.       With no economic experience and little charisma, he was      defeated when he ran for president in 1990. Mr. Walesa was      elected.       Tadeusz Mazowiecki was born on April 18, 1927, in the city      of Plock, in central Poland. His brother died in a Nazi      concentration camp in World War II.       Mr. Mazowiecki studied law at the University of Warsaw but      did not graduate. In 1953 he began editing a Catholic weekly,      but was eventually fired because of his opposition to the      Communist government. He started an organization of Catholic      intellectuals and a new Catholic monthly.       In 1961 he was elected to the Polish Parliament, where he      led the opposition to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia      in 1968 and unsuccessfully pushed for an investigation of the      police massacre of striking Gdansk shipyard workers in 1971.      As a result, he was barred from running for re-election in      1972. He then devoted himself to building alliances between      the intelligentsia of the left and the fledgling Polish labor      movement.       Mr. Mazowiecki, a tall, gaunt man with large, sad eyes,      went on to hold various official and unofficial posts in      Poland's government. In 1992 he was appointed envoy of the      United Nations to war-torn Bosnia. He resigned in 1995 over      what he regarded as the international community's      insufficient response to atrocities there.       He was married twice; both wives died. He had three sons,      Wojciech, Adam and Michal.                          ____________________
