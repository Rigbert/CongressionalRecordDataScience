 The American people deserve action on this charitable tax reform action called the CARE Act. We should not forbear on curtailing tax shelters and corporate expatriations, which all may be legal, but in a time during the war on terrorism for a corporation to flee the country to Bermuda and not do anything more than set up a shell corporation is unethical and immoral--tax shelters, where the people who write the tax shelters sell them on the basis of how much money you will save the corporation in taxes, and where the people who write them do not even have to defend them. That seems to me to be professionally unethical as well. In other words, sell your product to a corporation and then let them hold the bag.  We are losing a lot of revenue that can be used for charitable purposes under the CARE Act. Workers rightly expect a debate and action on a bipartisan retirement security package. Let's do the right thing. Let's do the people's business. Let's undo the gridlock on these important bills. Let's bring up the CARE Act. Let's bring up the NESTEG Act.  I yield the floor.
