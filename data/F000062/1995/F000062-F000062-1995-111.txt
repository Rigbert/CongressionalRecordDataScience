 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and associate, Gordon Lau. Over the years, I have worked closely with Gordon as San Francisco supervisors and as partners in establishing the first Sino-America Sister City relationship between San Francisco and Shanghai. I am proud of what we have managed to accomplish together.  Gordon is a longstanding pillar of the Chinese community in San Francisco and a key leader for crucial non-profits such as the Self-Help for the Elderly and the Chinese Culture Foundation.  Since Gordon graduated from the University of San Francisco Law School he has worked as an attorney and spent a great deal of his time in public service. Gordon was appointed to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors by former Mayor George Moscone in 1977. He later kept his seat in district elections becoming San Francisco's first Asian-American supervisor.  Gordon also served the city of San Francisco as a past board member for the Legal Aid Society, as founding member of San Francisco Lawyers Committee for Urban Affairs and Civil Rights, and as a former San Francisco Port Commissioner and the San Francisco Planning Commission.  I have worked closely with Gordon and the San Francisco-Shanghai Sister City Committee. Since the creation of this sister city committee in 1979, Gordon has played a crucial role in its development and served, virtually uninterrupted, as its chairman. This partnership is very dear to me and nobody has worked harder to make it the success that it is than Gordon.  Since 1979, there have been 150 exchanges between San Francisco and Shanghai making it not only the first, but most active, sister city relationship between China and the United States. Sister Cities International ranks the San Francisco-Shanghai relationship as the most active of any cities involved in sister city partnerships.  People-to-people relationships are critically important in overall foreign relations. During many complicated times between the United States and China this sister city relationship has provided a strong link between the people of San Francisco and Shanghai.  Since its inception, the San Francisco-Shanghai Sister City Committee has produced 150 projects in art, culture, law, economics, medicine, education, development, trade, investments, and public works. One of the highlights has been business management training program in which San Francisco businesses participate in the training of China's new business leaders. This training of midlevel managers has been pointed to repeatedly as one of the most effective in supporting the economic changes underway in China.  The success of this sister city relationship culminated with the celebration of Shanghai Week in San Francisco this past July, celebrating a 15-year relationship between San Francisco and Shanghai.   Gordon Lau is truly a model of dedication to a community and to a cause. I join with his wonderful wife Mary, a public school teacher in San Francisco, their remarkable daughters, Stephanie, Diane and Carolyn, as well as the people of San Francisco and Shanghai in thanking Gordon for his devotion and hard work.  There are people in life who quietly go about the business of getting things done. Gordon sets a perfect example of what can be accomplished when you believe in what you do and work hard to achieve success. He has worked, year after year, with little fanfare to achieve one of the world's most productive sister city relationships in the world. It is time that we say thank you.                          ____________________
