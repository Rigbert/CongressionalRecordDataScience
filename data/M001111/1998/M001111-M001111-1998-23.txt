 President, I rise today to join my colleague in the House, Representative Jack Metcalf, to introduce the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act.  Mr. President, I have always believed that the best way to solve problems is to bring people together and find consensus on an issue. The Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act is the direct outgrowth of just such an approach.  The Northwest Straits include the marine waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the San Juan Islands, and the northern portion of Puget Sound. It is a scenic and unique ecosystem critical to a broad array of sensitive fish and wildlife, including orcas, sea birds, salmon, bottom fish, and bald eagles.  Recognizing the importance of this precious marine ecosystem, the Northwest Straits were proposed for inclusion in the National Marine Sanctuaries program in some capacity as far back as 1979 when the National Marine Sanctuary Program was in its infancy. Although the Northwest Straits lie entirely within state waters, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) spent the next seventeen years evaluating the inclusion of this special area into the marine sanctuary program. This process involved substantial public participation. In recent years, it became clear there was insufficient local support to move forward with a Northwest Straits Marine Sanctuary designation for the area.  In response to these local concerns, Rep. Metcalf and I included a provision in the 1996 reauthorization of the Marine Sanctuaries program barring final designation of a Northwest Straits Marine Sanctuary without Congressional approval. Having thus put the marine sanctuary process on hold, in the Spring of 1997 we established a Citizen's Advisory Commission (the Commission) to identify the key marine resources and values of the Northwest Straits, as well as the threats to them, and recommend appropriate protective measures and a means of coordinating related federal, state, and local actions. The Commission is broadly representative of local interests including County and Port Commissioners, environmental and conservation groups, shipping interests, academics, and Indian Tribes.  The Commission met diligently for eighteen months to fulfill their mission. In addition to the Commission members, a representative of Governor Gary Locke participated in meetings and federal, state, and local agencies provided information and technical assistance. All Commission meetings have been open to the public and interested parties. The Commission has researched and reviewed the issues surrounding the Northwest Straits exhaustively and presented their formal recommendation to Representative Metcalf and myself on August 20.  The Commission has concluded that the very fabric of the Northwest Straits is unraveling, manifesting problems and trends that cross geographic and jurisdictional lines. While the ecosystem is complicated, the trends are simple: bottom fish, sea birds, invertebrates, salmon, and even some marine mammals have declined precipitously since 1980. This depletion of marine resources has hurt economies and communities around the Northwest Straits and further degradation portends far more serious impacts in the future. Existing management schemes, while sufficient in terms of legal authority, have failed to achieve the coordination and focus to change these trends.  While the Commission has not reached a consensus to endorse or reject any future alternative management scheme, the Commission recommends a set of steps that would not displace current management responsibilities but seek to compliment them by supplying key missing ingredients for success: sound science and broad support for solutions. These steps include the establishment of a network of local, county-based Marine Resources Committees (MRCs) committed to making all possible progress at the local level to protect and conserve the resources of the Northwest Straits using existing state and local authorities, and based on sound scientific information and the overall needs of the Northwest Straits ecosystem. The MRCs will coordinate activities through a Northwest Straits Commission consisting of representatives of the MRCs, Indian Tribes, the scientific community, and state agencies. The Commission will provide technical assistance, integrate science, develop an ecosystem-level coordination, and coordinate funding.  In addition, the Commission will assess the performance of the MRCs against a series of benchmarks. These Benchmarks of Performance shall include the assessment and establishment of a scientifically-based regional system of Marine Protected Areas, the assessment and establishment of a scientifically-based regional system to protect nearshore habitat, a net gain in open shellfish harvest areas, and discernable increases in bottom fish and other key marine indicators. Should these benchmarks fail to be met, further consideration of alternative approaches, including a marine sanctuary designation may be resumed.  In addition, this bill calls for a review of the effort after 5 years by the National Research Council, with particular emphasis on the achievement of the Benchmarks of Performance. With the authorization for this ``Local Marine Conservation Initiative'' expiring in 6 years, this NRC report will help us assess the accomplishments of this effort to determine whether it should be continued.  Mr. President, the Northwest Straits Marine Conservation Initiative Act represents the right way to address environmental challenges. By pulling all of the interested parties together to analyze and research not only the issue, but each other's perspectives, partnerships can be forged that will provide long-term benefits. This pragmatic and achievable proposal will truly improve resource protection in the Northwest Straits. It is an innovative, exciting way to address the marine conservation challenges before us. I am excited about this approach and the way it empowers local communities and local citizens to take the initiative to protect their home waters. In many ways, this approach is a test or experiment. The local leaders have the next several years to demonstrate that a coordinated, informed, and empowered local decision-making process can provide true protection for the Northwest Straits. I believe they can meet this challenge. I look forward to Congress' timely consideration of this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of commission membersand a letter from Governor Gary Locke be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Murray/Metcalf Northwest Straits Local Citizen's Advisory Commission                                 Members       Lew Moore, co-facilitator.

Hon. Patty Murray,     Hon. Jack Metcalf,     Northwest Straits Citizens Advisory Commission, Padilla Bay          National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mount Vernon, WA.       Dear Senator Murray, Congressman Metcalf, and Advisory      Commission Members: I am writing to congratulate you on your      success in developing a thoughtful, broadly-supported      framework for restoring the marine resources of northern      Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca--the regional gem      we call the Northwest Straits. I also want to express my      appreciation for your willingness to dedicate so much of your      time and talent over the last year-and-a-half to this effort.       This Commission's report has special credibility and value      because its preparation engaged high-level community leaders      representing a wide spectrum of interests. In joining forces      across the political aisle to solve pressing regional      problems, the convenors have followed the highest and best      tradition of the Washington Congressional delegation.       I am pleased to see that the Commission has approached the      problems of the Northwest Straits in a thoughtful and      strategically targeted manner. Instead of proposing a new      regulatory authority or layer of bureaucracy, you have wisely      sought to complement the roles of existing federal, state,      and local authorities by bringing in additional science and      creating a forum to build the broad support necessary to      advance resource protection.       Again, I want to commend you for your work in developing      this proposed partnership to restore and protect the      magnificent marine resources of the Northwest Straits. My      administration and I look forward to working with you as you      develop a congressional proposal and work to implement the      report's recommendations.           Sincerely,                                                       Gary Locke,     Governor.                          ____________________
