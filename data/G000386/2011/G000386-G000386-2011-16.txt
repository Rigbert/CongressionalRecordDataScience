 President, I have the good fortune of serving with Senator Leahy on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is the chairman; I am the ranking Republican. In that capacity, we have jurisdiction over constitutional amendments. So I rise to support S.J. Res. 10, which is cosponsored by all 47 Republicans.  I am very pleased we are taking up a balanced budget amendment.
