President, the President is setting a course that jettisons sound stewardship of fiscal policy and that ignores America's real needs, from education to first responders, and this budget resolution largely facilitates that reckless course.  Iraq's needs fare well in the President's spending priorities, but America's needs deserve to fare better. In record time, the administration's policies already have converted record surpluses into record deficits, and if these new policies are enacted, the worst is yet to come. More tax cuts for the wealthy, more borrowing, more deficits, and fewer investments in the priorities that really count in the everyday lives of America's families and communities.  We hear a lot in this town about ``compassionate conservatism.'' We hear speeches about declining family values and the breakdown of the traditional family. And we hear about streamlining Government and making it run more like a business based on cost-benefit analysis.  But the truth is, this budget before the Senate today is neither compassionate nor conservative. On the one hand it slashes, freezes, or totally eliminates funding for programs that help the poorest and the most vulnerable Americans, and on the other it uses smoke and mirrors to conceal the creation of a federal deficit larger than any other in our Nation's history.  This is a difficult time for many Americans, and this budget will only make things worse. Fifteen million American households cannot find affordable housing, yet this budget would force housing costs onto state and local governments.  Forty-four million Americans do not have health insurance, yet the budget that was brought to the floor would force the costs of Medicaid right back onto our cash-strapped State and local governments. I am pleased that we were able to soften this crushing blow to our states' Medicaid programs--for now--with a successful amendment. But there will be determined efforts to undo that vote at every step of the legislative process that lies ahead.  At a time when American companies are forced to hire from abroad because the students here lag behind in math and science skills, this budget would eliminate education programs by the dozen and severely underfund No Child Left Behind programs and funding for low-income schools. Perhaps most disturbingly, as we see more and more young troops coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan in need of long term medical and psychological care, this budget would dramatically reduce benefits and services to veterans.  I recently received a letter from a charitable organization that I believe does great work, Catholic Charities USA, describing their views on the proposed budget. I think it will surprise many members what they say. I ask unanimous consent that March 8, 2005, Catholic Charities letter addressed to me be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    March 8, 2005.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, 433 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of Catholic Charities USA, I      urge you to support budget priorities for FY2006 that will      strengthen the capacity of states, localities, and private      agencies to protect and assist the poorest and most      vulnerable members of our society.       Although our economy has recovered somewhat from the      economic recession that began in late 2000, increasing      numbers of Americans ate facing significant hardship.      Unemployment remains high, as over 9 percent of the working      population is either unemployed or underemployed, according      to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Poverty rates are rising      again, and 35 million people--including 12 million children--     are now living under the federal poverty line.       For millions of families, the difficulties presented by the      weak economy have been exacerbated by other challenges.      Fifteen million American households cannot find affordable      housing, while forty-four million people in the U.S. lack      health insurance. High housing costs, unexpected health      costs, chronic illnesses aggravated by inconsistent health      care--these and other factors contribute to the economic      instability experienced by many families.       We at Catholic Charities USA are witness to the human toll      of the failure to address these problems adequately. For      instance, our agencies, which provide food, shelter, and      other forms of emergency assistance to 4.5 million people      annually, are reporting strong increases in requests for      emergency assistance, especially among families with      children. According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, our      experience is not unique. Their 2004 survey of 27 cities      revealed that requests for emergency food and shelter      increased 14 and 6 percent, respectively.       We therefore urge you to produce a budget that will protect      funding for critical services and supports to help the      millions of families struggling to achieve stability and      self-sufficiency. Every decision of economic policy,      including the setting of national budget priorities, must be      judged in light of its impact on those who do not share in      the abundance of the American economy. At a time when the      United States is spending more on defense and homeland      security, a question arises about who will pay for it. It      should not be our nation's poorest citizens. We therefore ask      you to support the following budget priorities:       Place a priority on investments in federal programs that      protect and support low-income families and other vulnerable      populations. Funding for many poverty programs was already      cut or frozen in 2005. Others, such as Temporary Assistance      for Needy Families (TANF), the Child Care and Development      Block Grant (CCDBG), and the Social Services Block Grant      (SSBG) have been frozen since 1996. Congress should address      the budget deficit in a fair and balanced way maintaining      investments in our children, protecting programs assisting      seniors and persons with disabilities, and enhancing our      national security.       Oppose the inclusion of Medicaid cuts in fiscal year 2006      budget reconciliation: Medicaid provides essential health      coverage to over 50 million of our most vulnerable low-income      children, working families, seniors, and people with      disabilities. Neatly every state has already enacted painful      cuts to its Medicaid program, including eligibility levels,      services, and provider payments, and many states are facing      deep Medicaid cuts again this year. Federal funding      reductions would force states to implement even deeper cuts      further restricting eligibility, eliminating or reducing      critical health benefits, and cutting or freezing provider      reimbursement rates. As a result, state Medicaid funding cuts      could add millions more people to the ranks of the uninsured      who would go without care, endangering their own health and      public health.       The budget resolution should not place arbitrary caps on      discretionary spending. The Administration has proposed      statutory rules to cap discretionary spending over the next      five years at its proposed 2006 spending levels. Such caps      would require cuts of $200 billion in spending for domestic      programs over     the next five years, including funding for education,      veterans' health care, rental assistance, utility assistance,      and childcare. Such cuts would have a devastating impact on      agencies and communities that are already struggling to meet      the basic needs of vulnerable citizens.       We ask that Congress not attempt to balance the federal      budget through reductions in discretionary programs assisting      low-income families. Because domestic discretionary spending      constitutes only 16 percent of the federal budget, even deep      cuts in these programs would offer little help with the      federal deficit, while sharply reducing assistance to      families struggling to meet their basic needs.       If Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules are included in budget      reconciliation, they should be balanced. If Congress chooses      to reinstate PAYGO provisions, we urge that they be      implemented in a neutral manner that does not encourage      revenue reductions at the expense of critical programs      serving the nation's most vulnerable families. Under the      President's proposed PAYGO rules, entitlement program      increases would have to be offset by entitlement reductions      elsewhere. In contrast, tax reductions would require no      offsets in the federal budget. This unbalanced policy would      unfairly burden programs such as Medicaid that provide      families with critical assistance, and would likely fail to      achieve significant deficit reductions.       We recognize that Congress is faced with many difficult      choices. In your deliberations, please remember those who      have the fewest choices.           Respectfully,                                                 Fr. Larry Snyder.
