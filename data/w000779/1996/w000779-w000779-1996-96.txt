I say, it seems to me, in today's economy we can have more noninflationary economic growth than you could in the past. You look at technology, for example, and technology is driving so much of today's economy. I think the Senator is making a very important point with respect to the role of growth and the Fed and the issues that, frankly, are not getting the kind of attention they ought to receive.  My sense has been the Government does not even really measure today's modern economy in an accurate kind of way. I served on the Joint Economic Committee for a period of time, and I was concerned that the Bureau of Labor Statistics was not in a position to have the resources, it was not in a position to have the tools to really measure the modern economy.  This whole idea about the relationship of inflation and growth, I think, really needs a fresh look. My sense is that because of technology, we can have a higher degree of noninflationary economic growth than we could in the past. I look forward to working with the Senator on these issues.  I also say, once again, we are talking about something that is not a partisan kind of issue. Everybody in this body wants to make sure that we grow the economy, that we incent the private sector in a way to have good-paying jobs, and we do not want to fan the fires of inflation.  These are not partisan kinds of issues. The Senator, talking about wages and the Fed, he did not mention Democrats, he did not mention Republicans. We are talking about kinds of approaches this body ought to be looking at in terms of the modern economy.  When I talk about noninflationary economic growth, I submit that what is driving it is the technological revolution, which, again, is not the special prerogative of Democrats or Republicans.  I thank the Senator for yielding.
