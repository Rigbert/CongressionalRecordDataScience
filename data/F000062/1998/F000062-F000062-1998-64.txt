 President, following my remarks, it will be my intention to offer an amendment to close a gaping loophole in legislation which we passed 4 years ago to make the streets of this country safe. That specific legislation was legislation that prohibited the manufacture and sale of 19 commonly used assault weapons, semiautomatic assault weapons, that have been used to kill police, used by grievance killers, used by gangs, used by cartels, used by drive-by shooters.  The legislation also contained provisions that sought to eliminate the sale and transfer of the high-capacity clips and magazines that would hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And, in fact, today it is illegal in this country to domestically manufacture and sell a new clip, drum or strip that was made in this country, except to the military, police, or for nuclear power plant protection. It has become evident that though this legislation has been successful in reducing the criminal use of the 19 banned assault weapons, the provisions in this law aimed at reducing the availability of these large-capacity ammunition feeding devices have been rendered ineffective.  At the request of the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who was on the floor a moment ago, the 1994 law grandfathered existing high-capacity clips which were manufactured before the effective date of the ban to allow those clips which had a bill of lading on them to enter the country and to allow dealers to recover their expenses by selling off their existing stocks. The same thing existed for assault weapons themselves.  The President and Secretary of the Treasury closed this loophole through his executive decision which used the 1968 law, which said that any weapon imported into this country must meet a sporting use test. And 1.6 million of these semiautomatic assault weapons were essentially cut off from importation. The thrust of the legislation was to eliminate the supply over time --not to prohibit possession, but over time, because there are so many of these weapons and clips in this country now, to cut down on their supply.  I will never forget, because the distinguished Senator from Idaho did approach me on the floor--we were standing right down in the well; I remember it as clear as if it was yesterday, although it was almost 5 years ago--and indicated that he was concerned about weapons that had a bill of lading on them which had been manufactured pre-assault weapons ban and which were in the process of transit into this country.  My point, Mr. President, is that now, 4 or 5 years later, the existing supply of these clips surely has been used up. However, foreign clips have continued to pour into the United States.  From July of 1996 to March of 1998, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved 2,500,000 large-capacity clips for importation into this country.  Recently, that number has skyrocketed even further. In just the last 5 months, BATF has approved permits for 8.1 million large-capacity clips for importation into America. That represents a 314-percent increase in one-fourth of the time.  These clips have been approved to come through at least 20 different countries. It is difficult to know the place of manufacture, but they come through 20 different countries into this country.  I would like to just quickly go through the countries that they come through. And there are some interesting things. Austria, Belgium, Chile, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, England--and clips manufactured somewhere abroad come through Great Britain; there are actually 250-round magazines--250-round magazines--for sale in this country and 177-round magazines for sale in this country--Germany, Greece, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Nicaragua, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Zimbabwe.  So the total is 8.8 million in two years approved to come in.  Unfortunately, there is virtually no reliable method to determine the date of manufacture on the millions of clipsthat the BATF has estimated are in circulation now in the United States. The inability to determine the date of manufacture is particularly true regarding the foreign importation of large-capacity magazines because BATF has no ability to independently determine whether such clips imported into the country are legal or illegal. It has allowed the continued importation of clips represented to be manufactured before the assault weapons ban took place.  Let me show you how this happened. Here is a clip from Shotgun News, dated February 1998: ``Banned semiautomatics, Bulgarian SLR 95. 1 free 40-rd magazine with each purchase.''  Here is another one: ``Quality replacements, 30 rounds, the choice of the Canadian military. Will not bend or rust, $8.99 a clip.''  Here is where you see the impact of, now, the foreign rounds: ``30-rd East German''--East German-made--``Ribbed back, AK-47 magazines, $7.99.''  Here is one: An ``AK magazine special,'' coming with the pouch, ``including 4 Chinese AK-47 30-rd magazines with pouch, $27.50.'' It also includes ``four East German AK-47, 20 rd magazines with a pouch, $29.95.''  Now, my staff called a shotgun store and asked to buy some of these magazines. The only question he was asked, ``Is it legal to buy this stuff where you are''--he was in Washington, DC, where it is not legal to own a gun, and he said, ``I don t know, as far as I know it is,'' and they said, ``We will send it to you.''  My point is, you can get these big clips very easily--on the phone, by mail order. And because now the supply of the domestic clips is running out, most of the clips being sold in this country are of foreign manufacture. So we have two sets. We have the domestic manufacturers prohibited. We have the sale and transfer of new clips prohibited. And you have the grandfather clause creating this gigantic loophole which allows these big clips to continue to come into the country.  In April of this year, President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Rubin closed one loophole created by this grandfather clause by blocking further importation of modified semiautomatic assault weapons. About 30 of us sent him a letter. We pointed out there were 1.6 million of these which received approval that were coming in from all over the world. The Treasury Department looked at the 1968 law, which requires all imported weapons to meet a sporting test, and decided that they don't meet this sporting test, and therefore the Executive order is in place and this importation has been prohibited. The remaining loophole to close is this loophole for the big clips. The amendment that we will shortly offer will do just that.  So the change to the law that I have proposed is simple: It would bar further imports of large-capacity clips and magazines, just as U.S. domestic manufacturers have been stopped from producing these magazines. This amendment would not--I repeat, not--ban further domestic sales and possession of large-capacity clips which are already legally in the United States. There are tens of millions of these already.  Now, let's talk about who uses these high-capacity clips. I pointed out, coming through Great Britain, there were ammunition-feeding devices carrying 250 rounds. You can expel 250 rounds before you have to reload. Do hunters use them? Do marksmen use them? Do skeet shooters use them? Do Olympic team members use them?  Let's take hunters. The answer is no, hunters don't use them. Most States limit the magazine capacity allowed for hunting, usually eight rounds or less. Federal law clearly outlines the ammunition magazine size limits for bird shooting. Federal law does not allow the use of a shotgun that has a capacity of more than three shells--one in the chamber and two in the magazine--when hunting migratory game birds.  How about the Olympic team and other competitive shooters? No.  So who really uses these large-capacity clips? Let me read a list of events that have taken place fairly recently. July, 1998, earlier this month, Rio Hondo, TX, a killing spree leaves five dead, including two Border Patrol officers. In one day, 24-year-old Ernest Moore killed four people in what police called a planned situation. He killed two people and wounded another in a private residence. Police at the scene recovered an MK-70 assault rifle and a 30-round clip. Approximately 30 minutes later, Moore fired as many as 100 rounds at law enforcement officers from a .223-caliber assault rifle. Two Border Patrol agents were killed at the scene and a sheriff's deputy was wounded.  That is who uses these big clips.  June 17, Coeur d'Alene, ID: A State trooper ambushed by merciless assassin. State trooper Linda Huff was ambushed and killed by a man wielding a 9-millimeter pistol with a 15-round clip. Police were not immediately certain why 34-year-old Scott David Yeager bicycled to the police station and fired 17 rounds at Huff in the rear parking lot. Investigators say Yeager fired all 15 rounds from one 15-round clip, disposed of it, reloaded, and continued to fire.  In May of this year, Springfield, OR: A 50-round clip. High school student kills four, injures dozens. After killing his parents, went on a shooting spree at his high school--most of us are familiar with this. To carry out his fatal assault, he used a Ruger 10.22 hunting rifle, a Ruger .22 caliber handgun and a Glock model 19. Found attached to the rifle, a traditional hunting gun, was an empty 50-round clip and found on the student were four 30-round clips and two 20-round clips. During the attack, he fired from the rifle indiscriminately, and it was not until he emptied the 50-round clip that several of his classmates were able to tackle and subdue him.  In March of this year, Jonesboro, AR: 15-round clips. Two middle school students ambush classmates. Two students, age 11 and age 13, pulled the fire alarm in their school in order to draw their classmates outside. The boys lay in wait and ambushed the other students when they got outside. They fired 24 shots into the crowd, 15 of which came from a Universal carbine rifle with a 15-round clip. The shots from the rifle were fired as fast as the shooter could pull the trigger.  February of this year, New Orleans, LA: A 30-round clip. Police recover 30-round clip after chase. After a routine traffic stop, a man led police on a 3-mile chase during which he pointed a 9-millimeter assault pistol with a 30-round clip.  And then it goes on and on and on. Elmhurst, NY, 30-round clip. Indianapolis, 30-round clip; traffic stop pulls the weapon. Orange, CA, 30-round clip; disgruntled employee kills five with 30-round clip; five people were killed, and a police officer was seriously wounded when a disgruntled Caltrans employee began randomly firing from an AK-47S with a 30-round clip. Denver, CO, last November, police officer killed by SKS with a 30-round clip; Denver police officer Bruce VanderJagt was killed by a barrage of gunfire from an SKS assault rifle as he chased a burglary suspect; police later recovered the rifle and the 30-round clip. Magna, UT, police officers shot by SKS with 20-round clip.  It goes on and on and on. The point is, there are so many of these big clips available in this Nation that they become the ammunition-feeding device of choice for the grievance killer, the person going up against police, the gang that wants to engage in intimidation, drive-by shootings, the cartels--these are the weapons of choice, and the weapons of choice are useless if you don't have that big-round clip.  What are we seeing? Five months and 8.1 million of these receiving approval to come into this country because BATF could not assert when they were manufactured. BATF can't go to another country to check a factory supply. Therefore, an understanding that I have with the distinguished Senator from Idaho--and I am pleased he is on the floor now; these would apply to clips or weapons that had bills of lading attached to them--is clearly not the case today. Bills of lading that preexisted a 4-year-old piece of legislation now. The time has come to close this grandfather clause.  Now, a number of the tragedies that I have just indicated probably would have occurred without the availability of killer clips. Some are fond of saying, ``Guns don't kill, people do.'' Yes, that is true. But I don't think ever before in the history of this Nation we have everhad a time when more weapons of destruction were falling into the hands of children.  The case that really struck me was a case in Memphis, TN, when a 5-year-old took a loaded weapon to school to kill a teacher who had given that youngster a ``time out'' the day before.  All we are trying to do is close the grandfather clause, say all of the clips that were in transit on the day we passed this legislation, 4 years ago, have been used up, and now is the time to close the loophole.  Interestingly enough, some have told me, and Members of this body have told me, ``Well, we know people who like to use them plinking.'' They told me, ``Yes, I like to use them plinking.'' Well, we are not taking away anybody's right to possess or to plink. There are plenty of clips around for plinking. What we are trying to do is stop what is now a massive flood of clips, even those that now carry 250 rounds in these magazines, from coming into this country.  I don't like to do this amendment, frankly, this day, because this is a solemn day and I don't like to mix the two. Unfortunately, the Treasury-Postal bill is on the floor at this time, and this is an opportunity to move the amendment.  I hope that those who know the intent of the grandfather clause to only affect those guns and clips that were in transit at the time of the enactment of the legislation--something that I agreed to because I thought it was fair--will agree to let this legislation go into place. It will not take a clip out of anyone's hands; it will not prohibit possession. Domestic manufacturers of ammunition feeding devices, today, cannot manufacture clips for general sale that are in excess of 10 bullets. We know they are not used in hunting, but we do know that in case after case they are used to kill police officers, they are used to kill employees, used by grievance killers, drive-by shooters, drug gangs, cartels, etc. The real question in my mind is: Do the rights of the majority outweigh the rights of those few who would like to plink, who would like to continue the flood of weapons coming into this country? There is no civilized, industrialized power on Earth in which there are more weapons or in which there are more of these big clips floating around.  The instant case that really jettisoned me into the assault weapons legislation was the 1994 case of Luigi Ferri, who had Tec-9 copycats and a 9 millimeter pistol. When he went into 101 California Street, this was his array of ammunition-feeding devices that he brought with him. He carried with him 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25--25 different ammunition feeding devices, with enough rounds that exceeded 500 rounds. I think it was actually over a thousand rounds of ammunition used to do his dastardly deed. Indeed, he left 8 people dead and about 14 people wounded. And no one could get to him to disarm him. In this case, I don't know whether these are domestic or foreign made clips.  The point I want to make is that the large number, the incredible fire power and the lack of sanity seemed to prevail.                           Amendment No. 3351 (Purpose: To ban the importation of large capacity ammunition feeding                                 devices)
