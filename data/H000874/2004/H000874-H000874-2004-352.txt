 First of all, Mr. Speaker, on the highway reauthorization bill, can the majority leader give us some view? I see the chairman of the Committee on Rules is on the floor. Can the gentleman from Texas give us some view of the rule under which the majority contemplates consideration of the highway bill?  Mr. DeLAY. While I would defer to the Committee on Rules who should have an announcement regarding amendments very shortly, I anticipate that they would make in order a variety of amendments and call for a very lengthy debate.
