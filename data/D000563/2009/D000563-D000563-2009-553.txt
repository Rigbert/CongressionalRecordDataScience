President, let me address this notion that what we are doing happened behind closed doors, which was said by the Senator from Kentucky. I know some don't want to leave the broadcasting of the floor of the Senate, which is broadcast by C-SPAN, but one of the other channels is carrying the Senate Finance Committee. It is not behind closed doors. It is right in front of the television cameras. It is going on right now as they consider the bill they will be voting on this afternoon.
