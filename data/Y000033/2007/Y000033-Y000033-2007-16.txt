Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman that just spoke and his presentation. I just, again, wish that people would understand it's not the wilderness itself; it's how the act has been written. And if you think you're going to make a living off of coffee shops and tourism, these are low-grade paying jobs. I've seen it happen. I've seen my town of Ketchikan. We created a forest that we can't harvest and we took $80,000 jobs now down to the minimum wage. That will happen too. So I just, and it's too late, it's your district. You believe in what you say, and I commend you for it. But this is not the economy which I see, serving those that come from the larger urban areas, the elitists, as I call it.  And this area, by the way, was farmed at one time, as you know, and timbered and mined. People had jobs that provided and produced. We are rapidly becoming a Nation of consumption and of no production, of pleasure and no sweat.  Having said that, I have no other speakers, and yield back the balance of my time.
