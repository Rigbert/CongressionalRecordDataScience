The House voted by a pretty good number to instruct the conferees on the issue of overtime pay, a substantial number of votes from his side and most of the votes from our side, if not all, all but two. Can the leader tell me whether or not he believes that instruction is being implemented by the conference?  Mr. DeLAY. As the gentleman knows, motions to instruct are not binding. Many times it is just an expression of how you feel that day. The House voted on that issue, put it in the bill, and it is in the House bill. It is a very controversial issue between the House and the Senate. It is one of the issues that the conference committee is struggling with. As far as I know, they have not come to any resolution on how to handle that issue as of yet.
