m. Let me say before propounding this unanimous-consent request, Senator Leahy and I are working on trying to get all the remaining amendments and final passage dealt with at the same time around 2:30 p.m. We are not there yet. But I will start by asking unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Landrieu amendment No. 1245 regarding orphans at 2:30 p.m. today, with no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment prior to the vote.
