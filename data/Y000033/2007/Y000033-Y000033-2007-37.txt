I don't know what the gentleman is talking about. I just said they were not well represented. Respectfully, if I can say that. I don't name anybody's name. I don't mention anybody. I don't specifically mention any names. And that is not why.  For the rest of you that continue this constant harping on this floor about cutting monies from other areas under the guise of balancing the budget, I say shame on you, too. I say shame on you because we are not doing the legislative process any good.  Regardless of who is in power in this House, Democrat or Republican, we should be leading this Nation and we are at a standstill now. That is one reason our ratings are very low, totally, and that is a shame. Because we do have the work of this Nation that we should be doing and we should be addressing and we should take care of it.  I don't agree with everything that side does. We should not always agree on everything, but we should have the ability to get together and solve problems and to legislate, and we have not done that. So I am a little frustrated. And like I say, those that bite me will be bitten back.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
