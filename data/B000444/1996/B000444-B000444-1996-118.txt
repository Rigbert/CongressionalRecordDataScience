 President, I did not come to respond to my friends from Missouri or New Mexico, but I find it kind of interesting. You know, we deal with names and these issues so much, and we use the jargon so much, that sometimes it is pretty interesting and pretty confusing to the American people. I am not suggesting that the things that either of my colleagues have said is not substantively correct, but I would suggest it is out of context.
