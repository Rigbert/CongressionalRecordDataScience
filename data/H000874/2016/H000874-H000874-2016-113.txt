The American people ought to say: bring the issues to the floor and let the House work its will. That is why they elected us, not to have the chairman of the Committee on Rules say: Sorry, you don't get to vote.  He wasn't elected dictator; Steny Hoyer wasn't elected dictator; Jim McGovern wasn't elected dictator. We were elected to be one of 435 people to make policies for this country and for our people.  Reject this rule. Bring democracy back to the House of Representatives. Let the people's representatives set policy in the light of day.
