Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I did appreciate the nice words that were directed to me by my friend, Mr. Hoyer, in support of the NIH. And I will remind those that don't know that I was the Republican lead a number of years ago with Mr. Waxman and Mr. McCain and Mr. Wellstone to double the money for the NIH, one of the most significant things that this Congress, I think, has ever done.  But I have got to say, I simply don't understand the opposition to this bill. Yes, I am absolutely supportive of the NIH bill, and will continue to do that, and more money. The Ryan-Murray budget agreement which we will be voting on tomorrow, I will be supporting it. It includes programs like the NIH, which I am told will be increased about $23 billion, or 2 percent over the current levels.  In today's ``The Hill,'' there is a full-page ad offered by First Focus Campaign for Children. It says, ``Thank you for making children your First Focus,'' and it lists maybe as many as 80 to 100 Members, including many of those who spoke today against the bill, but it says, ``Thank you for making children your First Focus.'' That is what this bill is about.  It is not just a simple authorization. Yes, we do pass those from time to time. This actually directs. The language of the bill says, ``shall be transferred.'' Shall. It doesn't use the word ``may,'' ``may be,'' whatever. ``Shall be transferred to a fund in the Treasury to be known as the `10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund' which shall''--not may--``which shall be available only for the purpose provided in . . . the Public Health Service Act, and only to the extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.''  We made it pretty tight. The authors of this bill made it pretty tight. Tell me how we can make it tighter.
