President, these distinguished military officers, flag officers, people who are charged with knowing what is our law, what is our Constitution, what are our treaty commitments, and what are the rules our military must follow, write with absolute clarity, and I quote the significant sentence from their letter:       Waterboarding is inhumane, it is torture, and it is      illegal.
