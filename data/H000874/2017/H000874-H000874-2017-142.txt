I understand that. But the fact of the matter is this is an important issue. It ought to be considered by the House.  It ought to have every Member's ability to speak to the issue of whether or not we ought to build that wall, not whether we ought to have security--we all agree that we should and must have security--but whether we do it with a wall, as I said, in which many members of the current administration do not believe it will work and have been quoted as saying so in the past, and there are many Members on our side who feel that.  I would hope that the majority leader would at least make it known to the Rules Committee that we ought to have that as a freestanding amendment, not incorporate it in a rule that the vote for the rule or a vote against the rule is, of itself, a vote on the wall itself.  Lastly, Mr. Leader, I want to say that you and I are both very concerned about the Russian sanctions and Iranian sanctions bill that is pending. We have been working very hard on that, very constructively on that, and I look forward, over the next 24 hours, more or less, to see whether or not we could get that resolved.  We have introduced, as you know, the Senate bill as a House bill. We would be for that if it would be brought to the floor. But we want to make sure that we move a bill, as you do, as quickly as possible and get agreement with the Senate and move that bill to the President's desk.  I thank you for your work on that, and I look forward to working with you over the next day or two to see if we can achieve that objective together.  Madam Speaker, unless the gentleman wants further time, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
