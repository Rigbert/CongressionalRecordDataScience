 What I did say is that when this legislation is passed and you add $1.4 trillion to the deficit, then you are going to come back and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  So is my friend from Pennsylvania now--and that is interesting--are you guaranteeing the American people that you will not be cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?  Don't use the word ``save'' because what ``save'' means is a cut. Will you guarantee the American people now that there will be zero cuts to benefits in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and that you are not--excuse me. It is my time. I will yield to you. I will yield to you, but let me finish. I yielded to you before.  Will you guarantee the people of this country that after this bill passes, you will not come back, raise the retirement age, voucherize Medicare, raise the retirement age for Medicare, or cut cost-of-living increases by instituting a so-called Chained CPI? Do I have your word on that?
