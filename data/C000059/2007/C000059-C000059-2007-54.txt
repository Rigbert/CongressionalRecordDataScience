Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and outstanding businesses that enrich the lives of their employees, produce quality products and help make Riverside a wonderful place to live and work. On Saturday, July 14, 2007 Bourns, Incorporated will celebrate its 60th Anniversary.  Bourns, Inc. was founded by Marlan and Rosemary Bourns--two exceptional individuals who are also celebrating sixty years of marriage--six decades ago. They started out in a 384 square foot space in Altadena, California. The goal of the company was to provide a method of accurately determining an aircraft's pitch attitude which would solve a crucial problem for pilots. The success in providing this method catapulted them onto the world stage--they became a global corporation and manufacture a range of products that impact almost every aspect of today's electronics industry.  Bourns, Inc. moved their headquarters to Riverside, California located in my congressional district and have nine other locations around the world. Throughout the years, Bourns has prided itself on quality, value and innovation. Their product line now includes precision potentiometers, panel controls, encoders, resistor/capacitor networks, chip resistors/arrays, inductors, transformers, resettable fuses, thyristor-based overvoltage protectors, line feed resistors, gas discharge tubes, telephone station protectors, 5-pin protectors, industrial signal, irrigation and petroleum protectors, CATV coax protectors, signal data protectors, indoor and outdoor POTsplitters, network interface devices, and integrated circuits.  Bourns, Inc. is a multiple recipient of the Supplier Excellence Award, Top Supplier Award, Outstanding Performance Award, Preferred Supplier award, among others. They serve a wide-range of industries including Automotive Electronics, Test and Measurement, Medical Electronics, Consumer Equipment, Telecommunications, and Portable Electronics. Bourns, Inc. continues to grow, innovate and lead.  It is my pleasure to recognize Bourns, Inc. and its world-class employees for sixty years of exceptional service as well as thank them for their contributions to the community of Riverside, California. Bourns, Inc. not only provides quality products to their customers but also provides a positive place to work. I know that many community leaders are grateful for Bourns, Inc. and salute them on their 60th Anniversary.                          ____________________
