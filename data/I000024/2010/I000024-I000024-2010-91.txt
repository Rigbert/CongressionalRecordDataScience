We went through this class warfare once back in 1980. We had Jimmy Carter as President of the United States. He had the windfall profits tax. I am sure my friend from Vermont remembers that at that time. I remember it well. That is when they were going to have a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. The results of that:       The WPT reduced domestic production between 3 and 6 percent      and increased oil imports from 8 to 16 percent. . . . This      made the United States more dependent upon imported oil.  That is the Congressional Research Service, which is nonpartisan.  That is a major issue here in terms of our dependence on other countries for our ability to run this machine called America.  Let's get back to the percentage depletion. The percentage depletion is particularly important for the production of America's over 600,000 low-volume marginal wells. The average marginal well produces 2 barrels a day.  Let me tell you what that is so my colleagues, when they get ready to vote, will really understand whom they are affecting. A marginal well is a well producing under 15 barrels per day. The average is 2 barrels a day. My friend is talking about all these big giants. I am not nearly as concerned about the big five and the majors as I am about my marginal operators in my State of Oklahoma. With an average of 2 barrels a day, the marginal producers actually account for 28 percent of all domestic production in the lower 48 States--28 percent. These are all small people.  If you are concerned also about whom you are affecting by this legislation, look at the royalty owners. There are literally millions of royalty owners. They have maybe a small piece of property, maybe their homestead. They are the ones who would be denied the use of their land. By putting the small ones out of business, they are the ones you are damaging.  I will reserve the remainder of my time.
