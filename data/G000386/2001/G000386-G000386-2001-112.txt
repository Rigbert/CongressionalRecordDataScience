 President, I rise in opposition to the Schumer amendment. Earlier today, we had a 3-94 vote on the Hollings amendment. You will remember the vote of 3-94 earlier today when the Senate rejected the Hollings amendment on repealing the tax decrease of a month ago. I think that was a vote of this body saying send the checks. The conference report on that same bill directed the IRS, for very good reasons, to issue these notices that the Schumer amendment wants to repeal. We have had the Treasury Employees Union saying send out a notice to inform the taxpayers so that the Treasury employees would be able to do their job well, without always being on the phone informing the taxpayers of what their tax refund might consist.  So if this amendment would pass, it would keep the taxpayers in the dark. It would help the scam artists preying on the poor and elderly, as we have been told before. It would play havoc with the important work of the IRS. So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on this amendment.
