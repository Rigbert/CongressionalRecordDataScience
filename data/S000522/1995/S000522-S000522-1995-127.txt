Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1565, legislation to extend the priority health care program for veterans who were exposed to agent orange or ionizing radiation.  As vice chair of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I would look to recognize the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] and the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. Stump] for their unyielding dedication to these veterans who have suffered a wide range of illnesses because of their service to their country.  Mr. Speaker, as you know, H.R. 1565 would take into consideration the findings of the National Academy of Sciences, which has done extensive and exhaustive studies on agent orange linkage. This legislation would authorize the VA to continue priority health care treatment for the first three categories identified by NAS. Additionally, it would grandfather those veterans who have been previously treated by the VA for illnesses which now the NAS finds evidence of no linkage to agent orange exposure. So they are protected and they are grandfathered.  This bipartisan bill--and the minority side has been very, very helpful and very strong in their views which has helped to craft this important bill--also takes into account the fact that NAS is not the only reputable scientific agency doing research on this matter.  An amendment offered by Chairman Hutchinson and supported by the entire committee allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to add diseases to the list of covered conditions based on peer reviewed research which provides credible evidence of association between that disease and agent orange exposure.  Once more, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to give it unanimous support.
