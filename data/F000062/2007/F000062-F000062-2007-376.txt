 President, I am pleased to join Senator Boxer as a co-sponsor of the ``Pell Grant Equity Act of 2007'' that would provide all low-income students with the same opportunity to receive a Federal Pell Grant by eliminating the current tuition sensitivity provision in the Pell Grant Program.  Federal Pell Grants are the cornerstone of our need-based financial aid system ensuring that all students have access to higher education.  However, the Pell Grant program's eligibility formula penalizes low-income students who attend very low-cost colleges by reducing the amount of the Pell Grant they can receive.  The formula bases eligibility for Pell Grant awards on the amount of tuition charged by the college and provides a lower ``alternate'' amount for low tuition colleges, known as the ``tuition sensitivity'' provision.  Community college students are significantly impacted by the tuition sensitivity provision because of low student tuition fees.  In California, due to a drop in tuition fees from $26 per unit to $20 unit, community college students enrolling this spring will otherwise be penalized with a $56 reduction in their 2007 Pell Grants and will endure another $112 hit in the 2007-2008 academic year if the tuition sensitivity provision is not eliminated.  Community college students represent approximately 46 percent of higher education students in Californiareceiving Pell Grants and are the only ones negatively impacted by this provision.  Any reduction of these vital grants to our lowest income students would have a major impact in their ability to afford college and continue their education, and we cannot allow this to happen.  This bill would ensure that our nation's community college students are not unduly penalized for receiving an affordable education at a low-cost college.  We must continue to do all we can to make a college education more accessible and affordable for all of our Nation's students.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Boxer and I in supporting this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
