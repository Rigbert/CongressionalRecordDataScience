President, if I could have the attention of my colleagues from North Dakota as well as New Mexico, I have an amendment I will offer with Senators Biden, Nelson, and Daschle. I ask unanimous consent that our 30 minutes on this amendment be divided so that Senator Biden of Delaware will be first to speak for 10 minutes, Senator Nelson of Florida for 5 minutes, and that I will speak for the last 15 minutes.
