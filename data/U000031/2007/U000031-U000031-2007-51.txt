Joseph and Benton Harbor, MI. This month several special events will be held commemorating the l00th anniversary of our historic landmark, the St. Joseph Lighthouse.  St. Joseph and Benton Harbor's very beginnings were tied to Lake Michigan and the St. Joseph River. The intersection of these waterways provided for the founding of Fort Miami in 1679--the first European settlement in Michigan's Lower Peninsula. At one time, the trade and waterfront activity rivaled that of Chicago.  St. Joseph's lighthouse legacy has included five historic structures, including most recently, the North Pier lighthouses, which were completed as a range light system in 1907. When lined up together, they direct mariners to the mouth of the river. These architectural icons, along with their original Fresnel lenses and restored catwalk, survive as one of only two range light systems still active in the Great Lakes today. This year we celebrate 100 proud years of the lighthouses guiding fleets of freighters, passenger liners, fish tugs, and recreational watercraft safely to our harbor.  Few shoreline communities in the Great Lakes region can offer such a rich blend of past traditions, surviving historical structures, and living maritime history as St. Joseph and Benton Harbor. The lighthouse and the commercial shipping industry it was built to serve remain vital to our understanding of the past, present, and future. The St. Joseph lighthouse's working waterfront and maritime tradition have defined the cultural life and economy of our community, and I look forward to another century of the lighthouse serving as a loyal beacon for our magnificent shores.                          ____________________
