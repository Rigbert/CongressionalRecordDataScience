DAINES. Mr. Chairman, in preparing this and in reading this bill, for those who want to see the heart and soul--the vision--of the Democrats, they can be found in this first paragraph of the bill. In fact, I will read it. ``The bill establishes the Medicare-for-all program to provide all individuals residing in the United States free healthcare.''  It goes on to say a couple of paragraphs later: ``Health insurers may not sell health insurance that duplicates the benefits provided under this bill.''  If that is not a complete takeover of the healthcare system from the government, then you tell me what is.
