Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to come today before this House and the American people to formally recognize and honor Superintendent Larry Wile of the Kalamazoo Regional Educational Service Agency for his 40 year dedication to educating Michigan's children. He has been a friend of mine and a steady friend of education. He has always had the interests of the students first.  Superintendent Wile began his career as a teacher and administrator in the Climax-Scotts Schools, a community in my district. This June, after 40 years of service, he will retire as Superintendent of the Kalamazoo Regional Educational Service Agency.  Larry Wile has had a distinguished professional life. He served as an administrator in Michigan's Comstock Public Schools. For twenty-eight years, he has served southwest Michigan first as the Assistant Superintendent and then Superintendent of the Kalamazoo Regional Educational Service Agency.  Mr. Speaker, I'm here to acknowledge Superintendent Wile as a brilliant example for many young Michiganders. Throughout his service, Larry Wile has exemplified leadership, perseverance, and above all, hopefulness for the future of our great country.  In addition to serving as an educator, Larry Wile has also served as the Chairman of three notable organizations: the State Association of Intermediate School District Administrators, the Regional Principal's Organization, and the Kalamazoo County School Officers Association. He continued his tradition of excellence as a member of the Kalamazoo County Chamber of Commerce Legislative Committee. Superintendent Wile personifies what it means to be a true public servant in today's society. For forty years, and indeed, his entire life, Larry Wile has shown a concern and a proactive attitude in regard to his community, a passion for instilling ethics and knowledge into his students, and ultimately, a love for his family.  Mr. Speaker, I believe I speak for every member of this Congress and all those who have been touched by Superintendent Wile's care and intellect when I extend to his wife Rosie, his children and grandchildren our congratulations and best wishes for a retirement filled with happiness and productivity. I now respectfully ask you to make these remarks a part of the permanent record of the Congress in order to ensure that future generations of educators, students, and the American public have the opportunity to be inspired by the contributions of Superintendent Larry Wile of Kalamazoo, Michigan.                          ____________________
