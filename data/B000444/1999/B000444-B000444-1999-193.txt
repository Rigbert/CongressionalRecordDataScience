 President, today I am introducing legislation which provides equity for a group of veterans at their final moment: those veterans who are buried in State-owned veterans' cemeteries.  For a number of years, the amount of space in national veterans' cemeteries has been rapidly declining. With the strong encouragement of the Federal government, the States have undertaken to develop their own veterans' cemeteries. When certain categories of veterans are buried without charge in these State veterans' cemeteries, the Federal government pays the State a $150 ``plot allowance'' for the burial space. However, only limited categories of veterans are covered by this payment: those who were discharged for disability or who were receiving disability-related compensation; those who died in a veterans hospital; and those indigent veterans whose bodies were unclaimed after death.  For the many other veterans who don't fall into one of these few categories, the federal government will pay nothing for their burial space if they are buried in a State veterans' cemetery. By contrast, if any of these veterans were buried in a national veterans' cemetery, for which they are eligible, the federal government picks up the cost of the burial space. This disparity seems inexplicable, a final insult to the dedicated service of men and women who unselfishly served their country.  My bill removes this inequity by stating that, for any veteran who is eligible for burial in a national veterans' cemetery but who is interred in a State veterans' cemetery, the federal government will pay the State a $150 plot allowance for the burial space. That's it. No ifs, ands, or buts. No exceptions.  The government promised these veterans that they would be taken care of in their final passage, and it must live up to this vow. Regardless of whether veterans are buried in a State cemetery or in a national cemetery, their service in the armed forces benefitted all of us, and we should stop quibbling about whether the location of the grave has anything to do with the dignity and selflessness of the service to the country.  Mr. President, I urge my fellow Senators to support this bill in the name of fairness and in recognition of the service to the country of all our veterans in their final hour.                                 ______                                       By
