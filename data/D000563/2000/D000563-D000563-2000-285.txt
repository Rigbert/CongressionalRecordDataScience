President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  July 11, 1999:  Thomas Erwin, 36, Oklahoma City, OK; Bernard Harrison, 17, Baltimore, MD; Anthony L. Holt, 28, Chicago, IL; Judy Holt, 47, Dallas, TX; Christopher F. James, 34, Oklahoma City, OK; Byron Sanders, 17, Baltimore, MD; Eugene Smith, 21, Charlotte, NC; Nakia Walker, 25, Washington, DC; Unidentified male, 23, Newark, NJ.                          ____________________
