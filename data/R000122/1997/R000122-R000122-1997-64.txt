HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield, but let me finish my point. I have the greatest respect for Senator Dodd, but he spoke of, ``Let's not concentrate on the few bad grants, let's concentrate on the 100,000 good grants.'' When he said that, I thought about Arkansas, because we got one last year. We made 12 applications and we received 1, for the Arts Council in Arkansas.  So I have great questions about the priorities. In Arkansas, the NEA spent 17 cents for every man, woman and child in Arkansas; 17 cents. In New York State the NEA spent $1 for every man, woman and child in New York State.  I'm sorry, everybody says, ``Give the NEA a chance.'' We have given them chance after chance after chance. Year after year these objections and these concerns have been raised. We see no reform. We see no change. Instead we see arrogant elitism. And I say it is time to end the NEA. Don't end support for the arts--no. But end this Washington bureaucracy, send that money back so Rhode Island will have another $123,000, so Arkansas will have another $700,000, so Alabama him have another half-million dollars, so the States all over this country can do more for those artists, for those schoolchildren who, too often, fall through the cracks.  I believe that the amendment that we have offered makes eminent common sense.  I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.
