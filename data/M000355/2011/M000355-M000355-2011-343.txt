 President, in the midst of all our other business, I would like to just pause and take a moment to recognize the outstanding work of Jody Hernandez, who left us yesterday after 16 years of dedicated Senate service. Jody came to Washington, by way of San Antonio, after graduating from Vanderbilt University. Over the years, she has lent her talents to the Republican Policy Committee, the Budget Committee, and with Senator Don Nickles on and off the Hill. David Schiappa convinced her to come back to the Senate in 2005, and she has been an indispensable part of the Senate floor team ever since. Whenever any of us had a question, she had the answer. She has been a friendly and welcoming presence in the cloakroom, regardless of how long her day was. She has been a tremendous help to every one of us. And we will all miss her. But we are all delighted that she has found her partner in life, and we wish her and her new husband, LCDR Glenn Wright, U.S. Navy, many years of happiness and every success as they begin their life together. Jody and Glenn met on a church trip to Israel in October and recently tied the knot. So I am sure many adventures lie ahead. We thank her for her good cheer, her professionalism, and her service.                          ____________________
