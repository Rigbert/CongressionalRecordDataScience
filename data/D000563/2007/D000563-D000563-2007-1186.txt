President, I have spoken many times about one of our Nation's greatest public servants, the late Senator Paul Simon. He was an honorable man who devoted his life to working for the public good.  In the months before his untimely death, Senator Simon returned to Washington to talk to his former colleagues about the need to strengthen our Nation's international understanding and our ability to remain a world leader in the 21st century. His desire to promote peace and security through mutual understanding and sensitivity to the rest of the world was borne out of the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  Senator Simon struggled with the question of how America could lead when so few of our citizens have the proper knowledge and understanding of the world beyond our borders. He knew that America's security, global competitiveness, and diplomatic efforts in working towards a peaceful society rest on our young people's global competence and ability to appreciate languages and cultural and social realities beyond what they may have experienced in the United States. He envisioned a United States populated by a generation of Americans with a greater knowledge and understanding of the world--a generation of our Nation's future leaders that have been abroad and have a personal connection to another part of the world.  Senator Simon's tireless efforts led to Congress's establishment of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission. I was honored to serve on this bipartisan Commission, and it was a privilege for me to introduce legislation last year that brought Senator Simon's dream one step closer to reality. The bill, based on the Commission's recommendations, would have established a study abroad program for undergraduate students that would help build global awareness and international understanding.  I am once again proud to stand here today and introduce legislation that embodies Senator Simon's vision. The bill has been renamed the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act so that all future generations will remember Senator Simon's commitment to international education.  The goal of this legislation remains the same: to encourage and support the experience of studying abroad in developing countries--in countries whose people, culture, language, government, and religion might be very different from ours. This bill aims to have at least 1 million undergraduate students study abroad annually within 10 years and to expand study abroad opportunities for students who are currently underrepresented.  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Foundation Act would establish study abroad as a national priority and provide the catalyst for the education community to commit to making study abroad an institutional priority.  This legislation would create an independent public-private entity, the Senator Paul Simon Foundation, that would award grants to carry out the goal of making study abroad in high-quality programs in diverse locations around the world the routine, rather than the exception, for college students. Students who were previously unable to study abroad due to financial constraints would be eligible for grants. Grants also would provide colleges, universities and nongovernmental institutions with the financial incentive to develop programs that make it easier for college students to study abroad.  The future of our country depends on having globally literate citizens--those who are able to look at other points of view and incorporate those ideas into their thinking and manner of interacting with others. I have shared thisPaul Simon quote before, and I will do so again because it is the most poignant example of Paul's vision in his own words:       A nation cannot drift into greatness. We must dream, and we      must be willing to make small sacrifices to achieve those      dreams. This major national initiative can lift our vision      and responsiveness to the rest of the world.  I ask my colleagues to join with me and with Senator Coleman in support of this legislation and to see to it that Senator Paul Simon's dream of building a stronger and more culturally aware nation is realized.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 991       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study      Abroad Foundation Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to President George W. Bush, ``America's      leadership and national security rest on our commitment to      educate and prepare our youth for active engagement in the      international community.''.       (2) According to former President William J. Clinton,      ``Today, the defense of United States interests, the      effective management of global issues, and even an      understanding of our Nation's diversity require ever-greater      contact with, and understanding of, people and cultures      beyond our borders.''.       (3) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission      on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program      pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations      and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).      Pursuant to its mandate, the Commission has submitted to      Congress and the President a report of its recommendations      for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at      institutions of higher education in the United States to      study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing      nations.       (4) Studies consistently show that United States students      score below their counterparts in other advanced countries on      indicators of international knowledge. This lack of global      literacy is a national liability in an age of global trade      and business, global interdependence, and global terror.       (5) By numbers ranging from 77 to more than 90 percent,      Americans believe that it is important for their children to      learn other languages, study abroad, attend a college where      they can interact with international students, learn about      other countries and cultures, and generally be prepared for      the global age, according to a December 2005 national survey      commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International      Educators.       (6) In today's world, it is more important than ever for      the United States to be a responsible, constructive leader      that other countries are willing to follow. Such leadership      cannot be sustained without an informed citizenry with much      more knowledge and awareness of the world than most Americans      currently possess.       (7) Study abroad has proven to be a very effective means of      imparting international and foreign-language competency to      students.       (8) In any given year, only approximately one percent of      all students enrolled in United States institutions of higher      education study abroad.       (9) Less than 10 percent of the students who graduate from      United States institutions of higher education with bachelors      degrees have studied abroad.       (10) Far more study abroad must take place in the      developing countries. Ninety-five percent of the world's      population growth over the next 50 years will occur outside      of Europe. Yet in the academic year 2004-2005, 60 percent of      United States students studying abroad studied in Europe, and      45 percent studied in four countries--the United Kingdom,      Italy, Spain, and France--according to the Institute of      International Education.       (11) The Final Report of the National Commission on      Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (The 9/11 Commission      Report) recommended that the United States increase support      for ``scholarship, exchange, and library programs''. The 9/11      Public Discourse Project, successor to the 9/11 Commission,      noted in its November 14, 2005, status report that this      recommendation was ``unfulfilled,'' and stated that ``The      U.S. should increase support for scholarship and exchange      programs, our most powerful tool to shape attitudes over the      course of a generation.''. In its December 5, 2005, Final      Report on the 9/11 Commission Recommendations, the 9/11      Public Discourse Project gave the government a grade of ``D''      for its implementation of this recommendation.       (12) Investing in a national study abroad program would      help turn a grade of ``D'' into an ``A'' by equipping United      States students to communicate United States values and way      of life through the unique dialogue that takes place among      citizens from around the world when individuals study abroad.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to significantly enhance the global competitiveness and      international knowledge base of the United States by ensuring      that more students in United States institutions of higher      education have the opportunity to acquire foreign language      skills and international knowledge through significantly      expanded study abroad;       (2) to enhance the foreign policy capacity of the United      States by significantly expanding and diversifying the talent      pool of individuals with non-traditional foreign language      skills and cultural knowledge in the United States who are      available for recruitment by United States foreign affairs      agencies, legislative branch agencies, and nongovernmental      organizations involved in foreign affairs activities;       (3) to ensure that an increasing portion of study abroad by      United States students will take place in nontraditional      study abroad destinations such as the People's Republic of      China, countries of the Middle East region, and developing      countries; and       (4) to create greater cultural understanding of the United      States by exposing foreign students and their families to      American students in countries that have not traditionally      hosted large numbers of American students.
