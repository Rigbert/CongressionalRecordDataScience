 President, we are on legislation we started Thursday night. We had discussion this Friday, although we had no votes on any amendments to the bankruptcy reform bill. I hope we can move forward with this legislation and get it passed before we adjourn.  This is the same piece of legislation that passed the Senate by a 97-1 vote in 1998. It was conferenced with the House. The conference committee report passed the House of Representatives by a very wide margin. The bill came to the Senate in the last 3 or 4 days of the session with a threat of long debates and filibusters against the conference report. Consequently, a bill that passed 97-1, probably coming out of the conference more favorable to the point of view of those who still had some questions about it. Yet a lot of those Members did not want that bill to go to final passage. Therefore, the last Congress ended with the bankruptcy conference report not passing.  We started over again in the new Congress. Since the first of the year, Senator Torricelli of New Jersey and I have been working on this legislation to bring our colleagues a bipartisan approach to bankruptcy reform that we hope will end the situation of some people who have the ability to repay some debt getting off scot-free. We think this legislation is a big step in that direction.  In my earlier statements on the Senate floor on Thursday and Friday, I alluded to the role that overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers play in the current crisis of our bankruptcy system. Although I cannot statistically support it, when I refer to the role of overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers I really think, in my heart, we are talking about a very small minority of bankruptcy lawyers. Still, there are those who play a role in people going into bankruptcy who I do not think the bankruptcy laws were ever intended to help, or, in any case, harming people who have a debt owed to them which is not paid.  One of the major problems with the bankruptcy system is the mind-set of some of the lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy. Many lawyers today view bankruptcy simply as an opportunity to make money for themselves with a minimal amount of effort. And this profit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy even when a financially troubled client has the obvious ability to repay his or her debts. As one of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in the Commission's 1997 report, many who make their living off of thebankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy has a moral dimension. Bankruptcy lawyers shouldn't counsel someone to walk away from his or her debts without pointing out the moral consequences of making a promise to pay and then breaking that promise. As I have said before, it cannot be good for the moral foundation of our nation if people learn that it is okay just to walk away and not pay your bills because that's easier and more convenient, and obviously better for somebody's pocketbook.  All across America some of the more unsavory bankruptcy lawyers have created high-volume law offices that herd people into bankruptcy as if they were cattle instead of individual human beings in need of advice and counseling. These offices are known as bankruptcy mills. These bankruptcy mills are nothing more than large scale processing centers for bankruptcy--there is little or no investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able to at least partially repay their debts. For example, one bankruptcy attorney from Texas was sanctioned by a bankruptcy court for operating a bankruptcy mill. According to the court, this attorney had very little knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively in the yellow pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising worked, because he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases per month. Most of the work was done by legal assistants with very limited training. The court concluded that the attorney's services       Amount to little more than a large scale petition preparer      service for which he receives an unreasonably high fee.  The practices of bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy that the Federal Trade Commission went so far as to issue a consumer alert warning consumers of misleading ads promising debt consolidation.  I refer you to this Federal Trade Commission Consumer News Bulletin, right here on this chart. It refers to a question,       Debt Got You Down? You are not alone. Consumer debt is at      an all-time high. What's more, record numbers of consumers--     more than 1 million in 1996--are filing for bankruptcy.      Whether your debt dilemma is the result of an illness,      unemployment, or simply overspending, it can seem      overwhelming. In your effort to get solvent, be on the alert      for advertisements that offer seemingly quick fixes. While      the ads pitch the promise of debt relief, they rarely say      relief may be spelled b-a-n-k-r-u-p-t-c-y. And, although      bankruptcy is one option to deal with financial problems,      it's generally considered the option of last resort. The      reason: Its long-term negative impact on your      creditworthiness. A bankruptcy stays on your credit report      for 10 years, and can hinder your ability to get credit, a      job, insurance, or even a place to live.  I think that there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need counseling and help with setting up a budget, but who do not need to declare bankruptcy. It is not surprising, Mr. President, that bankruptcy lawyers are leading the charge against bankruptcy reform.  Now, we have heard complaints from some on the Senate floor about protecting child support and alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. I want to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise that they can help deadbeat dads get out of paying their child support and other marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a book entitled ``Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy.'' Some things about that book are displayed on this chart.  I think that it is outrageous that bankruptcy lawyers are helping deadbeats to cheat divorced spouses out of alimony and to cheat children out of child support. This is a recipe for promoting poverty and human misery. Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join with me in condemning this sort of amoral conduct. Bankruptcy was never designed for the purpose of helping deadbeat spouses escape their financial obligations. Not only are the current practices of bankruptcy lawyers a disservice to their clients, they also cheat society as a whole.  Mr. President, I ask consent to have printed in the Congressional Record an article from the Los Angeles Times dated August 12, 1998.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     2.5% Rise in Personal Filings Pushes Bankruptcies to New High                  [From Times Staff and Wire Reports]       Total bankruptcies nationwide hit a record high in the      second quarter, apparently boosted by a flurry of personal      filings by people who fear imminent changes in the bankruptcy      law.       Business bankruptcies continued to decline, but personal      bankruptcies, which account for 97% of the filings, edged up      2.5% from the second quarter a year earlier. That pushed the      total number of bankruptcy filings to 373,460 in April, May      and June, surpassing by nearly 2% the previous high posted in      the second quarter of 1997, federal court officials said this      week. California's figures mirrored the nationwide trend.       Although a 2% rise is not large, given the steady and      previously sharper increases in bankruptcies in recent years,      analysts were still surprised by the continuing uptick in      personal filings. The economy remains relatively strong and      consumer delinquencies in general have come down in recent      quarters while some lenders have tightened their credit      standards.       But bankruptcy attorneys and other experts said some      consumers were being prompted by pending bankruptcy reform      legislation, which could take effect as early as the fall and      is expected to make it tougher for consumers to extinguish      their debts.       Indeed, attorneys are advising their clients that they may      want to take advantage of the current law while it is still      available.       ``I'm telling clients that it might very well end up being      harder to file for bankruptcy,'' said Joseph Weber, a      bankruptcy lawyer in Costa Mesa. Weber added that he also      thinks a ``false optimism'' is adding to the number of      bankruptcy petitions. ``When they perceive the economy to be      better, some spend beyond their means,'' he said.
