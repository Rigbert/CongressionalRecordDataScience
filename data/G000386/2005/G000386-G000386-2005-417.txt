 President, in 15 seconds I wish to say that I appreciate very much the accommodations Mr. Dorgan has made and the fine dialog we had in bringing a compromise to my amendment. I compliment him on the work he did on this issue 2 or 3 months ago on a similar amendment. I appreciate very much the cooperation we have had.  I yield the floor.
