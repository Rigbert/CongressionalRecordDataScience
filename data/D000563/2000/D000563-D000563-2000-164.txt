President, I make the following unanimous consent request. I understand 6 minutes is left of the Democratic leader's time. Senator Wellstone asked for 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent to follow Senator Wellstone and to speak for 6 minutes on the Democratic leader's time, unless a Republican Member comes to the floor, at which point I will yield to them to speak.
