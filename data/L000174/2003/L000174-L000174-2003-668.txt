It is part of an effort to pack the Federal courts.  In many ways, the debate has been in the hands of the White House. This is a debate that could have ended at any time the White House wanted it to end. We wonder, is there something in Mr. Estrada's writings that the White House doesn't want us to see? The White House could have long ago solved this impasse by letting the Senate have access to Mr. Estrada's memos, especially since Mr. Estrada said he is perfectly willing to have us see those memos. We have plenty of questions we wanted to ask about it but we have to have the paperwork. He told us even though he said under oath he is willing to let us see it, the White House told him he could not.  So really this debate is in the control of the White House, not in the control of the leaders of the Senate. Past administrations provided legal memos in connection with the nominations of Robert Bork, William Rehnquist, Brad Reynolds, Stephen Trott, and Benjamin Civiletti, and this administration actually provided White House Counsel's office memos of its nominee to the EPA.  Our request for his memos was made nearly one full year ago, Mr. President. The White House also could have helped resolve this impasse through instructing the nominee to answer questions about his views at his hearing, to act consistent with last year's Supreme Court opinion by Justice Scalia in a case the Republican Party won to allow judicial candidates to share their views, and to stop the pretense that he has no views. The White House is using ideology to select its judicial nominees but is trying to prevent the Senate from knowing the ideology of these nominees when it evaluates them.  Instead, it appears that the Senate Republican majority, at the direction of the White House, chose to extend this debate because its political operatives hope to use it to falsely paint those who will not be steam rolled as somehow being ``anti-Hispanic.'' The Republicans' resort to partisanship regarding this nomination disregards the legitimate concerns raised by many Senators as well as by respected Hispanic elected officials and Hispanic civil rights leaders. Moreover, the Republican approach and the President's approach has been to divide: to divide the Senate, to divide the American people and, on this particular nomination, to divide Hispanic Americans against each other.  That is wrong. It is wrong because the President campaigned on a platform of uniting, not dividing. It is wrong because our country needs us to build consensus and work together, especially in these most challenging times.  Instead of bringing up legislation that could unite us or setting aside time for debate on the international and domestic challenges our country is facing, the Republicans have again returned to the nomination of Mr. Estrada and they have set aside an hour and one-half this morning for a constitutional debate. Many Democratic Senators have already spoken about the Senate's proper role in the confirmation process under the Constitution. I recall, in particular, statements by Senators Daschle, Reid, Bingaman, Boxer, Clinton, Corzine, Dodd, Dorgan, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, Feinstein, Harkin, Johnson, Kennedy, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Mikulski, Sarbanes and Schumer, among many others.  What is disconcerting about the recent debate is what appears to be the Republican majority's willingness to sacrifice the constitutional authority of the Senate as a check on the power of the President in the area of lifetime appointments to our federal courts. I fear, Mr. President, that the Republican majority's efforts to re-write Senate history in order to rubber-stamp this White House's federal judicial nominees will cause long-term damage to this institution, to our courts, to our constitutional form of government, to the rights and protections of the American people and to generations to come. I have served in the Senate for 29 years, and until recently I have never seen such stridency on the part of an executive administration or such willingness on the part of a Senate majority to cast aside tradition and upsetthe balances embedded in our Constitution so as to expand presidential power.  In the time set aside by the Republican majority for this debate today, I welcome the opportunity to shed light on the fiction that cloture votes, extended debate, and discussion of the views of nominees are anything new or unprecedented. What I do find unprecedented is the depths that the Republican majority and this White House are willing to go to override the constitutional division of power over appointments and longstanding Senate practices and history. It strikes me that some Republicans seem to think that they are writing on blank slate and that they have been given a blank check to pack the courts. They show a disturbing penchant for reading our Constitution in isolation from its history and the practices that have endured for two centuries, in order to suit their purposes of the moment.  A few years ago, when Republicans were in the Senate minority and a democratically elected Democratic President was in the White House, columnist George Will, for example, had no complaint about a super-majority of 60 votes being needed to get an up or down vote on legislation or nominations proposed by the President. In fact, reflecting Republican sentiment at the time, what he said in his defense of the Republican filibuster of President Clinton's proposals, was the following:       The Senate is not obligated to jettison one of its defining      characteristics, permissiveness regarding extended debate, in      order to pander to the perception that the presidency is the      sun about which all else in American government--even      American life--orbits.  This is from the Washington Post on April 25, 1993. It apparently did not trouble him or other Republicans when they were in the Senate minority that the Constitution expressly requires more than a simple majority for only a few matters. In fact, Mr. Will wrote: ``Democracy is trivialized when reduced to simple majoritarianism--government by adding machine. A mature, nuanced democracy makes provision for respecting not mere numbers but also intensity of feeling.''  Of course, that was in 1993 and President Clinton's proposals and a Democratic Senate majority were being contested by Republican filibusters. What is different a mere 10 years later? Just that the parties have switched roles and this year Democrats are in the Senate minority and a Republican occupies the White House. I ask unanimous consent that a recent article by Edward Lazarus that critiques Mr. Will's new position be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 25, 1993]George Will, Miguel Estrada, and the Cloture Vote: How Will's Flip-Flop  of Positions Illustrates the Increasing Collapse of the Politics/Law                               Distinction                           By Edward Lazarus       The flurry over Miguel Estrada's controversial nomination      to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      continues on. So does the Senate Democrats' filibuster to      stop Estrada from being confirmed.       Meanwhile, a rarely-invoked Senate Rule on the cloture vote      has once again become a hot political football. Senate Rule      XXII requires 60 votes of the Senate's 100 to stop debate,      and break a filibuster.       Rule XXII's constitutionality is debated. Some believe that      votes must be by a simple majority of 51, not a supermajority      of 60, except in the limited cases in which the Constitution      imposes a different rule.       Attorney Lloyd Cutler has put the argument as follows:      ``The text of the Constitution plainly implies that each      house must take all its decisions by majority vote, except in      the five expressly enumerated cases where the text itself      requires a two-thirds vote: the Senate's advice and consent      to a treaty, the Senate's guilty verdict on impeachments,      either house expelling a member, both houses overriding a      presidential veto and both houses proposing a constitutional      amendment.''       It's an interesting argument. Even more interesting is that      the high priest of conservative columnists, George F. Will,      has, over time, taken both sides of it--first attacking it,      and now recently embracing it.       What spurred Will's change of mind? Sadly, it seems to be      purely politics. That would be fine if it were an issue of      policy, and politics. But it's not: It's an issue of      constitutional law, which is supposed to have an answer      deriving from history and precedent--an answer that      transcends politics.              George Will's Flip-Flop on the Cloture Vote       Will, a historian of sorts, frequently opines on legal and      constitutional issues. He generally holds himself out, as      most commentators do, as an honest broker of ideas, albeit a      broker with a distinct perspective.       In that role, Will has twice addressed the issue of Rule      XXII.       The first time was in 1993. At the time, Democratic      stalwarts, such as Cutler, were challenging Rule XXII. They      feared that, despite Democratic majorities in both the House      and Senate, Republicans would use the filibuster to frustrate      the agenda of the new Democratic president, Bill Clinton.       At the time, Will took Cutler to task for his doubts about      the constitutionality of Rule XXII. He complained that taking      issue with the Rule was ``institutional tinkering'' that      ``would facilitate the essence of the liberal agenda--more      uninhibited government.'' And he took direct aim at Cutler's      argument about the Rule.       Specifically, Will argued that the five instances of      supermajority votes listed in the Constitution were the only      time supermajority votes could be used for externally-     oriented legislation--``the disposition by each house of      business that has consequences beyond each house, such as      passing legislation or confirming executive or judicial      nominees.'' However, ``procedural rules internal to each      house,'' according to Will, ``are another matter.'' And in      that sphere, a supermajority cloture vote was fine.       Indeed, Will pointed out, history supports this view:      ``[T]he generation that wrote and ratified the Constitution--     the generation whose actions are considered particularly      illuminating concerning the meaning and spirit of the      Constitution--set the Senate's permissive tradition regarding      extended debate. There was something very like a filibuster      in the First Congress.''       Fair enough. Until one reads the column Will published last      week in The Washington Post regarding the Estrada nomination.      Here's what Will has to say now (with emphases added):       ``The president, preoccupied with regime change elsewhere,      will occupy a substantially diminished presidency unless he      defeats the current attempt to alter the constitutional      regime here. If at least 41 Senate Democrats succeed in      blocking a vote on the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the Constitution      effectively will be amended.''       If Senate rules, exploited by an anti-constitutional      minority, are allowed to trump the Constitution's text and      two centuries of practice, the Senate's power to consent to      judicial nominations will have become a Senate right to      require a 60-vote supermajority for confirmations. By thus      nullifying the president's power to shape the judiciary,      the Democratic Party will wield a presidential power      without having won a presidential election.       Wait a second. So Will now agrees with Cutler? And not only      that, he reads both the Constitution's text and ``two      centuries of practice'' relating to filibusters entirely      differently than he once did? What's prompted his change of      mind? And doesn't he owe Cutler an apology?       Obviously, conscientious commentators do change their views      when they re-examine them and find them in error. I am no fan      of a ``foolish consistency'' in such matters. But this kind      of change of mind--without explanation or apology--is quite      troubling.       Also troubling is the fact that Will's close analysis of      the Constitution and the First Congress's proceedings, so      important to him in 1993, is entirely missing here. And his      venom--once directed at Cutler--now draws on Cutler (without      attribution) instead. Only one conclusion seems possible:      This is an exquisitely brazen example of intellectual flip-     floppery that has nothing to do with law or the Constitution,      or American history, and everything to do with conservative      politics.          what the flip-flop means for will, and for all of us       The flip-flop is an embarrassment to Will and his      reputation. Sadly, it may also be more than that as well. I      fear that Will's adventure in hypocrisy is emblematic of what      may well be the worst truth in American political discourse:      nothing is shameful anymore. And no sense of integrity--an      integrity that transcends politics--remains.       It seems especially ironic (or perhaps appropriate) that      Will should come to represent this problem. After all, he--     and commentators of his ilk--have spent the last decade or      two bemoaning the rise of moral relativism in our society.      They mourn the death of ``shaming'' as an instrument of      behavior modification for politicians and citizens alike.       In the culture wars, Will and others like him have been the      army defending such concepts as objective truth and personal      responsibility. They have been the ones saying there is a      right thing to do, independent of politics, independent of      the times. They have carried the banner of integrity, in      short. Now it's plain, though, that Will has torn up that      banner even while pretending to uphold it.       I confess that I'm a sucker. I believe in these kinds of      things--integrity, truth, certain absolute moral values, a      right thing to do. Maybe it's all that Plato I read in      college. I've always believed there is such a     thing as a ``true'' answer (even if we cannot know it with      certainty), and that there are ways of discerning better      from worse, whether in argument or music or literature.       Nowhere did these beliefs seem to be more important than in      the field of law. Courts wield great power to shape the      social order and control the destiny of individuals. Their      integrity rests ultimately on the belief that their decisions      are not merely just that--exercises of power--but are, in      addition, principled attempts to discern the proper meaning      of the law. And the idea that there is a ``proper meaning''      in the first place, in turn presumes a universe that      recognizes a genuine ability to choose better arguments over      weaker ones, regardless of what one thinks of the results the      arguments lead us to.       In according with these principles, I've critiqued legal      reasoning even when I agree with its result, if I've felt the      reasoning itself was flawed. For instance, though I support      abortion rights, I've expressed strong qualms about Roe.       Now, however, it seems integrity is being radically      redefined, as pure loyalty--fealty to the party, the      political beliefs, the results that one prefers. Lying in the      service of a cause has become, in some circles, honorable to      do.    changing times have ushered in a norm of intellectual dishonesty       Intellectual dishonesty is pure poison to the enterprise of      the law. Yet countless examples show intellectual dishonesty      has now become a routine, expected part of American      discourse. The most obvious half-truths and hypocrisies are      greeted with shrugged shoulders and a grunt of ``what did you      expect?''       These dishonesties that we have come to accept too easily      range from the non-reasoning of Bush v. Gore, to the logic-     defying economic rationale for more tax cuts, to the ever-     shifting justification of war in Iraq. And they extend to      just about every other significant issue of law and policy      that affects American life.       Why does this happen? It cannot be because all the people      perpetrating these intellectual frauds are bad people. It's      been my experience (limited, I admit) that most people who go      into government or devote themselves to a life of public      policymaking or intellectualism, do so for the best of      reasons--because they want to help shape the world for the      better.       Then why? I found a partial answer watching, last night, an      old clip of Daniel Ellsberg being interviewed by Walter      Cronkite, in the wake of Ellsberg's controversial release of      the Pentagon Papers. To paraphrase, Ellsberg contended that      our society had become so divided, with each side so bent on      perpetuating itself in power, that government and the world      around it imposed a sustained and terrible pressure on good      people to make a choice. They could either leave that world      or, far worse, give up the search for truth, in exchange for      the search for victory.       That was more than 30 years ago. Has anything much changed?
