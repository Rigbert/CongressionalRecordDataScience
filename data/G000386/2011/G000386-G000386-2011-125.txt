 SFC Terryl L. Pasker from Cedar Rapids, IA, was shot and killed in Panjshir Province, Afghanistan, while serving with the Iowa National Guard in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was 39 years old and was just completing his second tour in Afghanistan. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Erica, his parents Mary and David, and those who knew him and cared about him. Terryl Pasker is described as an upbeat, religious man. He was known as a hard worker and he owned a contracting business in his civilian life. The loss of someone in their prime, with a bright future and a whole life left to live is a tragic thing. It gives us pause to reflect on the tremendous sacrifice we ask of our servicemembers, and have since the first minutemen rallied at Lexington and Concord. I would like to pay tribute to the life and service of SFC Terryl Pasker and ask that my colleagues join me in honoring his memory.                          ____________________
