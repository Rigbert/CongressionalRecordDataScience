Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to pay tribute to a distinguished Rhode Islander who is being honored for his outstanding contributions as the Chief of the Division of Parks and Recreation in the State Department of Environmental Management.  Throughout his long and distinguished career, William J. Hawkins, Jr., has contributed greatly to the quality of life in our State. Rhode Island is proud to boast of many natural resources and public facilities which afford residents and visitors wonderful recreational opportunities. Bill Hawkins has been with the division for more than two decades. Under his leadership and vision, those resources have been protected, promoted, and enhanced for the benefit of all.  Bill Hawkins is a Marine Corps veteran and has been a volunteer fireman in his hometown of Smithfield for over 25 years. In addition to his professional contributions, Bill and his wife, Anne, are the proud parents of six children, and their lives have been blessed with six wonderful grandchildren. He is a man whose family is truly his pride and joy.  He is a man of great purpose and integrity who has earned the admiration, affection, and respect of many. I would ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in recognizing an individual who has made a significant difference to the enhancement of out Nation's recreational resources.                          ____________________
