President, I would like to honor one of America's fallen, a brave soldier from the State of Oklahoma. SPC Adam Brewer was serving in Iraq when he died defending his fellow soldiers and this Nation. His memory continues on in testimony to the selfless way he lived.  Specialist Brewer graduated from Bartlesville High School in 2000 and joined the Army shortly thereafter. He served for 2 years and was assigned to 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, normally stationed Fort Hood, TX. Specialist Brewer was serving his second tour in Iraq and had taken part in the original invasion that began in March 2003. On February 25, 2005, his unit was deployed to an area near Taji, Iraq. An improvised explosive device exploded nearby, tragically killing him and two other soldiers.  At Specialist Brewer's funeral, the pastor put it well: ``Not only did he defend our country but he defended the values of freedom that we hold so dear . . . I know his passing has been hard. But for the rest of your life, whenever you see his picture or mention his name, you can be proud.'' We are indeed proud, as we are of those young men and women who have committed to defend our Nation and put their lives on the line every day.  But I think Specialist Brewer's mother Karen Brewer said it best, ``He wanted to serve his country, and he served it all the way.'' He indeed gave all that he had, in life and in death, for his country. The legacy of such sacrifice challenges us on behalf of the Senate, this Nation, and the cause of freedom around the world, I honor a special Oklahoman and true soldier, SPC Adam Brewer.                    Specialist Robert T. Hendrickson  Mr. President, I wish to honor a true hero who, on February 1, 2005, gave his life while serving in Iraq. SPC Robert Hendrickson is an example of the selfless service that is essential to this country's freedom.  Although he was born in Biloxi, MS, Specialist Hendrickson listed Broken Bow, OK, as his hometown. He attended school in Del City and Edmond before moving with his mother to Broken Bow. His father, Dave Hendrickson, says his son planned to return to school when he returned from service and study to become a pediatric nurse.  After high school, Specialist Hendrickson enlisted in the U.S. Army. He was assigned to the 2d Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, normally stationed in Fort Hood, TX. He was serving in Iraq with this unit when, just after the successful elections took place, his vehicle overturned. He was found unconscious and never recovered.  He died to help the Iraqi people achieve their freedom,'' Dave Hendrickson said. ``He died for the Iraqi people and the war against terrorism so that his son might have a safer world to live in.''  Specialist Hendrickson is survived by his parents, his sister, and a 6-year-old son, Dylan. ``He loved Dylan more than anything,'' Dave said. ``My son was a good boy. He was a good man. He was a good dad.''  SPC Robert Hendrickson was indeed a good man. He put aside his own safety, volunteering to serve in the most dangerous of professions. He gave so much and his sacrifice will be remembered by friends, family, and all of us who are profoundly indebted to him.                    Staff Sergeant Jason R. Hendrix
