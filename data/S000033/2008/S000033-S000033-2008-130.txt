 President, the State of Vermont is proud of the people in our state who organize the annual Stowe Weekend of Hope, one of the most inspiring and educational events for cancer survivors in the United States.  ``We believe that the Stowe Weekend of Hope is unique, as it covers all cancers, reveals the generosity of an entire community, and has enhanced the lives of thousands of past attendees and their loved ones,'' said Jo Sabel Courtney, the chair and cofounder of the uplifting event. ``Our mission,'' she explained, ``is to inspire, educate, and celebrate the lives of people living with cancer.''  Altogether, some 900 participants from 21 States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada participated in this year's events presented by the Stowe Area Association and the Vermont Cancer Center. The Stowe Area Association's lodging properties donated 312 complimentary rooms to cancer survivors and their loved ones.  Jo Sabel Courtney would be the first to tell you that making the weekend a tremendous success is a team effort. The Stowe Weekend of Hope Organizing Committee she chairs includes Leslie Anderson of Stowe; Trine Brink, Stowe; David Cranmer, Shelburne; Sandy Devine, Stowe; Jenn Ingersoll, Burlington; Kimberly Luebbers, Burlington; Kathleen McBeth, Stowe; Valerie Rochon, Stowe; Susan Rousselle, Elmore; Terry Smith, Stowe, and emeritus member and cofounder, Patti O'Brien, M.D.  We in Vermont are very proud of the efforts that all of these people put into organizing this annual event for the education and enlightenment of cancer patients, cancer survivors and their families, and I have very much enjoyed visiting with them over the last several years.  This year's participants in the Stowe Weekend of Hope included people with 46 different cancers, people who are confronting complex physical, emotional, spiritual, and financial challenges.  Nationally renowned oncology specialists from around New England, as well as leading oncologists and researchers from the Vermont Cancer Center, and the University of Vermont and Fletcher Allen Health Care Division of Hematology and Oncology were present at this year's eighth annual Stowe Weekend of Hope to provide up-to-date information to both the patients and their loved ones.  The weekend also included hands-on workshops, informational and support group gatherings, recreation opportunities, inspirational music, ecumenical services, motivational talks designed to heighten the emotional experience of healing and growth, and a time for relaxation and reflection.  On Sunday morning, participants gathered to dedicate the Flags of Hope and Healing that they had created. Theclosing ceremony also included prayer, dance, song and remembrances.  The Stowe Weekend of Hope was founded in 2001. Since its inception, the event has grown locally and nationally to continue its focus its mission of support, education and inspiration.  It makes me proud of Vermont.                          ____________________
