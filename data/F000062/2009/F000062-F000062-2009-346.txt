                               Exhibit 1                                                State Capitol,                                      Sacramento, CA, May 5, 2008.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As Congress again considers      legislation needed to implement the Settlement Agreement      reached to restore the San Joaquin River, I write to      reiterate my support of your leadership in this matter and to      urge Congress to act now to take advantage of this historic      opportunity. Restoring the San Joaquin River will provide      vital benefits to the environment, to the people of the San      Joaquin Valley, and to all Californians. I remain confident      that this settlement can be implemented to provide these      important benefits while minimizing impacts to the Friant      water users and preserving the regional economy.       The state of California has already committed substantial      funding to support the settlement effort. In November 2006,      California voters approved Proposition 84, the Water Quality,      Safety and Supply, Flood Control, Natural Resource Protection      Bond, which earmarks $100 million to support San Joaquin      River restoration. Other bond funds are available to provide      flood management improvements and to support regional water      supply reliability projects. Moreover, I have directed my      Administration to pursue all available opportunities to      contribute to the dual restoration and water management goals      of the Settlement Agreement.       Thank you again for your leadership to secure the passage      of the necessary legislation to advance the restoration of      the San Joaquin River. Please know that my Administration      remains committed to this important effort and we look      forward to continuing our work with the federal government on      this significant restoration program.           Sincerely,                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger,     Governor.                                  ____                                            Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2007.     Hon. Nick J. Rahall II,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of Justice (DOJ) strongly      supports H.R. 4074, the San Joaquin River Restoration      Settlement Act (originally introduced by Congressman      Radanovich as H.R. 24). This bill provides necessary      authorization and funding to carry out the terms of the San      Joaquin River Settlement. The purpose of the settlement is to      fully restore the San Joaquin River and to mitigate the      impact of water losses on water districts in the Friant      Division of the Central Valley Project who have long-term      contractual rights and obligations with the Bureau of      Reclamation. This settlement not only resolves litigation      over the operation of the Bureau of Reclamation's Friant Dam      east of Fresno, California, it provides a framework for the      restoration of the San Joaquin River and its fishery in a way      that protects the sustainability of farming in the Friant      Division.       On October 23, 2006, the United States District Court for      the Eastern District of California approved this settlement,      ending eighteen years of litigation, Natural Resources      Defense Council, et al. v. Kirk Rodgers, et al. The      Administration previously announced its support for      legislation implementing this settlement in testimony before      your Committee on March 1, 2007, by Jason Peltier, Principal      Deputy Assistant Secretary for Water and Science for the U.S.      Department of the Interior. The State of California has      pledged its support for the Settlement in the amount of $200      million.       Enactment of H.R. 4074 is essential to the implementation      of this historic, court-approved settlement. Without this      legislation, the Secretary of the Interior lacks sufficient      authority to implement the actions in the settlement,      Implementation of the San Joaquin River Settlement will avoid      the high cost and uncertainty that will result from a return      to litigation if the settlement is not implemented.       Thank you for the consideration of our views. Please do not      hesitate to contact this office if we can be of further      assistance in this matter. The Office of Management and      Budget has advised that there is no objection to the      submission of this letter from the standpoint of the      Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                         Brian A. Benczkowski,                                       Principal Deputy Assistant,                                                 Attorney General.
