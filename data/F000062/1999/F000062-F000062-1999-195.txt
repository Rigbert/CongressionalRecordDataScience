 President, today I am pleased to cosponsor with Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison, Pete Domenici and Connie Mack a resolution commending the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and the Komen National Race for the Cure for their commitment to eradicating breast cancer. June 5 will be the Komen National Race for the Cure Day and this resolution urges the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the American people to observe the day with appropriate activities.  Washington, D.C., will host the Race and there will be 98 races across the country will over 700,000 people participating.  There are 2.6 million women in this country living with breast cancer and more than 178,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Over 43,000 will die.  Diagnostic tools for breast cancer are very limited. Treatments for breast cancer are at best imperfect. We don't know how to prevent it. We don't know how to cure it. We need to redouble our effort to stop breast cancer now.  Congress is taking some steps. During the FY 2000 appropriations process, I hope we can increase researching funding for all cancers. We must pass legislation, such as S. 784 which I have sponsored, to require Medicare coverage of routine costs of clinical research trials and S. 6, to require private insurance coverage of the routine costs of clinical research trials. We should enact legislation assuring access to specialists and coverage of second opinions. We should pass Medicaid coverage for women who are screened by CDC's breast and cervical cancer program but have no way to pay for treatment when they learn they have cancer.  I call on my colleagues to join us in supporting the 10th anniversary Race by supporting this resolution and sending it to the President. As new understandings of cancer emerge almost weekly, we must do all we can to support increased research and access to services to end this scourge.
