Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for yielding time to me. It is also good to see the gentleman from New Mexico. It is also good to hear from the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] in his attempt here with this amendment to separate the wheat from the chaff and then try to export the chaff.  I rise in opposition to his amendment. Look, here is what this is all about. This is not going to take very long.  We must export high-value-added products. That is the future of agriculture program policy. The highest value ag products are branded products. These products are sold by brand loyalty.  The European Union has that all figured out. They will not let some branded products in. Here we have a Member of Congress that does not want to let the branded products out.  This amendment should be introduced in the Assembly of France or the Bundestag of Germany or the Parliament of maybe Great Britain. I have a better idea. What this is, basically, is just a revote on the previous amendment. You kill the branded products, you kill the program.  If that is what you want to do, go ahead and we can have a revote. But if you are really excited about a generic product as opposed to the laundry list of big companies who do such a great job on behalf of our farmers and ranchers and every consumer here with exports, let us just put it in a brown paper bag.
