Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and me.  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) and I have for many years had the great honor of cochairing the Fire Service Caucus, which is the largest caucus in this House. I notice that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), another cochair, is on the floor as well, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), who has been a cochair of the Fire Service Caucus, and others who have been strong supporters of the fire service, the emergency medical response teams, and when I say the fire service, both the paid professionals and the volunteer professionals who do such an extraordinary job in our community.  It has been said that there have been cuts in this bill to fire service assistance, and that is true. I know the chairman and the ranking member have fought very hard because the funds that they have available to them are limited. And I want to thank the chairman, as has the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon). I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), ranking member, for agreeing to work with us to offer this $50 million to the SAFER funding, which will provide additional dollars for personnel for both paid and volunteer departments which is so critically needed in the country today.  So without further prolonging the debate, I want to thank the chairman for facilitating the adoption of this amendment.
