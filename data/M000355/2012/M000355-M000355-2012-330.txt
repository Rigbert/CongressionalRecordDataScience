 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has spent his life working to help build a better Kentucky and a better United States of America. Mr. Donald E. Girdler of Pulaski County, KY, better known as simply ``Donnie,'' recently passed away. He was 63 years old.  Mr. Girdler was passionate about politics, and he made it his life's work. He entered the political arena when he first worked on the campaign of my good friend Congressman Hal Rogers of Kentucky's Fifth Congressional District. Mr. Girdler had worked for Hal as a detective for 5 years before Hal, then a Commonwealth's attorney, decided to make a run at the U.S. House of Representatives. The political savvy and direction that Mr. Girdler would bring to the table would propel Hal Rogers to victory.  There was a definite sense of gratitude from the Congressman for his trustworthy friend, Donnie Girdler. Mr. Girdler was at home in the world of politics and made connections in Washington, DC, that included becoming personally acquainted with five different Presidents of the United States and becoming personal friends with President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush.  Donnie went on to work for over a quarter of a century for Rogers before finally retiring and returning to offer his much sought after insight in local politics. He made friends in several southeastern Kentucky counties and helped many of them get elected to public office. Mr. Girdler became a distinguished political consultant for the Commonwealth of Kentucky because of his years of experience and, most importantly, his absolute love of public service.  Donald Girdler made an everlasting contribution to the world of Kentucky politics, and his motivation and innovation paved the way for others to get involved in their own way by bringing opportunities and jobs to the Pulaski County area. Donnie loved working in politics. He loved serving the public, but he was happiest when he was at his farmhouse in Nancy, KY, and he could fix up a pot of coffee and talk politics with his friends that would drop by from time to time.  At this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating Donald E. Girdler, an individual whose hard work and upstanding character, combined with his talents and passion, have forever changed the climate of politics in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  A news story highlighting the eventful life of Donnie Girdler was recently published in the Somerset, KY, area publication, the Commonwealth Journal.  I ask unanimous consent that said story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 9, 2012]                Political Icon Donnie Girdler Dead at 63                            (By Bill Mardis)       A longtime aide to Congressman Hal Rogers and one of the      Lake Cumberland area's most savvy political strategists has      died.       Donnie Girdler's death Sunday ended a career that evolved      through service in the military, local law enforcement,      congressional front man, and political adviser to candidates      and confidant to presidents. He was 63.       ``As one who knew him for 37 years, I will say he was      highly motivated,'' said Dan Venters, justice of the Kentucky      Supreme Court.       ``I have known Donnie Girdler as long as I have known      anyone in Pulaski County,'' said Venters. ``When I first came      here to work in (then) Commonwealth's Attorney Hal Rogers's      office, Donnie was the first person I met. He was serving as      Commonwealth's detective in Hal's office.       ``There was something about us that bonded . . . he became      one of my closest friends and confidants,'' said Venters.       Girdler worked for Congressman Rogers for more than a      quarter of a century.       ``Donnie was one of my closest advisers and served      faithfully as a field representative for the Fifth      Congressional District,'' said Rogers. ``As a retired member      of the honorable U.S. Marine Corps and a former      Commonwealth's detective, Donnie was a man of integrity and      loyalty.       ``With courage of conviction, Donnie played a key role in      bringing various opportunities and projects to the region.      But it was his passion for politics that many sought during      campaigns. His political savvy and insight were invaluable to      local, state and federal politicians. He was a true patriot      and a true friend,'' said Rogers.       Girdler was a friend of presidents. He was personally      acquainted with five presidents and was a friend of the two      Bushes--George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush. He      worked in Bob Dole's presidential campaign and was a      presidential elector for George W. Bush.       Locally, Girdler managed the successful campaign of Pulaski      County Judge-Executive Barty Bullock and served as Bullock's      deputy judge for a year and a half.       ``I am very saddened by the recent passing of Donnie      Girdler,'' Bullock said in a statement. ``I first met him      when I ran for county judge-executive in 2006. As we worked      and spent numerous hours together, we became very good      friends.       ``Since the onset of his illness we have not had as much      communication as in the past, but I still think of our      friendship fondly. I know that Donnie had many friends, and      will be sadly missed by all who knew him,'' Bullock said.       A political consultant since leaving Congressman Rogers's      office, Girdler developed close friendships with politicians      and officeholders in wide areas, particularly in McCreary,      Whitley, Clay and Knox counties.       Said Lori Hines, a political partner, ``He had a great      insight into the human mind. He knew how people would react      more than anyone I have ever known. He definitely was a      people person. His voice was what defined him. People would      stop at his farmhouse in Nancy, have a cup of coffee and talk      politics,'' said Hines.       Girdler has been nominated as a member of the Republican      Fifth District Hall of Fame. He will be inducted posthumously      in March.       His body is at Pulaski Funeral Home where funeral      arrangements are pending. A complete obituary will be in      Wednesday's Commonwealth Journal.                          ____________________
