 President, the country and the President had to wait 2 years. It has been going on for 2 years. This very expensive investigation took 2 years to be concluded. Look, it is not unreasonable to give the special counsel and the Justice Department just a little time to complete their review in a professional and responsible manner.  Remember, as I said earlier, we are likely dealing here with other potential prosecutions, classified information, and damaging people's reputations. There is no evidence that the Attorney General is not going to produce as much information as possible for all of us, and that is why I objected.  I think it is a reasonable thing to do. We have been waiting for a long time for this report to wrap up. It is largely good news, not just for the President but for the country.
