Res. 330       Whereas the United States currently imports the majority of      its crude oil;       Whereas ensuring access to and stable prices for imported      crude oil for the United States and major allies and trading      partners of the United States is a continuing critical      objective of United States foreign and economic policy for      the foreseeable future;       Whereas the 11 countries that make up the Organization of      Petroleum Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') produce 40 percent      of the world's crude oil and control three-quarters of proven      reserves, including much of the spare production capacity;       Whereas beginning in February 2004, OPEC instituted      production cuts, which reduced production by 2,000,000      barrels per day and have resulted in dramatic increases in      crude oil prices;       Whereas in February 2004, crude oil prices were around $28      per barrel and have steadily risen since then, exceeding $38      per barrel in March 2004, the highest prices in 13 years;       Whereas the increase in crude oil prices has translated      into higher prices for gasoline and other refined petroleum      products; in the case of gasoline, the increases in crude oil      prices have resulted in a pass-through of cost increases at      the pump to an average national price of $1.75 per gallon;       Whereas increases in the price of crude oil result in      increases in prices paid by United States consumers for      refined petroleum     products, including home heating oil, gasoline, and diesel      fuel; and       Whereas increases in the costs of refined petroleum      products have a negative effect on many Americans, including      the elderly and individuals of low income (whose home heating      oil costs have doubled in the last year), families who must      pay higher prices at the gas station, farmers (already hurt      by low commodity prices, trying to factor increased costs      into their budgets in preparation for the growing season),      truckers (who face an almost 13-year high in diesel fuel      prices), and manufacturers and retailers (who must factor in      increased production and transportation costs into the final      price of their goods): Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the President and Congress should take both a short-     term and a long-term approach to reducing and stabilizing      crude oil prices as well as reducing dependence on foreign      sources of energy;       (2) to address the problem in the short-term, the President      should communicate to the members of the Organization of      Petroleum Exporting Countries ``OPEC'' cartel and non-OPEC      countries that participate in the cartel of crude oil      producing countries that--       (A) the United States seeks to maintain strong relations      with crude oil producers around the world while promoting      international efforts to remove barriers to energy trade and      investment and increased access for United States energy      firms around the world;       (B) the United States believes that restricting supply in a      market that is in demand of additional crude oil does serious      damage to the efforts that OPEC members have made to      demonstrate that they represent a reliable source of crude      oil supply;       (C) the United States believes that stable crude oil prices      and supplies are essential for strong economic growth      throughout the world; and       (D) the United States seeks an immediate increase in the      OPEC crude oil production quotas;       (3) the President should be commended for sending Secretary      of State Powell to personally communicate with leaders of      several members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting      Countries on the need to increase the supply of crude oil;       (4) to ameliorate the long-term problem of the United      States dependence on foreign oil sources, the President      should--       (A) review all administrative policies, programs, and      regulations that put an undue burden on domestic energy      producers; and       (B) consider lifting unnecessary regulations that interfere      with the ability the United States' domestic oil, gas, coal,      hydro-electric, biomass, and other alternative energy      industries to supply a greater percentage of the energy needs      of the United States; and       (5) to ameliorate the long-term problem of United States      dependence on foreign oil sources, the Senate should      appropriate sufficient funds for the development of domestic      energy sources, including measures to increase the use of      biofuels and other renewable resources.
