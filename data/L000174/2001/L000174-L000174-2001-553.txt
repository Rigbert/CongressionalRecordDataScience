I know the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, also strongly supports it. It is the type of bipartisan amendment that can be agreed to on this side of the aisle.  I have been checking around, and I do not find anyone over here who disagrees with it. I hope on the other side it can also be agreed to. If so, that is one we can move quickly to accept.  I want the distinguished Presiding Officer to know I checked on this side and there are no objections to her amendment, which is a good one.  However, I am disappointed that my good friend, the majority leader, has filed cloture on this bill. The Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, and I have been working to get amendments offered, filed, agreed to, if possible, and modified, if needed. We presented a good-faith list of about 15 amendments on our side of the aisle as of last Friday. We are awaiting a response. I know a number of amendments have been filed by Republican Senators, and we are trying to quickly clear them on our side if we can. I will continue to work to move forward on this.                            Amendment No. 41
