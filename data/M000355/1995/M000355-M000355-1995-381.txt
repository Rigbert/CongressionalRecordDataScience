 President, I would like to recognize Louisville Male High School, from Kentucky, who won first place at the State competition of the We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution. This victory entitles these young scholars to compete in the national finals held in our Nation's Capital.  The members of the Louisville Male High School team are: Shannon Bender, Josh Bridgwater, Shilo Burke, Katie Callender, Scott Embry, Jessi Followwill, Adam Greenwell, John Grissom, Christy Jones, Jonathan Keith, Stephanie McAlmont, Stephen McAlmont, Shannon McMillan, Travis Moore, Kristi Mosier, Adam Pedigo, Melanie Rapp, Amber Rowan, Chris Rutledge, Shannon Simms, Eric Stevens, April Stivers, Ricky Suel, Danyaun Vandgrift, Shaniqua Wade.  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Sandra D. Hoover, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the team. The district coordinator, Tommy Dowler, and the State coordinator, Tami Dowler also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the team reach the national finals.  The We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution program, funded by Congress, is designated to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The 3-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with both students and teachers.  Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in recognizing these students. It is refreshing to see young people wanting to gain an informed perspective about the history and the principles of the United States constitutional government. I wish the members of the Male High School We the People team the best of luck and look forward to their future in politics and government.                          ____________________
