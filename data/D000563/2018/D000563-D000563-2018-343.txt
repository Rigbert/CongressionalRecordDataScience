President, we are in the process of considering an omnibus budget bill. It is over 2,000 pages long. In fairness, it includes many provisions of legislation that has been worked on by many of us for months, so it isn't a surprise package, by and large. There are elements in it that are new and that have been recently negotiated, but the underlying bill--the appropriations bills included in it--has been the subject of committee hearings and negotiations literally for months. I know that because since last year, we have been working on the Defense Department appropriations, which is included in the bill.  My reason for coming to the floor, though, is to address an issue that is not included in the omnibus bill--one that I believe should be and one that is timely and compelling--and there is no reason why it is not included. It relates to those young people who were brought to the United States by their parents when they were infants, toddlers, children, and ended up in undocumented status in this country.  Some of them--a very small number of them--may have been smuggled across the border into the United States. More likely, a common situation is that they came here on a visitor's visa with their parents, the visaexpired, and they stayed. That accounts for almost half of those who are currently undocumented in the United States.  The difference is obvious. We are talking about children who really had no voice in their parents' decision about coming to this country and who literally grew up here, many times believing they were legal in the United States. It wasn't until later in life, usually when they were 10 or 12 years old, that their mothers and fathers sat down and said to them: We never filed the appropriate papers. You are undocumented in America. It means that your life is different from the lives of all the other kids you go to school with.  These kids may be worried about making the football team or getting an A in math, but then their parents say: You also have to be worried about somebody knocking on our front door and deporting our family back to some other country.  Your life in the United States could end at any moment. Be careful. Be careful not to violate the law. Be careful to keep your head down. Whatever you do, don't tell people that you are undocumented because it could subject you and members of your family to automatic deportation.  That is what they grew up with. Through no fault of their own, they were brought to the United States. They are living in this country. They are standing in classrooms in our schools, pledging allegiance to that flag every single day, yet not legal, not documented in the United States. They are undocumented.  Sixteen or seventeen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act, which said that those young kids deserve a chance--a chance to earn their way to legal status, earn their way to citizenship. If they become part of drug gangs or criminal enterprises, so be it--they will forfeit any right to become any part of America's future; if not, if they are prepared to finish school and prepared to either continue their education, enlist in our military, or get a good job, we will give them a chance. That is what the DREAM Act said, and for 17 years, I have been trying to make it the law of the land, and I have fallen short.  President Obama, when he was a Senator here from Illinois, was my colleague, and he was my cosponsor on the DREAM Act. So when he became President and it was clear that we couldn't pass the DREAM Act in Congress, I asked him: As President, can you do something to help? And he did. He created the DACA Program.  Under the DACA Program, these young people could come forward, pay about a $500 filing fee, and go through a criminal background check to make sure they were no danger to this country. If they passed it, they would be given permission under President Obama's Executive order--under the DACA order--to live in the United States for 2 years at a time and then to renew their status. During that 2 years, they couldn't be deported, and they could legally work.  It was a big decision for a lot of these young people. Remember what I said earlier--that their parents had warned them: Don't tell the government who you are. Don't tell them where you live. They could use that information against you.  But 780,000 young people came forward, trusting this government--trusting that if we invited them to be a part of the United States on a renewable, temporary basis, it would not ultimately hurt them--780,000.  What did they end up doing? Most of them went to school, but going to school as an undocumented person in America is a different challenge. You don't qualify for one penny of Federal assistance--no Pell grants, no government loans--so getting through college under those circumstances means borrowing money from some other source or working jobs to pay for your education, which many of them did.  Over the years, these DACA recipients ended up graduating from school. There are 20,000 of them teaching in schools across America. They are the teachers in the grade school and middle school and high school classes, and they have DACA protection. Nine hundred of them volunteered to serve in our military. Think about that for a moment. They stood up and took an oath to serve the United States in the military and to literally risk their lives for a country that does not recognize their legal status. Nine hundred of them are in that circumstance.  Many of them have done amazing things in their lives. I have come to the floor and told maybe 100, 110 stories of these Dreamers. They are amazing young people. They are resilient; they are talented; they are promising; they are exciting. Yet they are not legal in the eyes of the law in America.  So we tried. We tried to make sure there was a way to protect them when the new President came into office. President Trump had said very clearly in his campaign that immigration was a big issue. He said a lot of things. Some of them were inflammatory, but, interestingly enough, he said several times that Dreamers are different. These young people are different.  He told me personally: Senator, don't worry about it; we are going to take care of those kids. I believed him. I was hoping he would find a way to either embrace the Dream Act or extend DACA so that these young people would have their chance.  But on September 5 of last year, President Trump made an announcement with Attorney General Sessions. He said: This is the end of DACA. This is the end of protection for these young people. By March 5 of this year, 2018, the program will no longer exist. He said to Congress: Do something about it. He challenged us to pass a law.  The March 5 deadline was looming. Young people were falling out of the protection of DACA status, and their lives were uncertain. Some of them had quit school. They just didn't think there was any future or hope for them. Some of them faced the prospect of losing their job when they lost DACA protection. That was the reality.  So there we sat, with that March 5 deadline looming--a deadline we knew was important because that was when all protection and all renewals would end for many, many thousands of these young people. A number of us took it up as a challenge, six of us--three Democrats and three Republicans. We sat down for months to try to write a new DACA law--and then there was a breakthrough.  On January 9 of this year, President Trump called about 24 or 25 Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate Members, to actually come to a meeting at the White House in the Cabinet room. It was an interesting meeting. It was the fourth time I had ever spoken to President Trump, and he invited me to sit right next to him. It was a little surprising that a Democratic Senator would be allowed to do that, but he invited me to, and we spent an hour, with the television coverage constant, discussing this issue. The President said some things that were encouraging about what we could do to solve this problem--a problem he had created when he eliminated the DACA Program.  He said many things during the course of that meeting. He said: ``We're going to do DACA, and then we can start immediately on . . . phase two, which would be comprehensive.'' He was referring to other immigration measures. Then he said: ``We do a phase one, which is DACA and security, and we do phase two, which is comprehensive immigration.''  The President added that as part of any immigration deal, he wanted to end the diversity visa lottery--a separate issue--and change our longstanding laws that have allowed families to stay together and eventually be reunited as Americans. He referred to this as chain migration.  When the President made that offer to solve the problem, which he had created when he eliminated DACA, several of us came back to Capitol Hill and said: We have to get this done.  We labored quickly and made some tough decisions, Democrats giving on some issues, Republicans giving on others. We came up with a bipartisan bill--just what the President had asked for.  We called him. It was 2 days later--January 11. I know; I made the call. I said: Mr. President, we have a bill. Senator Graham, a Republican of South Carolina, and I, as well as four other Senators, have come up with a bipartisan bill.  He said: Bring it to the White House. Don't waste any time. I want to get this done.  That was at 10 in the morning. We were scheduled and went to the WhiteHouse at noon. By the time we arrived, it was pretty clear that something dramatic had happened in the meantime, because someone in the White House had invited five other Members of Congress from the Republican Party, all of whom opposed our effort. The meeting was pretty well stacked against us. I will not get into the detail of the meeting. It has been widely reported. But at the end of it, President Trump rejected a bipartisan approach to solving this problem.  It wasn't the only time he rejected a bipartisan approach. Senator Schumer and Leader Pelosi had offered him a similar approach before, saying: We can work together. It appeared they had an agreement, but it evaporated in a matter of hours.  We know, as well, that there were offers made of bipartisan approaches. Senator McCain and Senator Coons offered a bill on the floor of the Senate. It was a good bill--not exactly what I wanted by any means, but at least it solved the problem. It was vehemently rejected by the Trump administration.  All in all, there were six different bipartisan proposals offered to President Trump to solve the problem he had created by eliminating DACA. He rejected every single one of them.  He sent to the floor of the Senate a bill offered by Senator Grassley of Iowa. Senator Grassley's bill embodied the President's approach to this. Now, understand the Senate's scorecard here. There are 51 Republican Senators and 49 Democratic Senators. So when the President called his own bill, one of our Senators, Senator McCain, was away ill, but there were 50 Republican Senators and 49 Democrats who voted on that day.  How many votes did the President's immigration proposal get? Thirty-nine. The President got 39 votes. It was kind of a shock that the President's own party didn't support the President's bill--at least not all of them.  When we offered the one I supported, the plan offered by Senator Rounds and Senator King, it ended up with 54 votes. Eight Republicans joined to have a bipartisan measure. But it wasn't enough; 54 votes will not do it. On an issue like this, it takes 60. So we have nothing--nothing. What that means is, in the eyes of the law, for the time being, these DACA-protected young people have no legal protection--save one other element.  While we were debating, the courts were also involved. Two different Federal courts issued an order to the Trump administration and said: Stop. Don't do another thing; don't deport these kids. In fact, allow them to renew their DACA status.  Former Senator Sessions, now the Attorney General, filed an emergency effort before the U.S. Supreme Court to stop that decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected it. So now, today, there at least has been a postponement of deporting the young DACA kids. We don't know if that postponement will last a week, a month, a year. There is no telling. It is a pending court case. That is the only thing that is stopping the deportation of these 780,000 young people. That is it.  The obvious question is, Well, why did you stop? If you failed to meet the March 5 deadline, why didn't the Congress--why didn't the Senate, why didn't the House--continue the effort to try to solve this problem? Isn't that what you were elected to do, Mr. Senator?  The answer, obviously, is: Yes, we should. But we haven't.  That is why I have come to the floor today. We have this 2,000-page bill that does not solve the DACA problem. We have this 2,000-page bill that addresses every subject imaginable but doesn't address the looming deadline we face in America. We are one court decision away from hundreds of thousands of young people being deported.  What do the American people think of this idea of undocumented people, here but not recognized by law? I will tell you what they think. Eighty-five percent of the American people believe we ought to do what is right and fair for these young people. They support the Dreamers, and they support giving DACA protection. Eighty-five percent--60 percent of those who voted for President Trump--say that we should fix the DACA Program.  But we have failed again. We have failed to do what the President challenged us to do, as he continues to reject every bipartisan proposal that has been brought before him--every one of them.  I am going to be making a unanimous consent request when this is over. I think I know how it will end. Any single Senator can object and stop the protection of these DACA young people, and one is prepared to do it. It is my understanding that he is going to demand that we instead pass the President's immigration plan, which received--remember--39 votes. Not even all of the Republican Senators supported it. It wasn't bipartisan in any way. There are provisions in the President's plan that are just plain wrong, and even 14 Republicans realize that and voted against it.  So here we are at this moment, with an important bill with many positive aspects in it for all of America, including my State of Illinois. Yet there is one critical element still missing. We have failed to include a provision to solve the DACA problem created by President Trump. His refusal to accept any bipartisan compromise leaves us emptyhanded and these poor young people struggling to figure out what their lives will be.  Last week, I was in the Chicago for what I refer to as high holy days in Chicago--the St. Patrick's Day weekend, with parades and parties and breakfasts and lunches. I skipped one of the traditional breakfasts to go out to Loyola University's school of medicine. The reason I went there is called Match Day at medical schools. It is when graduates of medical schools apply for their residencies. Residency, of course, is a continuation of their education, leading up to their becoming actual practicing physicians. It is a huge day in each of their lives. They have gone through college; they have finished medical school; and now they wait for that letter that gives them a chance to finish their medical education.  I wanted to be there because six of the graduates of the Loyola University Chicago Stritch College of Medicine were protected by DACA. They are young people who are extraordinarily talented from all over the United States. They were given a chance to go to medical school, and here they were in a situation, waiting to see if they could become doctors. It turned out that because of our failure--because of the President's removing the DACA Program and our failure to pass a replacement, two of them have their residencies in doubt. A residency is a job. It is a big job. You don't just work 40 hours a week. It is sometimes 60 to 80 hours a week. It is a big undertaking. These young people, without DACA protection, cannot legally work in America and, therefore, found it next to impossible to find hospitals and universities that would take them and allow them to complete their medical education. That is the real-life consequence of our failure to act.  That is the real-life consequence of our failure to include in this omnibus bill--or any bill to this point--a solution to the problem created by President Trump. That is why I am going to make this unanimous consent request that will, in fact, pass the Dream Act, solve this once and for all, and create a law that protects these young people and others in similar categories--one that has been offered on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and one that I believe should be passed immediately.                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1615  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 1615 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further ask consent that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
