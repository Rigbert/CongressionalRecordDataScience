 REID. That is true.  Mr. McCONNELL. I would suggest another way to resolve the issue. I would ask that with respect to the House message on the CJS appropriations bill, that the motion to concur with an amendment be the Baucus-Grassley amendment which was filed earlier today.  I know my friend and colleague is going to offer some scaled-down version of that shortly. But if we offered instead the Grassley-Baucus amendment which was filed earlier today, that would include the unemployment extension. That was one of the features of that Baucus-Grassley amendment.  So if this consent were granted, it would allow us to work on that package rather than the version that the leader of the majority is going to offer here shortly that includes only four of those provisions.
