Speaker, the image of terrorism are ingrained in our minds. What was often seen as someone else's problem is now our problem.  If America is being terrorized without and within, this Congress should not be terrorized by special interest groups opposed to legislation which would protect us. When Congress passed its antiterrorism bill, the gun lobby opposed a provision which would have required tracer particles in explosives so that law enforcement could track the source of terrorist bombs. Sadly, more than 200 Members of Congress bowed to the NRA and voted to deny the FBI this important tool to fight terrorism.  Now we are being asked to pass additional antiterrorism legislation in light of the recent tragedies. But the gun lobby has once again made it clear that it will oppose any effort to put tracers in explosives.  As America would not be intimidated by terrorists, this Congress should not be intimidated by the gun lobby. Before we go home this week, let us pass an antiterrorism bill that will protect American families, not protect special interest groups.                          ____________________
