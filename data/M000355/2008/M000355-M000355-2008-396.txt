 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good friend and respected Kentuckian, Dr. Harry Carloss. Dr. Carloss has worked diligently for over 32 years to treat thousands of his patients who face one of life's most terrible illnesses, cancer.  Originally from Lexington, KY, Dr. Carloss went to the University of Louisville Medical School and later worked at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in San Diego, CA. Dr. Carloss, along with and his wife Barbara, returned a few years later to Kentucky and settled in Paducah to practice as an oncologist. Dr. Carloss worked in Paducah for 28 years, choosing to help those who oftentimes were facing a death sentence.  Along with helping his patients, he became a point man in the campaign to battle cancer. He has written medical scientific papers, been involved in many research and clinical trials over his career, and been given numerous accolades in the form of honors and awards from his peers.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a man who worked tirelessly and gave so much of himself to the people he served. Recently the Paducah Sun published a story about Dr. Harry Carloss, which admirably illustrates the work, sacrifice and commitment Dr. Carloss gave to his patients, and to finding a cure for cancer. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be included in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Paducah Sun, Mar. 12, 2008] Carloss Standing Down--After a Reluctant Withdrawal, Combatant in War                     on Cancer Looks Back on Campaign                          (By Steve Vantreese)        Paducah, Ky.--A cancer doctor dying of cancer--that sort      of story has a dark irony.        In the case of Paducah oncologist Harry Carloss, happily      it isn't true.        ``I've heard the rumor,'' he said, not particularly      offended. ``I don't have cancer. I have physical limitations      that forced me to retire.''        Instead of his primary foe over 32 years as a cancer      fighter, a fall from a ladder stopped the 57-year-old Carloss      in his oncological tracks. He broke his back, had it      surgically repaired as best as could be done--ruined spinal      parts removed, at least--and now is debilitated. Not dead,      not totally paralyzed, both of which he could have been. Just      limited.        He returned to his practice after injury and surgery, but      found after a trial period that he couldn't remain on his      feet for any length of time, or sit in most circumstances,      for that matter. He makes little reference to ongoing pain,      loss of sensation and difficulties in walking that came with      the nerve damage.       ``Other people have far worse problems,'' Carloss notes in      self-deferring fashion.        He's seen enough to know. As once the sole oncologist in a      void west of Louisville, south of St. Louis and north of      Nashville, Carloss saw a steady parade of patients in dire      straits.        The Lexington native and University of Louisville medical      school graduate went to the Scripps Clinic and Research      Foundation (San Diego, Calif.) to work in primarily      hematology. He and his wife, Barbara, returned to Kentucky,      coming to Paducah as a smaller town in which to raise their      kids.        ``I came here to be an oncologist, but I had doubts at      first that a town the size of Paducah could support an      oncologist,'' Carloss said. ``That turned out to be the joke      of the century.''        In the 28 years that he practiced in Paducah, Carloss      treated thousands. When he recently had to cease practice, he      found that he had approximately 3,000 current patients on      chemotherapy who shifted their cases to other physicians'      care.        Even though cut short by result of accident and injury,      Carloss can still claim a lengthy practice in a field that      often doesn't produce long runs.       ``Thirty-two years is a long time to practice as an      oncologist,'' Carloss said. ``There is a high burnout rate.      Most doctors who do this end up in research or something      outside seeing patients every day.''        One reason is that there is extra emotional burden in      specializing in the care of people who in many instances are      fatally ill.        The position of the oncologist has improved through the      years as medicine has, yet there is still the excess baggage      that comes from serving some of the sickest people.        ``Their problems become your problems,'' Carloss said.      ``Especially during the early years of my practice, before      medicine evolved as much, many cancers were just a death      sentence.        ``The stuff we had to use for chemotherapy would either      kill you or cure you,'' he said. ``It has to attack cancer      cells, but it attacked white blood cells, too. We now have      antidotes that chemo patients get to keep their white cell      levels from dropping.       ``There are lots of things we have to battle cancer now      that we didn't have then,'' Carloss said. ``And over the      years the mortality for cancer has gone down. It's become      more of a chronic disease than a death sentence.''        That has eased Carloss' burden of fighting what too often      seemed a losing battle. More clear wins against cancer      certainly helped, but he also has learned to benefit      patients--and himself--with relative, mitigated victories.       ``I discovered pretty early that I couldn't fix      everything,'' he said. ``What I learned is, while I might not      be able to save somebody, there are things I could do. I      might give them more time, make sure they had less pain and      improve the quality of the life they had left.''        Carloss said fairly early in his practice he got help in      dealing with losses, assistance that came from dying men.       ``I explained to one man that he was terminally ill and      offered him a chance to take part in some research,'' Carloss      said.       ``He really didn't show any emotion and I wasn't sure he      understood, so I explained his situation again--and still no      emotion.       ``Then he told me that he'd landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day      and everybody in his group was killed but him,'' he said.      ``He figured that everything he'd done since that day was a      bonus. And he said if he could do anything that would help      somebody else with the time he had left, he'd be glad to.''        A young man told Carloss that there was a blessing in his      cancer as opposed to a fatal heart attack.       ``He said at least he had time to correct his mistakes and      say his good-byes to people,'' Carloss recalled.        Carloss doesn't regret the emotional expenditures from his      past practice. He does have some sore spots about some of its      frustrations.       ``Because of the way treatment is paid for, all services      aren't available to everybody,'' Carloss said.        He said Medicare regulations and the resulting insurance      coverage parameters are such that every cancer patient simply      cannot get access to some of the drugs that might be      beneficial.       ``Now drugs have become so expensive that reimbursement      drives what can be used for a patient,'' Carloss said. ``I      could, or I used to could write you a prescription for a drug      that would cost you $72,000 for a year's supply. There are      drugs available that nobody can afford.       ``That's the part of the practice that I don't miss,'' he      said. ``Before, in the first 25 years of my practice, if      there was a drug out there, I could use it for a patient and      it would be paid for. We never turned anybody away if they      didn't have the money.''        Beyond patient care in small town America, Carloss has      been a point man in the campaign to counter cancer.        He has been involved in a wealth of research and clinical      trials through the years. He likewise has been a prolific      writer of medical scientific papers.        Carloss' honors and awards among medical peers have      stacked up through his career. His foremost recognition may      be his selection for mastership in the American College of      Physicians, which comes only for those cited for exceedingly      stellar career achievements.        Carloss, a plain talker might say, had a lot of irons in      the fire. His injury-forced retirement was such an abrupt      change in schedule, the reversal of pressure was so extreme      that it might have produced the bends in a mental sense.        Long days of life and death decisions were suddenly      switched over to longer days of no particular commitments.       ``I had lots of people that I was taking care of, and it      took me two months to stop calling the office every day to      check on them,'' he said. ``I solve problems during the      night, and it took me two months before I could sleep through      the night and not be lying there working things out in my      head.''        The demands of the career don't seem to have taken a      regrettable toll, however.       ``If I could do it all over tomorrow, I'd do it again,''      Carloss said.                          ____________________
