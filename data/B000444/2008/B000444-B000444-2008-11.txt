 This bill, consistent with the Constitution of the United States, prohibits the Bush administration from entering into a binding security agreement with Iraq without the approval of Congress. It would also prohibit the obligation of any funds to implement such an agreement.  I regret that I am compelled to introduce this legislation. If the President had embarked on these negotiations in a more responsible manner--by being clear about the objective, by ensuring that the agreements would not tie the hands of the next administration, by actively consulting with Congress as a partner in the process--this bill would be unnecessary. But the Administration has done none of these things, and so my colleagues and I want to ensure that Congress, and thus the American people, is brought into the process.  Let me take a step back and summarize how we got to this point. From October 2003 until the present day, the American military presence in Iraq has been authorized under international law through a series of UN Security Council Resolutions. Last November, President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki signed a ``Declaration of Principles,'' which set out a framework for our countries to negotiate, by yesterday--July 31, 2008--agreements governing cooperation in the political, economic and security spheres. The Declaration indicated that the two countries would not seek to renew the United Nations mandate for American troops in Iraq past December 31, 2008. Among other things, the Declaration contemplates ``providing security assurances and commitments to the Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression against Iraq'' and supporting Iraq ``in its efforts to combat all terrorist groups,'' including Al-Qaeda, Saddamists, and ``all other outlaw groups regardless of affiliation.'' In other words, all the folks fighting in Iraq and killing each other.  The Declaration may result in two pacts. One would be a ``Strategic Framework Agreement'' that will ``set the broad parameters of the overall bilateral relationship in every field,'' according to the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker. This might be better titled ``What the United States will do for Iraq,'' because it consists mostly of a series of promises that flow in one direction--promises by the United States to a sectarian government that has thus far failed to reach the political compromises necessary to build a stable country.  The second agreement is a ``Status of Forces Agreement'' or SOFA, governing the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq, including their entry into the country and the immunities to be granted to them under Iraqi law. The administration claims that this agreement is mostly ``routine'' because we have SOFAs with over 90 countries around the globe. But conditions our soldiers face in Iraq are far from ``routine,'' despite recent improvements in security. Moreover, this SOFA would be much broader than the typical SOFA, from what we know. It would provide us with access to bases from which our military would operate, provisions that are usually in a separate facilities or ``basing'' agreement. This SOFA would also deal with contractor immunity, would permit U.S. forces to engage in combat operations in Iraq, and would provide authority for detaining insurgents. This is not a typical SOFA.  One of these agreements will reportedly contain a ``security arrangement''--a pledge by the United States to consult on next steps if Iraq is threatened. The Administration suggests that such an agreement is unremarkable, and that it does not bind the United States. But at a time when we have over 100,000 troops on the ground, an expansive program to train and equip Iraqi forces, and multiple U.S. military facilities, the pledge is, in reality, little different from a binding security commitment. Certainly, the government of Iraq and its people will perceive that we are signing up to defend Iraq against external threats.  Yesterday's deadline has apparently not been met. The New York Times reports, however, that the Bush administration and Iraqi government are close to an agreement. But Congress still remains largely in the dark.  We have not seen draft language. We do not definitively know which portions of the agreement will be binding, and which will not be. We are not in a position to evaluate whether the agreement will create obligations--either legal or political--that will constrain the next administration, whether Democratic or Republican. The President cannot make such a sweeping commitment on his own authority. Congress must grant approval. The legislation we introduce today requires that Congress be made part of the process.  I have often stated that no foreign policy can be sustained without the informed consent of the American people. More than 5 years ago, President Bush went to war in Iraq without gaining that consent--by overstating the intelligence and understating the difficulty, cost and duration of the mission.  In the final months of his term, President Bush is once again acting without the informed consent of the American people, putting us on a course to commit the Nation to a new phase of a long war in Iraq, and thereby bind his successors to his vision of U.S. policy in Iraq. By these agreements, the President will make it harder for his successor to change course.  Let me be clear. I support the concept of a Status of Forces Agreement with Iraq. But not at the cost of limiting our operational latitude or making security commitments--legal or political--that are not approved by Congress.  Administration officials have indicated that the Iraqi government is resisting the inclusion of key provisions that U.S. forces need in order to operate in Iraq. Given the difficulty of securing Iraq's consent to the broad authorities that the United States now has by virtue of the U.N. Security Council Resolutions, I believe the best option for the United States at this juncture is to seek an extension of the current United Nations Security Counsel resolution for Iraq.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3433       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq Security Agreement Act      of 2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On November 26, 2007, President George W. Bush and      Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki signed the Declaration      of Principles for a Long-Term Relationship of Cooperation and      Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States      of America (in this Act referred to as the ``Declaration of      Principles''), with the goal of concluding a final agreement      or agreements between the United States and Iraq by July 31,      2008, ``with respect to the political, cultural, economic,      and security spheres.''       (2) The Declaration of Principles contemplates the United      States ``providing security assurances and commitments to the      Republic of Iraq to deter foreign aggression.''       (3) In 1992, pursuant to section 1457 of the National      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991 (50 U.S.C.      404c), the executive branch submitted a report to Congress on      then-existing security commitments and arrangements.       (4) The report described in paragraph (3) defined a      ``security commitment'' as an ``obligation, binding under      international law, of the United States to act in the common      defense in the event of an armed attack on that country.''      The report noted that all current security commitments of the      United States are ``embodied in treaties which receive the      advice and consent of the Senate.''       (5) The report defined a ``security arrangement'' as a      ``pledge by the United States to take some action in the      event of a threat to that country's security. Security      arrangements typically oblige the United States to consult      with a country in the event of a threat to its security. They      may appear in legally-binding agreements, such as treaties or      executive agreements, or in political documents, such as      policy declarations by the President, Secretary of State or      Secretary of Defense.''       (6) The United States Ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, has      stated that the agreements to be concluded as anticipated by      the Declaration of Principles will ``deal with the status of      U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq past 2008'' and ``set the      broad parameters of the overall bilateral relationship in      every field''.       (7) On November 26, 2007, Assistant to the President and      Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan,      Lieutenant General Douglas Lute, stated, ``We don't      anticipate now that these negotiations [under the Declaration      of Principles] will lead to . . . formal inputs from      Congress.''     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) any agreement that sets forth the ``broad parameters of      the overall bilateral relationship [as between the United      States and the Republic of Iraq] in every field,''      particularly one that includes a security commitment or      arrangement provided to the Republic of Iraq by the United      States, would result in serious military, political, and      economic obligations for the United States, and thus,      consistent with past practice, should involve a joint      decision by the executive and legislative branches; and       (2) a short-term extension of the mandate of the Multi-     National Force in Iraq (currently provided by United Nations      Security Council Resolution 1790 (2007)), would, in concert      with Iraqi law, provide United States forces with the      authorities, privileges, and immunities necessary for those      forces to carry out their mission in Iraq.     SEC. 4. ANNUAL REPORT ON SECURITY AGREEMENTS.       (a) Reports Required.--Not later than 180 days after date      of the enactment of this Act, and every February 1      thereafter, the President shall submit to the appropriate      congressional committees a report (in both classified and      unclassified form) on United States security commitments to,      and arrangements with, other countries.       (b) Content.--Each report submitted under subsection (a)      shall include the following:       (1) The text, and a description, of each security      commitment to, or arrangement with, one or more other      countries, whether based upon--       (A) a formal document (including a mutual defense treaty, a      status of forces agreement, a pre-positioning arrangement or      agreement, an access agreement, or a non-binding declaration      or letter); or       (B) an expressed policy, whether expressed orally or in      writing.       (2) An assessment of the need to continue, modify, or      discontinue each of those commitments and arrangements in      view of the changing international security situation.     SEC. 5. CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESS.       Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense      shall consult with the appropriate congressional committees      about the negotiations pursuant to the Declaration of      Principles. After the initial consultation, the Secretary of      State and the Secretary of Defense shall keep such committees      fully and currently informed regarding the status of the      negotiations. Prior to finalizing any agreement that includes      a security commitment or security arrangement with Iraq, the      Secretary of State should provide the text of the agreement      to the appropriate congressional committees.     SEC. 6. PROHIBITIONS.       (a) Prohibition on Entry Into Force of Certain      Agreements.--No agreement containing a security commitment      to, or security arrangement with, the Republic of Iraq, may      enter into force except pursuant to Article II, section 2,      clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States (relating      to the making of treaties) or unless authorized by a law      enacted on or after the date of the enactment of this Act      pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 2 of the      Constitution (relating to the enactment of laws).       (b) Prohibition on Use of Funds.--No funds may be obligated      or expended to implement an agreement containing a security      commitment to, or security arrangement with, the Republic of      Iraq, unless it enters into force pursuant to Article II,      section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States      or is authorized by a law enacted on or after the date of the      enactment of this Act pursuant to Article I, section 7,      clause 2 of the Constitution.       (c) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order for either      House of Congress to consider any bill, resolution,      amendment, or conference report that provides budget      authority for the implementation of an agreement entered into      in contravention of subsection (a).     SEC. 7. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.
