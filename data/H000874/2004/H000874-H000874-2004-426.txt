Leader, I want to make this comment. I make it as an interesting comment, that during the Clinton years, the gentleman claims that it was the Republicans who created those jobs. Is it not ironic, Mr. Leader, that the Republicans cannot do that when they not only have the House, the Senate, but also the Presidency? Could it be that perhaps the difference was President Clinton? Because with total control, as your friend Dick Armey noticed last time, you own the town and have for the last 3 years. Is it not ironic that you claim credit for doing it before but you cannot do it now?  Mr. DeLAY. I lived this history. I very much remember that the Balanced Budget Act of 1996 and 1997 was vetoed twice by President Clinton and then signed by President Clinton with very little changes. The restraint on spending through the whole process, the Welfare Reform Act that was vetoed two or three times if I remember, all of the issues that actually got to the President's desk in those years were resisted by the President while he took credit after he signed it for everything, including the economy.  Then we find ourselves coming into a new administration when the recession started in the old administration, and this administration was saddled with a recession as it came in and did exactly what needed to be done, along with the Republican House and Senate and, that is, give the types of tax relief and economic policies that now we see are working and a growing economy that the American people are experiencing, not the economy described by the other side of the aisle. Unemployment is going down, jobs are going up, people are finding jobs. I see no reason to extend after 26 weeks unemployment benefits.
