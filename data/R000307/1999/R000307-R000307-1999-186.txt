President, if I may respond to my distinguished friend, the whole goal of this is to provide the farmer and rancher with the risk management tools to enable that decisionmaking to be made by the individual producer as opposed to those of us in Washington who respond, as I indicated before, it seems like almost even numbered years to the plight of those who are experiencing disasters. We think this program or this reform will certainly represent a lot more consistencies.  Yes, it will cost money, but if you add up the average $1.5 billion that we have paid in disaster programs, not to mention the $6 billion emergency bill as of last year, of course that is reflective of the loss of export demand we have seen because of the economic problems all over the world. But I certainly agree with my colleague and my cosponsor.  Mr. President, I have several unanimous consent requests, I tell my colleague, if I may offer them at this point.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Craig, Burns, Hagel, Daschle, Conrad,  and Baucus be added as original cosponsors on the bill just introduced by Senator Kerrey and myself.
