 I said yesterday the Biden-Specter bill is a question of, is it better than the underlying bill? The underlying bill does the same thing the Senator just suggested that this bill does. The differences are, we save $53 billion. There is $3 billion in work funds for the States, individual responsibility contracts, no food stamp block grants, as the underlying bill has, and the State option for vouchers, among other things.  I think this is a much preferable bill than the underlying bill, and I would encourage my colleagues to vote for the Biden-Specter amendment, which is better known, quite frankly, as the Castle-Tanner bill.
