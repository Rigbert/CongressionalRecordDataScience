President, I am pleased to stand before the Senate today to tell my friends about Vermont's Northeast Kingdom--a place that is known as much for its natural beauty as the rural and industrious Vermonters who have settled there.  This region, defined by the three northeastern-most counties of Vermont that sit between the headwaters of the Connecticut River and the U.S.-Canadian border, became one of America's first National Geographic geotourism destinations. The designation highlights the character and sense of place that has come to define the dozens of mountain valley communities that sit in Orleans, Essex, and Caledonia Counties.  My wife Marcelle was born in the Northeast Kingdom, just south of the Canadian border in the city of Newport. Since then, like many Vermonters, we have often found ourselves heading to this part of Vermont to visit friends, go for a hike, or find a special place to have a meal. The people of the Northeast Kingdom have made this region of Vermont advance while carefully holding on to the key elements of their identity. Whether they are crafting furniture from the forests of the north woods or diversifying their family farm, these individuals have helped the communities of northeastern Vermont grow.  This autumn, Michelle Edelbaum and Daria Bishop of the Burlington Free Press published an article about a trip the two of them shared through the area, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of the article offering a glimpse into these ``Kingdom Gems.''  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From The Burlington Free Press, Sept. 30, 2007]                              Kingdom Gems                         (By Michelle Edelbaum)       When trees scream with crimson, gold and orange, head to      the Northeast Kingdom for world-class leaf peeping.       With foliage in mind, photographer Daria Bishop and I spent      a day exploring the towns, shops and people that make the      area special. We strayed from our loose plan to follow      locals' hand-drawn maps down scenic dirt back roads to not-     to-miss destinations.       On our 13-hour tour we didn't reach half the locations on      our list, which included classic attractions Cabot Creamery,      Great Vermont Corn Maze, Stephen Huneck's Dog Mountain and      Fairbanks Museum. But we did visit a handful of gems worth a      stop.                               GREENSBORO       Twenty-eight years ago an enthusiastic David Smith and his      wife, Willie, took over Highland Lodge in Greensboro from his      parents and fostered a community-centric gathering place that      hosts out-of-town guests and community gatherings. ``The      Walking Ladies,'' a group of 55 women who range in age from      40 to 86, meet thrice weekly in the dining room for coffee      and muffins after they exercise.       On their recommendation we ate moist, sugar-crusted      blueberry muffins, from-scratch blueberry pancakes and a      fluffy cheese and veggie omelet with McKenzie sausage links.      After breakfast, we set out on the lodge's 30 miles of trails      from a grove of soaring pine trees decorated with colorful      placards of children's artwork, courtesy of the lodge's      summer campers.       In Greensboro village two stores dominate the retail scene.      The Miller's Thumb, housed in a former grist mill, is filled      with local artwork, fancy kitchen knickknacks, Italian      pottery and antiques. Watch water rushing under the red      building through a plexiglass-covered hole in the floor.       At Willey's Country Store, customer Doug Aronson of      Woodbury declares ``if you can't find it here, you can't find      it anyplace.'' Wine, appliances, groceries, hardware and      clothes are sold at the town institution, housed in a      rambling white building that dates to the 1800s and has been      owned by the Hurst family for five generations.                               CRAFTSBURY       Look up as you approach Pete's Greens in Craftsbury. The      roof of the farm's serve-yourself stand is laden with      trailing plants, flowers and herbs. Peek inside at artful      displays of colorful organic vegetables.       Consider yourself lucky if you hit Stardust Bookstore and      Cafe on the idyllic Craftsbury Common during its limited      school-centric hours. The store, run primarily by students      from Craftsbury Academy, sells new and used books, coffee and      espresso drinks inside the quaint 1940s former public      library. Part of the proceeds are given to nonprofit      organizations and granted as scholarships.       Just outside of town down a long dirt road lies Craftsbury      Outdoor Center, on Great Hosmer Pond with 10 kilometers of      trails open for biking and hiking. Ski director John Brodhead      suggests spending an afternoon canoeing, mountain biking,      walking with a naturalist, kayaking or relaxing in an      Adirondack chair by the lake.                                 GLOVER       Untold treasures lie within Red Sky Trading Co. in Glover.      Owner Cheri Safford's whimsy is on display in the unique and      colorful assortment of vintage house wares, Melmac resin      dishware, trays, china tea cups, garden decor, picture frames      and more, that fill the maroon barn.       Buttery cookies, dense bars and rich chocolate cakes from      Safford's kitchen share counter and refrigerator space with      Vermont cheeses, natural sodas and local produce. Don't miss      Safford's award-winning canned jellies, jams, bread and      butter pickles, chutneys and pickled beets--just like Grandma      made.       Between a bank of beer coolers and a rack of chips at      Currier's Quality Market Inc. stand three stuffed deer and a      black bear; turn the corner into the postal area and you'll      come face-to-face with a 948-pound moose. More than 100      taxidermy animals are on display in the one-stop shop,      including a porcupine, wild boar, ram and British timberwolf.       Jim Currier, who's owned the store for 40 years with his      family, started the ever-growing collection 25 years ago with      a deer head from his father. Hunters with a mount at the      store earn ``bragging rights,'' said Currier's daughter Julie      McKay. Coming soon: a red fox, possum, and snow goose.       By 4 p.m. we hadn't eaten lunch and regretfully skipped      Bread and Puppet Museum and its ``Cheap Art.'' We missed      Mount Pisgah in Barton, with stunning views of Lake      Willoughby, biking in Burke at Kingdom Trails, and a mandarin      orange chicken salad at River Garden Cafe. We also passed on      flat bread and microbrews at Trout River Brewing Co. in      Lyndonville and coffee and chitchat at Miss Lyndonville      Diner.                             ST. JOHNSBURY       Instead we split for St. Johnsbury, where local-food-     centric Elements Food and Spirits, like many destinations in      the Northeast Kingdom that have irregular hours, isn't open      on Monday.       At Kham's Thai, chef and manager Souki Luangrath, whose      Essex Junction-based parents own the restaurant, says quality      ingredients are a priority--he even deveins shrimp. Our      refreshing late lunch included fresh spring rolls filled with      crisp veggies, savory coconut Tom Kha soup and saucy panang      curry with chunks of vegetables.       Railroad Street in downtown St. Johnsbury is home to      several dozen independently owned shops and restaurants.      Moose River Lake and Lodge Store sells jewelry with a      Southwestern flair, Adirondack and Amish-style furniture,      fine wine kept in a walk-in vault, art by illustrator Philip      R. Goodwin, quality sportswear and home decor.       Scottie Raymond, formerly an employee at Outdoor Gear      Exchange in Burlington, recently opened Kingdom Outdoors,      which sells technical outdoor wear and gear. Raymond inked      the graffiti-style mural in the skate shop and lounge      downstairs.       During the day, hit Dylan's Caf for creative breakfast and      lunch combinations, the newly opened Village Baker for      artisan bread and pastries, or Boxcar and Caboose for coffee      drinks and books. If you have time, check out PODO Shoes, the      Northeast Kingdom Artisan Guild and Gallery and Frogs and      Lily Pads.                          ____________________
