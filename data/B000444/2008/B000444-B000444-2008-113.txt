 This measure would enable the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to continue payments to Russia related to the International Space Station after 2011.  As with any legislation proposed by request, we introduce this bill for the purpose of placing the Executive branch's proposals before Congress and the public without expressing our own views on the substance of the proposals. As chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Foreign Relations, we intend to give the administration's requested legislation careful review and consideration.  The Administrator of NASA, Michael Griffin, has submitted this legislation to the committee, along with a section-by-section analysis that helps to explain why NASA wants this legislation and what they believe it will achieve. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support and a section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                                         National Aeronautics and                                          Space Administration,                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2008.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden,     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Aeronautics and Space      Administration (NASA) proposes the enclosed amendment to the      Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act (50 USC      1701 note). The purpose of the amendment is to permit NASA to      continue to procure Russian support for the International      Space Station (ISS) until suitable U.S. capabilities are in      place. We urge enactment of this important amendment.       The amendment provides a balanced approach, maintaining      both U.S. nonproliferation principles and objectives as well      as a U.S. presence on ISS. The justification and purpose for      this proposed amendment are stated more fully in the enclosed      sectional analysis. As an overview, NASA has procured Soyuz      services through the fall of 2011, consistent with existing      authority under the Act. However, U.S. obligations to provide      crew transportation and emergency services to the ISS      continue beyond 2011, and Soyuz will be the only viable      option for the United States to meet these obligations until      the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle or U.S. commercial      providers can provide such transportation and rescue      services. Fabrication of Soyuz vehicles must begin      approximately 36 months prior to launch, according to the      responsible Russian entities. Thus, unless contractual      arrangements for the provision of crew rescue and rotation      services beyond 2011 are concluded in 2008, the production of      Soyuz vehicles for U.S. crew transportation requirements will      be at risk. This, in turn, means that prompt legislative      action is needed to provide further relief beyond 2011 and      allow for the negotiation of these arrangements.       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is      no objection to the submission of this legislation from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                               Michael D. Griffin,     Administrator.                                  ____   Amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria Nonproliferation Act                           Sectional Analysis       The Administration remains committed to the important      objective of persuading the Russian Government and Russian      entities to improve their nonproliferation efforts regarding      Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Accordingly, the proposed      amendment to the Iran, North Korea, and Syria      Nonproliferation Act (the Act) would maintain key existing      U.S. nonproliferation tools while allowing payments to      Russian entities that support U.S. obligations to the      International Space Station (ISS) beyond December 31, 2011.       The provision would extend the Act's exception to the      prohibition on ``extraordinary payments'' to the Russian      government and Russian entities for goods or services      relating to the ISS from January 1, 2012 to the end of the      life of the ISS. It would exclude from the exception any      payments after December 31, 2011 for cargo services provided      by a Progress vehicle. The new provision would also exclude      from the exception payments for crew transportation or rescue      services provided by a Soyuz vehicle once (1) the U.S. Orion      Crew Exploration Vehicle reaches Full Operational Capability      or (2) a U.S. commercial provider of crew transportation and      rescue services demonstrates the capability to meet ISS      mission requirements.       An international partnership governed by an      Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) among the United States,      Canada, multiple European States, Japan and Russia      established the ISS. This partnership is a long-standing and      interdependent one, with roles and responsibilities outlined      in the IGA and subordinate agreements for design, development      and operations of the program. Pursuant to the IGA and      subordinate agreements, NASA has an obligation to its non-     Russian ISS Partners to provide crew rotation and rescue      services during the life of the ISS. Currently, the Russian      vehicle Soyuz is the sole provider of rescue services, with      the Space Shuttle providing crew transportation. After      Shuttle retirement, the partnership will be dependent on      Russia to provide both crew transportation and rescue      services with Soyuz until the U.S. Orion Crew Exploration      Vehicle (CEV) achieves Full Operational Capability (currently      projected for 2016) and can provide crew transportation and      rescue services, or a U.S. commercial provider can      demonstrate the capability to provide crew transportation and      rescue services to meet ISS mission needs.       NASA has procured Soyuz services through the fall of 2011,      consistent with existing authority under the Act. Fabrication      of Soyuz vehicles must begin approximately 36 months prior to      launch based upon information provided by the Russian      entities responsible for manufacturing these vehicles. Thus,      unless contractual arrangements for rescue and crew rotation      services after 2011 are concluded in 2008, the production of      Soyuz vehicles for U.S. crew transfer and rescue will be at      risk. This in turn means that prompt legislative action is      needed to provide further relief beyond 2011 and allow for      the negotiation of these arrangements.       Absent the proposed relief, the United States will be      unable to meet one of its most critical partner obligations:      providing crew transportation and rescue services to      European, Japanese and Canadian crews. The United States      would not have an American ``presence'' aboard the ISS,      either in terms of astronauts or access to research      facilities for the U.S. scientific community, if we could not      purchase crew transportation and rescue services from Russia,      as no non-Russian crew transfer vehicles will be available      until the CEV reaches full operational capability or a U.S.      commercial provider demonstrates the capability to meet ISS      crew transportation and rescue needs. Given NASA's      operational, engineering, safety and other responsibilities      for the ISS, NASA is concerned whether the ISS could remain      fully operational for any significant time period absent an      American presence.       Moreover, the authority under the present exception to the      Act has been used to obtain ancillary goods and services from      Russia in addition to crew transport and rescue. For example,      although purchased from Russia, the Zarya module is legally a      U.S. element under the Space Station agreements and NASA must      purchase unique tools and engineering support, such as      sustaining software, from Russia for the continued operation      of the module. NASA will have a continuing requirement to      procure certain goods and services where Russia offers unique      capabilities, such as those related to Russian space suits,      software and hardware engineering support, and Extravehicular      Activity tools and training, which are required for effective      operations onboard the ISS. This amendment will allow NASA to      continue to purchase such goods and services that are      necessary to meet U.S. responsibilities under the Space      Station Agreements.       In addition, this limited relief being requested (i.e.,      through the life of the ISS) may be necessary even after a      U.S. commercial capability is available, because some      potential U.S. commercial providers of cargo services and of      crew transportation and rescue services have Russian      contractors or other relationships with Russian entities      that, without this amendment, could trigger the Act's      ``extraordinary payment'' prohibition.       With respect to furthering the United States'      nonproliferation objectives and tools, in addition to the      positive incentive provided by prudent, closely monitored      space cooperation in areas of great benefit to the United      States, the proposed amendment would not affect the current      nonproliferation framework. The first five sections of the      Act establish a requirement to report to Congress on every      foreign person that transfers controlled items to, or      acquires controlled items from, Iran, Syria or North Korea      and authorizes sanctions against such foreign persons. These      key reporting and sanctions provisions would not be affected      by the proposed amendment. In addition, the amendment leaves      in place the ban on any United States government agency      making extraordinary payments in connection with the ISS or      other human space flight to any persons (including entities)      subject to sanctions under the Act or the Proliferation of      Weapons of Mass Destruction Executive Order (E.O. 12938, as      amended by E.O. 13094) or if the U.S. government agency (in      consultation with other interested U.S. government agencies)      anticipates that such payments will be passed on to such      persons. Finally, specific proposals for cooperation with      Russia would continue to be subject to review under relevant      mechanisms such as the State Department's Circular 175      process for interagency review of international agreements.      Likewise, export and import licensing regulations would      ensure that U.S. nonproliferation objectives are maintained.                          ____________________
