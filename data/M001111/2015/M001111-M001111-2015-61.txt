 President, I wish to recognize the National Women's Law Center for its longtime leadership and tireless commitment to expanding opportunities for women, girls, and families. The law center's advocacy has made a difference in countless lives for more than 40 years, and I have been proud to work with its members on many issues during my time in the Senate.  On July 30, the Coalition on Human Needs will honor the law center as its 2015 Human Needs Hero, recognizing years of research, analysis, advocacy, and litigation on a wide range of issues at the State and Federal levels. Since its inception in 1972, the law center has been a tireless advocate for women, children, families, and those Americans most in need. It has been at the forefront of many important policy initiatives and a source of insightful information that is essential to promoting and enacting good public policy.  Over the years, I have been proud to work with the law center on important programs and policies--from affordable childcare to expanding tax credits for low- and moderate-income families, increasing the minimum wage, and narrowing the wage gap. The law center's outreach and hard work have educated grassroots advocates and helped convey their views to policymakers for over 40 years--it is truly an invaluable resource.  As a determined and committed defender of the needs of women and families, the law center has earned the admiration of fellow advocacy organizations, the respect of its ideological opponents, and the trust of members of this body, including myself. I congratulate the National Women's Law Center for receiving this important award recognizing its hard work and commitment to social justice. I look forward to continuing to work together for years to come.                          ____________________
