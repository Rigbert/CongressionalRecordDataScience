Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, convened its third hearing to hear from Dr. Haris Silajdzic, the Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992 and 1993, Dr. Silajdzic testified in his previous position as Foreign Minister, describing the horrors taking place in his country and, knowing they could have been prevented, urgently asking for help. The hearing reviewed the tragic situation that still exists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the continued relevance of policy options that should have been taken by the international community long ago. Having to do that was frustrating to me, and I cannot begin to imagine how it must frustrate the Prime Minister.  We must not, though, accept the unacceptable. That is exactly what the Serb militants want us to do. It is clear that the people of Bosnia, despite their endurance of a third winter of war, are not prepared to abandon the defense of their homes, their families, their country. Indeed, Bosnia and Herzegovina seems motivated to defend international principles, even if they must do so almost completely alone.  In contrast, much to my dismay, the international community has been beaten back by the Serb militants in what has become a game of bluff. The Serb militants clearly escalate the violence, because they know we are unwilling to escalate in response. Our threats against them lack any credibility. Officials directing United Nations and NATO efforts have failed not only to stop vicious Serb aggression, but also to enforce their own Security Council resolutions. Instead, they have resorted to mutual recriminations, twisted explanations, and even blaming the victims for their fate.  Last summer, the so-called Contact Group--comprising the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany--offered the Bosnian Government and the Serb militants a plan on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with a deadline for an unconditional answer and warnings of repercussions for any side rejecting it. Sarajevo accepted it, in time and without condition. The militants effectively rejected it. As sanctions were then eased on Serbia in response, the deadline for Bosnian Serb acceptance was extended indefinitely. Earlier this month, U.S. officials presented this plan as simply a starting point for negotiations, and met with the Bosnian Serb leaders in their stronghold, Pale. To my dismay, the Secretary of State concluded that the ``Bosnian crisis is about Bosnia, but the NATO alliance is far more enduring, far more important than the Bosnian crisis.'' I was amazed and appalled.  Let's keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, that the Secretary's comment refers to what is, in fact, a well-documented genocide, and these diplomatic gestures were made toward those who orchestrated it. Through all the complexities of the Balkans that we must consider, one generic fact remains--you reward the aggressor, and you get more aggression. It is as simple as that.  The Helsinki Commission, through the leadership of the previous cochairs of the Helsinki Commission, noted that calls for a negotiated settlement, however correct, are meaningless if accompanied by an artificial neutrality and not by severe repercussions for those who operate outside acceptable parameters and seek what they want through the use of force. Collective partnerships, however desirable, will erode if partners allow one of their own to be carved into ethnic pieces.  Enunciating international principles, however promising, is empty if countries abandon them for historical affinities and big-power politics. Commemorations of the end of World War II a half century ago, however appropriate, ring somewhat hollow when genocidal acts that stir memories of the Holocaust are allowed to occur. The world's commitment to human [[Page E247]] rights, however boldly expressed, is questioned when our collective consciences are unaffected by the horrors that continue to be reported from Bosnia and Herzegovina today.  At the hearing, Prime Minister Silajdzic expressed his gratitude to the U.S. Congress for its strong and consistent support for Bosnia and Herzegovina through this terrible period. He noted that, 50 years after Auschwitz, concentration camps again appeared in Europe, this time in Bosnia, and this time the images are brought into our homes directly, especially through television. Rather than responding on the basis of principle, justice, and order, however, he described realpolitik and pragmatism as the order of the day. When a forceful response is eliminated, he concluded, the Bosnian Serb militants and their supporters in Belgrade are the only ones who benefit.  Given the current dynamics, the Prime Minister presented a reasonable course of action, specifically that the Contact Group meet at the ministerial level and set a deadline for a definite and final answer from the Serb militants. If the Serbs accept the plan in time, changes to the map could be made within 30 days, as long as these changes maintain the 51/49 percentage formula and are adopted by consensus. Negotiations on constitutional arrangements, international guarantees and other items would follow.  If, on the other hand, the Serbs reject the plan, the response adopted last July by the Contact Group foreign ministers should be reaffirmed, specifically the tightening of sanctions, the expansion and better protection of designated safe havens, including the use of air strikes, and lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina. On the latter, he added that recognition of the right to self-defense is the minimum that must be granted to the victims of this aggression.  I told the Prime Minister that the Helsinki Commission is dedicated not necessarily to the defense of his country, but to the promotion of principles adopted in Helsinki almost 20 years ago. In reality, however, these two different goals have come to mean the same thing. In this new Congress, the Commission will remain true to that goal and I, therefore, support his suggestions. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the Congress will debate the current policy options.  As we do consider policy options, I would like to repeat a remark made at the hearing by fellow Helsinki Commissioner, Mr. Steny Hoyer. He argued that one of the reasons we have allowed aggression and genocide to proceed in Bosnia is that some have convinced themselves that the conflict there is a civil war--an internal ethnic conflict--the inevitable result of age-old hatreds. To correct the picture, Mr. Hoyer quoted from a recent book, ``Bosnia, a Short History,'' by Noel Malcolm, the introduction to which states:       Paradoxically, the most important reason for studying      Bosnia's history is that it enables one to see that the      history of Bosnia itself does not explain the origins of this      war. Of course, the war could not have happened if Bosnia had      not been the peculiar thing that it was, which made it the      object of special ambitions and interests. But those      ambitions were directed at Bosnia from outside Bosnia's      borders. The biggest obstacle to all understanding of the      conflict is the assumption that what has happened in that      country is the product--natural, spontaneous, and at the same      time necessary--of forces lying within Bosnia's own internal      history. That is the myth which was carefully propagated by      those who caused the conflict, who wanted the world to      believe that what they and their gunmen were doing was done      not by them, but by impersonal and inevitable historical      forces beyond anyone's control. * * * And the world believed      them.''  Why the world believed them, I do not know. Perhaps naive assumptions about what was happening as Yugoslavia disintegrated; perhaps a cynical realpolitik that cares little about human suffering. Regardless, we cannot allow the resulting disaster to continue.                          ____________________
