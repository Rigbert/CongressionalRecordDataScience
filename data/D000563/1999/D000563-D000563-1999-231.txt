President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, as well as the Senators from Hawaii and Mexico, for joining in our message.  My fear is, in the closing weeks of this session, if the Members of the Senate were accused of having passed legislation this year to help the families of America, we could not gather enough evidence to prove the charge. We are about to leave town in a few weeks emptyhanded, having done little or nothing on education, little or nothing on minimum wage, little or nothing on health care. Frankly, I think the American people sent us to this body to do things to make life better for families across America. The Senator from Massachusetts speaks about minimum wage and education. There are so many other items on the agenda that should be addressed by a Congress listening to the American people.  I yield the remainder of my time.
