Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 400, a bill to provide for a land exchange within Gates of the Arctic Park and Preserve. This noncontroversial legislation was reported January 18 by the Resources Committee by a vote of 40 to 0.  H.R. 400 was introduced January 4 and passed the committee, as I said, at [[Page H1017]] our first full committee markup January 18. This bill is identical to H.R. 4746, which passed the House during the 103d Congress--it represents a true compromise. And I thank the former chairman, Mr. Miller, and Mr. Vento for their cooperation on this legislation.  The land exchange creates a deficit of 17,168 acres of wilderness in Gates of the Arctic Park. Therefore, the committee recommends the creation of 17,168 acres of wilderness outside the park, thus a no-net-loss-no-net-gain of wilderness.  This is a good bill. It settles a longstanding dispute between the local residents of Anaktuvuk Pass and the Park Service over the use of all-terrain vehicles [ATV's] for access to subsistence resources. Local residents use ATV's on parklands during the summer months. The Park Service contends that the ATV's harm the landscape. Both sides have reached agreement on the lands which may be used for ATV access and H.R. 400 ratifies that agreement.  I urge passage of this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
