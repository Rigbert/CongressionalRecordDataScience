 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., Tuesday, March 2. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of S. 1805, the gun liability bill, as provided under the previous order. I further ask unanimous consent that just before the vote on passage, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Levin amendment No. 2631, with no second degree amendments in order, and that following that vote, the Senate proceed with the order as previously entered.
