 I want the gentleman to know that on our side we are very pleased to see the patent reform legislation brought to the floor. As you know, that's a part of our Make it in America agenda. I know it's a part of your agenda as well. I think this is something on which there obviously has been some controversy with respect to provisions of the bill, but it is absolutely essential that we give certainty to patents and to accelerate the approval of patents. The backlog that exists is not acceptable. I am pleased that this legislation has come to the floor. Very frankly, this is a needed and welcome piece of jobs legislation.  One of the concerns we have on this side of the aisle, as you know, is that we have not from our perspective had a jobs focus in the last 6 months. We welcome this part of our Make it in America agenda and part of your agenda as well. Again, I think we can cooperate in this effort, hopefully, and have a bipartisan effort on this patent reform bill.                              {time}  1410  I also would raise the issue, Mr. Majority Leader, I want to say that I know that you and Mr. Kyl and others have been participating in the talks with Vice President Biden. There have been constructive talks, I understand from your comments and the comments of Mr. Van Hollen and Mr. Clyburn on our side. We are very hopeful that these talks will prove fruitful and that we can move ahead. We believe it's critical, as you know, and as you have articulated, that we address the default prevention responsibility that we share. Clearly, America wants to pay its bills, the American public expects us to pay our bill, and the international community expects us to pay our bills. You and I have both read quotes from Mr. Bernanke, business leaders like Jamie Diamond, economists and others who have indicated that failure to assure that America does not default on its bills will have very dire consequences both here and around the world.  So I am hopeful, Mr. Leader, that, although you did not announce it, we have very little time left, as you know, before the August 2nd date which Secretary Geithner has indicated is the date on which we will no longer have the cash flow ability to meet our obligations as they become due and to fund the programs that we have authorized and provided for the executive department to carry out.  I would very much be interested in your thoughts with reference to how we ensure that we take action in a timely fashion. I was very pleased to see Speaker Boehner's comment about a week and a half ago that he was focused on assuring that we did not default and provide for the payment of our debts prior to the end of this month. As you know, we have 4 days left, or 3\1/2\ days left, in this month, and that's next week, because the following week we're off. I would very much be interested in your observations on how you see us going forward on this critically important issue.  I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.
