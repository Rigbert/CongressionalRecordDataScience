Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and congratulate Jacque Muther--a true champion in building and sustaining HIV/AIDS care and treatment services in Atlanta--on her tenure as a member of the Board of Directors and Treasurer of the Communities Advocating Emergency AIDS Relief Coalition. CAEAR Coalition is a leading national voice for the treatment and care needs of people living with HIV/AIDS and Ms. Muther has served on its Board of Directors for 12 years, including eight as treasurer. She will leave the board at the end of this year and I take this opportunity to acknowledge her service at the local and the national levels.  Ms. Muther's commitment to the care and treatment of people living with HIV/AIDS goes back almost to the beginning of the epidemic. Since the mid 1980s, she has worked at the Grady Health System Infectious Disease Program--a program that now serves over 4,500 indigent people living with HIV/AIDS. She also served as Chair of Atlanta's Ryan White Title I Planning Council and as a member of the Georgia ADAP Task Force, which focuses on increasing state contributions to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. She also serves as Treasurer of HIVDent and is a member of the Board of Directors of Atlanta's AIDS Survival Project.  This impressive list of contributions does not fully capture Ms. Muther's important role in our community, nor her effectiveness as an advocate for high quality HIV/AIDS care for all whoneed it. Her service and advocacy are rooted deeply in her strong sense of justice and wherever she goes she is a compassionate and effective voice for the urgent need for the nation to redouble its commitment to HIV/AIDS.  I know well the power of her work in Atlanta and here on Capitol Hill where she is a highly regarded expert. She has the ability to help members and staff alike understand the needs on the frontlines and what we, in turn, must do to respond to those needs.  I rise to honor Ms. Muther's contributions and to express my gratitude that she continues on in service to this vital cause.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2141-E2142]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF JACQUE MUTHER                                 ______                                                             HON.
