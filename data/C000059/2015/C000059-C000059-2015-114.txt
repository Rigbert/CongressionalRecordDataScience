The language has been included in our enacted bills on a bipartisan basis since 2010. The language simply requires that programs and activities dedicated to climate change are reported in a transparent way so the American people know what we are spending their tax dollars on.  With so many climate change programs being initiated, it is important to know what is being done across the government to avoid redundancy, and there is certainly a significant amount of redundancy in some of these climate change studies. It is in the bill so the committee can have the information it needs to provide critical oversight.  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR.
