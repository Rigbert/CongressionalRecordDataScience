 The President's bragging on a $300 billion deficit. That means the government's borrowing about $800 million a day, $800 million a day to run the government, and they are handing the bill to future generations. He is bragging on that as great achievement, but that is not the whole story. He is also borrowing $182 billion from the Social Security surplus this year. So he is also borrowing from present and future generations. The total borrowing by the Federal Government this year will be $482 billion, and the President's bragging on it, and that means we are borrowing $1.3 billion a day to run the government, borrowing against the future, sending the bill to working Americans because we do not want to tax the rich people anymore, and the corporations are moving offshore to avoid taxes.  It is an extraordinarily fiscally irresponsible position for this government, and it is just part of the many failures of this administration, but I am going to talk about another failure today, one where the President has said we are also setting new records, trade policy.  America, month after month after month, is running larger and larger trade deficits. We are hemorrhaging jobs overseas to countries that exploit labor, countries like China where people work for 25 cents an hour they are so desperate, where they are not allowed to form labor unions, where U.S. capital is feeding their technological investment from corporations who are moving away from our country but want to sell their goods here.  Our trade deficit with China was $17.7 billion last month. One month, we borrowed $500 million a day from China to buy stuff from them that we used to make here in the United States of America. That is not sustainable. We are losing the jobs and we are mortgaging our future, and someday that debt is going to be called in by the Chinese and others.  The trade deficit overall went up to $63.8 billion. We are on track to have a trade deficit of $765 billion this year. Now, that is a lot of numbers. What does that mean? We are borrowing over $2 billion a day, $2 billion a day from foreign interests, number one being China, number two Japan, and others, to buy stuff made overseas that we used to make here. And the Bush administration touts this as a great success, free trade. Why?  Well, because the corporate CEOs, who have outsourced their jobs to China, are getting huge and growing compensation, an average of $12 million. They live in gated communities. They send their kids to private schools. They fly on private jets. They go to private resorts. They do not care about public infrastructure or public education. They do not care about the rest of us in this country. They do not even care about the American workers anymore because they are making stuff overseas. All they do is hope our credit cards hold up a little bit longer so we can buy more of the stuff they made over there that might be a tiny bit cheaper and put it on the credit card and they can cash in and get out of town before this house of cards collapses.  So we are borrowing over $1.4 billion a day to run the government. We are borrowing $2 billion a day to buy stuff made overseas, and President Bush is telling the American people that things are great and getting better, but on Main Street, America, they know that is not true.  Now, in the country clubs and in the boardrooms, sure, better than ever. Corporate CEO pay went up last year about 10 percent, about $1 million on average, which happens to be 100 times what a minimum-wage earner earns in this country. That was just their increase. The minimum wage has not gone up in 9 years. The Republicans refuse to bring it to the floor of the House because they are favoring these corporate CEOs. God forbid, they should pay more in taxes, and God forbid, they should have to pay the minimum-wage people who wait on their tables, who park their cars and who mow their lawns any more money. It would be a hardship for those rich folks.  So this is the Bush economic success. We are borrowing from overseas. We are borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund. We are borrowing from other investors. We are financing it on the credit card, and they tout this as great for our country and a strong economy. What a lie.                          ____________________
