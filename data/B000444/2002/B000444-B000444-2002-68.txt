Res. 326       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 2002,      203,500 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 39,600      women will die from this diease;       Whereas it is estimated that about 2,000,000 women were      diagnosed with breast cancer in the 1990s, and that in nearly      500,000 of those cases, the cancer resulted in death;       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with      a woman at age 70 years having twice as much of a chance of      developing the disease as a woman at age 50 years;       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast      cancer have no family history of the disease;       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a      certified facility, can provide safe screening and early      detection of breast cancer in many women;       Whereas mammography is an excellent method for early      detection of localized breast cancer, which has a 5-year      survival rate of more than 97 percent;       Whereas the National Cancer Institute and the American      Cancer Society continue to recommend periodic mammograms; and       Whereas the National Breast Cancer Coalition recommends      that each woman and her health care provider make an      individual decision about mammography: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates October 18, 2002, as ``National Mammography      Day''; and       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling upon the people of the United States to observe the      day with appropriate programs and activities.
