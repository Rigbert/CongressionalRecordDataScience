  Several arguments have been made in support of this section. For instance, it has been argued that military officers should be treated as their civilian counterparts. However, civilian comparisons are not relevant because of the unique role and mission required of our Nation's Armed Forces.  It has been argued that the confirmation of retiring officers increases the administrative workload of the Senate Armed Services Committee. In fiscal year 1993, the committee reviewed just six grade 0-10 officers for retirement and less than 20 at grade 0-9. I do not believe that is an unreasonable number. In addition, reviewing military nominations is a constitutional responsibility that helps maintain civilian control and accountability.  Most importantly, by removing Senate involvement in the confirmation of retiring officers, we remove congressional oversight. We remove our ability to play a role in the very process that has been so troublesome in recent years.  Mr. President, Senator Grassley's amendment would prohibit waiving time in grade requirements if an officer is under investigation for alleged misconduct or if adverse personnel action was pending. While I do not feel this is the ultimate solution to this problem, I do feel it is a move in the right direction toward making this section more acceptable.  There is no reason for an officer to receive a promotion while an investigation into alleged misconduct is pending.  As I have stated, I still have concerns with the wholesale repeal of congressional oversight as it relates to the confirmation of retiring officers. I believe we have a duty and an obligation to ensure that there are standards of accountability.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Grassley amendment.
