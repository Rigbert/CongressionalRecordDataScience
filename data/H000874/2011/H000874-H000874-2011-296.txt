 But I am certainly hopeful, as he was hopeful, given the representations of transparency and openness, that there would be opportunities to amend. I know that Mr. Van Hollen spoke to that in the Rules Committee, and I would hope that we could see that policy which has been expressed by your side pursued in this instance as well as future instances. I thank the gentleman for his response.  Let me ask the gentleman: There was some criticism raised when we passed a budget enforcement resolution that we hadn't passed a full budget. In that budget enforcement resolution, as you recall, A, we articulated a specific number; and, B, that number was voted on by the entire House.                              {time}  1120  It is my understanding that the proposition that will be put before the House next week will provide and give unilateral authority to the chairman of the Budget Committee to set a number and that that number will not be voted upon by the House pursuant to the authority granted in that resolution.  Is that an accurate reading of that resolution?
