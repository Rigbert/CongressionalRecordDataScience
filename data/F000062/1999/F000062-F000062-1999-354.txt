 President, I am introducing today a legislation that previously passed the Senate by unanimous consent but failed to be enacted because it was never considered by the House during last Congress.  The bill provides permanent resident status to three children, Sergio (18 years old), Fauricio (16 years old), and Ana Lozano (15 years old) who now face deportation because they lost their mother in 1997 and the immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children under the age of twenty-one without their parents.  The Lozano children face a dire situation without this legislation since despite the fact that they came into the country legally, they could be deported because they were orphaned.  The children lived with their mother, Ana Ruth Lozano, until February 1997 when she died of complications developed from typhoid fever. Since their mother's death, the children have been living with their closest relative, their U.S. citizen grandmother, who currently lives in Los Angeles, California.  Without their mother, these children can be deported by the INS despite the fact the children have no family who will take care of them in El Salvador except their estranged father who cannot be located by the family.  Without this bill, the children will most likely be sent to an orphanage in El Salvador. Here in the U.S., the children have their U.S. citizen grandmother and uncles who will give them a loving home.  I have previously sought administrative relief for the Lozano children by asking the INS District Office in Los Angeles and Commissioner Meissner if any humanitarian exemptions could be made in their case. INS has told my staff that there is nothing further they can do administratively and a private relief bill may be the only way to protect the children from deportation.  I urge all the members to support this bill so that we can help the Lozano children rebuild their lives in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 276       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SERGIO LOZANO,                    FAURICIO LOZANO AND ANA LOZANO.
