 He did not say this, but there were also a lot of changes made to accommodate Republicans. But he pointed out that we have two issues on which we disagree. That is what the Senator from Vermont said. I do not think that Senators should vote against this bill over two issues which are not central to the concept of bankruptcy reform.  I was disappointed, however, in his comments on the process. He referred to a very unusual process. I confess that it was a very unusual process bywhich this bill was conferenced and got to the Senate floor. But I think I heard him say something about Democrats not being consulted. There was a 3-3 ratio on this conference. Normally there would not be a 3-3 ratio; there would probably be one more Republican than Democrat. But because of Senator Coverdell's death, it ended up on this conference there were three Republicans and three Democrats. So the point is, we would not be here today if it were not for help from Democrats, even in conference.  I only say that because the Senator from Vermont is a friend of mine. He is very strongly opposed to this legislation. But I thought I ought to point out the fact that there are those small, insignificant modifications of his comments that I thought I ought to make. Whether he would consider those clarifications or not, that is his judgment. But I want them on the record for my point of view.  I also address an issue raised by Senator Leahy. Some have stated that the bankruptcy conference report should be opposed on the grounds that it does not contain a provision that would prevent abortion protesters from using bankruptcy as a way to get out of paying debt arising as a result of violence or intimidation at abortion clinics.  On this issue, I draw my Senator's attention--in other words, the attention of the Senator from Vermont--to a memo prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.  This memo--which I will provide to any Senator who wants to see it, and I will include it in the Record--concludes that not one single abortion protester has ever used bankruptcy in this way. I repeat, according to the Congressional Research Service, a truly nonpartisan resource, no one has ever used bankruptcy to skip out on debts arising from violence or intimidation at an abortion clinic.  This issue, of course, is a red herring. It has been put forth by people who flat out oppose needed bankruptcy reform as a way of defeating this legislation. There is absolutely no merit to their argument.  I hope people will see it for what it is--an empty political ploy. I hope Senators will see through this political ploy and support the bankruptcy conference report.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the memo from the Congressional Research Office.  There being no objection, the memo was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                          Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.                               Memorandum     To: Hon. Charles Grassley.     From: Robin Jeweler, Legislative Attorney, American Law          Division.     Subject: Westlaw/LEXIS survey of bankruptcy cases under 11          U.S.C. Sec. 523.       This confirms our phone conversation of October 25, 2000.      You requested a comprehensive online survey of reported      decisions considering the dischargeability of liability      incurred in connection with violence at reproductive health      clinics by abortion protesters. Our search did not reveal any      reported decisions where such liability was discharged under      the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.       The only reported decision identified by the search is      Buffalo Gyn Womenservices, Inc. v. Behn (In re Behn), 242      B.R. 229 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1999). In this case, the bankruptcy      court held that a debtor's previously incurred civil      sanctions for violation of a temporary restraining order      (TRO) creating a buffer zone outside the premises of an      abortion service provider was nondischargeable under 11      U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6), which excepts claims for ``willful and      malicious'' injury. The court surveyed the extant and      somewhat discrepant standards for finding ``willful and      malicious'' conduct articulated by three federal circuit      courts of appeals. It granted the plaintiff's motion for      summary judgment and denied the debtor/defendant's motion to      retry the matter before the bankruptcy court. Specifically,      the court held:       ``[W]hen a court of the United States issues an injunction      or other protective order telling a specific individual what      actions will cross the line into injury to others, then      damages resulting from an intentional violation of that order      (as is proven either in the bankruptcy court or (so long as      there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the      question of volition and violation) in the issuing court) are      ipso facto the result of a `willful and malicious injury.'      ''--242 B.R. at 238.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Utah.
