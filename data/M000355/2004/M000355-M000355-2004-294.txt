 Feinstein, Mr. McCain, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Corzine) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations;       Whereas the National League for Democracy, headed by Daw      Aung San Suu Kyi, is the legitimately elected political      leadership in Burma;       Whereas the ruling State Peace and Development Council,      headed by General Than Shwe, and its affiliated organizations      continue, through a variety of means, to violate the human      rights and dignity of the people of Burma through murder,      torture, rape, forced relocation, the employment of child      soldiers, the use of forced labor, and the exploitation of      child laborers;       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council has      detained over 1,300 prisoners of conscience, including      National League for Democracy leaders and supporters of      democracy;       Whereas, under the repressive rule of the State Peace and      Development Council, the situation in Burma poses an      immediate and growing threat to the Southeast Asia region,      including through the unchecked spread of HIV/AIDS, the      illicit production of, and trafficking in, narcotics,      trafficking in persons, and alleged efforts to purchase      weapons from North Korea, China, and Russia;       Whereas, at the 58th session of the United Nations General      Assembly, a resolution was adopted by the General Assembly      that expresses grave concern about the ongoing systematic      violations of human rights inflicted upon the people of Burma      and calls on the     State Peace and Development Council to release all political      prisoners, respect the results of the national elections in      1990, and restore democracy to Burma; and       Whereas the National League for Democracy has called upon      the United Nations Security Council to intervene on behalf of      the people of Burma: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the      United Nations Security Council should immediately consider      and take appropriate actions to respond to the growing      threats posed to the Southeast Asia region by conditions in      Burma under the illegitimate rule of the State Peace and      Development Council, including the threats posed by      widespread human rights violations, the unchecked spread of      HIV/AIDS, the illicit production of, and trafficking in,      narcotics, trafficking in persons, and alleged efforts by the      State Peace and Development Council to purchase weapons from      North Korea, China, and Russia.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I submit, along with some fellow members of the unofficial, bipartisan Senate Burma Caucus, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the United Nations Security Council should immediately consider and take appropriate actions to respond to the growing threats posed by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma to its immediate neighbors and the entire region.  What are these threats? The unchecked spread of HIV/AIDS that is further aggravated by the SPDC's use of rape as a weapon of war against the people of Burma, particularly ethnic women and girls; the illicit production and trafficking in narcotics, which destroys the lives of Asian youth and families; trafficking in persons and brutal crackdowns on ethnic minorities that create significant populations of internally displaced persons and refugees; alleged efforts to purchase weapons from North Korea, the People's Republic of China and Russia.  For the past decade, we have know that the SPDC poses a clear and present danger to the people of Burma, including democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and other senior members of the National League for Democracy (NLD). Resolutions, statements and reports by the U.S. State Department, the United Nations, the European Nation (E.U.), and human rights organizations have repeatedly documented and condemned brutal human rights violations committed with impunity by the SPDC.  Today, there is no question that Burma's myriad problems are no longer the internal affair of a handful of psychopathic generals in Rangoon.  Last May, the NLD called upon the U.N. Security Council to intervene.  Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the United Kingdom, and the Administration, who are scheduled to take over chairmanship of the Council in October and November, respectively should heed their call.  In Burma, time now favors the democrats. With the international community's continued vigilance, appropriate pressure can be placed on the SPDC before they assume chairmanship of the ASEAN in 2006 to secure a meaningful path toward reconciliation that includes the full and unfettered participation of the NLD. If the Security Council takes up the matter of Burma, significant strides will be made toward democracy and justice in that country.  It is an understatement to say that I am disappointed with the E.U.'s decision to allow ``low level'' participation by the SPDC in the upcoming ASEM meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. Such action serves only to prolong the suffering of the Burmese people, including the hundreds currently languishing in prisons for peacefully championing the principles of freedom and justice, and the three NLD youths recently arrested for the ``heinous'' crime of gathering signatures on a petition calling for Suu Kyi's release from house arrest.  With France, Spain and Portugal reportedly clamoring to derail the toughening of sanctions against Burma, it is only fair to ask: When will they act to support the democrats of Burma?  It is time the world's democracies make 2006 the ``Year of Democracy'' in Burma.  I want to recognize Senators Feinstein, McCain, Mikulski, Feingold, Leahy, and Dole for their support of the resolution, and freedom and justice in Burma.  I ask unanimous consent that an article by William Ashton that appeared in the Irrawaddy on the SPDC's efforts to procure weapons be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  The Arms Keep Coming--But Who Pays?                          (By William Ashton)       Burma's ruling State Peace and Development Council, or      SPDC, has been at pains over recent months to tell the      international community that it is devoting a considerable      effort to implementing a new ``road map'' to multi-party      democracy and introducing measures for a more open economy.      The military government has also claimed major advances in      promoting education and public health, and in developing the      country's civil infrastructure.       The Rangoon regime can certainly point to an increase in      diplomatic activity, and show visitors to Burma many new      roads, buildings and dams. However, the SPDC's statements      continue to ignore the fact that, for the past 15 years, a      large proportion of its central budget-probably between 35      and 45 per cent each year-has been allocated to the armed      forces, or Tatmadaw. This does not include significant      allocations to the defense sector from off-budget sources and      unofficial payments that never appear in the national      accounts. Also, while an increasing proportion of Burma's      annual defense expenditure is now used to pay for recurring      personnel and maintenance costs, a high percentage is still      devoted to the acquisition of new arms and equipment from      abroad.                      Continued Military Expansion       When the armed forces took back direct political power in      1988, they launched an ambitious defense expansion and      modernization program. Since then, the regime has      consistently spent a greater proportion of central government      outlays on defense than any other country in the Asia-Pacific      region. The Burmese armed forces have doubled in size, making      them the second largest in Southeast Asia and, by some      calculations, the 15th largest in the world. New command and      control structures have been put in place, and capabilities      in key support areas like intelligence, communications and      logistics have been substantially upgraded. The country's      military infrastructure has also been improved. In addition,      the Burma Army has acquired a wide range of tracked and      wheeled armor, towed and self-propelled artillery, air      defense weapons, transport, small arms and communications      equipment. The air force has taken delivery of more than 150      helicopters, fighters, ground attack, transport and training      aircraft. The Burma Navy too has expanded dramatically, with      new corvettes, missile patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels      and riverine craft.       Given its enormous expansion since 1988, the massive influx      of arms and equipment since then, and the difficulties of      keeping its current inventory fully operational, it might be      expected that the Tatmadaw's acquisition programs would now      be slowing down. Yet, over the past 18 months, there has been      clear evidence that the Rangoon regime continues to give its      highest priority to the development of Burma's military      capabilities.       While some of the SPDC's more ambitious projects, such as      the planned acquisition of strategic weapon systems, have      reportedly been shelved for the time being, other major      contracts have gone ahead. China remains Burma's principal      source of military technology but, despite an arms embargo      imposed by its traditional suppliers, the regime has managed      to find a number of new vendors.                            Arms Deliveries       A survey of arms deals with Burma over the past 18 months      has revealed the following:                                 China       Rangoon is locked into a continuing close logistical      relationship with Beijing, due to the need to maintain all      the arms and military equipment purchased from China, at an      estimated cost of billions of dollars, since 1988. However,      the SPDC is interested in acquiring even more arms, and new      weapons and consignments of materiel continue to be      delivered. There have been reports of 200 heavy-duty trucks      crossing the China-Burma border, and of shipments of      unspecified ``air force weapons'', multiple rocket launchers      and possibly artillery. There were also reports in March 2004      that the Burma Army was negotiating yet another arms deal      with China, this time to buy obsolescent weapons being phased      out by the People's Liberation Army. In addition, there have      long been rumors that Burma has been negotiating with China      for the purchase of combat helicopters, minesweepers, anti-     ship missiles and sea mines.                              North Korea       Rangoon's developing relationship with Pyongyang has gone      well beyond the small arms ammunition purchased in 1990, and      the sixteen 130mm artillery pieces acquired by the SPDC in      1998. For example, in 2003 a team of North Korean technicians      was sent to Rangoon to install surface-to-surface missiles on      some new Burma Navy vessels. In addition, discussions have      taken place between Rangoon and Pyongyang over the purchase      of a small submarine, and possibly even a number of SCUD      short-range ballistic missiles. Late last year there were      even suggestions that North Korea was assisting Burma with      the construction of a nuclear reactor, raising the specter of      the Rangoon regime one day acquiring a nuclear weapon.                                 India       As part of a renewed effort to get closer to Burma, India      has provided the Tatmadaw with a range of weapons, ammunition      and equipment. In May 2003 the Indian Defense Ministry      confirmed that it had sold the Tatmadaw eighty 75mm howitzers      (or ``mountain guns''). Also, India has reportedly sold      mortar and artillery ammunition to Rangoon, and advanced      communications equipment. A Burmese military delegation      visiting India in early 2004 said that the Tatmadaw welcomed      further arms deals. The Indian Defense Minister has stated      that New Delhi is keen to sell Burma naval vessels. A      demonstration by Indian combat aircraft in Burma this year      prompted speculation about future sales to the Burma Air      Force.                                Ukraine       The Russian language press stated in late 2002 that the      Ukraine had contracted to provide Burma with some 36D6 radar      systems. In mid-2003 it was reported that the Ukraine had      sold the Tatmadaw 50 T-72 main battle tanks. In February      2004, a Ukrainian-flagged ship made a secret delivery to      Rangoon, probably of air defense weapons. Also, in May 2003,      one of the Ukraine's leading arms exporters signed a contract      with Burma worth US $500 million, to provide the Rangoon      regime with components for 1,000 BTR-3U light armored      personnel carriers. Over the next ten years these vehicles      will be supplied in parts, and assembled in a new, purpose-     built factory in Burma. More arms deals between Rangoon and      Kiev are likely.                                 serbia       In December 2003, Serbian language sources claimed that      Rangoon had contracted with Belgrade to buy a number of      ``Nora'' self-propelled howitzers. The cost of these weapons,      which are marketed by Jugoimport-SDPR, is unknown. In      addition, in March 2004 about 30 Serbian engineers arrived in      Burma to repair and upgrade the Burma Air Force's 12 Soko G-4      jets, which were purchased from the Republic of Yugoslavia in      the 1990s. These aircraft have been grounded for several      years, due largely to a lack of spare parts.                                 russia       In late 2002 the SPDC purchased eight MiG-29B-12 air      superiority combat aircraft and two dual-seat MiG-29UB      trainers from Russia, at a reported cost of about US $130      million. All these aircraft were delivered to Burma by the      end of 2003. In addition, in July 2002 Rangoon signed a      contract with the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (Minatom)      for the construction of a nuclear reactor in Burma. While the      project has encountered major problems, probably due to its      cost, it may still go ahead. It is likely that the shipments      of Russian military equipment detected in southern Burma in      April 2003, which were thought to be components for the      reactor, were in fact deliveries of a new communications      system.                                slovakia       According to a news report dated October 2003, the Unipex      Company of Slovakia is currently being investigated for      taking part in the illegal export to Burma of machines for      the manufacture of ``artillery grenades'' (possibly rocket      propelled grenades).       It is likely that other contracts have been signed but not      yet been made public. The frequent visits to Rangoon of North      Korean and Ukrainian cargo vessels over the past 18 months,      and the measures taken to hide the nature of their cargoes,      strongly suggests that other deliveries of arms and equipment      have occurred. Several eastern European countries are keen to      sell arms to Burma. Also, countries like Singapore, Pakistan      and Israel maintain close links with Rangoon. All have weapon      systems that are on the Tatmadaw's wish list. In the past,      these factors have often led to substantial sales of weapons,      military equipment and dual use goods to Burma, and related      training contracts.                            paying the bill       In considering the financial implications of these sales,      several factors need to be borne in mind. Not only does the      regime need to cover the initial purchase price of these      arms, but it faces the continuing costs of keeping them      serviceable, providing facilities to house them, buying spare      parts to maintain them and training people to repair and use      them. The latter often includes sending selected military      personnel overseas for specialized training, and in a few      cases supporting foreign experts resident in country. Some of      these costs can be paid in local currency, but they still      constitute a heavy drain on Burma's precious foreign exchange      reserves. The regime is still able to earn hard currency      through the export of gas, gems, timber, agricultural produce      and other natural resources, but its economy is facing major      problems. These have not been helped by the new sanctions      imposed by the U.S. in June 2003, after a government mob      violently attacked democratic opposition leader Aung San Suu      Kyi.       In the past, some of these costs have been met through      trade deals, under which Burma has paid for part of its      contracts with primary goods like rice and teak. North Korea      and Russia, for example, have accepted such commodities in      part payment for arms and military equipment. Even the      Russian nuclear reactor could be paid for in part through      barter arrangements. Also, for strategic and other reasons,      some arms suppliers have been very generous in their terms.      For example, China has repeatedly offered the Rangoon regime      special ``friendship prices'' for arms, and overlooked      deadlines for the repayment of loans. The Ukrainian firm      selling Burma APCs has probably provided vendor financing of      some kind.       Even so, given the regime's current debts, its continuing      need for foreign logistical support, and its latest      acquisitions, the investment required now and in the future      will be huge for a country like Burma. These costs must      inevitably be carried at the expense of other sectors of the      government that are desperate for scarce resources.
