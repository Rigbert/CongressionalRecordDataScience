Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our country are exceptional. The United States has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated military personnel who willingly and unselfishly dedicate their lives to service and make our country a safer place to live and work. Navy Commander Jeff Taylor is one of these individuals. On July 21, 2003, he will be honored as he retires from the U.S. Navy.  Jeff was raised in Southern California and graduated from Southern California College with a B.A. in Business Administration in 1978. After working for three years for a major defense contractor in Newport Beach, California, he accepted an appointment to Naval Officer Candidate School and received his commission in 1981.  Commander Taylor first served as the Combat Information Center Officer aboard the USS Cochrane based in Yokosuka, Japan and as the Fire Control Officer and Main Propulsion Assistant on the USS Leahy based in San Diego, California. He also served as an instructor at the Surface Warfare Officers School in Coronado teaching combat systems and ship control curriculum.  After completing Department Head School, Commander Taylor served as Chief Engineering Officer on the USS Worden based in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. During this time he participated in Operations Desert Shield and Storm. Jeff also served as Maintenance Officer at Assault Craft Unit 5 at Camp Pendleton, California where he directed maintenance and repair of Navy hovercraft and subsequently served as an Engineering Branch Head and instructor at the Surface Warfare Officers School in Newport, Rhode Island. Jeff then returned to sea duty as Executive Officer on the USS Kidd based in Norfolk, Virginia and later served as Chief Staff Officer for Destroyer Squadrons 20 and 32.  Upon completing his sea duty, Jeff reported to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division in March of 1999. Commander Taylor also earned a Masters Degree in Business Administration and a Diploma from the United States Naval War College. His personal decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal and Navy Commendation Medals.  Commander Taylor is happily married to his wife Bonnie and enjoys surfing and long distance running in his spare time.  Jeff's lifetime dedication to military service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our country and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
