 President, reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified to strike the last paragraph and, further, that it also be in order for a second amendment, the text of which will be at the desk and is the President's small business tax hike; further, that it be considered under the same terms of my amendment, and that after the vote on that amendment the Senate proceed to a vote on the McConnell-Hatch amendment as the original request provided for.
