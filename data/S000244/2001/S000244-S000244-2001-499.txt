Speaker, today I am re-introducing legislation, the Freedom from Unfair Energy Levy Act or ``FUEL Act,'' to alleviate the impact of current high fuel prices. My legislation would place a six-month moratorium on federal motor fuel excise taxes, including the 18.3 cent per gallon tax consumers pay for gasoline and the 24.3 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel, and eliminate permanently the 4.3 cent per gallon tax increase approved in 1993.  Last year, when I first introduced the FUEL Act, I warned of the threat that high energy prices posed to our economy. As was illustrated clearly in the 1970s and early 1990s, fuel price hikes can cause widespread damage to economic well being. Unfortunately, high energy costs have continued to plague the U.S. since that warning and our economy is beginning to suffer the consequences. Some have argued that money from fuel taxes is more useful in Washington than in Americans' pockets, helping motorists afford the high price of gasoline. In reality, the economic damage caused by high fuel prices far outweighs any impact on federal spending that a six-month moratorium could cause. Congress should act now to mitigate the economic damage caused by steep energy costs.  The current high gasoline prices across the country are a continuation of the energy problems that began during the Clinton administration. In recent years, domestic energy production has fallen to its lowest level since before World War II. The failure to increase domestic production has made the U.S. increasingly vulnerable to the whims of OPEC nations, who recently slashed their oil production in order to increase their profitability. Compounding the problem is the increase in the gasoline tax that was enacted in 1993. That year, when fuel prices were low, Democrats in Congress, President Clinton, and a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore combined to increase federal fuel taxes. The FUEL Act would reverse that increase and represents a sound first step in the development of a comprehensive, long-term policy to lower energy costs.  Besides addressing long-term concerns, my legislation provides immediate assistance to the problem of high fuel costs. By halting the collection of federal fuel taxes for six months, consumers will see an immediate dip of nearly 20 cents in the cost of gasoline at the pump. This six month moratorium will help to keep prices down over the summer months which often see steep fuel cost increases. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to fight rising energy prices.                          ____________________
