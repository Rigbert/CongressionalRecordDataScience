Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate thirty individuals who will take their oaths of citizenship on August 10, 2018. This memorable occasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana.  America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their families. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America.  On August 10, 2018, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship inHammond, Indiana: Mark Andrew Abraham, Vanesa Anabel Miseres, Emeterio Garcia Betancourt, Abdullah Al Mamun, Adan Boussart Cruz, Haider Mohammed Abbas Al Kilidar, Marjorie Eldora Garbutt, Doaa Ayad Khalid Al Dulaimi, Eleftheria Nikolaos Fitousis, Maria de Jesus Ramirez Trejo, Lea Estialbo Tan, Oswaldo Rafael Gutierrez Mercado, Miguel Angel Morales Hernandez, Jai Prakash Agrawal, Hina Naz Chaudhry, Alaa George Issa Tadros, Xiaoyan Yang, Abdelhafid Erramnati, Yuliya Maroz, Gerardo Alvarez, Nana Kwesi Ampadu Annoh, Claudia Andrea Cespedes, Moon Tek Fisher, Maria Alejandra Hernandez, Jordan Dong Van Hoang, Patricia E. Leyva, Sandip Singh Lidhar, Himansu R. Parikh, Sherida Antoinette Parkes King and Julio Cesar Salazar.  Although each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will become citizens of the United States of America on August 10, 2018. They, too, are American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
