But I have indicated and the Speaker has indicated that we're going to do 48 hours' notice, as required, or at least as we would hope to do. This is a very important bill. It is a bill that is of great consequence to all Americans, and we are going to meet those targets of notice.                              {time}  1500  So in that context, in light of the fact the bill is still in the committee, it may be impossible to meet that commitment and get the bill on the floor on the 31st. As a result, my view is the probability of doing that bill by the 31st is very small.
