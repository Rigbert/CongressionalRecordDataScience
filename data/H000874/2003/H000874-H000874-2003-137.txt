Speaker, reclaiming my time, next to last issue I would bring up, I think I heard the gentleman say this, but I want to make sure the Members understand, is it the gentleman's understanding, and is it his intention, that if we adopt a CR, is it next week that he thinks we may do that, that the date set in that CR for continuing funding would be until the 31st of October? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  While I heard there is growing support for a CR that carries us through to October 31, to my knowledge no final decisions have been made on that, but a decision on it is getting closer and closer.
