President, we don't have one of the leaders on the floor at the present time. I was going to ask that we proceed to a vote. But I am not going to do that until the other side is represented here. But I know everyone on this side is ready to vote.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call the roll.  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
