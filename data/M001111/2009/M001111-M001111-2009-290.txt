 I agree that the flood-map program is an instrumental tool in reducing the loss of life and property from floods. The Homeland Security Subcommittee will work with the Senator to review the recent contract solicitation. I am committed to ensuring that DHS invests acquisition dollars in projects that are well planned, competitively awarded, well managed, closely overseen, and best able to serve local needs.
