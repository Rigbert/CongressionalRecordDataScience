 I would like to say to my friend from Florida, I think we share the same goal. I do not want to see a single penny wasted. I do not want to see a single taxpayer's dollar misused for political purposes or otherwise. But does the gentleman realize in titles I and II we have over $1 billion being spent by this country?  The gentleman is talking about taking $29 million out of title III because he is upset with one or two allocations around the world. I would say to the gentleman, I have a list here in my hand of five allocations which he should applaud, where this title III money is being used to literally feed starving people.  Please, do not kill the whole program in countries like Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Honduras, Bolivia, and Bangladesh, because you have some objection to what happened in Somalia.
