  Mr. President, he indicated that the principal issue we are sparring over is the question of immunity from litigation for communications companies that cooperated in protecting our country. I am sure the majority leader knows that yesterday my side offered to his side a vote on the Dodd-Feingold amendment related to that issue, and a vote on the Specter-Whitehouse amendment related to that issue, and that package was rejected.
