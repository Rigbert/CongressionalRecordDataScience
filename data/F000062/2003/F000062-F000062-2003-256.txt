 President, during the height of the war in Iraq, I came to the floor to honor those from California who had made the ultimate sacrifice. And I paid tribute to these service members who embody the very best of the American spirit, those willing to give their own lives so we and others around the world can enjoy the blessings of freedom.  At least eight men with California connections have died in Iraq since May 1 due either to accident or hostile enemy fire. I strongly believe that theyand the others from across our country must be awarded the same respect and admiration as any American, in any war, at any time in our history.  SGT Atanasio Haro Marin Jr., 27, known as ``Nacho'' to his family, was born in Momax, Mexico, and lived there with his mother while his father worked in California to support seven children. The family was reunited in Los Angeles when he was 2 years old, moving to suburban Baldwin Park. He competed on the Sierra Vista High School track team and also ran in a Los Angeles marathon. Upon graduation, he joined the National Guard. When his tour of duty ended, he transferred to the Army.  Sergeant Marin was assigned to Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 16th Field Artillery Regiment, and died on June 3, when his checkpoint south of Balad, Iraq, was attacked with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades. He was 27 years old.  He last saw his family during a January leave, 2 months before he left for the Middle East. He called home twice in April and sent a Mother's Day card that read: ``Don't worry, be happy.''  A native of Eureka, CA, CPT Andrew David La Mont was the youngest of nine children and came from a family with strong ties to the military. His father and grandfather were career military men.  ``He was a tremendous son and a fantastic marine,'' said his mother, Vivian La Mont. He was single and had served with the Marines since graduating from San Diego State University in 1994. La Mont had previously served in Kosovo and Afghanistan.  Twenty-one-year-old LCPL Jason Moore was described as a rather wild young man with a boundless spirit, whose enthusiasm led him to the Marine Corps.  Moore died on May 19 in Iraq when the CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter he helped crew crashed into a canal. Four other Camp Pendleton marines were killed in the same incident.  His parents, Bill and Gale Moore, buried their only son at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery.  He graduated from San Marcos High School in 2000. His neighbor Deane Terry said Moore was clearly bound for Marine aviation from a young age, after his interest in the Civil Air Patrol and radio-controlled planes.  ``He was going to continue to aim high one way or another,'' said Terry, whose son was Moore's playmate. Terry described the day Moore returned from Marine boot camp and stood straight and proud in his uniform in the Terry living room.  ``He was so excited to be a Marine,'' said Terry, who added that Moore joined the high school swim team just to prepare himself physically for the service. ``He went at the Corps at full speed, not hesitating, not looking back.''  PVT Jose Gonzalez spoke very little English when he arrived as a freshman at John Glenn High School in Norwalk, CA. By the time he graduated in 2001, he had earned high honors in college preparatory classes.  The Mexican native also played varsity baseball, becoming a player who coach Bill Seals could count on at nearly any position: pitching or playing in the outfield or infield. He always wore his team hat to school, every day, year-round. The coach said it was about pride.  With his diploma in hand, Gonzalez embraced another part of American life: the military. He entered the Marine Corps 2 months after graduation and became a supply clerk.  Gonzalez deployed to Iraq with Camp Pendleton's 1st Force Service Support Group and survived the war. On May 12, he was killed when ordnance he was handling detonated. He was just 19 years old.  In Norwalk, Gonzalez is survived by parents and two teenage sisters. Gonzalez was not forgotten at his old high school. John Glenn students have created a memorial on the auditorium stage--they leave flowers, candles, and signs offering tribute to the soft-spoken man who died for his adopted country.  The last time Paul Tokuzo Nakamura, of Santa Fe Springs, called home from Iraq was on Father's Day, when he told his family that all was well.  ``The first thing he told me was that he had showered and had steak for dinner,'' his father, Paul Nakamura, said Wednesday. ``We know he was lying. He didn't want us to worry.''  The 21-year-old Nakamura joined the Army Reserves out of patriotism despite his father's protests.  ``One day he said, 'Mom, Dad, I'm so proud I was born in the United States,''' his mother, Yoko, 55, told those gathered at a memorial service.  Nakamura was stationed with the 437th Medical Company, based in Colorado Springs, CO. He was sent to the Middle East in February and was killed on June 19, when the ambulance he was in was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade in Al Iskandariyah, south of Baghdad.  ``He was a rascal--you would tell him not to do something, and he would do it anyway,'' said his sister, Pearl. He was a lifeguard who taught swimming at the Santa Fe Springs Aquatic Center since he was 17 and was on his high school's water polo team.  Twenty-five-year-old Army Ranger Andrew Chris followed in the footsteps of his relatives when he joined the military in 2001. Both of his grandfathers served in World War II, his father served in the Army, his uncle in Special Forces and his brother Derek in the Navy. It was a way to connect with the generations of his family.  Chris was killed in combat operations on June 25, just a few days after arriving in Iraq. Ordnance exploded near the vehicle Chris was riding in, and the Army Ranger died immediately.  Before Chris joined the Army, he lived for 5 years in California, most of them in San Diego. After he graduated from high school in Florence, AL, he moved to Lemoore, south of Fresno, to live with his brother.  He spent many weekends exploring and camping in the mountains of California and Arizona. He was also well read, with a special interest in World War II and planned to teach high school history when he completed his military career.  Andrew Chris was quiet and reserved, and extremely loyal to family and friends. He had visited his brother Derek's family just before he was sent to Iraq.  Josh Chris said knowing that his brother died doing what he loved has made it easier to accept. ``He was spiritually and emotionally ready.''  From the outset of the conflict in Iraq, I have learned a great deal about those who have died from the local newspapers. Yet there have been a few individuals whose stories remain largely untold to the public.  One of those is Marine CPL Douglas Jose Marencoreyes, a 28-year-old from Chino, who was assigned to the Light Armored Vehicle-Air Defense Battery, 4th Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. He was killed when the transport truck he was riding in rolled over.  I also learned relatively little about 19-year-old Ryan Cox, from Derby, KS, who was stationed at 29 Palms, CA, and died due to a noncombat weapons discharge on June 15.  Still, we know that he loved to surf and skydive and that, according to his mother, Robin Hamilton, he was doing what he wanted to do. ``He was serving his country. I couldn't have asked for a better son.''  Nor, for that matter, could the United States. We must never forget to remind those left behind--mothers and fathers, wives and children--of how proud we are of America's brave sons and daughters.  We must never lose sight of their achievement or their sacrifice, not to mention the enormous sacrifices made by their families, the ones left behind.                          ____________________
