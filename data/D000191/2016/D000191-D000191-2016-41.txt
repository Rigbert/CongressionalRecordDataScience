Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Back to the harbor maintenance trust fund issues and the allocations to the Corps, the bill sets targets, which I fully agree with, that a higher percentage of the harbor maintenance tax should be allocated every year to O&M programs.  As I mentioned earlier, there is already a $2.5 billion backlog for operations and maintenance, so we are dealing with that by mandating that a higher percentage be spent every year. Unfortunately, if we don't free up the harbor maintenance trust fund, there is only one place that money can come from: new construction.  So I am all for the O&M, and I am all for these increases. But by stripping the harbor maintenance trust fund provision out of the bill and continuing to divert $400 to $500 million a year of the tax to the maw of the Federal Government, they are creating an untenable position for the Corps.  They are already saddled with a $64 billion backlog on construction. They are saddled with a $2.5 billion backlog on operations and maintenance. We are telling them you have to spend more on operations and maintenance. Well, with the discretionary budget caps, that can come out of only one place, and that is the construction projects. Whether it is going to come out of Port Everglades or Charleston Harbor or Brazos Island Harbor, I don't know; but the Corps is going to have to make those decisions because they aren't going to be getting these additional funds that they would have gotten had we freed up this money and created a real trust fund.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
