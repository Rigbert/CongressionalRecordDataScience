President, today I lend my support to the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act to ensure the equality of opportunity for all.  Throughout our history, America has been committed to opening its doors to those who wished to build a new life here; yet, despite being ``the land of opportunity,'' the laws that we have had in place have left many families seeking a better life in limbo. Over the last 2 years, the crisis has reached new levels of inhumanity as this administration irresponsibly ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, DACA, program and ripped families apart at our borders.  This legislation should be considered in the context of a more comprehensive bill which would also address the pressing issues of DACA and family separation. It will be an important piece of the puzzle that will hopefully put us on a path to changing the unfair laws that are currently in place and once again makeAmerica a place of possibility for all. The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act makes important and long overdue changes that will create a more equitable employment-based immigration system. This system will distribute green cards based not on the applicant's country of birth, but on his or her skills. It will slowly get rid of the employment-based country caps and instead create an evenhanded ``first come, first serve'' system for equally qualified, highly skilled immigrants.  This legislation is an important step towards more comprehensive immigration reform. The system as it is now is rigged and unfair. I hope that we can begin to move towards a more comprehensive bill and a brighter future where America is once again, without a doubt, the land of opportunity.                          ____________________
