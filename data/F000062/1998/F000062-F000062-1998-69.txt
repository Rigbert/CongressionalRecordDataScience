  Mr. President, I am really disappointed that this program is being ramrodded through on an appropriations bill. This program represents a huge new immigration program and no one should think to the contrary.  Fifty percent of all the people that are going to come in from other countries under this program will go to one State--California. California has not been afforded the time to do the analysis to see how this program would affect it. This program is a Trojan horse.  When I heard the testimony on a registry program on the Judiciary Committee I thought, ``Great idea; I want to support it.'' When the Senators made the announcement, I was a cosponsor.
