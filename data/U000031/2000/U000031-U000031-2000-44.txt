 Madam Speaker, I appreciated the leadership of both the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher). They were terrific as we moved H.R. 45, as well as were other members of the committee.  But the major change between the two bills is the interim storage facility. It was the administration that sent us that letter and said, we will veto the bill unless you take that provision out. We took their word for it, and yet they still were not there. It really was Lucy and the football. We did what they asked. The Democratic administration refused to play ball. And here we are today.  Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Norwood), a member of the Committee on Commerce and a viable Member on this issue.
