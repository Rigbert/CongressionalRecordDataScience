 As the Senator from Michigan described this, everybody here wants to make sure we take care of our troops. We received a unanimous vote, if memory serves me, the last time we extended unemployment benefits. I think most Members want to stand up and help those who are unemployed through this difficult time of unemployment in our country.  If there ever were a bill to bring us together in those two areas--helping our troops and helping the unemployed--this is the bill.
