 The way the current bill is drafted, without my amendment, it simply creates foreign back alleys for our women who are serving overseas--for those of us who were aware before Roe v. Wade, women got abortions in back alleys because they were not provided medical facilities. We have friends who are not able to have babies because of a procedure that was performed in a back alley. I cannot imagine this Senate and this Congress putting our women who serve in uniform overseas at risk as we did women many years ago in this country. It seems to me that is really disturbing--to create foreign back alleys as this current bill does.
