President, I wish the Senator from Alabama would stay on the floor for a minute.  First of all, I direct this statement to my chairman, whom I deeply respect. There are three amendments floating around right now. There is a lot of confusion as to which one we are voting on now.  I say to the Senator, your statement, the statement from the Senator from Virginia, and the Senator from Alabama, if, in fact, this is a 2-year delay, I would agree wholeheartedly. For all the lobbyists in there--and I have five major installations in my State of Oklahoma--if this is a 2-year delay, as I have said publicly before, and as I said as recently as our policy meeting, I would say let's go ahead and do it, and do it now.  It is my understanding--and I would certainly yield to anyone who disagrees with this--this is killing this BRAC round; that if it should become necessary to have it, you would have to reauthorize it in 2007. That is now my understanding. It is not a delay. This is not the House language. I would like to ask if there is anyone who would correct me. If I am wrong, I need to know it.  Apparently, I am not.  Let me ask the author of the amendment.
