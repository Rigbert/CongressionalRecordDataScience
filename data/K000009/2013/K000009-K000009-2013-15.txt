Speaker, as cochair of the Ukrainian Caucus here in the House, I rise today to condemn the violence currently igniting in Ukraine at the hands of Ukraine's top government officials. Their targets are peaceful protesters and dozens and dozens of journalists who have been harmed.  Shouldn't President Yanukovych and the Ukrainian Government be working hard to encourage and ensure a more open society rather than repressing their own citizenry? Shouldn't they be building a society in which Ukrainians can assemble and freely voice concerns regarding the future of their country?  Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, some have estimated over a million people, have taken to the streets in Kiev this past week out of frustration at their government's abandonment of the European Union Association Agreement. As protests escalated through this weekend, journalists and demonstrators were met with a violent police crackdown. Many were brutally beaten and burned by tear gas.  For many years now, Ukrainians have called for and continue to desire a government and country that embraces democracy, liberty, and respects human rights. Those citizens in the streets and all Ukrainians deserve the opportunity to peacefully demonstrate. They should not fear government retaliation.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me say that I continue to support the Ukrainian people's European aspirations and their demands for democratic reform. Let the people of Ukraine move forward and face west and east and north and south with no fear of reprisal. =========================== NOTE ===========================     December 2, 2013, on page H7377, the following appeared: Let the people of Ukrain move forward    The online version should be corrected to read: Let the people of Ukraine move forward ========================= END NOTE =========================                           ____________________
