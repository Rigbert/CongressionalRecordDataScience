  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, is this a replay of the first 100 days of FDR? That is what the Republican leadership would have the American people believe. Or is it more like a really bad remake of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' some alien force has taken over the other side as they march lockstep and they will not consider any problems that they are creating with their contract. No matter how problematic, no matter how contradictory, no matter how poorly drafted their proposals, the contract must go forward, the alien force says.  Today $3 billion more for a needy Pentagon. They cannot make ends meet on a $271 billion budget. The American people know that. And next week we eliminate the School Lunch Program and the Program for Women, Infants, and Children because we cannot afford it.  Is there a little contradiction here? Is this 100 days to address the real needs of the American people akin to FDR, or is it a nightmarish remake of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers''?  Make up your own mind.                            ____________________
