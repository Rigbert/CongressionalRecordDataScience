President, I have many questions about S. 240, the so-called Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. This bill is intended to curb frivolous lawsuits by private investors claiming securities fraud. But I fear that this bill would also stifle honest lawsuits. I cannot support a bill that will infringe on the rights of innocent securities fraud victims.  Our Federal securities laws provide enforceable legal rights to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and private investors. The ability of private investors to enforce their rights is indispensable to enforcing our Federal securities laws. As one former Commissioner of the SEC said:       Because the Commission does not have adequate resources to      detect and prosecute all violations of the federal securities      laws, private actions preform a critical role in preserving      the integrity of our securities market.  A perfect example of this critical role is the securities fraud case involving Charles Keating, known for his role in the largest savings and loan debacle in U.S. history. After Keating, as president of the Lincoln Savings & Loan of California, sold uninsured bonds in the lobbies of Lincoln branches by making misrepresentations, private investors sued under our Federal securities laws. A class of 23,000 investors recovered $240 million of their $288 million in losses through private securities fraud actions.  I am sure that the vast majority of professionals working in the securities industry strive to provide accurate information and there are some abuses of the private securities litigation system. This legislation would, undoubtedly, curb many of these abuses. For instance, I support the bill's provisions to prohibit lawyers from paying bounties to professional plaintiffs, those who buy a few shares of different stocks so they may bring shareholder suits for a living.  But this bill also overreaches beyond these abuses and penalizes innocent investors. Under S. 240, for example, aiders and abettors cannot be sued in private securities actions, even if they knowingly assist securities fraud. The defendants in the Charles Keating case whose liability depending on aiding and abetting, which included Keating's lawyers, accountants and consultants, paid over $100 million to fraud victims.  In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that enactment of S. 240 would increase costs to the SEC for enforcement actions by $125 million to $250 million over the next 5 years. In these tight budget times, I am very doubtful that Congress will increase the SEC's budget by such a large amount. As a result, enforcement of our securities laws will suffer.  I have heard from many Vermonters, including the commissioner of the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance and Securities--the State's chief securities regulator--who feel S. 240, as reported by the Senate Banking Committee, would severely limit private actions under securities laws. Vermont institutional investors, such as the Towns of Colchester, Brandon and Stowe, Teamster Union Local 597, the Vermont NEA, AFSCME Council 93, the Vermont State Labor Council and others have also alerted me to their opposition to this bill. Vermont consumer and senior groups including Vermont Public Interest Research Group, Council of Vermont Elders, Older Women's League, Southwestern Vermont Council on Aging and the Central Vermont Council on Aging opposed S. 240. Moreover, the Commissioner of the SEC--the national's chief securities regulator--also has significant concerns about S. 240 as reported.  I believe we are moving too fast on this bill, ignoring the SEC and others concerns. That is why I supported a motion on the Senate floor to refer this bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member. This legislation would make significant changes to Federal litigation rules and should be carefully reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee before the full Senate votes on it. Unfortunately, that motion was defeated.  Thousands of Vermonters and millions of Americans depend on our Federal securities laws to protect their investments, savings and retirements. These laws are just too important to add questionable curbs that may protect companies and individuals who commit fraud at the expense of innocent investors. Unless this bill is significantly amended, I will vote against it.                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to propound a number of unanimous consent agreements which we have worked out in order to accommodate Members and in order to move the legislative flow.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bryan be recognized to offer an amendment relative to aiding and abetting on which there will be 1 hour for debate to be equally divided in the usual form, and any second-degree amendments may be limited to half that debate time, and must be relevant in the first degree they propose to amend.
