Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that will nullify the Federal Communication Commission's mandate that will force all televisions to have a digital TV receiver by 2007. The TV Consumer Choice Act of 2002 will give consumers the ability to choose whether or not they want a TV that includes an expensive--and often unnecessary--digital TV tuner.  While digital TV may present new and exciting options to viewers, these tuners should not be forced upon hundreds of millions of Americans, many of whom do not want or need this expensive device. Digital TV tuners are only used to receive over-the-air signals. For those households who choose alternate services, such as cable or satellite, the device is completely worthless. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, the tuner mandate will increase the cost of the average TV by $250 for a device that less than 13% of consumers will use. This is unacceptable.  My legislation will ensure that individual consumers--not the federal government--decide which TV options are best for them. I am hopeful my colleagues will support this legislation and the House will act on this proposal expeditiously.                          ____________________
