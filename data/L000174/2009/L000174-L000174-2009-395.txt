President, I understand the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is about to come to the floor. As each of us probably have times we are going to have to be on and off the floor, I am going to begin my comments now.  I said Monday at the outset of this debate on the motion to proceed to the fraud enforcement bill that I hoped the objection to proceeding and any filibuster effort against this bill would be short lived. I am glad to see that cooler heads have prevailed. That actually happens in the Senate now and then.  After being delayed 2 days, we have agreement to turn to the Leahy-Grassley Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. I thank the majority leader for his persistence. I regret that the weeks we spent reaching across the aisle for a time agreement on this bill were unavailing.
