Mr. Speaker, Terry and Mary Kohler: $715,457.  Richard Gilder, Jr.: $310,000.  Roger Milliken: $255,000.   [[Page H899]] These are but a few of the heavy hitters who have contributed to Speaker Gingrich's personal political machine, GOPAC. Is it any wonder the Speaker wants to keep this list a secret?  The Los Angeles Times succeeded yesterday in doing what the Federal Election Commission is attempting to do in the courts, revealing the contributors to GOPAC and what their interests are in legislation before this Congress.  What does the contributor get for $715,000? Only an outside independent counsel can tell us for sure.  The lists of questions about the Speaker's financial dealings get longer and longer. I ask, ``Isn't it time we get an answer?''  We need an outside counsel. We need one now.                          ____________________
