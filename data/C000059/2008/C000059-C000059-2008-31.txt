 Bill Number: H.R. 5658.  Account: Standards Development--Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, NAVY.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division.  Address of Requesting Entity: Naval Surface Warfare Center Corona Division, 2300 Fifth St., Norco, CA 92860.  Description of Request: I have received congressional authorization in the House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (NDAA FY09) for a requested project in the amount of $2,000,000. The authorization is for a project which would continue work in the areas of Primary and Depot Maintenance calibration standards. Specifically the work will be done in the technology areas of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC), electro-optics, and physical-mechanical. The purpose of the work is to ensure measurement accuracy in support and maintenance of new advanced technology weapon systems, current weapon systems and associated support equipment. Specifically, the funding also continues efforts of calibration standards (hardware) in support of Nanoscale Dimensional Standards using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Standards developed through this ongoing program provides continued measurement support and capability to ensure that our nation's advanced weapon systems operate as designed and detectors accurately recognize threats.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert.  Bill Number: H.R. 5658.  Account: Defense Wide--Research, Development, Test & Evaluation.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside.  Address of Requesting Entity: 900 University Avenue, Riverside, California 92521.  Description of Request: I have received congressional authorization in the House-passed version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (NDAA FY09) for a requested project in the amount of $3,000,000 for 3-D-electronics technology. This project aims to take advantage of recent advances in nanomaterials and nanodevices to begin to address the issue necessary to take the electronics industry beyond the two-dimensional silicon based devices and wiring and to develop high density, 3D-electronics technology together with associated packaging, portable power sources and heat dissipation solutions. UC Riverside has substantial expertise in the development of nanomaterials that offer extraordinary properties when properly engineered for these applications. The proposed effort will fund technology development studies in the following five areas: 3D integration of RF and Digital technologies; materials development for thermal management; materials development for 3D wiring; materials development for multi-technology isolation; and development of process equipment for advanced 3D processes and materials manufacturing. The availability of new approaches to very high density electronics and compact power sources that are built from the new generation of nanomaterials will greatly aid the DoD mission in providing advanced electronics and power in the battlefield.                          ____________________
