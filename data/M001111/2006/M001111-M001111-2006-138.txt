 President, this is an agreed-upon modification to the amendment I spoke to this morning regarding the funding for port security.  As I said this morning, it makes sure that we have adequate resources to implement the port security bill, and that is essential to its success. We have worked out an agreement with Finance, and that amendment is pending. I hope we can move quickly and agree to it.
