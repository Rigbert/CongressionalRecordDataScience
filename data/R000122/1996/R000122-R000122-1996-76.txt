Chairman, I regret that I must vote against H.R. 2406, the Housing Act of 1995. While I support the provisions which reduce burdensome regulations for public housing authorities and consolidate numerous programs, I do not support the provisions which will limit housing options for our Nation's most vulnerable residents and families.  During House debate, I spoke in favor of Representative Frank's amendment to retain the Brooke amendment, an amendment which would have ensured that residents in public housing do not pay more than 30 percent of their limited income toward rent. Although the House was successful in retaining this important provision for our Nation's elderly and disabled, and those with incomes below 30 percent of the area median, H.R. 2406 still contains language which will effectively shut out low-income working Americans from affordable, decent housing. I have long held that we need meaningful welfare reform and that there ought to be a safety net for those Americans trying to get their feet back on the ground. Repealing the Brooke amendment will severely hurt our Nation's low-income, working residents who are struggling to afford a home, food, clothing, and medicine.  In addition to repealing the Brooke amendment, the House bill also changes regulations regarding income targeting. I commend Chairman Lazio for his efforts on compromise language with Representative Kennedy from Massachusetts to reserve more public and assisted housing for the very poor. I also share the goal of integrating a broader range of incomes for people in public housing, but I remain concerned that many low-income Americans will still be cut off from housing assistance while housing authorities seek to attract people with higher incomes. It is my hope that the House-Senate conference will result in an agreement to ensure that those who are in dire need of housing are able to receive assistance.  Mr. Speaker, I heard from hundreds of Rhode Islanders who expressed serious concerns about this bill and the repeal of the Brooke amendment. At a time when Americans are already coping with drastic budget cuts, it does not make sense to disadvantage working residents and families by placing affordable, decent housing out of their reach.  Mr. Speaker, everyone needs a place to live, and, as such, housing legislation should be a bipartisan effort. The Senate has taken this to heart and passed bipartisan legislation which preserves the Brooke amendment. It is my hope that the final bill will be more like the Senate version, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure safe, decent, affordable housing for all Americans.                          ____________________
