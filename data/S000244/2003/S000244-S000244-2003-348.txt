Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this conference report contains provisions of H.R. 1104, the Child Abduction Protection Act, which overwhelmingly passed the House 410 to 14 less than 2 weeks ago, and the provisions of S. 151, the PROTECT Act of 2003, which passed the other body 84 to nothing on February 24.                              {time}  1130  Over the last several days, during the course of lengthy staff meetings and an open, working meeting of conferees, we have worked diligently to resolve differences between the House and the Senate. I believe we were successful in crafting a bipartisan conference report that recognizes a comprehensive effort is needed to better protect children. In order to accomplish this, the legislation includes provisions to help prevent crimes against children, to assist in the safe recovery of abducted children, to enhance the investigations and prosecutions of these crimes, and to ensure that the offenders are held accountable and unable to repeat these crimes.  An abducted child is a parent's worst nightmare. We must assure that law enforcement in our communities have every possible tool to prevent abductions in the first place, and when an abduction occurs, to recover a missing child quickly and safely, and to ensure that the criminal receives sure and swift justice, including an appropriate sentence in prison.  The overarching goal of this comprehensive package is to stop those who prey on children before they can harm children. This is accomplished by destroying the illicit markets that encourage exploitation and abduction of children, strengthening penalties to reflect the seriousness of these crimes, halting repeat offenders, and enhancing law enforcement agencies to effectively prevent, investigate and prosecute crimes against children.  For instance, this legislation responds to the April 16, 2002, Supreme Court decision in Ashcroft v. The Free Speech Coalition that struck down a 1996 law written to combat computer-generated pornography. As the president for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children stated, ``The Court's decision will result in the proliferation of child pornography in America unlike anything we have seen in more than 20 years.''  Congress has an obligation to prevent the resurgence of the child pornography market. This conference report will help do so by amending the definition of computer-generated child pornography so that it will withstand a constitutional challenge.  Additionally, the conference report provides strong support to recover abducted children quickly and safely through a prompt and effective public alert system. Such a system can be the difference between the life and death for that child.  To accomplish this, the conference report codifies the AMBER Alert program currently in place in the Departments of Justice and Transportation, and authorizes increased funding to help States deploy a child abduction communication warning network. While our goal must always be to prevent the abduction of the child before it occurs, our communities should also have an effective and responsive AMBER Alert system to assist in the quick and safe return of the kidnapped child.  I am happy to report that this compromise legislation doubles the authorized funding for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Nation's resource center for child protection, to $20 million a year through 2005. The center assists in the recovery of missing children and raises public awareness of ways to protect children from abduction, molestation, and sexual exploitation.  Another vital component in the effort to protect children are strong laws that hold the criminal accountable. Those who abduct children are often serial offenders who have already been convicted of similar offenses. Sex offenders and child molesters are four times more likely than any other violent criminal to repeat their offenses against children. This number demands attention, especially in light of the fact that a single child molester on average shatters the lives of over 100 children.  Under this legislation, sexual predators will no longer slip through the cracks of the system and harm other children. To this end, the legislation provides a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for non-familial abductions of a child under the age of 18, lifetime supervision for sex offenders, and mandatory life imprisonment for second-time offenders. The compromise legislation restricts the opportunity for pretrial release for crimes of child abduction and sex offenses and extends the statutes of limitation.  Finally, this conference report contains provisions to address the long-standing and growing problem of downward departures from the Federal sentencing guidelines. Outrageously, between 1996 and 2001, U.S. courts have lowered the sentences of one out of every five of those convicted of sexually abusing a child or sexually exploiting a child through child pornography.  Strong sentencing is an essential component in any effort to fight crimes against children. All of our efforts in this bill and in previous anticrime measures are fruitless if, at the end of the day, judges are permitted to give offenders a slap on the wrist, which is exactly what is happening today with increased frequency.  I am proud of the efforts of the conferees to quickly send this legislation to the President. It was a fair and open process, and the exhaustive negotiations yielded extensive changes to the base text of the legislation that passed the House. Most of these changes were made to accommodate the concerns of my colleagues in the minority party, both in the Senate and in the House.  I am extremely proud of the extraordinary effort my now-weary staff expended to help craft this conference report and to get to it the floor today. I would like to extend special thanks to Sean McLaughlin, Will Moschella, Beth Sokul, Jay Apperson and Katy Crooks of the Committee on the Judiciary staff. Their dedication is greatly appreciated.  The bottom line is that this comprehensive legislative package will crack down on child abductors, build and expand on the work of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, give Federal authorities additional tools to prevent and solve these horrific crimes, and provide meaningful sentencing reform for all crimes. I urge my colleagues to protect America's children from the worst predators in our society by supporting this bipartisan child protection legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
