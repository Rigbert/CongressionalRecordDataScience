Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Nadler], for yielding me this time. I thank the chairman for all of his help and all of his support, the gentleman from Pennsylvania.  I am here to lend my strong support for these three tri-State water compacts. It was not easy, but the States of Georgia, Florida, and Alabama had come together with the Federal Government behind a proposal that we all can agree on. This legislation will protect the environment, the water supplies, and the interests of everyone involved.  A lot of dedicated people spent a lot of time working on this legislation. I want to thank my colleagues, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Barr] and the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich], for their work on this project. I also want to thank Rob Hood with the Speaker's office and Bob Herriott with the office of the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Barr], Spinner Findley with the Department of Justice, Philip Mancusi-Ungaro with the EPA, Joe Tanner with the State of Georgia, and State Representative Bob Kerr, who deserve recognition for their contribution. In addition, I thank Sally Bethea with the Upper Chattahoochee River people for her work to ensure that these compacts adequately protect the environment.  Mr. Speaker, lastly, I thank Harold Reheis, head of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. More than any other individual, Harry Reheis deserves recognition for bringing us to where we are today. Through his leadership and dedication, we have managed to resolve all of the differences and overcome all of the problems confronting this project. So I thank Mr. Reheis for all his work on this project.  Again, I express my strong support for these compacts and ask my colleagues for their support.
