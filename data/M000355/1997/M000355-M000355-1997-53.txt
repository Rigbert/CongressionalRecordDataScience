 And the chairman of the national committee is simply referring to the poll that his organization took and clearing up the article that was in the Weekly Standard which was simply inaccurate. So I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that this letter from Jim Nicholson be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Republican National Committee,                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1997.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator McConnell: I want to take this opportunity to      clarify to you recent RNC polling data in light of      misinformation reported in a September 22, 1997 Weekly      Standard article entitled, ``Republicans Get Some Very Bad      News.''       The Standard piece erroneously claimed that a recent RNC      national poll illustrated that Americans were increasingly      supportive of campaign finance reform, listing it as an issue      of chief concern.       Let me be clear--the Weekly Standard was wrong. In fact,      the September poll discussed never contained a direct      question about campaign finance reform.       Here is a synopsis of what we have found in our polling to      date:       In an open-ended question from our September survey of      1,000 likely voters, not one individual surveyed identified      campaign finance reform as the most important problem facing      the U.S. today.       In a question offering a short list of potential concerns      from our June 1997 poll, only 2% of Americans said that ``the      way political campaigns are financed'' would be the most      important issue to them in deciding how to vote for congress.       In a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey, only 5%      surveyed found that ``reforming the way political campaigns      are financed'' deserved the greatest attention from the      Federal government at the present time (from a list of seven      issues.)       I hope this information proves useful to you as the Senate      continues debate on the McCain-Feingold bill.           Sincerely,                                                    Jim Nicholson,                                                         Chairman.
