 Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr.         Gorton and Mr. Grams):  S. 625. A bill to provide for competition between forms of motor vehicle insurance, to permit an owner of a motor vehicle to choose the most appropriate form on insurance for that person, to guarantee affordable premiums, to provide for more adequate and timely compensation for accident victims, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.                   THE AUTO CHOICE REFORM ACT OF 1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am happy today to join with my esteemed colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator Lieberman, to announce the introduction of the Auto Choice Reform Act. As you know, we introduced this bill in the last Congress, along with Senator Dole. We are proud to announce that Senator Slade Gorton and Senator Rod Grams have also joined us as original cosponsors.  You will hear lots of discussion today, and in the coming months, about various aspects of automobile insurance and tort liability. But, everything you will hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two words: choice and savings.  Consumers want, need, and deserve both.  Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice of opting out of the pain and suffering litigation lottery. The consumers who make this choice will achieve a substantialsavings on automobile insurance premiums.  Based on an analysis by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, the Joint Economic Committee estimates that, under Auto Choice, consumers could save a total of $45 billion nationwide in 1997--at no cost to the Government. And, over 5 years, Auto Choice could make available a total of $246 billion in savings. Now, that's better than any tax cut that either party has proposed.  What does a $45 billion annual savings mean to the average driver? Well, that savings is colorfully and clearly illustrated behind me with this check: ``Pay to the Order of the American Driver--$243.'' And this check is not a one-time payment. Motorists could achieve this type of savings every year.  However, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of Auto Choice, you must understand the terrible costs of the current tort liability system.  The Nation's auto insurance system desperately needs an overhaul. And nobody knows this better than the American motorist--who is now paying on average $757 for automobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, average premiums rose 44 percent--nearly 1\1/2\ times the rate of inflation.  Why are consumers forced to pay so much?  Because the auto insurance system is clogged and bloated by fraud, wasteful litigation, and abuse.  First, let's talk about fraud. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave of indictments stemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-ranging investigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car accidents and massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I. uncovered criminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order to bring lawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses and governments. F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh estimates that every American household is burdened by an additional $200 in unnecessary insurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud.  In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the incentives of our litigation system encourage injured parties to make excessive medical claims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. The Rand Institute for Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, concluded that 35 to 42 percent of claimed medical costs in car accident cases are excessive and unnecessary. Let me repeat that in simple English: well over one-third of doctor, hospital, physical therapy, and other medical costs claimed in car accident cases are for nonexistent injuries or for unnecessary treatment.  The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars annually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and national debate over our health care system. While people have strongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that problem, the Rand data make one thing certain --lawsuits, and the potential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the health care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, without depriving one person of needed medical care, is clearly in our national interest.  Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might ask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party stands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the more you go to the doctor, the more you get from the jury. And, the more you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in his own pocket.  In addition to the massive fraud encouraged by the liability system, seriously injured people are grossly undercompensated under the tort system. A 1991 Rand study reveals that people with economic losses between $25,000 and $100,000 recover on the average only 50 percent of their economic losses. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover only 9 percent.  Moreover, liability insurance does not pay until the claim is resolved. Studies show that the average time to recover is 16 months, and it takes longer in serious injury cases.  The Auto Choice bill gives consumers a way out of this system of high premiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill would remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that car accident victims recover fully for their economic loss.  Now, I'd like to answer the question: what is Auto Choice? Let me first answer with what it is not. It does not abolish lawsuits, and it does not eliminate the concept of fault within the legal system. There will no doubt be less reason to go to court, but the right to sue is absolutely not abolished.  What it does do is allow drivers to decide how they want to be insured. In establishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles economic and noneconomic losses and allows the driver to choose whether to be covered for noneconomic losses--that is, pain and suffering losses.  In other words, if a driver wants to be covered for pain and suffering, he stays in the current State system. If he wants to opt-out of the pain and suffering regime, he chooses the personal protection system.  This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, is, believe it or not, currently unavailable for over ninety percent of all motorists. Auto Choice will change that.  Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every consumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance systems.  The first choice is the tort maintenance system. Drivers who wish to stay in their current system would choose this system and be able to sue and be sued for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially buy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would recover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The only change for tort drivers would be that, in the event that they are hit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would recover both economic and noneconomic damages from his own insurance policy. This supplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be called tort maintenance coverage.  The second choice is the personal protection system. Consumers choosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their economic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. These drivers would give up recovery of pain and suffering damages in exchange for being immune from pain and suffering lawsuits. Personal protection drivers would achieve substantially reduced premiums because the personal protection system would dramatically reduce: First, pain and suffering damages, second, fraud, and third, the bulk of attorney fees.  Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal protection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own coverage will have the right to sue the responsible party for the excess. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the right to sue each other for both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the right to sue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong.  The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous.  First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer injury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid for their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave compensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much coverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery road will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless driver could not recover under the tort system because no other person was at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family is injured, the driver knows his insurance will protect his family.  Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is in the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how much coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as little insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 of protection to $1 million of coverage.  Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the event they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue.  Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care resources. Insuring on a first-party basis eliminates the incentives for excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be compensated for actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for padding one's claims disappear.  Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers because thesavings are progressive. Low-income drivers will see the biggest savings because they pay a higher proportion of their disposable income in insurance costs. A study of low income residents of Maricopa County, AZ, revealed that households below 50 percent of the poverty line spent an amazing 31.6 percent of their disposable income on car insurance.  For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and the ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing or extra food for the children. Or, they choose the worst alternative of all--driving without any insurance. Should we allow our litigation system to promote such unlawful conduct?  Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those who don't drive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer dollars through decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will allow governments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit the community. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that could be hired with money now spent on lawsuits. Or, schools and playgrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on liability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the Bronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth Services, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban areas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits.  Last, we will create incentives for safer cars. Now, it actually costs more to insure a safer car. That's because a driver in a bigger car who is responsible for another's injury may have a bigger claim to pay. After all, the bigger, safer car may cause more damage to the person in a smaller, less safe car. So insuring a bigger, safer car costs more. But under auto choice and first-party coverage, insurance companies would reward customers with lower premiums for safer cars.  The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one simple choice: ``Do you want to continue to pay $757 a year for auto insurance and have the right to recover pain and suffering damages? Or would you rather save $243 a year on your premiums, be promptly reimbursed for your economic losses, and forego pain and suffering damages?''  It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which answer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the consumer. We simply want to give them the choice.  In closing, I'd like to do something I rarely do--quote the New York Times--which summed up the benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of Auto Choice: Auto Choice ``would give families the option of foregoing suits for nonmonetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.''  Now, before I turn over the floor to Senator Moynihan, I'd like to share with you a scathing indictment of the tort liability system that was written more than a quarter of a century ago by a true visionary:       No one involved has an incentive to moderation or      reasonableness. The victim has every reason to exaggerate his      losses. It is some other person's insurance company that must      pay. The company has every reason to resist. It is somebody      else's customer who is making the claim. Delay, fraud,      contentiousness are maximized, and in the process the system      becomes grossly inefficient and expensive. Automobile      accident litigation has become a 20th-Century equivalent of      Dickens's Court of Chancery, eating up the pittance of widows      and orphans, a vale from which few return with their respect      for just[ice] undiminished.  Well, those insightful and prophetic words were spoken by none other than the man who stands here with me as an original cosponsor today, my colleague from the State of New York, Pat Moynihan. Pat, it's taken over 25 years, but I think we're finally going to overhaul this broken-down auto insurance system.  Mr. President, this bill has broad support from across the spectrum. It should be obvious by the support and endorsements that this bill has already received that this is not conservative or liberal legislation. It is consumer legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and statements in support of Auto Choice from the Republican mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani, the former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis, and the executive director of the Reform Party, Russ Verney, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 625       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Auto Choice Reform Act of      1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the costs of operating a motor vehicle are excessive      due in substantial part to the legal and administrative costs      associated with the resolution of claims under the tort      liability insurance system;       (2) the tort liability insurance system often results in--       (A) the failure to provide compensation commensurate with      loss;       (B) an unreasonable delay in the payment of benefits; and       (C) the expenditure of an excessive amount for legal fees;       (3) the incentives of the tort liability insurance system      for motor vehicles are distorted, and result in--       (A) significant fraud in the claims process, which      exacerbates the level of distrust of many individuals in the      United States with respect to the legal process and the rule      of law;       (B) significant, wasteful, fraudulent, and costly overuse      and abuse of scarce health care resources and services;       (C) unbearable cost burdens on low-income individuals,      imposing on them the Hobson's choice of driving on an      unlawful, uninsured basis or foregoing essential needs, such      as food and adequate shelter;       (D) significant reductions in, access to, and purchases of,      motor vehicles, which--       (i) damage the economic well-being of many low-income      individuals; and       (ii) cause unnecessary harm to a critical component of the      economy of the United States;       (E) significant deterioration of the economic well-being of      the majority of major cities in the United States through the      imposition of a massive tort tax that--       (i) places a disproportionate burden on urban residents;      and       (ii) contributes to the abandonment of the cities by many      taxpayers who are able to achieve substantial after-tax      savings on automobile insurance premiums by moving to      adjacent suburban communities; and       (F) significant inability to achieve market-based discounts      in insurance rates for owners of safer cars, which reduces      the level of safety for drivers and passengers of motor      vehicles;       (4) insurance to indemnify individuals for personal      injuries arising from motor vehicle collisions is frequently      unavailable at a reasonable cost because of the potential      liability for third-party tort claims;       (5) a system that gives consumers the opportunity to insure      themselves and that separates economic and noneconomic      damages for the purposes of purchasing insurance would      provide significant cost savings to drivers of motor      vehicles;       (6) a system that enables individuals to choose the form of      motor vehicle insurance that best suits their needs would--       (A) enhance individual freedom;       (B) reduce the cost of motor vehicle insurance; and       (C) increase average compensation in the event of an      accident; and       (7) a system that targets and emphasizes the scourge of      those individuals who drive under the influence of drugs or      alcohol will further deter such dangerous and unlawful      conduct.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to allow consumers of motor      vehicle insurance to choose between--       (1) an insurance system that provides substantially the      same remedies as are available under applicable State law;      and       (2) a predominately first-party insurance system that      provides for--       (A) more comprehensive recovery of economic loss in a      shorter period of time; and       (B) the right to sue negligent drivers for any      uncompensated economic losses.

SEC. 5. AUTO CHOICE INSURANCE SYSTEM.       (a) Operation of the Right To Choose.--Under this Act, a      person shall have the right to choose between the following      insurance systems:       (1) Personal protection system.--A person may choose      insurance under a system that provides for personal      protection insurance for that person and any resident      relative or dependent of that person.       (2) Tort maintenance system.--A person may choose insurance      under a system that provides for the form of motor vehicle      insurance (including tort liability, no-fault, add-on, or      uninsured motor vehicle insurance) that is otherwise required      in the State in which the person is insured.       (b) Personal Protection System.--       (1) Minimum policy requirements.--In order for a personal      protection insurance policy to be covered by this Act, a      motor vehicle insurance policy issued by an insurer shall, at      a minimum--       (A) provide personal protection insurance coverage--       (i) with no per accident limit; and       (ii) in coverage amounts equal to the greater of--       (I) the minimum per person limits of liability insurance      for personal injury under the applicable State financial      responsibility law; or       (II) in a State covered by a no-fault motor vehicle      insurance law, the minimum level of insurance required for      no-fault benefits;       (B) contain provisions for a waiver of certain tort rights      in accordance with this Act; and       (C) contain provisions under the applicable State financial      responsibility law relating to liability for--       (i) property damage; and       (ii) bodily injury to protect third parties whose rights to      recover both economic and noneconomic loss are not affected      by the immunities provided under this Act for those persons      choosing personal protection insurance coverage.       (2) Superseding provision.--This Act supersedes a State law      to the extent that, with respect to the issuance of a      personal protection insurance policy, the State law--       (A) would otherwise bar a provision that provides for the      personal protection authorizations and accompanying      immunities set forth in this Act; or       (B) is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of this      Act.       (3) Primacy of payment.--       (A) In general.--Personal protection insurance benefits      shall be reduced by an amount equal to any benefits provided      or required to be provided under an applicable Federal or      State law for workers' compensation or any State-required      nonoccupational disability insurance.       (B) Reimbursement of payors.--       (i) In general.--A personal protection insurer may take      appropriate measures to ensure that any person otherwise      eligible for personal protection benefits who has been paid      or is being paid for losses payable by personal protection      insurance from a source other than the applicable personal      protection insurer shall not receive multiple payment for      those losses.       (ii) Accrual of rights.--Any right to payment for losses      referred to in clause (i) from a personal protection insurer      accrues only to that payor.

(g) Consumer Information Program.--The State official      charged with jurisdiction over insurance rates for motor      vehicles shall establish and maintain a program designed to      ensure that consumers are adequately informed about--       (1) the comparative cost of insurance under the personal      protection system and the tort maintenance system; and       (2) the benefits, rights, and obligations of insurers and      insureds under each system.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of      enactment of this Act.                                                                    ____                 Statement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani       Today, members of Congress and other leaders from across      the political spectrum, representing diverse populations and      constituencies, unite in expressing support for the      introduction and passage of bold, necessary federal      legislation reforming auto insurance and tort law in America.       The introduction of auto-choice legislation marks a      milestone in the nation's response to motorist demands for      fair, equitable and cost-effective insurance coverage.      Millions of drivers are presently paying excessive insurance      premiums because of inflated claims and huge pain and      suffering awards. Under this legislation proposed by Senators      Lieberman, McConnell and Moynihan, among others, the nation      as a whole stands to save $45 billion in insurance premiums      this year alone, with the average driver nationwide saving      $243 per year. That amounts to the equivalent of a $243 tax      cut without any corresponding cut in services. The newly      released report by the Joint Economic Committee of the United      States Congress on ``The Benefits and Savings of Auto-     Choice'' estimates that with auto choice, New York City      motorists will see an average decrease of $417 per driver per      year.       The genius of this bill is the unbundling of pain and      suffering coverage from insurance premiums and the switch to      first party coverage--similar to no-fault coverage. Moreover,      people who want coverage for pain and suffering--and are      willing to pay for it--can obtain it. But, they will not      recover pain and suffering damages at the expense of third      parties, or at the expense of our court system where      sympathetic juries often grant windfalls for being injured in      the form of subjective non-economic damages. There is simply      no justification for many of the enormous awards to the      injured who--though rightfully compensated for objective      pecuniary loss--are rewarded for unsubstantiated pain and      suffering damages, often with no regard for the relationship      to the fault of the parties concerned.       Over the years, New York City has risked losing the      valuable civic contributions of many of its residents to the      suburbs where insurance rates are usually more affordable.      Coupled with the reduction in crime our City has experienced,      reduced insurance premiums would provide added incentive for      City residents to keep their homes and their businesses in      the City. These reforms come at no cost to City residents nor      would they diminish governmental services. Motorists in      municipalities and urban centers across the land stand to      reap these enormous savings.       When we value the productivity of our urban residents and      demonstrate our respect for their contributions, we improve      the quality of life for the City as a whole and ensure its      prosperity for years to come. Auto-choice assists in doing      precisely that. It demonstrates our leaders' respect for the      economic well being of even the most hard pressed motorist.       But equally as important, the bill would help restore a      little faith in our courts and judicial system, which have      been increasingly plagued with criticism by, and stands to      lose the confidence of, ordinary citizens. When people see      some lawyers running from the hospital to the court to the      insurance company, they understand why their premiums are so      high. Plaintiffs receive barely one-half of all settlements      after lawyers, experts and court fees are paid. Under      existing law, plaintiff attorneys have tremendous incentive      to shoot for the gold--that giant pain and suffering cash      cow--paid for by the American motorist through excessive      insurance premiums.       People wonder: why can't this process be controlled? Today,      we tell these people that they, not special interests, are in      charge. We assure them that money which should not be      unjustly taken from them, will not be. We give them the      chance to determine for themselves how much insurance      coverage is     enough coverage for them and their families. And, keep in      mind, under auto-choice, all motorists obtain coverage for      objective economic loss, such as medical bills or lost wages.       The bill is sensible and fair, and I respectfully urge      Congress to pass this important legislation.                                                                    ____         Northeastern University, College of Arts and Sciences,            Department of Political Science,                                                   April 17, 1997.       I enthusiastically endorse the ``choice'' auto insurance      bill you are jointly sponsoring. Your action is an important      act of bipartisan leadership on an issue that significantly      affects all Americans.       The issue you address has been a great concern of mine      throughout my political career ever since I sponsored the      first no-fault auto insurance bill in the nation.       Given the horrendous high costs of auto insurance, coupled      with its long delays, high overhead, and rank unfairness when      it comes to payment, your ``choice'' reform takes the      sensible approach of allowing consumes to choose how to      insure themselves. In other words, your reform trust the      American people to decide for themselves whether to spend      their money on ``pain and suffering'' coverage of food,      medicine, life insurance or any other expenditure they deem      more valuable for themselves and their families.       The bill is a particularly important to the people who live      in American cities where premiums are the highest. It is no      surprise that the cost studies done by the Joint Economic      Committee indicate that while your reform will make stunning      cost savings available to all American consumers, its largest      benefits will go to the low income drivers living in urban      areas.       The bill will also help resolve the country's problems with      runaway health costs. By allowing consumer to remove      themselves from a system whose perverse incentives trigger      the cost of health care costs, your reform will lower the      cost of health care for all Americans while ensuring that      health care expenditure are more clearly targeted to health      care needs.       I look forward to assisting you to the fullest possible      degree as you exercise your vitally need leadership on behalf      of America's consumers.     Michael S. Dukakis.                                                                    ____          Statement of Reform Party Chairman Russell J. Verney       Only on rare occasions does Congress have the opportunity      to stimulate our national economy without adding to the $5.2      trillion debt burden this generation is leaving to our      children and grandchildren.       Auto Choice Reform is one of those rare opportunities. It      allows the owners of automobiles the choice of the level of      insurance coverage they wish to provide for their own losses.      protects an injured or harmed person's right to collect for      their losses and can cut the average automobile owner's      annual insurance rate by an average of $243 per year.       Auto Choice Reform is an idea whose time has come.      Unfortunately, it will also stimulate a new furious round of      campaign (investments) contributions by special interests who      benefit from the current high cost of auto insurance rates      and protracted litigation associated with automobile      insurance and accidents injuries.       As list of top donors to political parities and candidates      during 1995 and 1996, published by Mother Jones Magazine      listed numerous individuals from the insurance industry and      trial lawyers who have established their right of access to      our top political leaders in this country.       The sponsors and promoters of the common sense Auto Choice      Reform Act will have to overcome the easy access special      interests have to our country's decision makers if this $44      billion per year cost savings for motorists in this country      is to be achieved.
