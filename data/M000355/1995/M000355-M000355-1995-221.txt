 President, how much time is remaining on each side?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Forty-nine minutes is remaining on your side; the other side has 36 minutes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a number of requests for time, so I am going to have to start allocating minutes, fewer minutes than I had hoped. Senator Kassebaum has indicated she wants to speak. Senator Hutchison has indicated she wants to speak. Senator Simpson is here. Senator Brown is here. But I believe Senator Brown is really sort of next in order. I would like to give to Senator Brown 10 minutes.  I yield Senator Brown 10 minutes.
