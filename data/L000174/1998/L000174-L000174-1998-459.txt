President, recently Charles Tolchin made remarks at the ground breaking at the new NIH Clinical center. While speeches at ground breakings are not normally something of note, these are.  Charles Tolchin suffered from cystic fibrosis and normally would not have lived even into his teens. Today, he is nearly 30, has survived a double-lung transplant, and has shown it is possible to completely beat the odds.  He makes it clear that he did this with the help of the people at NIH, and I ask that the text of his statement be printed in the Record so that this achievement can be shared with all.  The statement follows:                      A Living Shrine to My Heros                          (By Charles Tolchin)       The new Mark Hatfield Clinical Research Center is a living      shrine to my heros. NIH researchers define dedication, faith,      and infectious enthusiasm. They have made an enormous impact      on my life.       I have Cystic Fibrosis, A genetic lung and digestive      disease affecting 30,000 Americans. When I was five, doctors      used the sweat test to diagnose me. It was developed here at      NIH forty years ago by Dr. Paul D'Saint Agnese and is still      the primary diagnostic tool for CF.       Over the past ten years, NIH has invested millions of      dollars in CF research. That investment has reaped a golden      return. In 1989, NIH funded scientists Francis Collins, Jack      Riordan and Lap Chee Tsui, isolated the gene that causes CF.      Since then, CF has led the pack in gene replacement therapy.      Scientists are now trying to create a delivery system for      inserting healthy genes into patients' lungs.       NIH funds research designed to gain a deeper understanding      of CF on a molecular level. Why do CF lung cells act in the      abnormal manner that they do? Every year, when I hear a      lecture on the latest breakthroughs, I'm amazed at the art on      the slides. It used to be very simple: here's a cf cell. But      now, the art is highly defined, illustrating how the CF      Transmembrane Regulator fails to transport water, sodium and      chloride across the cell wall.       This gained knowledge is leading to new treatments, also      funded by NIH. In 1993, the FDA approved a new drug for CF,      Pulmozyme, aimed at thinning the thick mucous that plugs our      lungs. I inhaled it twice a day for four years. NIH research      has led to the development of nebulized Tobramycin, and      Ciprofloxacin, two highly effective antibiotics. Both have      fought biological warfare in my lungs. NIH research has led      to the use of ibuprofen to reduce inflammation in the lungs.      And NIH research led to the Flutter device, which I used      three times a day to help cough up my mucous.       What impact has all of this research had on my life? When I      was diagnosed at the age of 5, life expectancy was 8. Now,      I'm 29, and life expectancy is 31. My whole life, that number      has gone up because of the great strides in CF research.       I have also benefitted from NIH's outstanding clinical      care. I became a patient back in 1977. I have received      outstanding care from nurses who define compassion. Many have      treated me for over ten years, adding the rare dimension of      continuity to medicine. Pharmacists, x-ray technicians,      respiratory therapists and nutritionists have all contributed      their talents to my well-being. Finally, the physicians at      NIH are world-class. My doctor, Milica Chernick, is a fine      example. Having a lung disease means an endless procession of      cold stethoscopes on your chest. Dr. Chernick always made      sure to warm hers before taking a listen.       Because of NIH clinical care, and NIH and CF Foundation      research, I stayed healthy enough to receive a double lung      transplant at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,      this past April. The changes in my life have been profound.      No longer do I spend five hours a day on respiratory therapy.      I sleep all night without coughing. In fact, I never cough.      Now I have the energy to go out and do things all day, to      shed an isolated existence for one of vitality and      stimulation.       The changes in my life have also been subtle. The only rule      I broke after transplant was that I started driving a week      before my doctors granted me permission. When I did so for      the first time, I felt wind on my arms and realized that it      was my own breath. When I went swimming for the first time      after my transplant, I realized that I didn't need to keep a      gym bag with a box of kleenex by the side of the pool.       Throughout my lifetime, medicine and research have      dovetailed together. Clinical care at NIH kept me healthy      enough to receive my transplant. Research at NIH helped      provide the therapies I received.       We still do not have a cure for CF, but thanks to brilliant      scientists and NIH's deep commitment, I am confident we will.      In this living shrine, my heros fight against time, against      persistent and pervasive adversaries, and against the      unknown. I for one, am extremely grateful.                          ____________________
