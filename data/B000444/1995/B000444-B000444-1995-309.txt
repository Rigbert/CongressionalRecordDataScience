  The reason this is so important is twofold. First, in this era where Federal, State, and local law enforcement often work together we need to maintain spectrum space so that these, and other public service agencies, can communicate with ease and with the most advanced technology available. If we develop better technology to allow the police to talk to each other without the bad guys listening in, we must have the spectrum available to use this technology.  Second, we must work to ensure sufficient spectrum space for the myriad technological advances being made in the area of secured communications. I have heard several of the law enforcement leaders in my home State of Delaware raise these key points. So, I believe this is a practical problem that we face in Delaware and around the Nation.  We do a disservice to law enforcement and to the American people if we do not provide these public servants with the many benefits of our rapidly advancing telecommunications industry. I look forward to working with my friend from Utah on this important effort.
