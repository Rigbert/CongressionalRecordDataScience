Costello, as I tell people, I grew up in Gary, Indiana, with about four integrated steel facilities. I'm a carbon guy. We have a significant issue as far as the use of carbon in this country, and one of the ways to solve it is to proceed with FutureGen. So I do look forward to working with both of you as we proceed.
