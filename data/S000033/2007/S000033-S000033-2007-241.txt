 President, today I am introducing the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007. There are many critically important issues that we face, including education, health care, the growing and inexcusable economic inequality in this country, and the situation in Iraq. Among these issues has to be the threat faced by the earth itself due to global warming and that is why this legislation is the first bill that I am introducing as a U.S. Senator.  The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the full text of which I ask be included in the Record following my remarks, was initially introduced last year by the Senator whose seat I currently hold, Senator Jim Jeffords. Jim's leadership in offering a forwardthinking global warming bill is known by all in this chamber and I am honored to continue his efforts by introducing this tremendously-important legislation today.  This bill, is being cosponsored by many of my esteemed colleagues and I would like to recognize them this morning: Senator Boxer, chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee; the Senior Senator from the great state of Vermont, Mr. Leahy; both Senators from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Menendez; Senators Reed and Whitehouse, both from Rhode Island; the Senate delegation from the State of Hawaii, Senators Inouye and Akaka; and Senator Feingold of Wisconsin and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. I appreciate the support of these colleagues in focusing attention on the most important environmental issue of our time and urge my other colleagues to join in this effort.  I am also proud that the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act has the support of numerous national groups, including the Earth Day Network, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, Environmental & Energy Study Institute, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, League of Conservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Environmental Trust, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and US PIRG.  The Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act is based on the scientific evidence and consensus that global warming poses a significant threat to the United States and the world. In fact, with our national security, our economy, our public health and welfare, and our global environment at stake, we must do nothing short of taking bold action. To that end, I am proud that last week the Vermont state legislature began 3 weeks of hearings on global warming. Like Americans across the country, they want action to fight global warming and they wish their Federal Government would step up and provide leadership commensurate with the magnitude of the threat. Well, Mr President this bill answers those pleas for leadership.  Grassroots support for action on global warming is clear. Over 300 mayors have committed their cities to meeting the standards described in the Kyoto Protocol. In fact, with over 54 million citizens represented, the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement provides clear evidence that everyday citizens--unlike some large corporations who have continually misrepresented the science of global warming--want to see movement on this issue. Additionally, a group of northeast States, including Maine, Connecticut, Delaware, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont, have already implemented a regional effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other northeastern States, such as Maryland and Massachusetts, are likely to join this group soon. And, we all know that the State of California has recognized the need to act on global warming and is moving forward with a tremendous program.  Despite the increasing calls for action, for years, the Bush administration has turned a deaf ear as the scientific community warned us of the problem of global warming and the disastrous impact it will have on our planet. Sadly, many of these predictions are now becoming a reality.  Global concentrations of greenhouse gases are incredibly high. In fact, the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has risen to 378 parts per million--a level unseen during anytime over the past 400,000 years. Additionally, on a global scale, 8 of the 10 years between 1996 and the end of 2005 are among the warmest 10 years on record and experts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have just logged 2006 as the hottest year on record for the U.S. Also, the National Center for Atmospheric Research suggests that the majority of the ice caps of the Arctic Ocean will melt by the summer of 2040--decades earlier than previously expected. And, the situation has become so dramatic that the Department of the Interior recently suggested listing polar bears on the endangered species list because their habitat is quite literally disappearing. We are also told to expect changes in agriculture and water systems, new threats to our health, and more extreme weather patterns including more intense hurricanes. All of this is due to global warming caused by the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are released into our atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels.  The good news is that we know how to stop continued global warming--we simply need the political will to make it happen. The time is now for bold action that will move our country away from fossil fuels such as coal, gas, and oil towards efficient, sustainable energy sources like wind, solar, bio-mass and hydrogen. The bill I introduce today recognizes the urgency of our circumstances and sets targets for reduction of U.S. emissions to help stabilize global atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases below 450 parts per million, a critical level as recognized by leading climate scientists. More specifically, this legislation calls for an 80 percent decrease--compared to 1990 levels--in global warming pollutants by 2050 by enacting a combination of mandatory reduction targets and incentives that will help develop clean alternative energies.  The concept is simple. By putting our minds to it, we can usher in a new era of nonpolluting, renewable energy sources. And, what makes this proposal even more exciting is its potential to reshape our economy and make the United States a leader in clean and efficient energy technologies--creating millions of good paying jobs in the process.  In fact, it is a lack of bold vision that will financially cost us. In October of 2006, Sir Nicholas Stern, a former chief economist of the World Bank, turned the old economic arguments against taking action on climate change on their head. In a report to the British government, he writes that bold action to combat the threat of global warming will in fact save industrial nations money and that inaction could cost between 5 to 20 percent of global gross domestic product. Speaking to the issue in no uncertain terms, the report states, ``If no action is taken we will be faced with the kind of downturn that has not been seen since the great depression and the two world wars.''  To be quite frank, the time for talk is over. It is time for action and introduction of this bill signals my commitment to pushing for such action.  While I ask unanimous consent that Senator Jeffords' full statement from last year on this important bill be included following my remarks, I want to read two excerpts from those remarks:       Global warming is real and it is already happening. Its      effects are being felt across the globe and the longer we      delay, the more severe these effects will be.  He went on to say,       In my final year in the Senate, I have often asked myself,      ``What lasting actions can I take to make the world a better      place?'' I hope that by proposing real action on climate      change, and passing the torch to a new generation of those      committed to protecting the environment, that I can help make      a difference for us all.  I couldn't be more honored to carry on Senator Jeffords' vision on behalf of Vermonters and all Americans.  In closing, a country that represents only 6 percent of the world's population but produces 25 percent of itsgreenhouse gas emissions, the United States has a moral obligation to lead the way toward reducing these emissions. For the sake of our children and grandchildren, we must meet that obligation. This legislation will put us on the right path to do so.  I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              Statement of Senator Jeffords, July 20, 2006       Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Global Warming      Pollution Reduction Act of 2006.       One of the most important issues facing mankind is the      problem of global warming. Global warming is real and it is      already happening. Its effects are being felt across the      globe and the longer we delay, the more severe these effects      will be. The broad consensus within the scientific community      is that global warming has begun, is largely the result of      human activity, and is accelerating. Atmospheric greenhouse      gas concentrations have risen to 378 parts per million,      nearly one third above pre-industrial levels and higher than      at any time during the past 400,000 years. Projections      indicate that stabilizing concentrations at 450 parts per      million would still mean a temperature increase of two to      four degrees Fahrenheit. Such warming will result in more      extreme weather, increased flooding and drought, disruption      of agricultural and water systems, threats to human health      and loss of sensitive species and ecosystems.       In order to prevent and minimize these effects, we must      take global actions to address this issue as soon as      possible. We owe that to ourselves and to future generations.       The overwhelming majority of Americans support taking some      form of action on climate change. I am today introducing the      Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, which I believe      responds to that call. I believe this is the most far      reaching and forward thinking climate change bill ever      introduced. It sets a goal of an 80% reduction in global      warming pollutants by 2050. It provides a roadmap for actions      that we will need to take over the next few decades to combat      global warming. I believe that if this bill were passed, it      would put us on the path to potentially solving the global      warming problem. If it were passed, we would reshape our      economy to become more energy independent, cleaner and more      economically competitive. If it were passed, we would have a      chance of avoiding some of the worst and most dangerous      effects of global warming. If it were passed, we would be in      a position to negotiate with other countries as part of the      global solution.       Some will say that this bill imposes requirements that ask      too much of industry. Some will say that this bill contains      requirements that we cannot easily meet. I say first of all      that the costs of inaction vastly outweigh the costs of      action, and that we have a responsibility to future      generations not to leave the earth far worse off than when we      found it--with a fundamentally altered climate system.      Temperature changes, sea level rise, hurricanes, floods and      droughts can affect food production, national security, the      spread of disease and the survival of endangered species.      These are not things to trifle with on the basis of industry      cost estimates, which have frequently been overstated.       But perhaps more importantly, we can act to reduce global      warming. We can reduce emissions to 1990 levels between now      and 2020 through a reduction of just 2 percent per year.      Energy efficiency alone could play a major part in reaching      reductions and new technologies can help as well. Moreover,      additional deployment of existing renewable energy sources,      including bio-fuels, can also help substantially. If we were      to take the actions suggested in this bill, we would find      that we would enhance our energy independence, and we would      become a world leader in clean energy technologies. American      innovation can position us as the world leader in clean      technologies.       In my final year in the Senate, I have often asked myself      ``What lasting actions can I take to make the world a better      place?'' I hope that by proposing real action on climate      change, and passing the torch to a new generation of those      committed to protecting the environment, that I can help make      a difference for us all. Global warming is upon us now. The      question is, can we take action now, before it is too late?       We know what we need to do, we know how much we must      reduce, and we have the technology to do so. The question for      this body is, do we have the political will? Can we overcome      our fears and insecurity and act decisively to combat global      warming? That is the opportunity and challenge of the coming      years, which my bill on global warming seeks to address. I      urge my colleagues to join me in the quest for a better,      safer world that is free of the enormous threat posed by      dangerous global warming. I urge my colleagues to support      this important piece of legislation.                                  ____                                 S. 309       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
