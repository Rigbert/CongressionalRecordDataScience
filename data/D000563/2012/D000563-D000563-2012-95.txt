President, let me first echo the comments of the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, about our colleague and friend, Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana.  It has been my good fortune now for some 16 years to serve in the Senate with Senator Dick Lugar and to come to know him and his wife Char and, more importantly, to come to know their work together on behalf of Indiana and the United States. Dick Lugar is truly a giant in the Senate. We are going to miss him. There aren't many with the vision of Dick Lugar.  There is something about standing in the middle of this country, Adlai Stevenson II once noted, with the flatlands all around you that gives you a perspective on the world a little different. Dick Lugar's perspective on the world has been so insightful and so important for decades.  His work with Senator Nunn in dealing with the proliferation of nuclear weaponry and the dissolution of the Soviet Union was truly historic andmay have saved the world from catastrophe time and again. He reached out to a young Senator from Illinois by the name of Barack Obama and took him on a congressional delegation tour to look into this issue. I think at the end of the day their friendship was solid, and President Obama notes it was one of the more important overseas visits he made as a Member of the Senate.  I know Dick Lugar as well from the many times we came together with our wives at the Aspen Institute. It is truly unfortunate that there aren't more Senators participating in the Aspen Institute. It is a meeting, usually overseas, of members of the Senate and their spouses with experts to discuss some of the most important problems facing us in this world. No lobbyists are allowed to attend; it is truly 2 or 3 days of work. But it is also a time in the evening to sit together and come to know a family. Loretta and I have come to know Char and Dick Lugar as exceptional people. Char and I would sit and talk about books--which she loves to read and I do too--and Dick and I would talk about the topic of the day, and we created a bond of friendship in those experiences.  He has done so much work in the Senate, as Senator McConnell noted, starting as the mayor of Indianapolis and working his way up to the Senate. He became a powerful force in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and I was honored to serve on that committee over the last several years and watch his work unfold and evolve.  Dick Lugar is going on to great things, I am sure. This is not the end of his service to our country. I wish him and Char the very best, whatever their next undertaking may be.  As you receive praise from the Senator from Kentucky to the south of Indiana, accept some from the Senator from west of Indiana in the State of Illinois. I am honored to count Dick Lugar as a friend, and I am sure going to miss you. You have been an extraordinary ally and colleague on so many important issues.                              Daniel Akaka  Mr. President, I also add my comments in chorus to what the majority leader said about Senator Dan Akaka of Hawaii.  I came to know him--and I have spoken about this on the floor--and Millie who are the perfect Senate family. They have devoted a major part of their lives to serving Hawaii and serving in the national interest.  The legacy Senator Akaka leaves behind is substantial when it comes to legislation, particularly in helping veterans and agricultural issues. But, more important, what Dan Akaka leaves behind is the feeling of kinship and camaraderie which he has with so many Members of the Senate. He is a stalwart at the Senate Prayer Breakfast, leading the singing every Wednesday morning, and it is heartfelt and very genuine.  As Senator Reid mentioned earlier, his family background of Hawaii--which he shared with us one afternoon at a lunch--is a tradition of giving and hospitality which we find built in to Danny Akaka. We are going to miss him.                                Jim Webb  To the Presiding Officer--I said a few words on the floor before--we thank you for your service. You did an extraordinary job here. There aren't many one-termers who make a mark in the Senate and on the Nation. You did it.  I can remember--I thought it was a little bold of you, maybe even more--when you came in and said: I want to rewrite the GI bill, and you did it and it was exceptional. You have helped thousands of men and women who have served in our military come back to America and be welcomed and be productive parts of our future.  In so many ways, I wish to thank Senator Jim Webb, our Presiding Officer, for being an important and viable part of the Senate. I know you will continue to serve our Nation in many different capacities in the future, and I am sure they will be equally exceptional.                          ____________________
