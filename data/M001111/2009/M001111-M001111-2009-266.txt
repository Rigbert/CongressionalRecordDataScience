 President, in a moment I will send a managers' package to the desk. We are waiting for one quick decision. Hopefully, in a moment, I will be sending a managers' package to the desk with a number ofamendments that have been worked out on both sides. We hope to adopt that package.  I know Members have been waiting to get to votes. We have several Senators who require votes on their amendments. We hope to start that fairly shortly, as soon as this package is adopted.  Amendments Nos. 1401; 1447; 1457; 1463, as Modified; 1456; 1454, as Modified; 1466, as Modified; 1465; and 1464, as Modified, to Amendment                                 No. 1373  So, Mr. President, I send to the desk a managers' package, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be considered, and modified, as indicated, where indicated, and agreed to en bloc; and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; that the consideration of these amendments appear separately in the Record, and any statements relating to their consideration be printed in the Record.
