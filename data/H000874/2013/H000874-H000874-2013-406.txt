 This night, we take a positive step, and the people watching us, Mr. Speaker, on television tonight and reading about their Congress tomorrow are seeing that we were able to act, not perfectly, but in a bipartisan fashion to try to take a step towards fiscal responsibility, fiscal stability, and, yes, caring for those who most need our help in this country.  I urge my colleagues, as the leader of my party in this Congress urged us, to support this legislation, not as a Democrat, not as a Republican, but as an American who understands that our people believe that action is necessary. And I would urge all of us as we close this debate to do so in a way that brings us together, not drives us apart; that reaches out to the best in us, not to the partisan in us.  Mr. Speaker, it is time for this Congress to come together, address this issue, act together, and pass this bill.
