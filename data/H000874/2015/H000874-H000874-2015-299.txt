Speaker, I rise to thank Allen King, a resident of Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, for his service to this House. He retired on June 30, 2015, after more than thirty years in various positions with the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer.  For the past twelve years, Allen has served as the Supervisor for the Central Receiving and Warehousing, Logistics, and Support Department. He began his career with the House with the Labor Department and Property Supply under the Clerk's office, and for many years he worked directly under Cosmo Quattrone and Tom Van Dyke in the Furnishings Department. Following a reorganization of the CAO, the Department was renamed Logistics and Support, where Allen worked with former Deputy CAO Walt Edwards and former Chief Logistics Officer Jerry Bennett.  Some of his most memorable experiences during his time working for the CAO include contributing to the setup for the Congressional Iran-Contra hearings in 1987 as well as the 2001 anthrax scare, when the House of Representatives had to convene in a temporary location. Allen and his team, along with other CAO staff, set up an alternate House chamber as well as temporary offices and provisions for Members and staff off campus.  One of Allen's favorite moments on the job occurred in 1981 when he witnessed a marching band performing through the halls of the Cannon House Office Building, in town for the Inauguration of President Ronald Reagan. Allen was also on hand to witness the lying-in-state of President Reagan's casket in the Capitol Rotunda years later.  In retirement, Allen intends to enjoy more fishing and visits with old friends and co-workers. I congratulate him on his years of service, and I wish him and his family all the best as Allen begins a new chapter in his life. I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Allen King for his distinguished service, contributions, and commitment to this House and to our country.                          ____________________
