There is a very critical change.  Mr. DeWINE. If I could reclaim my time, the problem is the colleague of the Senator just told me there was not much of a change at all, and this is the problem with the language: One of the Senators saying there is a change and the other saying there is not much change. That is ambiguous, which is the problem, with all due respect to both of my colleagues, who are great friends. It is the language; it is not the Senators.
