 President, there has been incredible prosperity that the vast majority of our country is benefiting from--and that prosperity was built on a combination of communication and computers. This technology has opened a whole new world for America. This new technology has driven our economic growth. And, the future lies with those who can master the tools of this new economic age.  It wasn't too long ago that it looked like our time in the sun was behind us.Behind us was the idea of prosperity in our country. But times have changed over the past few years. And we stand here today with the prospect of a new era of prosperity.  With flexible financial markets, a historic wave of entrepreneurial activity, and the convergence of new technologies from the personal computer to the Internet, we are transforming ourselves into what is now called the ``new economy.''  Look at the numbers: In recent years, Information Technology industries contributed 35% to Gross Domestic Product growth. The Information Technology sector is growing at twice the rate of the rest of the economy. And by 2006, more than half of the U.S. workforce will be employed by industries that are either major producers, or intensive users, of Information Technology.  A lot of what we do--manufacturing, shipping, marketing, are basically the same old functions. But we do virtually all of them in new and better ways thanks to the explosion of information technology. This has increased our productivity in ways that the best economists still don't completely understand.  But, there is one thing that we do understand: those who can master technology will be able to benefit from this great expansion--and that is why we are here today. So no one is left behind.  That is why today I am proud to be introducing legislation, aptly titled Kids 2000, that will be one step in our mission to provide all children with access to technology.  It is my hope, that through a public/private partnership, led by members of Congress and Steve and Jean Case, state-of-the-art computer centers will be placed in Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide. Located in largely under-served communities, Club computer centers will reach precisely the kids who need these resources the most. And none of these kids will be left behind.  One goal of Kids 2000 is to help close the digital divide by providing kids with computers, internet access, and fully comprehensive technical training. As the wonders of computers become increasingly evident and celebrated, certain segments of society still lack access to these resources. Some segments are not participating in this technological revolution that is sweeping across our country.  And the disparities are alarming. Look at the figures: Of households making over $75,000, 80% own computers and 60% use the Internet. Yet, for households making between $10,000-$15,000, only 16% own a computer and only 7% use the Internet.  And it's not just income levels. There are disparities amongst races, education levels and geography. In addition, at all income levels, households with two parents are far more likely than one-parent households to own computers and have Internet access.  The digital divide is also significant because the new digital economy can't run on computers alone. Businesses need workers with computer know-how and Internet literacy. Those who are not competent with the tools of technology will be left behind. Some of them are our kids. They are our responsibility and we cannot let this happen.  And we know what happens to our kids when they are left behind. Their opportunities are vastly reduced, there is despair, and even criminal behavior. But there is something that we can do. And we are here today to begin a significant effort to do just that--to close the digital divide.  Addressing the problems associated with the digital divide is not all this initiative seeks to do. Another goal is to reduce juvenile crime by providing kids with substantive after-school programs.  Everyone has heard me say this time and time again, but let me say this one more time--prevention works.  While kids are learning in these computer centers, they will be off the street and out of harm's way. They will be occupied with constructive activities. School dropout rates will be reduced because kids will realize that they have great potential. Kids 2000 is the ultimate after-school program.  That is precisely why I have asked the Boys and Girls Clubs to host my computer initiative. For decades, the Boys & Girls Clubs of America have provided young people all across the United States with the support and inspiration they need to make it in a world full of peer pressure and crime.  Kids 2000 also makes sense economically. It is estimated that allowing a single youth to drop out of high school and enter a life of drug abuse and crime costs society between $1.7 and $2.3 million. In comparison, Kids 2000 will cost the government a mere $40 per child.  Because I believe that there is a role for the private sector, I have asked my good friends Jean and Steve Case and PowerUp to be an integral part of this initiative. That means computers, America On-Line accounts, educational curriculum, and fully comprehensive technical training in Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide.  And PowerUp is not alone. 3-Com has committed to donating $1 million in networking equipment, MCI Worldcom will be donating educational software and training, American Airlines has agreed to donate free airline travel to train teachers, Ripple Effects Software will donate educational software, and Sabre Inc. will be donating computers.  I want to thank all the corporations that have stepped forward and I hope that there will be many more in the coming months. We can't do this project without the private sector's help.  I want to say thanks to Steve and Jean Case who have been in the forefront of this issue since the beginning and who are participating in this initiative in a very significant way. You know we could not do this without you and I appreciate your generosity and commitment to the cause.  This initiative has brought together so many integral sectors of society. Business, government, the non-profit world. Together, we can make this program a success. Together we can make a difference in the lives of kids and provide our children with the tools they need to live and learn in a world that has become so dependent on technology.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2061       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Kids 2000 Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) There is an increasing epidemic of juvenile crime      throughout the United States.       (2) It is well documented that the majority of juvenile      crimes take place during after-school hours.       (3) Knowledge of technology is becoming increasingly      necessary for children in school and out of school.       (4) The Boys and Girls Clubs of America have 2,300 clubs      throughout all 50 States, serving over 3,000,000 boys and      girls primarily from at-risk communities.       (5) The Boys and Girls Clubs of America have the physical      structures in place for immediate implementation of an after-     school technology program.       (6) Building technology centers and providing integrated      content and full-time staffing at those centers in the Boys      and Girls Clubs of America nationwide will help foster      education, job training, and an alternative to crime for at-     risk youth.       (7) Partnerships between the public sector and the private      sector are an effective way of providing after-school      technology programs in the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.       (8) PowerUp: Bridging the Digital Divide is an entity      comprised of more than a dozen nonprofit organizations, major      corporations, and Federal agencies that have joined together      to launch a major new initiative to help ensure that      America's underserved young people acquire the skills,      experiences, and resources they need to succeed in the      digital age.       (9) Bringing PowerUp into the Boys and Girls Clubs of      America will be an effective way to ensure that our youth      have a safe, crime-free environment in which to learn the      technological skills they need to close the divide between      young people who have access to computer-based information      and technology-related skills and those who do not.

A bill to amend chapter 4 of title 39, United States Code, to allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for organ and tissue donation awareness through the voluntary purchase of certain specially issued United States postage stamps; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.       ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION AWARENESS ``SEMI-POSTAL'' STAMP  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to introduce legislation that would authorize the issuance of the organ and tissue donation awareness ``semi-postal'' stamp. With 67,000 people on the organ donation waiting list, we have no time to lose in educating the public about the importance of life-giving organ and tissue donations.  In August 1998, as a result of strong public and congressional interest, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 32-cent organ and tissue donation commemorative stamp. But, just five months later, the postal rate increased to 33-cents. To use the stamp, that meant purchasers would have to buy an additional one-cent stamp to make up the postage difference. Yet, despite this hassle, more than 47 million of the 50 million stamps originally printed have been purchased, demonstrating the strong demand for an organ and tissue donation awareness postage stamp.  Since the U.S. Postal Service does not re-issue commemorative stamps, we are seeking authorization for a ``semi-postal'' stamp. This stamp would sell for up to 25 percent above the value of a first-class stamp, regardless of the price of the first-class stamp, itself. The surplus revenues would be directed to programs that increase organ and tissue donation awareness. The decision to donate an organ or tissue is a life-saving one. However, it is frequently one that family members and loved ones fail to communicate to one another. Every effort we make to remind people that this is a decision that should be communicated before a tragedy strikes is an effort toward saving lives. Whether it is an organ and tissue donation postage stamp or a box that drivers can mark as they renew their drivers' licenses, they are steps that raise awareness of the importance of communicating to family and friends the decision to become an organ or tissue donor.  I would like to thank my colleague, Senator Durbin, for joining me in introducing this legislation, and Senators Abraham, Baucus, Cleland, Dodd, and Levin for their co-sponsorship. I have appreciated their support for this bill and for their tremendous work on behalf of organ and tissue donation awareness. I would also like to thank a number of organ and tissue donation groups who support this legislation--the Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP); the National Kidney Foundation (NKF); the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS); Transplant Recipients International Organization, Inc. (TRIO); the Coalition on Donation; Hadassah; the Eye Bank Association of America; the American Society of Transplantation; the American Society of Transplant Surgeons; LifeBanc; and the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations.  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important legislation. Time is of the essence. The waiting list for organs includes 67,000 people, with a new name added to that list every 16 minutes. Moreover, ten to twelve people die every day waiting for an organ to become available. There is simply no time to lose. Every effort we make to increase, and in this case help generate, funds for organ and tissue donation awareness will help to save someone's life.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2062       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
