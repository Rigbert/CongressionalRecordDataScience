 President, I will proceed on my leader time.  As we all know, the war on terror did not end last month when American forces shot and killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad.  General Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, wrote to me yesterday to explain that this is a moment of elevated threat to our country and that the intelligence community isworking to analyze the information gained at the Bin Laden compound. Al-Qaida and its associate groups remain a threat to the United States.  And our intelligence community, military and law enforcement professionals still need the tools that enable them to gather and share intelligence in this fight.  That is why all Americans should be reassured today in knowing that these dedicated men and women will continue to have those tools. I have no doubt that the 4-year PATRIOT Act extension that Members of both parties have agreed to will safeguard us from future attacks, and that everything we agreed to in this extension is necessary for this fight.  As FBI Director Bob Mueller has said, all the authorities it contains are critical. Every one requires the prior approval of an independent Federal judge. Nothing in this extension has ever been found to be unconstitutional. And most of these authorities have not even been challenged in court--ever.
