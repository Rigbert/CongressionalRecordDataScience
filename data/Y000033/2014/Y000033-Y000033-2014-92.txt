I thank the chairman. I look forward to working on this issue further, and I also want to extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble), the only former coastguardsman now serving in Congress.  To find a finer gentleman and colleague than Mr. Coble would be difficult, indeed. We will miss you, Howard, so please stay in touch.
