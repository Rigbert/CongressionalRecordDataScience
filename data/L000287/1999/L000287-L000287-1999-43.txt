Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wolf), the chairman, and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), the ranking member, for their good work on this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2084.  Metropolitan Atlanta is facing a crisis. Declining air quality and bumper to bumper traffic are clouding Atlanta's future.  The people who bear the heaviest burden of air pollution--poor people, the elderly, and children--are those who most need our protection. As we speak, Atlanta's hospitals are bracing for a rush of respiratory emergencies as this season's ozone season approaches.  Traffic in and around Atlanta is so congested that the term ``quick commute'' has become an oxymoron. Parents spend more time in traffic than attending little league games and PTA meetings. Atlantans now rank traffic, public transportation and air pollution alongside education and crime as their top concerns.  More roads will not solve Atlanta's problem. In fact, more roads are not an option. Federal funding cannot be used for road construction because Georgia has not filed the State Improvement Plan required by the Clean Air Act.  The best way to improve this situation and the quality of life for my constituents is to expand the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority system.  MARTA's Board has identified the western light rail extension as the most cost effective addition to the system. The project would reduce congestion and air pollution, and improve access to educational and employment resources--linking thousands of students to Georgia Tech University and workers to Fulton County Industrial Park.  While I realize the severe constraints we face in making responsible decisions about spending our transportation tax dollars, one million dollars dedicated to studying the MARTA west side extension is a sound and responsible investment.
