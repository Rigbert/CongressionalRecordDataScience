  Madam President, 100 days ago, Justice Kennedy announced his retirement from the Supreme Court. Shortly thereafter, on July 9, the President announced the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as the newest Justice.  Judge Kavanaugh has spent 25 years of his career in public service. He spent the last 12 years on the DC Circuit--considered the second most important Federal court in the country. His record there has been extremely impressive because the Supreme Court adopted a position advanced in Judge Kavanaugh's opinions no fewer than a dozen times.  Judge Kavanaugh is also a pillar of his community and in the legal profession. He serves underprivileged communities, coaches girls' basketball, and is a lector at his church. He has shown a deep commitment to preparing young lawyers for their careers. He has been a law professor at three prestigious law schools and a mentor to dozens of judicial law clerks.  This should have been a respectable and dignified confirmation process. In a previous era, this highly qualified nominee would have received unanimous support in the Senate. Before leftwing, outside groups and Democratic leaders had him in their sights, Judge Kavanaugh possessed an impeccable reputation and was held in high esteem by the bench and the bar alike. Even the American Bar Association, which the Democrats say is their gold standard for judges, gave him its unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating.  What leftwing groups and their Democratic allies have done to Judge Kavanaugh is nothing short of monstrous. I saw what they did to Robert Bork. I saw what they did to Clarence Thomas. That was nothing compared to what we have witnessed in the last 3 months.
