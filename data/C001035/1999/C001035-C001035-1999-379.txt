President.  I begin by expressing my appreciation to Senator Nickles and my other colleagues on the health task force. We have labored hard during the past year and a half, and I am very proud of the legislation we introduced.  I also thank our staff, particularly Priscilla Hanley on my staff who has worked night and day during the debate.  We are on the verge of passing landmark legislation that will expand access to health care, that will hold HMOs accountable for providing the care that they have promised, and that will improve the quality of health care in this country.  I am particularly pleased that the final bill contains provisions I offered to provide a tax deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance, to ensure that women have direct access to OB/GYNs without having to go through a gatekeeper, to guarantee that a terminally ill patient is able to keep his or her doctor even if that doctor has left the HMO network, and to expand patient access to a variety of health care providers.  At the heart of this bill is the internal and external appeals process that will provide coverage and protections to everyone in all employer-sponsored health plans. This appeals process will ensure that consumers receive the care they have been promised up front, before harm is done, and without having to hire an expensive lawyer and resort to a lawsuit in order to get the care they need.  That is the heart of this bill. We have worked hard to provide these kinds of protections which will ensure that people do get the treatment they need when they need it--not damages years later in a courtroom.  I thank the assistant majority leader for the time.  I am proud to be a supporter of this important legislation.
