 More than 1,200 students from across the United States will visit Washington, DC to take part in the national finals of We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution, the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. The We the People program run by the Center for Civic Education, with the help of Federal funding, provides an outstanding curriculum that promotes civic competence and responsibility among elementary and secondary students.  I am proud to announce that the students from Iowa City West High School, through their knowledge of the U.S. Constitution, won the State competition and thus were given the distinction of representing Iowa in the national finals.  While in Washington, the students will participate in a three-day academic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which they ``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of constitutional principles and have opportunities to evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. In the end, students take away a solid understanding of the origin of American constitutional democracy as well as the contemporary relevance of our founding documents and ideals. In short, it produces better citizens.  I would like to personally recognize the Iowa City West students who are on the team that will represent Iowa in the national finals, Guo Chen, Jinny Guo, Yelena Shabelnik, John Alatalo, Cole Anderson, Bennett Mueller, Rebecca Wen, Elizabeth Wang, Evan Davis, Eleanor Marshall, Margaret Shultz, Katherine Yang, Trevor Clinkenbeard, Mark Mellecker, Brad Ockenfels, Ray Ockenfels, Nik Hlebotwitsh, Sara McAndrew, Jessica Sheldon, Asya Bergal, Joe Henderson, Hilah Kohen, Jacob Larson, Elizabeth Vandenberg, and teacher Gary Neuzil.  I wish these students the best of luck at the We the People national finals and applaud their outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
