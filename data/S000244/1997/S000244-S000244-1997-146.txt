Speaker, today we are introducing a bill to clarify the interpretation of language contained in the Florence Agreement, a multilateral international agreement regarding the importation of educational, scientific, and cultural materials. Signed by the United States it allows for the duty-free importation of scientific apparatus into the United States, if used by U.S. approved institutions for educational, scientific, and cultural purposes.  As nations tighten their research budgets, international scientific collaborations involving many nations are becoming more common. Therefore, it is crucial the United States promulgate the same tariff treatment for the importation of component parts of large scientific instruments, as for the scientific instruments themselves. The need for this legislation was demonstrated last year by the difficulties experienced in the Gemini International Telescope project. The U.S. Customs Service narrowly defined the words ``scientific instruments or apparatus'' not to include ``components'' of these instruments.  The Gemini project involved two large telescopes under construction in Hawaii and Chile. The project was managed by the Association of Universities in Astronomy [AURA], and involved the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. The telescopes contained several components, including an 8-meter mirror manufactured in the United States. The mirrors were shipped to France for polishing before being returned to Hawaii and Chile for final assembly. The U.S. Customs Service initially contended that the mirror was a component, along with the other large components is not eligible for the same tariff free status as the instrument. Chile, however, was not charging duties on the components destined for there. The 104th  Congress had to pass specific legislation to provide tariff relief for the Gemini project.  The prevent future problems, this bill addresses the difficulties encountered through the interpretation of the words ``instruments or apparatus'' by the U.S. Customs Service. It states that separable components shall be included under the definition of instruments or apparatus, and that therefore they shall be eligible for the same tariff treatment under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. This bill will ensure that the United States fulfills the Florence Agreement's intent of furthering the exchange of ideas, knowledge, and information through the interchange of scientific instruments and apparatus.                          ____________________
