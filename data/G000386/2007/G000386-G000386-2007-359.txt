 By 2011, the tax will affect all farms and businesses worth more than $1 million at a tax rate as high as 55 percent. In the State of Iowa alone, according to the USDA, we have more than 20,000 farms worth more then $1 million. Those families may be land rich, but they are cash poor, and they have to spend too much money today to plan on how to survive the unfair death tax. These are not big farms. With land prices today, you can have as few as 350 acres in Iowa to have a million dollars in value.  If the Senate fails to put money in the budget today and we leave the death tax in place in its punitive form, our failure to amend this budget will create the economic uncertainty that could dismantle our farms and small businesses in rural America. I will be voting ``yes'' on the Kyl amendment. It puts money in the budget. It is the responsible thing to do.
