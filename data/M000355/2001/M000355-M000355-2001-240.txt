 I understand the Senator from Ohio is not interested in a time agreement at this point but to have the vote in the morning.  In the meantime, I say to my colleague from Connecticut and others, with regard to any amendment that might be offered to reduce the opposition of the AFL-CIO to the bill by massaging the coordination language, we would like to see that when it is ready. That is the amendment I have been predicting for a week and a half, that there would be at some point an effort to water down the coordination language in the underlying McCain-Feingold bill in order to placate the AFL-CIO. We are anxious to see that language. I am sure it will pass, once offered, but we are anxious to take a look and make sure all Members of the Senate are aware of the substance of it.  It looks as though I may have fewer amendments to deal with than Senator Dodd. I suspect the sooner we shut up, the Senator from Ohio can continue his discussion of his amendment.
