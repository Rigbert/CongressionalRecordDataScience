Speaker, last week I came to the floor and recommended that the Obama administration appoint a special envoy with a very broad portfolio: dispatched to work on a diplomatic solution to the tragedy that is destroying Syria and unfolding in the Middle East, now having broad impact in greater Europe.  I want to point out to those who are listening that the displacement crisis in the Middle East, centered in Syria, has consumed seven nations and propelled the largest refugee crisis Europe has faced since World War II. Already in Syria, over a quarter of a million people have been killed--civilians--and that is probably a low number.  With over 12 million people displaced, Europe is being besieged by hundreds of thousands, legions, of the dispossessed. Meanwhile, it almost seems surreal that no effective diplomatic negotiation is underway that holds the prospect of leading to peace.  I again ask the Obama administration to dispatch a special envoy with a broad portfolio to work full time on a diplomatic solution to the tragedy that is destroying Syria.  Then yesterday in The New York Times appeared an editorial by the legendary 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, entitled ``A Plan to End the Syrian Crisis.'' I served President Carter during his years in the Presidency.  I well remember the incredible moment in 1979 when President Carter stood with Anwar Sadat, the President of Egypt, and the Prime Minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, and they signed that treaty in March of 1979. Who would have ever thought that that moment in history would have been possible? Yet, until today, that treaty holds between Egypt and Israel, and it has made a gigantic difference in the saving of lives in that extremely troubled region.  In his editorial to The New York Times, President Carter references that the Carter Center--which he founded and to which he has dedicated his life with his wife Rosalyn ever since his service as President--has been deeply involved in Syria since the early 1980s. Who would know more than he?  He recommends the only real chance of ending the conflict is to engage the United States, Russia, Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia in preparing a comprehensive peace protocol with Syria. He knows what that requires. He recommends a cease-fire, formation of a unity government, constitutional reforms, and elections.  Mr. Speaker, I include for today's Record the editorial entitled ``A Plan to End the Syrian Crisis.''  I say to my colleagues and to those who are listening: As we watch this tragedy unfold, our Nation is the most powerful nation in the world. Surely, we should have the wisdom and the will to take this latest tragedy, which we had no small part in precipitating, and find a way to bring the parties to the table.  What is happening in Syria due to the lack of a diplomatic solution is now impacting Europe in ways that we have not seen since World War II. It is very destabilizing.  With what is happening inside Ukraine today due to Russia's invasion, with over 1.7 million displaced persons internally, if Russia would happen to turn the tourniquet tighter in eastern Ukraine and cause additional displacement across Europe, imagine what the winter months would bring.  I can't urge in strong enough terms that the Obama administration pay heed to President Carter's very lucid editorial in yesterday's New York Times. I commend all Members and citizens to read it.                [From the New York Times, Oct. 26, 2015]                    A Plan To End the Syrian Crisis                           (By Jimmy Carter)       I have known Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria, since      he was a college student in London, and have spent many hours      negotiating with him since he has been in office. This has      often been at the request of the United States government      during those many times when our ambassadors have been      withdrawn from Damascus because of diplomatic disputes.       Bashar and his father, Hafez, had a policy of not speaking      to anyone at the American Embassy during those periods of      estrangement, but they would talk to me. I noticed that      Bashar never referred to a subordinate for advice or      information. His most persistent characteristic was      stubbornness; it was almost psychologically impossible for      him to change his mind--and certainly not when under      pressure.       Before the revolution began in March 2011, Syria set a good      example of harmonious relations among its many different      ethnic and religious groups, including Arabs, Kurds, Greeks,      Armenians and Assyrians who were Christians, Jews, Sunnis,      Alawites and Shiites. The Assad family had ruled the country      since 1970, and was very proud of this relative harmony among      these diverse groups.       When protesters in Syria demanded long overdue reforms in      the political system, President Assad saw this as an illegal      revolutionary effort to overthrow his ``legitimate'' regime      and erroneously decided to stamp it out by using unnecessary      force. Because of many complex reasons, he was supported by      his military forces, most Christians, Jews, Shiite Muslims,      Alawites and others who feared a takeover by radical Sunni      Muslims. The prospect for his overthrow was remote.       The Carter Center had been deeply involved in Syria since      the early 1980s, and we shared our insights with top      officials in Washington, seeking to preserve an opportunity      for a political solution to the rapidly growing conflict.      Despite our persistent but confidential protests, the early      American position was that the first step in resolving the      dispute had to be the removal of Mr. Assad from office. Those      who knew him saw this as a fruitless demand, but it has been      maintained for more than four years. In effect, our      prerequisite for peace efforts has been an impossibility.       Kofi Annan, the former United Nations secretary general,      and Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister,      tried to end the conflict as special representatives of the      United Nations, but abandoned the effort as fruitless because      of incompatibilities among America, Russia and other nations      regarding the status of Mr. Assad during a peace process.       In May 2015, a group of global leaders known as the Elders      visited Moscow, where we had detailed discussions with the      American ambassador, former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,      former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, Foreign Minister      Sergey V. Lavrov and representatives of international think      tanks, including the Moscow branch of the Carnegie Center.       They pointed out the longstanding partnership between      Russia and the Assad regime and the great threat of the      Islamic State to Russia, where an estimated 14 percent of its      population are Sunni Muslims. Later, I questioned President      Putin about his support for Mr. Assad, and about his two      sessions that year with representatives of factions from      Syria. He replied that little progress had been made, and he      thought that the only real chance of ending the conflict was      for the United States and Russia to be joined by Iran, Turkey      and Saudi Arabia in preparing a comprehensive peace proposal.      He believed that all factions in Syria, except the Islamic      State, would accept almost any plan endorsed strongly by      these five, with Iran and Russia supporting Mr. Assad and the      other three backing the opposition. With his approval, I      relayed this suggestion to Washington.       For the past three years, the Carter Center has been      working with Syrians across political divides, armed      opposition group leaders and diplomats from the United      Nations and Europe to find a political path for ending the      conflict. This effort has been based on data-driven research      about the Syrian catastrophe that the center has conducted,      which reveals the location of different factions and clearly      shows that neither side in Syria can prevail militarily.       The recent decision by Russia to support the Assad regime      with airstrikes and other military forces has intensified the      fighting, raised the level of armaments and may increase the      flow of refugees to neighboring countries and Europe. At the      same time, it has helped to clarify the choice between a      political process in which the Assad regime     assumes a role and more war in which the Islamic State      becomes an even greater threat to world peace. With these      clear alternatives, the five nations mentioned above could      formulate a unanimous proposal. Unfortunately, differences      among them persist.       Iran outlined a general four-point sequence several months      ago, consisting of a cease-fire, formation of a unity      government, constitutional reforms and elections. Working      through the United Nations Security Council and utilizing a      five-nation proposal, some mechanism could be found to      implement these goals.       The involvement of Russia and Iran is essential. Mr.      Assad's only concession in four years of war was giving up      chemical weapons, and he did so only under pressure from      Russia and Iran. Similarly, he will not end the war by      accepting concessions imposed by the West, but is likely to      do so if urged by his allies.       Mr. Assad's governing authority could then be ended in an      orderly process, an acceptable government established in      Syria, and a concerted effort could then be made to stamp out      the threat of the Islamic State.       The needed concessions are not from the combatants in      Syria, but from the proud nations that claim to want peace      but refuse to cooperate with one another.                          ____________________
