 President, on Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the Iraq-Afghanistan supplemental. The chairman and ranking member will be here, and we will begin the amending process Monday afternoon. As I announced earlier today, the next rollcall vote will occur at 5:30 Monday afternoon on a district judge, the one we announced a few moments ago. Other votes are possible around that 5:30 time in relation to the supplemental bill.  I say to all of our colleagues, this will be a busy week. This is a big, important piece of legislation. We hope to finish it next week. But in any event, whether we finish it then or not, we are going to have a busy week, with lots of votes throughout the entire week, including the likelihood of night sessions.                          ____________________[Page S3364]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
