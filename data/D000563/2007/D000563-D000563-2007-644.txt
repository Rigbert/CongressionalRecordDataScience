President, we should all be so fortunate as to live a worthy life and at the moment of our passing have a person with the talent of Bill Moyers memorialize our time on Earth. On Saturday, Bill Moyers, the PBS journalist who served as special assistant to President Lyndon Johnson from 1963 to 1978, delivered a eulogy at Lady Bird Johnson's funeral service Saturday. He read from a text which I will now have printed in the Record.  I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From statesman.com, July 15, 2007]               Bill Moyers's Eulogy for Lady Bird Johnson       Bill Moyers, the PBS journalist who served as special      assistant to President Lyndon Johnson from 1963 to 1967,      delivered a eulogy at Lady Bird Johnson's funeral service      Saturday. He read from this text:       It is unthinkable to me that Lady Bird is gone.       She was so much a part of the landscape, so much a part of      our lives and our times, so much a part of our country for so      long that I began to imagine her with us always. Now,      although the fields of purple, orange, and blue will long      evoke her gifts to us, that vibrant presence has departed,      and we are left to mourn our loss of her even as we celebrate      her life.       Some people arriving earlier today were asked, ``Are you      sitting with the family?'' I looked around at this throng and      said to myself, ``Everyone here is sitting with the family.      That's how she would treat us.'' All of us.       When I arrived in Washington in 1954, to work in the LBJ      mailroom between my sophomore and junior years, I didn't know      a single person in town--not even the Johnsons, whom I only      met that first week. She soon recognized the weekends were      especially lonesome for me, and she called one day to ask me      over for Sunday brunch.       I had never even heard of Sunday brunch, must less been to      one; for all I knew, it was an Episcopalian sacrament. When I      arrived at 30th Place the family was there--the little girls,      Lady Bird and himself. But so were Richard Russell and Sam      Rayburn and J. Edgar Hoover--didn't look like Episcopal      priests to me. They were sitting around the smallish room      reading the newspaper--except for LBJ, who was on the phone.      If this is their idea of a sacrament, I thought, I'll just      stay a Baptist. But Mrs. Johnson knew something about the      bachelors she had invited there, including the kid fresh up      from her native East Texas. On a Sunday morning they needed a      family, and she had offered us communion at her table. In a      way, it was a sacrament.       It was also very good politics. She told me something that      summer that would make a difference in my life. She was shy,      and in the presence of powerful men, she usually kept her      counsel. Sensing that I was shy, too, and aware I had no      experience to enforce any opinions, she said: Don't worry. If      you are unsure of what to say, just ask questions, and I      promise you that when they leave, they will think you were      the smartest one in the     room, just for listening to them. Word will get around, she      said.       She knew the ways of the world, and how they could be made      to work for you, even when you didn't fully understand what      was going on. She told me once, years later, that she didn't      even understand everything about the man she married--nor did      she want to, she said, as long as he needed her.       Oh, he needed her, alright. You know the famous incident.      Once, trying to locate her in a crowded room, he growled      aloud: ``Where's Lady Bird?'' And she replied: ``Right behind      you, darling, where I've always been.''       ``Whoever loves, believes the impossible,'' Elizabeth      Browning wrote. Lady Bird truly loved this man she often      found impossible. ``I'm no more bewildered by Lyndon than he      is bewildered by himself,'' she once told me.       Like everyone he loved, she often found herself in the path      of his Vesuvian eruptions. During the campaign of 1960 I      slept in the bed in their basement when we returned from the      road for sessions of the Senate. She knew I was lonesome for      Judith and our six-month-old son who were back in Texas. She      would often come down the two flights of stairs to ask if I      was doing alright. One night the Senator and I got home even      later than usual. And he brought with him an unresolved      dispute from the Senate cloakroom. At midnight I could still      hear him upstairs, carrying on as if he were about to purge      the Democratic caucus. Pretty soon I heard her footsteps on      the stairs and I called out: ``Mrs. Johnson, you don't need      to check up on me. I'm alright.'' And she called back,      ``Well, I was coming down to tell you I'm alright, too.''       She seemed to grow calmer as the world around her became      more furious.       Thunderstorms struck in her life so often, you had to      wonder why the Gods on Olympus kept testing her.       She lost her mother in an accident when she was five. She      was two cars behind JFK in Dallas. She was in the White House      when Martin Luther King was shot and Washington burned. She      grieved for the family of Robert Kennedy, and for the lives      lost in Vietnam.       Early in the White House, a well-meaning editor up from      Texas said, ``You poor thing, having to follow Jackie      Kennedy.'' Mrs. Johnson's mouth dropped open, in amazed      disbelief. And she said, ``Oh, no, don't pity for me. Weep      for Mrs. Kennedy. She lost her husband. I still have my      Lyndon.''       She aimed for the consolation and comfort of others. It was      not only her talent at negotiating the civil war waged in his      nature. It was not just the way she remained unconscripted by      the factions into which family, friends, and advisers      inevitably divide around a powerful figure. She kept open all      the roads to reconciliation.       Like her beloved flowers in the field, she was a woman of      many hues. A strong manager, a canny investor, a shrewd judge      of people, friend and foe--and she never confused the two.      Deliberate in coming to judgment, she was sure in conclusion.       But let me speak especially of the one quality that most      captured my admiration and affection, her courage.       It is the fall of 1960. We're in Dallas, where neither      Kennedy nor Johnson are local heroes. We start across the      street from the Adolphus to the Baker Hotel. The reactionary      congressman from Dallas has organized a demonstration of      women--pretty women, in costumes of red, white, and blue,      waving little American flags above their cowboy hats. At      first I take them to be cheerleaders having a good time. But      suddenly they are an angry mob, snarling, salivating,      spitting.       A roar--a primal terrifying roar swells around us--my first      experience with collective hate roused to a fever pitch. I'm      right behind the Johnsons. She's taken his arm and as she      turns left and right, nodding to the mob, I can see she is      smiling. And I see in the eyes of some of those women a      confusion--what I take to be the realization that this is      them at their most uncivil, confronting a woman who is the      triumph of civility. So help me, her very demeanor creates a      small zone of grace in the midst of that tumultuous throng.      And they move back a little, and again a little, Mrs. Johnson      continuing to nod and smile, until we're inside the Baker and      upstairs in the suite.       Now LBJ is smiling--he knows that Texas was up for grabs      until this moment, and the backlash will decide it for us.      But Mrs. Johnson has pulled back the curtains and is looking      down that street as the mob disperses. She has seen a dark      and disturbing omen. Still holding the curtain back, as if      she were peering into the future, she says, ``Things will      never be the same again.''       Now it is 1964. The disinherited descendants of slavery,      still denied their rights as citizens after a century of      segregation, have resolved to claim for themselves the      American promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of      happiness. President Johnson has thrown the full power of his      office to their side, and he has just signed the Civil Rights      Act of 1964--the greatest single sword of justice raised for      equality since the Emancipation Proclamation. A few weeks      later, both Johnsons plunge into his campaign for election in      his own right. He has more or less given up on the South,      after that legislation, but she will not. These were her      people, here were her roots. And she is not ready to sever      them. So she sets out on a whistle stop journey of nearly      seventeen hundred miles through the heart of her past. She is      on her own now--campaigning independently--across the Mason-     Dixon line down the buckle of the Bible Belt all the way down      to New Orleans. I cannot all these years later do justice to      what she faced: The boos, the jeers, the hecklers, the crude      signs and cruder gestures, the insults and the threats. This      is the land still ruled by Jim Crow and John Birch, who      controls the law with the cross and club to enforce it. 1964,      and bathroom signs still read: ``White Ladies'' and Colored      Women.''       In Richmond, she is greeted with signs that read: ``Fly      away, Lady Bird.'' In Charleston, ``Blackbird Go Home.''      Children planted in front rows hold up signs: ``Johnson is a      Nigger Lover.'' In Savannah they curse her daughter. The air      has become so menacing we run a separate engine fifteen      minutes ahead of her in case of a bomb; she later said,      ``People were concerned for me, but the engineer in the train      ahead of us was in far greater danger.'' Rumors spread of      snipers, and in the Panhandle of Florida the threats are so      ominous the FBI orders a yard-by-yard sweep of a seven-mile      bridge that her train would cross.       She never flinches. Up to forty times a day from the      platform of the caboose she will speak, sometimes raising a      single white-gloved hand to punctuate her words--always the      lady. When the insults grew so raucous in South Carolina, she      tells the crowd the ugly words were coming ``not from the      good people of South Carolina but from the state of      confusion.'' In Columbia she answers hecklers with what one      observer called ``a maternal bark.'' And she says, ``This is      a country of many viewpoints. I respect your right to express      your own. Now is my turn to express mine.''       An advance man called me back at the White House from the      pay phone at a local train depot. He was choking back the      tears. ``As long as I live,'' he said, in a voice breaking      with emotion, ``I will thank God I was here today, so that I      can tell my children the difference courage makes.''       Yes, she planted flowers, and wanted and worked for      highways and parks and vistas that opened us to the      technicolor splendors of our world. Walk this weekend among      the paths and trails and flowers and see the beauty she      loved. But as you do, remember--she also loved democracy, and      saw a beauty in it--rough though the ground may be, hard and      stony, as tangled and as threatened with blight as nature      itself. And remember that this shy little girl from Karnack,      Texas--with eyes as wistful as cypress and manners as soft as      the whispering pine--grew up to show us how to cultivate the      beauty in democracy: The voice raised against the mob. . .      the courage to overcome fear with convictions as true as      steel.       Claudia Alta Taylor--Lady Bird Johnson--served the beauty      in nature and the beauty in us--and right down to the end of      her long and bountiful life, she inspired us to serve them,      too.
