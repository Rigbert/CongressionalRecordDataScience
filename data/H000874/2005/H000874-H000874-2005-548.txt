I think all Members will want to make sure that that time frame in which it will be considered, they will be available to be on the floor or be watching the floor debate with the ability to come to the floor to offer their thoughts. I thank the gentleman for that information.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, I want to reemphasize, we are trying to work out with your side as lengthy a debate as necessary to have a full and important debate. Even though we would discourage any amendments to this very important issue, we would want to have opportunities for every Member to participate in the debate. So we would work out with your side enough time so that we can thoroughly debate this issue.
