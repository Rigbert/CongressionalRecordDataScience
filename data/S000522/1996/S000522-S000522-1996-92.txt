Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me the time.  Let me just begin by expressing my very sincere thanks for the great job that Chairman Ben Gilman did in sheparding this legislation through the Congress, through both Houses, through a very difficult markup in full committee, the divisive floor fight that we had. Regrettably it was divisive, and then a very difficult conference, and now we are trying to deal with an override attempt, and hopefully that will succeed. He did a very good job. He was very fair, and this legislation, Ithink, is a very reasonable piece of legislation that merits the support of my colleagues.  Mr. Speaker, when President Clinton vetoed H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1996 and 1997, he gave a number of reasons. He said that we were spending too little. He said it was somehow inappropriate for Congress to require the executive branch to consolidate Federal agencies even though the legislation mirrored Secretary Christopher's consolidation proposal. As a matter of fact, it was even less, far less than what actually Secretary Christopher wanted us to do. You might call it ``Christopher light'' in that regard. It would only consolidate and get rid of one agency rather than three.
