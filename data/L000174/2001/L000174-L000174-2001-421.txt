President, the Solicitor General fills a unique position in our Government. The Solicitor General is not merely another legal advocate whose mission is to advance the narrow interests of a client, or merely another advocate of his President's policies. The Solicitor General is much morethan that. The Solicitor General must use his or her legal skills and judgment for higher purposes on behalf of the law and the rights of all the people of the United States.  At his hearing, Mr. Olson acknowledged that:       The Solicitor General holds a unique position in our      Government in that he has important responsibilities to all      three branches of our Government. . . . And he is considered      an officer of the Supreme Court in that he regularly and with      scrupulous honesty must present to the Court arguments that      are carefully considered and mindful of the Court's role,      duty, and limited resources. As the most consistent advocate      before the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General and the      lawyers in that office have a special obligation to inform      the Court honestly and openly. The Solicitor General must be      an advocate, but he must take special care that the positions      he advances before the Court are fairly presented. As      Professor Drew Days said to this committee during his      confirmation hearing 8 years ago, the Solicitor General has a      duty towards the Supreme Court of ``absolute candor and fair      dealing.''  Republicans and Democrats have carefully reviewed nominations to the position of Solicitor General to ensure the highest levels of independence and integrity, as well as legal skills. Indeed, the Solicitor General is the only government official who must be, according to the statute, ``learned in the law.'' The Solicitor General must argue with intellectual honesty before the Supreme Court and represent the interests of the Government and the American people for the long term, and not just with an eye to short-term political gain. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent article by Professor Lincoln Caplan on the role of the Solicitor General.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, May 18, 2001]                The President's Lawyer, and the Court's                          (By Lincoln Caplan)       New Haven.--The job of solicitor general is one of the most      eminent in American law. Part advocate, the S. G. as he is      called, represents the United States before the Supreme      Court, where the federal government is involved in about two-     thirds of all cases decided on the merits (as opposed to      procedural grounds). Part judge, he chooses when the      government should appeal a case it has lost in a lower court,      file a friend-of-the-court brief, or defend an act of      Congress. Most S.G.'s have influenced rulings in landmark      cases; many have become judges; four have risen to the      Supreme Court. Yet for most of this tiny office's history      since it was created in 1870, the S.G. drew little public or      even scholarly attention.       Today, however, the nomination of Theodore Olson to be S.G.      is headline news, as is evident from the attention to the      Senate Judiciary Committee's 9-9 vote on it yesterday, a      split along party lines. In the past 40 years, the courts      have become forums for resolving social questions, and the      docket of the Supreme Court has become defined by the most      divisive issues. During the past 15 years, especially, as the      line between law and politics has been increasingly hard to      draw, the choice of a solicitor general has become more      important politically than that of any legal figure except      for the attorney general or a Supreme Court justice.       The choice of Mr. Olson makes this point sensationally      because his legal accomplishments are so marked by ideology.      As a young Justice Department official under Ronald Reagan,      he made his name as an adamant defender against Democrats in      Congress who were trying to probe a Republican environmental      scandal. He has litigated matters like a major anti-     affirmative-action case in Texas, brought by conservative      activists to overturn liberal precedents. He has served on      the board of the conservative American Spectator magazine,      for which he wrote biting, anonymous criticism of Bill and      Hillary Clinton. He has helped lead the Federal Society, a      conservative legal organization that is now a formidable      force in the Bush Administration. Most significantly, he was      the winning attorney in the Supreme Court case of Bush v.      Gore. During Mr. Olson's Senate confirmation hearing, Richard      Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said to him, ``I can't find any      parallel in history of anyone who was as actively involved in      politics as you and went on to become solicitor general.''       For the S.G.'s office, the Olson nomination frames a debate      that was sparked during the Reagan years and remains      undecided.       The traditional view holds that the solicitor general has a      unique role in American law and functions as ``the 10th      justice.'' Justice Lewis Powell, for example, argued that the      S.G. has a ``dual responsibility''--to represent the      president's administration but also to help the Supreme Court      develop the law in ways that serve the long-term interests of      the United States. (To some experts, the S.G.'s duty to      defend federal statutes amounts to a third responsibility, to      Congress.) Rex Lee, the first solicitor general in the Reagan      administration, was an unequivocal conservative. Yet he was      forced to quit by colleagues who thought he was too      restrained in his advocacy of the president's social agenda.      Famously, he said that it would have been wrong for him to      ``press the administration's policies at every turn and      announce true conservative principles through the pages of my      briefs.'' He was, he stated, ``the solicitor general, not      the pamphleteer general.''       A more recent view is that the S. G. should act as a      partisan advocate for policies of the president, not as the      legal conscience of the government. Rather than defending a      position of independence within the administration, Mr. Lee's      successor, Charles Fried, told the Senate that ``it would be      peevish and inappropriate for the solicitor general to be      anything but cheerful'' while supporting the views and      interests of the president who appointed him.       The latter outlook is much easier to defend. The separation      of powers among the three branches of government makes it      simplest to regard the solicitor general as a spokesman for      the executive branch: the concept of a dual responsibility      (or a triple one) confounds the notion of checks and      balances.       Yet for decades the former outlook prevailed, and it is      supported in the only official statement about the S. G.'s      role, issued in 1977 by the Justice Department. The Supreme      Court has bestowed on the solicitor general a special      status--seeking the S. G.'s advice in many cases where the      government isn't even a party. And the S. G. has reciprocated      by fulfilling a special role in court. If a private lawyer      wins a case he thinks he should have lost, he accepts his      victory in judicious silence. But when the solicitor general      prevails on grounds that he considers unjust (for example,      when evidence supporting a criminal verdict is slight), he      may ``confess error'' and recommend that the Supreme Court      overturn the decision. To Archibald Cox, one of the country's      admired S. G.'s, surrendering victory in some cases helps      justify the reliance that the Supreme Court places on the      solicitor general: this practice demonstrates that the      solicitor general's approach to arguing the government      position is likely to be developed with the nation's long-     term interests in mind.       Both views of the role require candor in the S. G. That's      why last week the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed its      vote on Mr. Olson after reports surfaced that he had given      misleading testimony, during his confirmation hearing, about      his role in a project run by The American Spectator to find      damaging information about the activities of the Clintons in      Arkansas. The question of misleading testimony is reminiscent      of a rebuke to Mr. Olson by an independent counsel who      investigated whether he had lied to Congress in testimony      during his days as a Reagan defender. While ``literally      true,'' the counsel stated, that testimony was ``potentially      misleading.''       Whether he is approved as solicitor general by the full      Senate or the Bush administration must choose someone else      for the post, a deeper question endures: Is it now acceptable      to define the job as that of an outright partisan? Or should      the S. G. remain an advocate for the nation's long-term      interests whose duty to the rule of law goes beyond      allegiance to the political views of the administration?
