 President, I rise today to recognize the career accomplishments and community leadership of Mr. Fred N. Mudge upon his retirement as president and CEO of Logan Aluminum, Inc., in Lewisburg, KY.  Mr. Mudge began his career 32 years ago as a plant manager with Anaconda Aluminum. Later, his aptitude for innovation and demand for quality guided him in his progress from site manager for Anaconda's Alpart facility in Jamaica to the position of vice president of technology for Anaconda and ARCO Metals of Chicago. In 1985, Fred Mudge invested his tenacity and experience in the position of president and chief executive officer for a new Kentucky company, Logan Aluminum, Inc. Through his foresight and hard work, Logan Aluminum today is a world leader in aluminum can sheet stock production.  Mr. Mudge's personal quest for excellence is not limited to the worksite. As a member of the Lewisburg community, he contributed to the revitalization of the local chamber of commerce and the establishment of an economic development commission. In addition, he assisted in the founding of Lewisburg's junior achievement program. Today, Mr. Mudge continues to work on behalf of his community as a member of the Logan Memorial Hospital board and the Western Kentucky University board of regents.  Mr. President, Fred Mudge's work as an industry leader and dedicated community volunteer demonstrates the essential skills and determination our Nation needs to successfully meet the future challenges of job creation and community development. While his daily leadership at Logan Aluminum will be missed, I am confident that the Logan County community will continue to enjoy the benefits of his energy and insight well into the future.                          ____________________
