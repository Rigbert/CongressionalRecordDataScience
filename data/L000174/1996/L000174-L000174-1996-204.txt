President, I am very pleased that the managers of the bill, Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn, have accepted my amendment to increase the budget of the Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program to $18 million for fiscal year 1997. This represents about a $10 million increase above the President's request, but my amendment is supported by the Department of Defense. I have no doubt, based on the inquiries I have received from other Senators who have expressed support for this effort, that if there were a rollcall vote on the amendment it would pass overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. I also want to thank Senators Thurmond and Nunn for finding an acceptable offset for my amendment in the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration Program--PE#0603750D.  Adequate funding for demining technologies is urgently needed, as the experience of our troops in Bosnia has so graphically illustrated. They found themselves surrounded by millions of hidden landmines that had been scattered randomly over the countryside, with virtually no way to locate them besides hand-held metal detectors and probes. This is the same technology that has been used for decades, and although effective, it is terribly time consuming and dangerous.  Bosnia is just one example. There is wide recognition that the problem of unexploded landmines, particularly in countries where our troops are most likely to be sent on peacekeeping missions, has reached crisis proportions. There are an estimated 100 million of these hidden killers in over 60 countries, each one waiting to explode fromthe pressure of a footstep. Many of them are made of plastic, and cannot be detected with standard metal detecting equipment. The cost of locating and destroying the mines is immense, in both dollars and lives.  A great deal of money has been spent to develop more and more sophisticated landmines, and to develop countermine warfare technology to enable our forces to breach enemy minefields. But cutting a path through a minefield quickly and safely is a very different problem from humanitarian demining, which involves getting rid of every single mine in a large area. That is the only way to assure the local population that it is safe to return. Yet until this program, almost nothing had been done to improve the technology for demining. Imagine the time it takes to demine an area the size of half of Angola with a hand-held probe, where there are an estimated 10 million mines, or Bosnia, where there are 3 million mines. It will take generations.  The generally accepted estimate of the cost of demining is from $300 to $1,000 per mine, when you factor in the cost of training and equipment. That is obviously completely unaffordable for countries like Bosnia or Angola.  The Pentagon's Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program was started 2 years ago with $10 million that I requested in the Fiscal Year 1995 Defense Appropriations bill. It was supported by Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn at that time. For the past 2 years, the program, which is managed by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict [SOLIC] and is located at Fort Belvoir, has been supporting research and conducting tests on a wide range of demining technologies. Some of them have been put to use by our troops in Bosnia.  Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet solution to the mine problem, because there are so many variables. Mines are scattered in jungles, rivers, sandy deserts and mountainous terrain. The purpose of the Humanitarian Demining Technologies Program is to pursue any promising concept. We are not looking for high-tech solutions, although we do not rule them out. It will require a combination of technologies to locate the mines in such varied conditions. Most important, we need technologies that are appropriate for low budget operations in places where spare parts may be unavailable.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict is the appropriate overseer of this program. Unlike the Army, which does not have a demining mission, SOLIC also manages the Humanitarian Demining Program which sends U.S. military personnel overseas to train foreign personnel in landmine clearance. SOLIC has been a proponent of efforts to rid the world of mines, and has done a good job of managing the demining technologies program so far. My amendment assures that it will continue to do so.  Mr. President, the United States cannot solve this problem by itself. It is going to require the involvement and resources of the international community. But we have capabilities that other nations do not, and there is intense interest in the private sector to develop better demining technology. Every week, my office receives inquiries from representatives of private industry who have ideas about how to do this. Some are impractical, others are promising. This program aims to separate the wheat from the chaff, and I am confident that this relatively small investment in funds will reap real rewards for our troops and millions of innocent civilians.  I thank Chairman Thurmond and Senator Nunn for their support, and the Defense Department for its support and recognition of the need to intensify and expand this program. I ask unanimous consent that a Department of Defense position paper expressing support for my amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   POTENTIAL AMENDMENT TO S. 1745--SASC VERSION OF THE FY97 DEFENSE                            AUTHORIZATION BILL       Amendment Number:       Service Affected: OSD, Army.       Statement of Amendment: The amendment would make available      $18 million for research, redevelopment, test and evaluation      activities relating to humanitarian demining technologies to      be administered by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for      Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict.       Effect of Amendment: This amendment would increase the      funding level of the humanitarian research and development      program, and in truth, accelerate the development and testing      of additional systems and equipment to determine with      reliability the presence of minefields, detect mines and      discriminate between mines and other objects, and facilitate      volume clearance of mines with increased safety and      reliability. The amendment would also allow new states that      explore solutions in higher technology areas that are      unaffordable at budgeted levels.       DoD Position: Support:       On May 16, 1996, the President announced an initiative to      ``significantly expand'' DoD's humanitarian demining program.       The additional funds will accelerate the development and      the availability of highly effective systems equipment for      Humanitarian demining.       This amendment will allow the Department to implement a      robust research, development, test, and evaluation program      for humanitarian demining.
