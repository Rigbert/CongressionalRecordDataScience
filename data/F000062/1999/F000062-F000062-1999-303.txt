 President, I rise today in support of the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, introduced by the Senators from Utah and Montana. This bill addresses what is in my opinion a long-standing oversight in the tax code, and will create a permanent extension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.  Indeed, this legislation is necessary because, despite a remarkable record of spurring innovation and success--it is regarded by many in the business world as the single most effective tool government has to help business--the 18 year old research and experimentation tax credit inexplicably remains a temporary provision of the tax code.  Economists have linked the tax credit to steady economic growth and productivity. Industry leaders have credited it with spawning private enterprise investments. It is especially important to high tech and emerging growth industries that are driving our economy. And, because it creates jobs and spurs economic activity, the research and experimentation tax credit helps to increase the tax base, paying back the benefit of the credit.  Yet, despite its many benefits, for 18 years the research and experimentation tax credit has remained a temporary tax provision requiring regular renewal. The President's budget request for FY2000 has, once again, only requested a one year extension of the credit.  In fact, since 1981, when it was first enacted, the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit has been extended nine times. In four instances the research credit had expired before being renewed retroactively and, in one instance, it was renewed for a mere six months.  This is not a process which is conducive to encouraging business investment in the innovative industries--high technology, electronics, computers, software, and biotechnology, among others--which will provide future strength and growth for the U.S. economy.  Earlier in this decade California was faced with its severest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Today, the California economy is healthy and vibrant, and it is so in no small part because of the critical role played by innovative research and development efforts in nurturing new ``high tech'' industries.  Today the 150 largest Silicon Valley companies are valued at well-over $500 billion, $500 billion which did not exist two decades ago. Much of this growth is a result of ability of companies to undertake long-rage and sustained research in cutting-edge technologies.  To give just one example: Pericom Semiconductor, located in San Jose, California, has expanded from a start-up company in 1990 to a company with over $50 million in revenue and 175 employees by the end of last year. Pericom is ranked by Deloitte Touche as one of the fastest growing companies in Silicon Valley. And, according to a letter I received from the Vice President of Finance and administration at Pericom, utilization of the research credit has been key to their success, enabling them to add engineers, conduct research, and expand their technology base.  I will enter into the Record letters I have received from several California companies regarding the benefits of the research and experimentation tax credit.  The new jobs created at companies like Pericom, Genetech, Intel, Lam, and Xylinx, along with a host of others, through utilization of the research and experimentation tax credit also create additional tax revenue, paying back the benefit of the tax credit.  Research and experimentation is the lifeblood of high technology development, and if we want to replicate the success of companies like Pericom across the country it is crucial that we create a permanent research and experimentation tax credit.  According to a 1988 study conducted by the national accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, a permanent credit will increase GDP by nearly $58 billion (in 1998 dollars) over the next decade. The productivity gains from a permanent extension will allow workers throughout the nation to earn higher wages.  Whether it is advances in health care, information technology, or environmental design, research and development are critical ingredients for fueling the process of economic growth.  Moreover, aggressive research and experimentation is essential for U.S. industries fighting to be competitive in the world marketplace.  Right now American biotechnology is the world leader in developing effective treatments and biotech is considered one of the critical technologies for the twenty-first century. With other countries heavily-subsidizing research and development, it is critical that U.S. companies also receive incentive to invest the necessary resources to stay on top of breakthrough developments.  Most biotech research and development efforts are long term projects spanning five to ten years, sometimes more. The uncertainty created by the temporary and sporadic extensions is incompatible with the basic needs of biotech innovation--providing companies with a stable time frame to plan, launch, and conduct research activities. In the case of a promising but financially intensive research project, such unpredictability can make the difference as to whether the project is completed or abandoned.  Anyone who has watched the growth of America's high tech sector in the past two decades--much of it in California--has seen first hand how research and development investment leads to new jobs, new businesses, and even entire new industries. And anyone who has benefitted from breakthrough products--from new treatments for genetic disorders to cleansing contaminated groundwater--has felt the effect of this tax credit.  Mr. President, I believe that the research and experimentation tax credit has proven its worth in creating new technologies and jobs, and in growing tax revenues for this country. It should not be imperilled by remaining a temporary credit, subject to termination because of the uncertainty of a given political moment. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to create a permanent extension for the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.  I ask that letter in support of the bill be printed in the Record.  The material follows:                                                      Pericom,                                                 October 13, 1998.     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,     Washington, DC.       This is a letter to let you know how we are able to utilize      the benefits of the Research and Development Tax Credit.       Pericom Semiconductor--located in San Jose, California--has      expanded from a start-up in 1990 to $50M in revenue with 175      people as of September 1998. The savings that we obtain      through the utilization of the research credit have enabled      us to add engineers to help us expand our technology base. We      were ranked as one of the fastest growing companies in      Silicon Valley as a result of a Deloitte Touche survey.       The benefit to our country is that we export about 50% of      our revenue to Asia Pacific and Europe. This helps with the      balance of trade.       The engineers that we hire also pay their fair share of      taxes so the benefit of the tax credit is paid back and I'm      sure are more than revenue neutral. It enables them to buy      goods and services which has the spiral effect of making our      country that much stronger.       We respect your efforts on our behalf and view the      extension as a must for us. There is no known reason not to      pass it.           Sincerely,                                               Patrick B. Brennan,                       Vice President, Finance and Administration.                                       ____                                                Texas Instruments,                                        Silicon Systems, Inc.,                                    Santa Cruz, CA, March 9, 1999.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to you in my capacity as      Santa Cruz Fab Director of Texas Instruments. Although we      have operations throughout the United States, especially in      Texas, we have significant operations in Santa Cruz, San      Jose, Tustin and Santa Barbara, California. Thank you for      your support for the Research and Development (R) tax      credit and your efforts to make the credit permanent. We      support the bill recently introduced by Reps. Johnson and      Matsui. Making the R tax credit permanent is our top tax      priority for 1999.       Texas Instruments is a global semiconductor company      employing over 34,000 people worldwide. We are the world's      leading designer and supplier of digital signal processing      (DSP) and analog technologies, the engines driving the      digitization of electronics. DSP is the enabler of products      and processes yet to be imagined. It is a 3.9 billion dollar      market today. It should hit 13 billion dollars within the      next five years. If one adds mixed signal and analog      products, the total market could be in excess of 60 billion      dollars by the year 2002.       The R tax credit provides a significant incentive for      companies to perform additional amounts of R activity.      Given the inherent riskiness of this type of investment, the      credit makes for sound tax policy. Because the R credit is      primarily a wage credit, most of this additional investment      is directly connected to the creation and maintenance of      high-wage professional jobs.       Additionally, the creation of new products and broadening      the scope of technical knowledge benefits Americans      generally. We specialize in digital signal processing      solutions, enabling the nation to be more efficient and more      productive. Ultimately, the nation's employees will earn      higher wages and pay more taxes because Texas Instruments and      other California companies are investing in the future      through research.       To best harness the incentive nature of the R tax credit,      we believe that Congress should make the credit permanent.      Texas Instruments and the entire high tech community would      like to be able to rely upon the existence of the credit      beyond the average six months to 1\1/2\ year extension that      has characterized the treatment of the credit since 1986.      This would allow us to devote even more resources to R      activities, and quite possibly hire even more Californians.       There is another way to look at this: Congress and the      Administration need to take steps to ensure that U.S.      companies are equipped to compete in the international      marketplace. In the semiconductor industry, we have always      faced a continuing threat from foreign competitors such as      those in Japan, Korea or Taiwan. The R tax credit is a step      that helps U.S. companies as they compete in the global      marketplace. It does this by encouraging R activities,      which in turn result in greater employment opportunities.       As you know, high-technology firms have a critical role to      play in the future of the nation, and we all need to work to      keep businesses like ours here in the U.S. As the world      quickly shifts to a service economy, high salary jobs that      can sustain the American standard of living are becoming      increasingly linked to high value-added, high-tech      professions. Future economic growth and high employment      require us to continue to nourish innovation while      encouraging our employees to be as productive and creative as      possible. Our nation has the potential to lead the world into      a prosperous new century of growth, given appropriate federal      policy--such as making permanent the R tax credit.       Again, thank you for all your previous efforts in support      of the R tax credit. If there is any additional information      that we can provide to you in support of this important      provision, please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                  James D. Jensen,                                  Santa Cruz Fab Director.
