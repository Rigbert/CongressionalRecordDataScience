Chief Justice, I object to the references the manager is making to new information. It is my understanding that from Senate Resolution 16, the material outside the record may only be presented in connection with a motion to expand the record. This new information--we have skirted it already with the Lewinsky interview this weekend, but now the latest that Mr. Manager McCollum states, I would say respectfully, expands that record and, indeed, we are not at that point.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes. I think the motion that the managers have made is a motion to authorize the presentation of evidence that is not in the record. And so I think that is a fair comment. I overrule the objection.
