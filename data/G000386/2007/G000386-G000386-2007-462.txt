 I am trying to preempt--in a sense counter--what I think are old arguments that are going to be repeated about that issue. They are going to be coming from leftwing think tanks, and maybe the Democratic leadership in the Congress will pick up on it. For sure, the east coast media, who tend to be sympathetic to the views of these political organizations, is going to be loudly speaking about it. I don'tfind anything wrong with it being discussed, but I am going to make sure it is discussed in an intellectually honest manner.  The charge is going to be made that the alternative minimum tax problem we face now is a direct result of the bipartisan--I emphasize bipartisan--tax relief legislation that was enacted in 2001 and 2003, which, by the way, Chairman Greenspan has said, both before he left the Fed as well as a private citizen, that these tax relief packages we passed back then are the basis for the economy going very smoothly in the last 3 or 4 years, creating 7.2 million jobs. If that is the argument they are going to make--and I will bet you, although I am not a betting man, that that is what we are going to hear--it is a distortion, plain and simple. So I think I am going to try to correct the record in advance. Maybe next week, if I have done it adequately, there won't be any record to correct. I have been around here long enough to know what is going to be said.  To the extent the Democratic leadership and allies suggest, like others who have looked at this issue, that the bipartisan tax relief packages are responsible for the alternative minimum tax problem, I respond in this way: Most who have reached that conclusion have done so by misusing data, data that is provided by the truly nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, an agency of Congress that you might say wears green eyeshades, looks at things as they are, without a Republican or Democratic bias. These figures of the Joint Committee on Taxation will be used to distort the record on the issue of the alternative minimum tax.  The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis suggests an alternative explanation for the alternative minimum tax problem, and that is the failure of Congress to index the alternative minimum tax for inflation when it was first established 35 years ago. The critics are going to charge that the bipartisan tax relief packages are responsible for this alternative minimum tax problem. This conclusion is reached in error because it is based upon faulty logic. Those who have done similar analyses have based their conclusions on the mistaken assumption that a reduction in Federal receipts should be interpreted as a percentage causation of the alternative minimum tax problem. The Joint Committee on Taxation was asked to project Federal alternative minimum tax revenue, if the bipartisan tax relief provisions were extended but current law hold-harmless provisions were not extended. And what do we get, a $1.1 trillion issue, and a Federal alternative tax revenue, if neither the Bush tax cuts nor the hold-harmless provisions is extended, a $400 billion issue compared to the $1.1 trillion issue.  From that data, some erroneously concluded and publicly represented that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are responsible for 65 percent of the alternative minimum tax problem. In other words, this $1.1 trillion minus the $4 billion divided by $1.1 trillion. And conversely then, that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 tripled the size of the alternative minimum tax problem; again, $1.1 trillion divided by $400 billion. The logic used to reach that conclusion is flawed. That is what I am about to show.  This is because the many variables affecting the alternative minimum tax have overlapping results, and the order in which one analyzes those overlapping variables will directly impact the outcome of the analysis.  In that way, we can use the same Joint Committee on Taxation data in the analysis above to suggest that the failure to index is actually the dominant cause of the alternative minimum tax problem. If one were to first index--and that wasn't done 35 years ago--the current tax system for inflation by permanently extending an indexed version of the current hold-harmless provisions, Federal alternative minimum tax revenue would be reduced from $1.1 trillion to $472 billion over the 10-year period we use to guesstimate taxes coming into the Federal Treasury. Thus, extending and indexing the current hold-harmless provision for future inflation would reduce the alternative minimum tax revenues by 59 percent over the same period referred to in the Joint Committee on Taxation letter dated October 3, 2005, as ``percentage of AMT effect attributable to failure to extend and index hold harmless provision.''  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of that entire letter in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Congress of the United States,                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2005.     To: Mark Prater and Christy Mistr.     From: George Yin.     Subject: AMT Effects.       This memorandum responds to your request of September 29,      2005, for an analysis of the portion of the AMT effect (AMT      liability plus credits lost due to the AMT) which can be      attributed to the failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount      to inflation, assuming alternatively that the EGTRRA and      JGTRRA tax cuts (``tax cuts'') are either permanently      extended or repealed. We also explain how this information      compares to information previously provided to you on August      31, 2005 and September 16, 2005.       For the purpose of this analysis, we have first assumed      that the tax cuts are repealed. The first set of figures in      Table 1 compares the AMT effect under this assumption if,      alternatively, (1) the AMT exemption amount hold-harmless      provision is not extended beyond 2005; (2) such provision is      extended permanently; and (3) such provision is extended      permanently and indexed after 2005. The second set of figures      presents the same comparison under the assumption that the      tax cuts are permanently extended. All of the information      provided in this table was previously provided to you in our      September 16, 2005 memo, except in a different format.

In the analysis described      above, we identify the portion of the AMT effect attributable      to failure to adjust the AMT exemption amount to inflation.      There is, however, interaction between these two contributing      factors to the AMT effect. In order to avoid double counting      of interactions, a stacking order is imposed. The      apportionment of effects to each contributing factor will      vary depending on the stacking order, even though the total      effect remains constant.       This phenomenon is illustrated by Tables 2 and 3 below. The      first two columns of Table 2 show the portion of the AMT      effect attributable to the tax cuts, consistent with the      information provided on August 31, 2005 and September 16,      2005. The second two columns of Table 2 show the portion of      the AMT effect attributable to the failure to extend and      index the hold-harmless provision, consistent with the      information provided in Table 1 above. Note that if these two      contributing factors were completely independent of one      another, the information in Table 2 would suggest that the      two factors together contribute to more than 100 percent of      the AMT effect. In fact, as shown in Table 3, the two factors      together contribute to only 85 percent of the AMT effect.      Thus, there is substantial overlap between these two factors.
