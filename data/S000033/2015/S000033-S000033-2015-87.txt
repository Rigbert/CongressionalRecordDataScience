 President, when we look at budgets, we look essentially at two things. First off, we look at what the budget actually does, because it is a set of priorities, and we look at what the budget does not do.  Any sensible group of people, whether it is a family, whether it is local government, State government, whether it is a business--people sit around the table and say, OK, these are our needs, this is what we have to address or this is no longer relevant or this is wasteful and we have to get rid of it. That is what a budget process is about.  When you examine the Republican budget, it almost seems they turn that equation upside down and they do everything we should not be doing and they don't do what we should be doing.
