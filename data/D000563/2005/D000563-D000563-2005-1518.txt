President, today the Senate has overwhelmingly approved the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005, SAFETEA, H.R. 3. I supported this important legislation, as I did last year when the Senate passed asimilar measure, S. 1072. I believe it is a critical step toward funding our Nation's transportation infrastructure and creating much needed jobs.  Now the real work begins. The Senate funding level is $295 billion. The House has passed its version, TEA-LU, at $284 billion over 6 years. And the President unfortunately supports the lower House number. In fact, he has threatened to veto any transportation bill that exceeds the $284 billion funding level.  I was proud to join 83 of my Senate colleagues in standing firm on the Senate level of $295 billion. The White House should take note that at least 84 Senators--a supermajority--support a higher number.  Reauthorization of TEA-21 is one of the most important job and economic stimuli that the 109th Congress can pass. We must work quickly to deliver the best conference report at the highest possible funding level. We should not let further delay stand in the way of real transportation infrastructure improvement, economic development, and job creation.  I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the benefits of this legislation for my home State of Illinois.  H.R. 3, as amended by the Senate, would make the largest investment to date in our Nation's aging infrastructure, $295 billion over the life of the bill. In short, SAFETEA would increase the State of Illinois' total Federal transportation dollars and provide greater flexibility. It would help improve the condition of Illinois' roads and bridges, properly fund mass transit in Chicago and downstate, alleviate traffic congestion, and address highway safety and the environment.  The bill would provide $184.5 billion over the next 5 years for highways and other surface transportation programs. Illinois has the third largest Interstate System in the country; however, its roads and bridges are rated among the worst in the Nation. The State can expect to receive more than $6.1 billion over the next 5 years from the highway formula contained in the Senate bill. That is a 33-percent increase over the last transportation bill, TEA-21.  With these additional funds, the Illinois Department of Transportation will be able to move forward on major reconstruction and rehabilitation projects throughout the State.  Mass transit funding is vitally important to the Chicago metropolitan area as well as to many downstate communities. It helps alleviate traffic congestion, lessen air emissions, and provides access for thousands of Illinoisans every day. H.R. 3, as amended by the Senate, includes $46.53 billion over the next 5 years for mass transit. Illinois would receive about $2.22 billion over the next 5 years under the Senate bill, a $286 million or nearly 15-percent increase from TEA-21.  This legislation also preserves some important environmental and enhancement programs, including the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality, CMAQ, program. CMAQ's goal is to help States meet their air quality conformity requirements as prescribed by the Clean Air Act. The Senate bill would increase funding for CMAQ from $8 billion to $10.8 billion--an increase of 35 percent. Illinois received more than $460 million in CMAQ funds in TEA-21. The State is expected to receive an increase in CMAQ funds under the Senate bill.  With regard to highway safety, Illinois is 1 of 20 States that has enacted a primary seatbelt law. H.R. 3 would enable the State of Illinois and other States who have passed primary seatbelt laws to obtain Federal funds to implement this program and further improve highway safety.  I know this legislation is not perfect. Illinois' highway formula should be higher. Amtrak reauthorization and rail freight transportation funding are noticeably absent. And important road and transit projects from around my home State have not yet been included. I will work with Senator Barack Obama, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and my Illinois colleagues in the House to ensure that Illinois receives a fair share of transportation funds--highway, transit, and highway safety--in the final conference report.  I know my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol understand the importance of this legislation and I am hopeful that Congress can expeditiously work through the differences between the House and Senate bills in a conference committee. One of every five jobs in Illinois is related to transportation, including construction jobs. Unless Congress moves quickly, we will lose another construction season and the important jobs that are created by public investment in transportation.  Mr. President, with the passage of this legislation, the Senate has upheld its obligation to reauthorize and improve our Nation's important transportation programs. I am pleased to support SAFETEA.                          MISSED SENATE VOTES
