Madam Speaker, as we celebrate Black History Month, we should remember that this year is the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a man of peace, a man of love, a man of nonviolence. We should pause in thanks for the great contributions he made to make our country a better place. What he did in organizing and leading the Montgomery Bus Boycott more than 50 years ago, liberated not just a people but an entire nation.  Dr. King followed in the tradition of a very long and distinguished list of men and women who made unbelievable contributions to America and the world at large. The life works and contributions of these people continue to inspire us and will inspire generations yet to be born. Whether in education, sports, politics, business, medicine, the arts and sciences, one can turn the pages and see these unbelievable individuals' faces as part of our history. These individuals, whether it's Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver, Ralph Bunche, Rosa Parks, Joe Louis, they are all members of a cadre that must be looked upon as contributors to a better America. At this point, this juncture, we celebrate their lives and their contributions.                          ____________________
