 President, we are on the verge of an important bipartisan accomplishment to actually seriously begin to secure the border. I thank Senator Graham for his amendment. I thank the majority leader for his willingness to pass that portion of it that clearly is directed at border security.  I think once we have had an opportunity to actually read the amendment, which Senator Gregg and his staff and Senator Graham and his staff are doing, we will have an opportunity to do something important for the country later tonight.
