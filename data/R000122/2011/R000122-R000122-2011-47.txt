President, I rise to thank and commend Senator Whitehouse for inviting Rabbi Leslie Gutterman here to deliver the prayer.  Les Gutterman has been an extraordinary figure in our State, a man of great wisdom, compassion and kindness, who has, since 1970, contributed extraordinarily to the State of Rhode Island and to the people of Rhode Island.  His congregation goes far beyond denominational lines. He is literally the rabbi for everyone. In fact, he is my rabbi, and I am pleased and proud to say that.  Mr. President, again, I am delighted to welcome Rabbi Gutterman here today.
