 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a couple who truly exemplify the spirit of Kentucky. Mackie and Doris Reams have been happily married for 57 years and have lived an exciting and romantic life together in London, KY.  When Mackie, now 80, first saw Doris, he was about 20 and was working as a tobacco cutter in a field near her house; she was only 16 at the time. ``I saw her a few times and I just got brave enough to ask her to go out,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't resist those pretty blond curls . . . .That's how it started. We went together for about three years before we got married.'' Mackie and Doris were married on October 3, 1953, by preacher Layton Vandaventer and have been inseparable ever since.  The couple lived in Mackie's parents' house on Old Salem Road for several years after they wed and worked on the family farm. Each day they milked 8 cows by hand and tended to 6,000 broiler chickens. ``We fed and took care of them for nine weeks,'' recalls Doris, now 76. ``Then Purina Company came and we loaded them on a truck that took them to a processing plant in Mt. Sterling.''  In 1955, Mackie began a brief stint of service in the U.S. Army--his service ended in 1957. Afterwards, he began a career at Caron Spinning where he worked for 27 years. Doris was also employed at the Caron Spinning factory for almost 13 years until it finally closed down. Mackie's final job before he retired was as a door greeter at Walmart. ``My legs and knees got to bothering me, standing there all the time,'' Mackie said. ``So, I just quit. We just go and do whatever we want to do,'' he says in reference to their daily routine.  Each day the couple walks at Kmart every morning and visits the Laurel County Older Person Activity Center. ``We play cards and play cornhole in the exercise room,'' Doris said. ``We have lunch. OPAC has a lot of things to do. They took us to the state fair this year,'' she explained. In what spare time they do have, Doris and Mackie also attend Calvary Baptist Church on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings.  ``We have been very healthy and happy all our life together,'' Mackie and Doris are lucky enough to say. ``We thank God for that.''  Doris and Mackie Reams are an outstanding pair of Kentuckians who are truly blessed for the wonderful lifetime they have shared together. They are hard-working, caring citizens whose lifetime of success and happiness serves as an inspiration to the people of our great Commonwealth.  The Laurel County-area publication the Sentinel Echo recently published an article highlighting this couple's achievements over the years. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Sentinel Echo, Winter 2011]                        Together, Wherever We Go                            (By Carol Mills)       Former Walmart greeter Mackie Reams met his wife Doris 60      years ago, and they have been happily married for 57 years.      He is 80 and she is 76.       Their secret to staying in love for so long is they do      everything together.       ``We just went together wherever we were going, and we      still do,'' Doris said.       Mackie said he lets her do all the shopping, but he goes      with her. Sometimes he sits and waits on her to finish      shopping, but he is always near.       ``If we went somewhere, we took our kids with us and      everybody went. That's just the way we lived.''       Doris moved to Bill George Road from Knox County with her      parents at a young age.       ``I've lived around this territory ever since I was 10      years old,'' she said. ``My dad owned all this country back      in here where all the houses are. We just farmed. We raised      tobacco and corn. After we got married, I worked for Caron      Spinning. I worked there for 13 years until they closed      out.''       Mackie farmed at his parents' place on Old Salem Road.      After he married Doris, the couple stayed with his parents      for a couple of years. On his farm, they milked eight cows by      hand twice a day for two years and sold the milk to Southern      Belle Dairy Company.       The Reams also raised broiler chickens.       ``The broiler house held 6,000 chickens,'' Doris recalled.      ``We fed and took care of them for nine weeks. Then Purina      Company came, and we loaded them on a truck that took them to      a processing plant in Mt. Sterling. Then we would have to      clean the house and get ready for another bunch of baby      chickens and start all over again.''       Mackie spent two years in the U.S. Army--1955 to 1957. He      then worked at Caron Spinning for 27 years and for 13 years      as a door greeter at Walmart.       ``I quit about three years ago,'' Mackie said. ``My legs      and knees got to bothering me, standing there all the time.      So, I just quit. We just go and do whatever we want to do.''       The couple walks at Kmart every morning and attend Calvary      Baptist Church every Sunday morning and evening and on      Wednesday.       The couple also visits Laurel County Older Person Activity      Center almost every day.       ``We play cards and play cornhole in the exercise room,''      Doris said. ``We have lunch. OPAC has a lot of things to      do.''       Mackie said OPAC took them to Frankfort to see the Capitol.       ``They took us to the state fair this year,'' Doris said.       They used to travel a lot.       ``We've been to a lot of the states,'' Doris said. ``We      usually went with friends. We went all the way to California,      driving around on two weeks of vacation. We just drove and      stopped whenever we got ready.''       ``Niagara Falls, all up in New York and all up in that      territory,'' Mackie added. ``All over Kentucky and the United      States just about.''       In the '70s and '80s, Mackie and Doris were active in      sports. He played baseball while Doris watched and rooted for      him. They also went bowling three or four nights a week at      Levi Lanes.       ``We won lots of trophies,'' Doris said. ``I also used to      quilt a lot during the winter months and made crocheted      afghans, but I can't anymore because of my arthritis in my      hands.''       Mackie first noticed Doris at her home near where he was      cutting tobacco in a field. Her home was just a couple of      houses down from where she now lives on Bill George Road. He      was 20 years old, and she was 16.       ``I saw her a few times and I just got brave enough to ask      her to go out,'' he recalled. ``I couldn't resist those      pretty blond curls. That's how it started. We got to going to      church together. We went together for about three years      before we got married.''       Mackie said he drove his father's pickup to do his      courting.       ``I got to drive it,'' he said. ``I'd go get her and we'd      go to church. We'd ride around and maybe go up to town on      Saturday and walk up and down the streets. I never did go to      the Reda (theater) with her because her family was kind of      strict. They didn't want her going places like that at that      time.''       ``My parents were old fashioned,'' Doris laughed. ``I guess      they finally decided we were going to get married anyway and      agreed. They didn't like it too well, but they went ahead      with it. My dad went with us to the wedding, but my mom      didn't because she thought she would cry or something. We got      married in the preacher's house on Oct. 3, 1953. His name was      Layton Vandaventer. He's deceased now.''       Doris and Mackie have been in good health for most of their      lives.       ``We have been very healthy and happy all our life      together,'' they said. ``We thank God for that.''       The couple has two children, Eddie Reams and Phyllis      Purvis, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.                          ____________________
