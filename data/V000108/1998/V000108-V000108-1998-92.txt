Speaker, I rise today to talk about the critical importance of union organizing in protecting working families. ``The Day To Make Our Voices Heard'' campaign highlights successful organizing drives and shows how they improve workers' standards of living and working conditions. The campaign focuses public attention on the many obstacles workers face in exercising their right to union representation. This week's events are especially important in building coalitions among workers, union leaders, as well as political and community leaders--coalitions that will hold up the example of responsible employers and build public pressure against employers who trample the right of their workers to organize.  In Northwest Indiana--the region I represent--and throughout our country, the opportunity to join a union means a guarantee that workers share in the benefits of increased productivity. The ability to join a union means that you will earn an average 34 percent more than a nonunion worker. The ability to join a union means that you are more likely to receive health benefits from your employer and higher quality benefits that will protect your family members in the case of a serious illness. The ability to join a union means that you are more likely to have a decent pension that will provide you and your spouse with a secure retirement. The ability to join a union means that you will have a greater say in how your workplace is run, which will lead to a safer and more productive workplace.  And what has protecting workers' ability to join unions meant to our country? Over the past century, America's unions have helped build the largest middle class in the history of the world. As we move into the next century, good union jobs will continue to be essential to building and maintaining communities that are strong both economically and socially.  Now you would think that the Congress would be doing everything it could to protect workers right to union representation. Sadly, that is not the case. Just this March, the Republican majority in the House pushed through legislation that would overturn a unanimous 1995 Supreme Court decision recognizing the right of all workers to seek employment, regardless of their membership in a union or their support for union representation in their new workplace. And every year, we see attempts in the Congress to cut funding for the National Labor Relations Board--the federal agency responsible for preventing unfair labor practices by employers and unions.  Mr. Speaker, it is high time that Members of the House make our voices heard in support of union organizing efforts across the country. We owe this--higher wages, better benefits, safer workplaces--and much more to the working men and women of America.                          ____________________
