Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Doug Phillips of Anchorage, AK, who participated in CIVITAS atBosnia and Herzegovina from August 1 through August 17, 1997. This intensive program is designated to train teachers from throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina with materials and methods developed to educate for democracy. Mr. Phillips was part of a team of 20 American educators who were assigned to 16 locations throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the Republika Srpska; the American teamed with 18 teachers from the Council of Europe in nine of these sites. This education for democracy program reached 550 teachers from both entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The summer training program was developed by the Center for Civic Education as part of a major civic education initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina supported by the U.S. Information Agency and the U.S. Department of Education and built on a program begun in 1996. The U.S. Information Service in Sarajevo provided valuable assistance to the program. The goals of the program are to provide teachers with the tools necessary to help prepare students and their communities for competent and reasonable citizenship, including participation in elections and other opportunities to take part in the political life of their communities. Achieving this goal will contribute to the reconstitution of a sense of community, cooperation, tolerance, and support for democracy and human rights in this war torn area.  I am also pleased to announce that the curricular materials being used for the program in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been adapted from the ``we the people * * * the citizens and the Constitution, foundations of democracy,'' and the project citizen programs, which are supported by Congress and used in schools throughout the United States. Initial reports evaluating the summer program indicate the materials--selected and adapted by educators from Bosnia and Herzegovina--and teaching methods were enthusiastically received and will be adapted for use in classrooms in both entities of the country.  Mr. Phillips is the social studies program coordinator for the Anchorage public schools. He also serves as the state coordinator for the ``we the people * * * the citizens and the Constitution'' program in Alaska.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend Doug Phillips for his dedication and commitment during the CIVITAS at Bosnia and Herzegovina summer training program. His work is helping to achieve the overall objective of building democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina.                          ____________________
