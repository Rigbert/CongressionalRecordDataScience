 Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/4\ minutes.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment, cosponsored by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson), the gentleman from California (Mr. Stark), the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms.  McKinney), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Hilliard), the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller), the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Berry) deals with one of the great moral challenges of this century.  Millions of people in Africa and Asia are suffering from the horrible AIDS epidemic decimating their countries. Because of poverty, they are unable to afford the very expensive prescription drugs needed to combat this killer disease.  Sadly, the major pharmaceutical companies are using their enormous wealth and influence to fight legislation passed in South Africa, Israel, and Thailand which allows those countries to purchase and manufacture anti-AIDS drugs at far lower prices than those charged by the major drug companies.  These laws are consistent with international trade and copyright law. Once again, these laws are consistent with international trade and copyright laws.  Tragically, the U.S. State Department is currently working with the drug companies to punish South Africa because their government has committed the terrible crime of trying to get affordable drugs to treat their AIDS patients.  What South Africa is doing is legal under international law. And it is morally right.  Please support this amendment. Get the U.S. Government on the right side of this issue and help save millions of lives.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
