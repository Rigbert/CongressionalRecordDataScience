 President, here is something else that will give cheer to Kentucky families. I am pleased to report that today the President will sign a resolution identical to a proposal I introduced, a resolution that will undo a harmful regulation that could threaten nearly one-third of America's coal mining jobs. I am looking forward to attending that signing ceremony later today.  This resolution is just one of several that we hope to send to the President to begin providing the American people with relief, protecting jobs, and growing our economy. It reflects promises made and promises kept.                          ____________________
