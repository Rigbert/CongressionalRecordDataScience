 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a proud Kentuckian, community leader, and good friend, Mrs. Cornelia ``Neal'' Vaughan. Neal, like her uncle, the late Senator John Sherman Cooper, is sincerely dedicated to improving the lives of Kentuckians, and she does sothrough her extensive volunteer work. Neal is a founding member of the Fayette County Drug Court and served on the National Association of Drug Court Professionals Board of Directors. She has worked with the Junior League, God's Closet, the Governors Inauguration Committee, the Sayre School Board, and the Hope Center for Women. Neal is also on the board for the Kentucky Governor's School for the Arts, but her greatest accomplishments lie in her role as president of the board of directors for the Chrysalis Community Center in Lexington, KY.  The center assists women recovering from substance abuse addiction and counsels the children of these women on substance abuse prevention. Chrysalis uses a combination of the 12-step program originated by Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, long-term living arrangements, and a caring and nurturing environment to ensure women and their families live fulfilling lives free of abusive substances. On Friday, September 23, 2005 the center recognized Neal for the vital role she has played in its expansion by dedicating the center's community center in her honor. Neal has given her all to the center's important mission: restoring hope and dignity in women's lives.  On September 21 of this year, The Lexington Herald-Leader published an article highlighting the Chrysalis Center's success and Neal's contribution. I ask that the full article be included in the Congressional Record.           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Sept. 21, 2005]                Chrysalis, the House That Neal Built Up                           (By Robin Roenker)       A mural of brightly colored butterflies accentuates the      sky-blue walls of the entry to Lexington's Chrysalis      Community Center.       It's the type of room that makes you feel better just by      entering it. A room that says, you're welcome here. This is a      safe place to be.       And to the women who use Chrysalis House's services--women      who are recovering from substance addiction--it says      something else. A message many of them have not heard often      enough: ``You're a good person. You deserve treatment with      dignity.''       For two decades, that message has been the motivating theme      behind Cornelia ``Neal'' Vaughan's volunteer work with      Chrysalis House.       As president of the agency's board of directors for 16 of      the past 18 years, Vaughan has overseen Chrysalis House's      growth from a single, 12-person-capacity facility on Maxwell      Street for women recovering from substance addiction into a      multi-faceted agency with three transitional treatment      facilities, 50 apartments, an 18,000-square-foot community      center and programs to help place graduates in their own      permanent housing. Currently, Chrysalis House's six      facilities are home to 114 women and 100 children, with 160      more women on waiting lists.       Vaughan, who will be honored at a ceremony Friday, can      detail every step of Chrysalis House's development.       She can detail them because she was there, say her fellow      Chrysalis House board members, every step of the way. Raising      money. Submitting grant proposals. Identifying facility      sites. Recognizing the women's needs and finding partners in      the community to help meet them.       But not only that. Despite her penchant for wearing pearls      and high heels, she was also there to clean out shower      stalls, pull weeds from the grounds and serve food in the      dinner line, said Lisa Minton, Chrysalis House's executive      director.       ``She is the heart and soul of our organization,'' Minton      said.       ``Neal has been very inspirational in her vision,'' added      Julie Hamilton, who assumed Vaughan's position as president      of the Chrysalis House board of directors in July. ``She's      the first to say that this is all about the women and      children. And her passion has been very contagious.''       To recognize Vaughan's longstanding leadership and      volunteer work on behalf of women and children in the      community, the Chrysalis House board of directors is      dedicating the Chrysalis Community Center, which opened in      2003 on the house's new eight-acre campus on Hill Rise Drive      off Versailles Road, in honor of Vaughan.       A plaque will be hung in Vaughan's honor. Speakers will      include Kentucky first lady Glenna Fletcher and Beverly Watts      Davis, director of the U.S. Department for Health and Human      Services Center for Substance Abuse Prevention.                            No good vs. bad       ``With substance abuse, it is not a good or bad issue,''      said Vaughan, 57. ``It is a sick or well issue.''       That philosophy motivates the program's holistic approach      to treating the women who come to Chrysalis House. The women      receive addiction treatment as well as help with reclaiming      their lives, jobs and families.       When Chrysalis House first opened, ``women were coming in      and getting sober, but they had so many other issues,''      Vaughan said.       ``I realized that even though they were staying in our      facility for 10 months or a year, they were leaving without      parenting skills or a job,'' she said. ``If you're going to      rehabilitate someone, you have to really rehabilitate them.      You need to find the gaps where they need help, and help them      fill those in.''       Now, participants take part in required job skills classes      and work one-on-one with tutors and counselors during their      stay, so that when they leave Chrysalis House, they're ready      to ``pick up their lives, and have a productive life they      feel good about,'' she said.       Studies of Chrysalis House participants show that 80      percent are still sober, still have custody of their      children, and are still employed a year after they moved out      of the apartments, Vaughan said.                          Doesn't take ``no''       Much of the credit for Chrysalis House's growth goes to      Vaughan's tenacity in raising support for its programs and      educating the community to ``break down the stigma      surrounding substance addiction,'' Hamilton said.       ``She helped open community doors to a better understanding      of the disease of addiction itself,'' she said. ``Plus, she's      the type of person you can't say `no' to. She never gives      up.''       In addition to her work with Chrysalis House, Vaughan is a      founding member of the Fayette County Drug Court. She serves      on the board of the Governor's School for the Arts and has      fulfilled another of her passions--organizing big events--     through work with the Governor's Inauguration Committee and      the Lexington Ball, which supports the University of Kentucky      Markey Cancer Center. She was recently appointed to the      national board of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention.       Vaughan attributes her passion for community service to the      example set by her parents, Richard and Cornelia Cooper of      Somerset, who remain active volunteers. She credits her      longevity as board president to the support and understanding      of her sons Cooper and Stoll, and her husband, Derek,      chairman of G.F. Vaughan Tobacco Company.       Two years ago when Derek asked her what she wanted for      their 30th wedding anniversary, he wasn't surprised by her      answer: All new furniture for the First Step House on      Chrysalis Court.       That is what she got--along with a new strand of pearls.                          ____________________[Pages S10818-S10819]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  TRIBUTE TO CORNELIA ``NEAL'' VAUGHAN  Mr. McCONNELL.
