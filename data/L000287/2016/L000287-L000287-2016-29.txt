Speaker, I rise today to offer a resolution recognizing September 21st as the International Day of Peace.  This year marks the 35th anniversary of the United Nations declaring the need for the global community to celebrate an International Day of Peace. Around the world, today is an inclusive effort towards encouraging, promoting, and recommitting to peaceful action and ceasefire.  At a time when war, violence, and conflict dominate the news headlines, peace may seem a distant and lofty goal. However, during times like these I am reminded of a quote by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--``Mankind must evolve for all human conflict a method which rejects revenge, aggression, and retaliation. The foundation of such a method is love.'' Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed seemingly insurmountable obstacles of hate be toppled by the spirit of love. It is for this reason that I continue to have faith in the possibility of positive and good change.  Every year, I fight tirelessly to protect the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), an organization which serves as the key link between U.S. national security agencies and their global counterparts to prevent and resolve conflicts. I believe in my heart of hearts that USIP's mission and work are critical to our national security and foreign policy priorities.  A few years ago, after leading a congressional delegation to India to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Dr. and Mrs. King's pilgrimage, I introduced a bill--the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act. This bill teaches the doctrine of nonviolence, the effectiveness of applying the principle of Satyagraha, or non-violent resistance, to a new generation of emerging global leaders and scholars. USIP was on the same page and developed educational modules on nonviolent civil mobilization.  In my core, I also believe that peace work begins at home. It is for this reason that I was so encouraged when the U.S. Institute of Peace launched the inaugural USIPeace Teachers program, which selected educators from across the country to incorporate peacebuilding into their curricula. My constituent, Timothy McMahon, a teacher at Atlanta International School, was an inaugural participant in this great program, and sought to instill the skill of effective, mindful dialogue in his classroom.  You see, Mr. Speaker, peacefulness begins at the local level, within each community, and in every person. Nearly a year ago, His Holiness, Pope Francis addressed the U.S. Congress, and he reminded us of the Golden Rule--``To treat others as we treat ourselves.'' On days like today, I encourage each of my colleagues not only to cosponsor this resolution, but also to consider how even the smallest act can make this world a little better, a little more peaceful, a little more loving for generations yet unborn.                          ____________________
