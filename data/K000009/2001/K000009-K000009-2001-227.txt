Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of a Toledoan and American of note. Ina Marie Lee. Miss Lee passed away at 108 years of age.  Miss Lee was a nurse and a veteran of World War I. She was considered the oldest living veteran in Northwest Ohio, and was one of the oldest in our nation. She served as a nurse during the war, stationed with the Army in Mobile, Alabama and Fort Snelling, Minnesota. Upon her discharge at the War's end, she worked as a private nurse for several of Toledo's prominent families. She did not retire from nursing until the age of 85, after a 55 year career.  Ina Marie Lee was born in the tiny town of Jerry City in Wood County, Ohio. The daughter of a poultry farmer, Ina dreamed of being a nurse. After overcoming tuberculosis as a child, she realized that goal and was one of the first graduates of the former Toledo Hospital School of Nursing. Graduates of the school still meet, and Ina was a revered and popular member. She was ``a wonderful role model for other nurses,'' according to her longtime friend and nurse Mary Lou Leonard.  Believed to be a descendant of General Robert E. Lee. Ina joined the Army on June 10, 1918. As a distinguished veteran, she was a member of the American Legion Argonne Post 545. She was also a member of the Toledo Chapter of the Order of the Eastern Star, the Toledo Hospital Alumni Association, the Idlewood Rebekah Lodge No. 565 in Jerry City, and the Westgate Chapel in Toledo. She was several times the Grand Marshall in Toledo parades and was featured on NBC's Today Show on two occasions. It was my personal honor to join Ina at a recent nurses reunion in Toledo where we unveiled a statue to honor nurses and their contributions to our community.  These few words on the Congressional Record cannot do justice to this most remarkable of women and her life well-lived. Perhaps the words of her friend. Ms. Leonard, say it best. Ina Marie Lee ``was a fun-loving, happy, caring person. She loved live life, she loved people, and she loved helping people.'' No greater tribute can there be than to have been recognized and appreciated as a friend, confidante, and dedicated nurse. We extend to her sister, Genetta Grau, and her niece and nephews our heartfelt condolence. At the same time, we celebrate a truly incredible life and honor her memory by trying to live in its example.                          ____________________
