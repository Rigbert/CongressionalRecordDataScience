Chairman, I offer a bipartisan amendment in conjunction with the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Bilirakis], the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], and the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Smith].  Our amendment would narrow the authority of the President to provide U.S. economic assistance to countries found to be in violation of the U.S. Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. The Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act was signed into law in 1995, prohibits foreign aid to any country that blockades the delivery of U.S. disaster relief supplies to a third country as that currently applies to the country of Turkey which, since April 1993, has blocked all U.S. disaster relief assistance and International Red Cross medical supplies bound for the landlocked country of Armenia.  In addition to Turkey's ongoing blockade of humanitarian assistance to Romania, Turkey is continuing its illegal occupation of northern Cyprus, its internationally condemned war against the Kurds living in southeast Turkey,its persecution of Christians and its aggressive policy in the Aegean Sea which very nearly resulted in an armed confrontation with Greece earlier this year.  The Clinton administration has failed to address these issues. In fact, last month President Clinton rejected clear congressional intent by waiving the application of the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act to Turkey. As I stated before, U.S. law today prohibits U.S. economic or military assistance to any country that directly blockades the transport of U.S. disaster assistance or emergency relief supplies to a third country.  Authored in the House by the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Smith and the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and in the Senate by Senators Dole and Simon, this law applies to Turkey because of its ongoing blockade of all U.S. and international humanitarian relief supplies bound for Armenia.  In order to maintain U.S. pressure on Turkey, we are offering this amendment in a bipartisan fashion to ensure that Turkey complies with the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act before it receives any additional U.S. economic support funds.  Specifically, our amendment will narrow the Presidential waiver authority contained within the act, ending the ability of the President to invoke a national security waiver in order to provide up to $25 million in fiscal year 1997 in economic assistance funds to Turkey.                              {time}  1600  Mr. Chairman, while our amendment would cut $25 million in economic aid to Turkey if they do not lift the blockade of Armenia, it would have absolutely no effect on U.S. military assistance to Turkey. I repeat that. It would have absolutely no effect on U.S. military assistance to Turkey, which, in fiscal year 1997, is scheduled to exceed $140 million.  Turkey's hostile and aggressive actions in the last 11 months demand a response from this country. The Clinton administration has failed to adequately do so, and it is up to the Congress to make a clear, decisive statement to Turkey that its hostile and aggressive policies against other countries will not be tolerated or rewarded by the people of the United States.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support a policy of positive engagement with Turkey. However, we cannot condone blindly giving foreign aid and economic assistance dollars to a country which so routinely violates the rights of its neighbors.  Mr. Chairman, I would encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure.
