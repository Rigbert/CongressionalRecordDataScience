 I thank my friend from Vermont for raising this issue. On the one hand, we have a State--the State of Vermont--which addressed this issue in a serious way, listening to all points of view, having the legislature go over this in a thorough manner. Then, herewe have the Senate, after many, many millions of dollars in lobbying efforts and campaign contributions, overriding the work of the State of Vermont and not having one hearing--not one hearing with consumers, environmental groups, farm organizations--and rushing it through in the last week or two before we adjourn for summer break.  I thank the Senator from Vermont for raising that enormously important issue.  With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from Kansas.
