President, today I wish to recognize the service of an Oklahoma native and proud Marine officer upon completing 22 years of dedicated service to our great Nation. Lt. Col. Michelle Heath was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps in April 1997 and has dedicated her career to the selfless service of our country.  Throughout the course of her career, Lieutenant Colonel Heath supported numerous operations both stateside and overseas. During her first tour at Camp Lejeune with 8th Motor Transport Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Heath deployed as the motor transport detachment commander. After completion of this deployment, in May 2000, she was assigned as the assistant logistics officer to Marine Aircraft Group-14, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point.  Follow-on assignments included duty as the 2d Marine Aircraft Wing Antiterrorism Officer, Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point followed by time with Mobilization Plans and Policy, Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Marine Corps Base Quantico. During this time she was directly involved with the mobilization of Marine Corps Reserve units in support of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In June 2006,Lieutenant Colonel Heath deployed to Iraq to serve with Marine Wing Support Squadron-473 as a logistics officer.  In 2013, Lieutenant Colonel Heath attended the Naval Command and Staff course at the Naval War College. Upon graduation, she served as the operational sponsor for Marine for Life, Manpower and Reserve Affairs in Quantico, VA. In this capacity, she sought to ensure that all Marines maintained a connection to the Corps, regardless of their stage in life. Lieutenant Colonel Heath continued her service to the Nation when she joined the operational sponsor for the Readiness Support Program, Marine Corps Individual Reserve Support Activity, Marine Forces Reserve, New Orleans, LA.  Since 2016, Lieutenant Colonel Heath has served in the Office of Legislative Affairs, Headquarters, Marine Corps, Pentagon. In this capacity, she has worked tirelessly while balancing military, political, and budgetary priorities for the Congress.  Upon retirement, Lieutenant Colonel Heath will return to the great State of Oklahoma and will reside in Norman, OK. On behalf of my colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I want to personally thank Lieutenant Colonel Heath for her more than two decades of service to the Marine Corps and our Nation, and I wish her well in her future endeavors.                          ____________________
