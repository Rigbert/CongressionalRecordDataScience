Speaker, just to expand on the point of my colleague. I think it is a statistic the American people need to pay attention to. It is one-quarter of one percent. One-quarter of one percent of the people in America gave more than $200 to a political campaign last year and yet constituted 80 percent of the contributions.  So who do we think are in the Republican leader's office when the decisions are being made on tax relief or reforming Social Security or on whether or not we are going to have HMO reform that gives patients rights? Guess what, the insurance company executives are in the office, not the patients, not the people who desperately need access to health care and cannot get it because their HMO is more interested in profits than in their health care. Guess who is in those offices when we are talking about tax reform?  Now, we could do some tax reform around here that would benefit the majority of the working people in America. In fact, I have introduced some legislation to reform Social Security that would vouchsafe Social Security for 75 years, certified by the board of trustees, and it would give tax relief to 95 percent of the wage earning Americans in this country.  It is simple. Right now we pay Social Security tax on the first $72,600 of income. After that, we do not pay Social Security tax. If we earn a million dollars a year, our tax rate under Social Security is less than one percent. If we earn $15,000 a year, our tax rate on Social Security, which is part of the FICA, is six percent. We make six times more out of a meager income on which we cannot make ends meet.                              {time}  1830  So if we just lifted the cap and said, fair is fair, all these people want to talk about a flat tax, well, let us make Social Security a flat tax on all income, not a regressive, super-regressive flat tax which is only on the first $72,600 of income. That would vouchsafe Social Security into the indefinite future. But you can also use some of that money to give a $4,000 exemption from FICA tax. Forty percent or 45 percent of Americans pay more in taxes to Social Security than they pay in income taxes. Ninety-five percent of Americans would benefit under that system. Everybody who earned less than $76,000 a year would get a tax break. But guess what? The same people are sitting in the leaders of the office of the Committee on Ways and Means and the Republican leader's office when I talk about a progressive Social Security reform, something to make this vital program safe, and saying, ``You better worry about your campaign contributions here if you raise my taxes.'' They want to tax the little people, and they want tax relief at the top.  It is time to change this system. But it is not going to change, as the gentleman from Vermont pointed out, until more people who have more on the line choose to vote, and that is the majority of the American people, who are losing under the current system. Often I give speeches like this on the floor and I have had colleagues andfriends from the Republican side of the aisle say, ``You're talking about class warfare. We don't want class warfare around here.'' That is what they say. That is not the truth. What they want is they want to continue the current class warfare, which is winning warfare against middle-income and working families and the poor in America to the advantage of that one-half of 1 percent at the top. That is what they want to perpetuate. They do not want to talk about it. They do not want the truth out there. It goes to so many issues. It goes to Social Security reform. It could be progressive. It goes to trade. I hope the gentleman does not mind if I switch to trade for a moment.
