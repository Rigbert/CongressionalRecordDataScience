President, the Federal Communications Commission's rules pertaining to media ownership have long served a vital function, helping to ensure a diversity of viewpoints in the media marketplace. The FCC's attempt to undo these important rules that have served us so well is misguided and harmful. The FCC's 35 percent cap on national audience reach has not only served to promote diversity, it also protects local programming, allowing it to reflect local values and preferences. If the cap is increased to 45 percent we can be sure that major networks will meet or exceed the new threshold, as some companies have done under the current standards, allowing for the acquisition of local stations while eliminating the unique choices that local programming can provide.  I am also concerned about the FCC's effort to remove the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership limitations in 80 percent of all media markets. Currently, cross-ownership rules prevent a single corporation from becoming too powerful a voice in a given community. Lifting the cross-ownership ban will leave many communities reliant on one company to decide what they are able to see and hear.  There are those who argue that the increase in the number of media outlets has obviated the need for such rules. The reality, of course, debunks this notion. While the number of media outlets has increased, ownership has become more concentrated. What's more, many of the largest new media outlets appear to be owned and controlled by the same conglomerates that control traditional media.  In light of these facts, it seems illogical that the FCC would exacerbate a disturbing trend that is transforming the marketplace of ideas into little more than a corporate superstore. A recent, troubling tendency of the large media companies was highlighted in The Wall Street Journal this week in an article noting these companies' rapid acquisitions of cable channels to ``re-create the old programming oligopoly'' of the pre-cable era. The numbers tell the story. Of the top 25 cable channels, 20 are now owned by one of the big five media companies, according to The Wall Street Journal article of September 15, 2003.  The unsettling statistics extend to other communications branches as well. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the number of owners of commercial radio stations has declined by approximately 25 percent since 1996. Even more alarming is the fact that since 1995, ``the number of entities owning commercial TV stations has dropped by 40 percent.''  I welcome and strongly encourage the emergence and proliferation of new and different platforms for news and information. We can expect that more and more Americans will gain access to and will use these resources. In our democratic society, there still are good and sound reasons for encouraging and protecting the diversity of viewpoints available in more traditional media. The FCC--to which the American people have entrusted some of this responsibility--should be working to diversify, not homogenize, the news and information media available to the American public.  I ask the Wall Street Journal article of September 15, 2003, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 15, 2003]          How Media Giants Are Reassembling the Old Oligopoly                           (By Martin Peers)       Two years ago, Mattel Inc. gave CBS a choice. The network      had refused to broadcast the toymaker's movie ``Barbie in the      Nutcracker'' in prime time. So Mattel threatened to pull      millions of dollars of advertising from the Nickelodeon cable      channel--owned by CBS parent Viacom Inc.       Viacom, which had spent a decade bulking up with      acquisitions, now wielded its new clout, according to people      familiar with the situation. If Mattel made good on its      threat, Viacom said, it would be blacklisted from advertising      on any Viacom property--a wide swath of media turf that also      includes MTV, VH-1, BET, a radio broadcasting empire and even      billboards. Mattel backed down, and the Barbie movie ended up      running during a less-desirable daytime period.       Neither company will comment on the scrape, but Viacom says      Mattel remains a ``valued advertising partner.'' More      generally, President Mel Karmazin in an interview is blunt      about his company's strategy: ``You find it very difficult to      go to war with one piece of Viacom without going to war with      all of Viacom.''       Viacom and its big media peers have been snapping up cable      channels because they're one of the few entertainment outlets      generating strong revenue growth these days. More broadly,      the media giants have discovered that owning both broadcast      and cable outlets provides powerful new leverage over      advertisers and cable and satellite-TV operators. The      goliaths are using this advantage to wring better fees out of      the operators that carry their channels and are pressuring      those operators into carrying new and untried channels.      They're also finding ways to coordinate promotions across      their different holdings.       Entertainment giants such as Viacom, NBC parent General      Electric Co. and Walt Disney Co., which owns ABC, now reach      more than 50% of the prime-time TV audience through their      combined broadcast and cable outlets. The total rises to 80%      if you include the parents of newer networks--such as News      Corp.'s Fox and AOL Time Warner Inc.'s WB--and NBC's pending      acquisition of Vivendi Universal SA's cable assets, estimates      Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.       The big media companies are quietly re-creating the ``old      programming oligopoly'' of the pre-cable era, notes Mr.      Wolzien, a former executive at NBC. Of the top 25 cable      channels, 20 are now owned by one of the big five media      companies.       The idea of owning broadcast networks as well as cable      channels is ``comfortable for people like ourselves,'' says      Bob Wright, chairman of NBC, which two weeks ago signed a      preliminary agreement to acquire Vivendi Universal's USA and      Sci Fi cable channels, along with the Universal film studio,      bolstering a stable of cable channels that includes      Bravo, MSNBC and CNBC.       For the past several years, Viacom and other media      companies have pressed the Federal Communications Commission      to relax restriction on owning local TV station. One of their      main arguments: Their audience is shrinking as cable booms      and the TV audience fragments. The original three broadcast      networks now capture only 33.7% of the prime-time television      audience, down from 69.3% in 1985-86. Cable now boasts a      49.3% share, compared with 7.5% in the mid-'80s, according to      a Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau analysis of data from      Nielsen Media Research.       But with the wave of consolidation and the increased reach      of the media giants, some cable systems are fighting to keep      restrictions on TV-station ownership in place. Cox      Enterprises, parent of the fourth-biggest cable operator, Cox      Communications, has argued that the big broadcasters are      abusing protections granted them under federal law. The      broadcasters, Cox argues, are using those protections to      charge cable systems more for their cable channels. Cox and      others have complained to the FCC that media companies make      them accept less-popular cable channels in exchange for      carrying their broadcast networks.       Media companies counter that their consolidation only puts      them on a level playing field with cable operators, who are      themselves merging into giants. Comcast Corp.'s acquisition      of AT Corp.'s cable division last year gave it a reach of      more than 21 million homes, for instance, almost 30% of homes      served by cable. Comcast has already begun to tell cable      channels it wants to save money on what it pays for      programming, setting the scene for increasingly contentious      negotiations with big media companies.       ``There has been so much consolidation'' among the      distributors that ``unless you are equally big . . . you risk      a situation where you can be marginalized,'' says Viacom      President Karmazin.                          following the money       In buying up cable channels, the media conglomerates are      simply following the money. The music business is shrinking      rapidly as piracy eats into sales. Universal Music Group, the      world's biggest, is now thought to be valued at $5 billion to      $6 billion, less than half what it was a few years ago. The      film business is volatile, with a quarter's performance      dependent on whether movies bomb or not. The publishing      business is steady but grows at a slow pace. Broadcast      television's audience is shrinking, and its business model is      entirely dependent on advertising revenue, a cyclical      business.       Cable channels are gushing cash because they generate      revenue from two sources--subscriptions and advertising. The      subscriptions don't come directly from customers, but through      cable-TV services, which operate the vast array of wires and      pipelines connected to homes, and through satellite-TV      services that beam the signal. For the right to carry the      programming on their systems, these cable-operating companies      pay a range of monthly fees, from 26 cents a subscriber for      VH-1 to more than $2 for ESPN. These fees, for the most part,      increase every year, providing a steadily rising annuity for      the channel owners.       As cable viewership has increased, so has advertising.      Since 1980, cable-channel ad revenue has risen from      practically nothing to $10.8 billion in 2002, according to      the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau. Some channels,      meanwhile, are cashing in on strong brand names. Nickelodeon,      for one, is a merchandising powerhouse, with products      including Dora the Explorer backpacks and SpongeBob      SquarePants videogames.       The result has been an explosion in profits. MTV earned      just $54 million in 1989, estimates Kagan World Media, but is      expected to make more than 10 times that much this year. QVC,      the home shopping channel, generates so much money that      Liberty Media recently agreed to buy full ownership of the      channel at a value of about $14 billion--the same value put      on all of Vivendi Universal's film and TV assets.       Cable channels' surging profits have transformed the bottom      lines of their parent companies. E.W. Scripps Co., the 125-     year-old Cincinnati newspaper publisher and TV-station owner,      now relies on its cable division for much of its profit      growth. In 1994, Scripps launched the Home and Garden channel      on the initiative of a TV executive, Ken Lowe, amid      widespread skepticism. One Scripps newspaper publisher      approached Mr. Lowe at the time to complain ``a lot of the      cash that I'm making here is being shipped to you . . . You      better know what you're doing,'' Mr. Lowe recalls.       Nine years later, HGTV has become one of the most popular      cable channels with shows such as ``Design on a Dime'' and      ``House Hunters.'' Scripps added a controlling stake to the      Food Network in 1997. In the second quarter of this year, the      impact of cable channels, including the Home and Garden      channel and the Food Network, was clear; Newspaper and      broadcast-TV profits both fell, while cable-channel profit      jumped 70%, helping Scripps's net profit more than double.      Scripps stock is trading near its 52-week high of $90.65, up      almost 30% for the past 12 months.       The publisher who had complained about the cable-channel      investment recently thanked Mr. Lowe, now Scripps's CEO,      noting that the rise in Scripps's stock price would put his      three children through college, Mr. Lowe says.       Since 1990, almost half of the top 50 cable channels have      changed hands. Among the big deals: Disney's $19 billion      acquisition of ESPN's parent, Capital Cities/ABC, and Time      Warner's $6.7 billion purchase of CNN parent Turner      Broadcasting, both negotiated in the summer of 1995. In 2001,      Disney bought the Family channel from News Corp. for $5.2      billion.       Last year, NBC bought Bravo for $1.3 billion, CBS, owner of      the Nashville Network (now Spike TV) and Country Music      Television, itself was gobbled up in 2000 by MTV's longtime      parent, Viacom. Viacom has since added channels such as BET      and Comedy Central.       Mr. Karmazin recently boasted to investors that the      company's broadcast and cable outlets reach 26% of the      nation's viewers in prime time, a significantly bigger share      than any other company. Having such a big market share is      ``real important for lots of reasons, in terms of dealing      with advertisers and our cable partners,'' he told investors.       Ad sales and marketing executives from the CBS and MTV      Networks divisions meet regularly to share information and      plot cross-promotional opportunities. In January 2001, MTV      staged the halftime show for the Super Bowl, which was      broadcast on CBS, featuring performances from Aerosmith and      Britney Spears.       Last fall, CBS helped stem a slide in young women viewers      of its reality blockbuster series ``Survivor'' with a      documentary on the series that ran repeatedly on MTV before      the new season of Survivor premiered. The premiere episode of      ``Survivor'' on CBS saw a 25% jump in its young female      audience, says George Schweitzer, executive vice president of      marketing for CBS. CBS promoted its sitcom ``King of Queens''      through a special last Friday on Viacom's Comedy Central      cable channel.                         protecting one another       The broadcast and cable sides of Viacom generally don't try      to sell ads jointly, but the common ownership allows them to      protect each other's flanks. At a presentation to advertisers      last spring, MTV executives compared the audience reach for      most of MTV Networks with ABC, NBC, Fox and WB--but CBS's      figures weren't included in the breakdown, so that MTV didn't      siphon ads from its corporate cousin.       Meanwhile, Disney's ownership of both ABC and ESPN allows      it to spread out the cost of expensive sports packages such      as its deals with the National Football League and the      National Basketball Association. ABC Sports is, in fact,      overseen by the same executive who runs ESPN, George      Bodenheimer, and the two operations regularly promote each      other's programming and share talent.       Joint ownership of cable and broadcast is particularly      valuable in negotiations with cable operators. A 1992 law      allows broadcasters to regularly renegotiate the price for      carrying TV stations' signal on cable. While broadcasters      could charge a cash fee, they usually offer the broadcast      stations free in exchange for carrying a new cable channel      they've launched. Few viewers would subscribe to cable if      ABC, CBS or NBC weren't on the channel line-up, so the cable      operators have little leverage.       The strategy lets broadcasters add more cable channels,      including many narrowly focused networks. Since 1993, big      media companies have launched at least 35 new cable channels      by bartering the right to carry their broadcast stations,      estimates George Callard, an attorney with Cinnamon Mueller,      a law firm that is counsel to the American Cable Association.       Using such a strategy, cable operators say, Disney has      shoehorned its Soapnet cable channel, which features reruns      of soaps such as ``General Hospital,'' into services reaching      33 million homes. Disney argues that fewer than half of those      homes have the channel as a result of a barter arrangement.       Cox Enterprises complained in a filing with the FCC in      January that Cox Communications has to agree to carry Soapnet      nationally in exchange for the right to offer ABC stations in      just a few of its markets. A Disney spokesman says Cox is a      ``savvy negotiator'' that ``wouldn't have signed the deal      unless they found value in it.''       Catalina Cable, a cable-TV operator on Catalina Island off      the California coast, has only 1,449 customers. Ralph Morrow,      Catalina's owner, says he was asked to carry Soapnet when he      tried to renew his right to carry a Disney ABC affiliate for      the beginning of 2000. He says he suggested paying cash for      ABC instead. Disney's response was that the cash fee for ABC      would be ``really high,'' he says. ``They made it clear to      me'' that he didn't have that option ``at a reasonable      price.'' A Disney spokesman says Mr. Morrow mischaracterized      its offer, noting that Disney offers operators ``multiple      options, including a stand-alone cash offer which we believe      to be a fair offer and fair value.''       Mr. Morrow, who says he doesn't see the need for a soap-     opera channel, now pays Disney 11 cents a subscriber for      Soapnet. Disney responds that surveys of viewers have shown      Soapnet to be popular. The channel drew 97,000 viewers in      July and August, according to Nielsen. In the same period,      HGTV--which is available in about two and a half times as      many homes--averaged 457,000 viewers.
