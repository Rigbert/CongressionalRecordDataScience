 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 9:15 a.m. tomorrow, Friday July 25; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate resume consideration of S. 3268, and immediately proceed to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on S. 3268, the energy speculation legislation. I further ask that the time from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. be equally divided and controlled by the leaders in alternating 30-minute blocks of time, with the Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes and the majority controlling the next 30 minutes. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that Senators have until 10 a.m. Friday to file second-degree amendments.
