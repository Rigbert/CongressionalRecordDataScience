Chairman, I appreciate the chairman's yielding.  First of all, I would express my opposition to the amendment being offered by the gentleman from Arizona. We have an authorized activity and the subcommittee has earmarked this project.  I have a philosophical difference with the approach that the Member has taken, as a Member of the House of Representatives, because we are a co-equal branch of the United States Government, and the last time I looked at the budget of this country was in excess of some trillions of dollars.  The gentleman mentioned catastrophic failures. I would mention that the administration spent a great deal of money in their budget request on about 10,000 trailers in response to a great natural crisis. Those trailers are sitting out in the middle of Arkansas.  The chairman of the committee talked about Hanford. That was not an earmark, but it was requested by the administration. If this committee and all of the members of this committee did not continue as we do every day to exercise oversight and deliberate activity and judgment, they would still be spending more of the taxpayers' hard-earned moneys than is necessary.  There is under construction in the State of California, and I don't mean to single them out, but the gentleman mentioned catastrophic failures, the National Ignition Facility that some years ago was on time and under budget. It was an administration request.  We are not defunct of all wisdom. The administration is not. There is a balance to be struck; and in a budget in excess of some trillions of dollars I do believe this subcommittee, under this chairman and the Members on it, have made wise and reasoned and specific decisions.  I am adamantly opposed to the amendment offered by the gentleman.
