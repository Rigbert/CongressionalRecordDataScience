 Carl Henry Lindner, Jr., was Greater Cincinnati's most successful entrepreneur and a self-made man. He passed away this October 17. He was 92 years old.  Carl Lindner was born in Dayton, OH, in 1919, the son of a dairyman. He quit high school to help out in his father's dairy. That store grew into United Dairy Farmers, a chain of dairy and convenience stores that many northern Kentuckians frequent to this day to buy their famous ice cream.  Mr. Lindner made much of his living in the banking and insurance business. His name became famous across northern Kentucky and Ohio and nationwide as the owner of the Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2005. Carl also ran an amusement park and his hometown newspaper, the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Always the optimist, Carl was famous for carrying cards with him that he would hand out to anyone he met with motivational sayings printed on them. One frequent version of the card would read: ``Only in America! Gee, am I lucky!''  Carl spent much of his time working for his community, bringing thousands of high-paying jobs to Cincinnati and northern Kentucky. He has been called a ``one-man Chamber of Commerce.'' He also was renowned for his philanthropic efforts. He gave generously of his time and resources to charities, churches, universities, museums, organizations serving the underprivileged, and even children in Sri Lanka orphaned by the 2005 tsunami.  I had the benefit of knowing Carl for a long time very well. He was an amazing man, and his loss will be deeply felt by many. Elaine and I send our condolences to his wife Edyth; his sons, Carl III, Craig, and Keith; his 12 grandchildren, 5 great grandchildren, and many other beloved family members and friends.  The passing of Carl Lindner is a true loss for the people of northern Kentucky, Ohio, and the Nation. I know my Senate colleagues join me in remembering and honoring Carl for his very American success story, his service to his community, and the example he leaves behind for others of a full life well lived.  Madam President, the Cincinnati Enquirer recently published an obituary of Carl Lindner. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in full in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Oct. 18, 2011]                     Carl Henry Lindner: 1919-2011 Billionaire Investor, Dead at 92, Was Cincinnati's Biggest Benefactor                            (By Cliff Peale)       From humble beginnings running his father's dairy store in      Norwood, Carl Henry Lindner Jr. grew into a billionaire, a      friend of U.S. presidents and Greater Cincinnati's most      successful entrepreneur.       For nearly a century until he died late Monday at age 92,      the former Reds owner never shed the fierce competitiveness      and loyalty that made him a hometown icon.       His influence ran to every corner of Greater Cincinnati.      The high-school dropout bought and sold Kings Island, the      Reds, Provident Bank and the Enquirer. His name is on      buildings from the University of Cincinnati's business school      to the tennis center at Lunken Playfield.       But it was the banking and insurance business that made him      a billionaire. At his death, his American Financial Group      Inc. controlled assets of nearly $32 billion and he was      routinely listed as one of the richest men in America.       Ever the optimist, Lindner often carried an inch-thick      stack of cards with motivational sayings--one was ``Only in      America! Gee, am I lucky!''--that he handed out to anyone he      would meet.       He was a teetotaler, physically unimposing yet with a      prominent shock of white hair and a penchant for wearing      flashy neckties.       Even to his closest friends and colleagues, he was soft-     spoken and rarely confrontational. Yet some business partners      complained about unfair treatment and he flashed a harsh      temper when confronting reporters who wrote what he perceived      as unfriendly stories or criticism of his business dealings.       A devout Baptist and a longtime member of Kenwood Baptist      Church, Lindner used his wealth and influence behind the      scenes to become Greater Cincinnati's largest benefactor and      economic development force. At the height of his personal      giving he contributed millions of dollars a year to      charitable causes, and brought thousands of high-paying jobs      to downtown Cincinnati.       His companies brought thousands of employees to the region,      and the annual Christmas party that he threw at Music Hall      attracted some of the nation's biggest acts, including Bill      Cosby and Frank Sinatra.                      Considered himself outsider       At the same time, Lindner thought of himself as an      outsider, building his business career outside of      Cincinnati's old-money elite. He was never a member of many      of the most exclusive business and country clubs and his bar-     the-doors business style, starting with a hostile takeover of      Provident Bank in the mid-1960s, was out of place in always      polite Cincinnati.       Perhaps the most public role of his career was his      ownership of the Cincinnati Reds from 1999 to 2005. Lindner      owned a minority stake both before and after that period but      was the Reds' CEO for six seasons, and each of those years      the team lost more games than it won.       He approved the trade for Ken Griffey Jr. in 2000, even      sending his private jet to bring Griffey to Cincinnati and      then personally driving the hometown star back to Cinergy      Field from Lunken Airport in his Rolls-Royce.       But as the Reds' losses mounted, Lindner never spoke      publicly to fans and privately bristled at talk-radio      criticism.       That period ended in late 2005 when Lindner sold a      controlling stake in the Reds to a group headed by Bob      Castellini.       Shy and scornful of reporters, Lindner nevertheless became      a focus of media attention because of his substantial wealth      and his far-flung business dealings.       The controversies included millions of dollars in political      contributions as his Chiquita Brands International Inc. was      waging a trade war with European countries, a bevy of      lawsuits and federal charges over business deals that      benefited Lindner and his company more than other      shareholders, and a high-profile battle with the Enquirer in      1998 over a series of critical stories on Chiquita.       Lindner built a national reputation in the 1980s as a high-     risk trader, becoming a business partner of symbols of the      decade's excess such as junk-bond king Michael Milken and      Cincinnati's own Charles Keating.       He was the classic ``value investor,'' buying properties      few other investors wanted and waiting years, or even      decades, to reap the benefits.       That gave him a portfolio including the old Penn Central      railroad, Circle K convenience stores and New York City      landmark Grand Central Station.       But Lindner spent the two decades before his death shedding      assets that didn't deal with insurance and transferring      others to his three sons. That left American Financial as      mostly an insurance and financial services company.       He lost his stake in Chiquita in 2002 when that company      emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In 2004, Lindner, his      family and American Financial reaped nearly $1 billion in      stock when they sold Cincinnati's Provident Financial Group      Inc. to Cleveland-based National City Corp.       The moves consolidated the business around safer insurance      businesses. Lindner also transferred tens of millions of      dollars to his three sons and their families, solidifying for      generations a wealth that he never enjoyed growing up.                         Starting from scratch       Born April 22, 1919, in Dayton, Ohio, Carl Henry Lindner      Jr. was the firstborn of a modest dairyman and his wife,      Clara.       Lindner quit high school to help in his father's Norwood      dairy store. Along with his father, he and his brothers      Robert and Richard, and sister Dorothy, built it into United      Dairy Farmers, a chain of dairy and convenience stores.       When the family founded what now is UDF on Montgomery Road      in Norwood in 1940, the first day's sales amounted to $8.28.       Lindner often talked about the modest surroundings of his      childhood, noting more than once that he picked up dates in      an ice-cream truck.       Robert Lindner's family eventually took control of UDF, and      Richard Lindner became sole owner of the Thriftway      supermarket chain before selling it to Winn-Dixie Stores.       Lindner married the former Ruth Wiggeringloh of Norwood in      1942. They divorced seven years later with no children. He      then married the former Edyth Bailey in 1951, and they have      three sons who all went into the family business: Carl III,      Craig and Keith.       Lindner cautiously entered the savings-and-loan and      insurance business, founding his flagship company American      Financial Corp. in 1959. In the early 1970s the company      gained control of Great American Insurance, which would      become its chief operating business.       Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the company bought and sold      companies in a variety of industries. Lindner took the      company private in 1981 and released little financial      information to the public, but in 1995 the company sold stock      to public shareholders under the new umbrella of American      Financial Group Inc.       In 2003, Keith Lindner left American Financial to      concentrate on the family's charitable pursuits. In 2004 Carl      and Craig Lindner were named co-CEOs of the company while      Carl Lindner Jr. remained chairman.       Lindner was a conservative icon, lobbying against Robert      Mapplethorpe's 1990 exhibit at the Contemporary Arts Center      here and funding the Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy.       But he was pragmatic as well, contributing more than $1      million to Democratic President Bill Clinton during Chiquita      Brands' battle over European banana quotas. He was well known      as one of the biggest givers in the country to both political      parties.                             The good life       Lindner developed a taste for the good life, including a      sprawling home in Indian Hill and nearly a dozen Rolls-Royce      automobiles--with the trademark ``CHL'' license plate--that      he drove himself well into his 80s.       He also owned a home in the exclusive Ocean Reef community      of North Key Largo, Fla. There, he entertained lavishly,      including hosting former President George Bush in the early      1990s.       Lindner traveled around the country in his own private jet.      He dined often at exclusive restaurants like the Maisonette      or the Waterfront--where he was an investor--and also became      a regular at Trio in Kenwood.       Lindner received nearly every award Cincinnati has to      offer, including induction into Junior Achievement's Greater      Cincinnati Business Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Great Living      Cincinnatian award in 1994.       He was also on the board of directors of Citizens for      Decency through Law, an anti-pornography group headed by      American Financial co-founder and one-time Executive Vice      President Charles Keating.       Among numerous awards and honors throughout his career,      Lindner was named Man of the Year of the United Jewish Appeal      in 1978 and received the Friars Club Centennial Award in      1985. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by UC in 1985 and      by Xavier University in 1991.                       Services not scheduled yet       Lindner's family has not yet scheduled memorial or funeral      services.       American Financial Group, where Lindner was chairman, said      Tuesday that the family had requested memorial gifts be made      to Kenwood Baptist Church.       Lindner is survived by wife Edyth, sons Carl III, Craig and      Keith, 12 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.
