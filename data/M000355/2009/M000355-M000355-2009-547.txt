 President, I rise today to honor a well-respected Kentuckian, Dr. John Logan. Mr. Logan's outstanding dedication to Kentucky history is truly immeasurable as is his devotion to the Commonwealth itself.  Recently the Gleaner in Henderson, KY, published a story highlighting Dr. Logan's new book about the extraordinary history of Methodist Hospital in Henderson, KY. The story highlights not only Dr. Logan's allegiance to the medical industry but his unknown talents as an archivist. Dr. Logan was able to compile such a vast amount of research for his new book because, as he says, he ``lived'' it. Having been involved with the hospital since 1962, Dr. Logan has certainly seen his share of history firsthand. Without Dr. Logan's remarkable efforts to preserve history, the triumphant story of this great Kentucky institution would be lost forever.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Logan as a true patriot and Kentuckian whose legacy will forever be remembered, and I further ask unanimous consent to have the full article printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Gleaner, Jan. 17, 2009]  Time To Tell the Story: Local Physician Administers Dose of History                   With New Book on Methodist Hospital                           (By Judy Jenkins)       It wasn't so much a want as it was a need.       And it wasn't so much a need as it was a deep conviction      that time wouldn't wait forever and something important could      be lost.       That's why, five years ago, Dr. John Logan began a long-     contemplated project that required the patience of a saint,      more than a few detective skills, and the excavation of      nearly half a century of his own memories.       The result, just off the press, is the 192-page ``History      of Methodist Hospital, Henderson, Ky., 1948-2008.''       The hardcover volume, published by McClanahan Publishing      House, Inc. of Lyon County, Ky., is chock full of photographs      and doesn't merely chronicle the development of the hospital      from a simple, one-story brick building with 12 doctors and      35 employees to the towering complex it is today.       It also pays tribute to the legions of people of all ages,      races and socio-economic backgrounds who have done everything      from polishing the floors and baking the bread to utilizing      space age diagnostic technology and performing life-saving      procedures.       ``I decided it was time to tell the story,'' says John, who      has served as the hospital's medical director for 22 years,      been president of the medical staff, and completed 19 terms      as chief of the medical staff.       His thought, he said, was, ``If I don't tell it, it's      gone.''       He couldn't let that happen because ``It's a great story.      That this hospital all these years has survived across the      river from hospitals twice our size. That says we're doing      something right.''       Because he has been associated with the hospital since 1962      and has witnessed its growth and advancements, he didn't have      to spend all of his time in a basement room with dusty boxes      of scrapbooks and loose clippings.       ``I've LIVED the research,'' he said, grinning.       He came to this area as a brand new physician, hanging out      his shingle in Sebree in his wife Jackie's home county.       Probably no one in his native Edmonson County had expected      him or his brother Tom to become doctors. Their family was      thick with attorneys, but the siblings opted to follow the      medical path.       John's mentor was a country doctor named Sidney Farmer, who      hired him at age 14 to clean his offices. When John got a      driver's license, he drove Farmer to make house calls.       A year after the youthful family practitioner came to these      parts, he was introduced to a dynamic 31-year-old named      Charles ``Chuck'' Jarrett, who had accepted the post of      Methodist Hospital executive director.       Chuck, who was a former Marine and ``a dreamer'' who had      the unique ability to persuade others to dream with him, soon      was plotting a tall, gleaming modern hospital on that hill      off Twelfth and Elm Streets.       When he died, far too young, in 1973, the institution had      four sprawling wings and was just as he had envisioned it.       Since that time, his successors Ron Chapman and Bruce      Begley have kept the dreams alive and the hospital is flanked      by a North Tower and South Tower.       In his book, John fleshes out what otherwise could be the      bare bones of history. For instance, he relates that in      addition to being a popular veteran pediatrician and hunter,      Dr. John Jenkins is a pig farmer.       The author says Jenkins once told him, ``If I work very      hard practicing medicine, I can almost cover my losses in pig      farming.''       John also writes about the late Dr. M.G. Veal, a fellow      with a well developed sense of humor and hobby sideline as a      trumpet player in several area bands. He smoked, though he      knew better, and ``His trademark was a cigarette with an inch      of ashes hanging.''       (I can vouch for that mischievous sense of humor. Once he      passed me in the hospital lobby and loudly congratulated me.      When I, confused, asked why he was congratulating me, he      said, ``I just heard that you're expecting your tenth child,      Mrs. Jenkins!'' Heads turned, believe me. For the record, I      only had three kids at the time and the fourth and last was      born a year later).       As I read the book, I was reminded of the tragic losses the      hospital medical staff has suffered over the years.       Among them, the death of the young and much-revered Dr.      W.B. Blue, who practiced in Henderson's East End. He died in      a vehicular accident here.       And there was Dr. Elton House, who was reaching the height      of his career when he drowned during an outing on Barkley      Lake.       And Dr. Joe McGruder, who had brought so many babies into      the world, lost his life while scuba diving on vacation.       John is proud of the fact that he unearthed photos of every      Methodist Hospital physician--but one--who was on the      original staff, or who had served at least 20 years.       His only failure was Dr. Ira Cosby, an original staff      member who regularly made house calls and was never known to      drive faster than 35 mph.       John and his faithful helpers searched high and low,      contacting relatives and doing everything possible to come up      with a likeness of the doctor, but had to admit defeat.       There are numerous photos of hospital employees who have      made their own marks on the institution. They include the      late Bill Beck, director of materials management. He was a      soft-spoken man who never minded going above and beyond the      call of duty to honor a request.       James ``Rip'' Van Winkle was like that too, and I don't      recall an instance when the late director of building and      grounds left a room without relating an anecdote or witticism      that had everyone laughing.       John himself could fill a book, but because space is      limited we'll just say he played a major role in many things      we take for granted here, including the spacious YMCA, the      Henderson Fine Arts Center, the Depot/Tourism Center--and the      hospital's Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Unit that makes      it possible to care for most of the tiniest and sickest      babies right here.       He's not happy about everything related to the hospital. It      just irks him that while the facility regularly performs      cardiac catheterizations and has a staff of 24 cardiologists      as well as a dedicated telemetry unit, it hasn't yet been      able to obtain a state Certificate of Need to permit      angioplasty procedures or stent placements here.       He'll keep pursuing that, no doubt, as he has, at 71, no      immediate plans to retire.       Nor does he plan a sequel to the history.       ``I've done the first 60 years. Somebody else will have to      do the next 60.''                          ____________________
