Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with the Kyoto Protocol that has been debated a number of times on the House floor within literally the last several days, as well as committee; and I would simply want to point out several things.  One is, Kyoto did not simply come full clothed from the Clinton administration but rather from negotiations begun under President Bush's administration pursuant to a treaty that President Bush signed on June 1, 1992.  There was a Kyoto Protocol subsequent to that, and concerns have been expressed as far as various administration agencies engaging in actions that are not authorized.  The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg) has made a point of this, and I would simply indicate that the concern I have is we have legitimate authorized programs that the various departments in this case, the Department of Energy, should pursue and they should not in any way, shape or form be precluded from doing so because coincidentally they also happen to have been mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol.  I would agree with the concerns expressed on previous occasions by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Knollenberg) that the Kyoto Treaty is not the law of the land. We should not be implementing it; but because there are diversions and parallel tracks in many programs, I do want to make sure that we are clear that we are not in any way inhibiting duly authorized programs from proceeding.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  2030
