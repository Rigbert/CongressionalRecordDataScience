Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. As I was saying before my time expired, Cynthia Snyder is a Republican. But that is not her major activity. She is a member of the board of directors of United We Stand. United We Stand, of course, is the organization that Ross Perot founded. He raised the budget issue to central concern of this country. I think he performed a service in doing so.  Cynthia Snyder is a concerned citizen in my district. Yes, she is a Republican, and she is with United We Stand. But let me read one paragraph of the letter she sent to the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], not to me, but she sent me a copy of it.  She said,       Why can't Congress get on with their statutory and      constitutional mandates to fund the government, instead of      holding government employees and the public hostage to their      own 7-year budget proposals? Most of us know we must curtail      spending and many of us worked hard to elect deficit hawks,      but does adding millions per day to the deficit by keeping      the government shut down help in any way do that?  She concludes, as I said, by saying,       Besides, I am a Republican, and you are hurting Republican      chances of election to high offices by your amateurish      behavior.  Bob Dole, the majority leader, leading candidate for President of the United States in the Republican Party, said that what we are doing does not make sense. He said as previous speakers said, ``Enough is enough.''  I represent 56,000 Federal employees. They are not responsible for incurring the deficit, and they do not have the power to sit in this body to reduce the deficit. What they try to do is carry out the responsibilities given to them by the executive and legislative branches of Government.  Mr. Speaker, we have held them hostage. We have put families at risk. We have shut down portions of Government, stamped our feet and said, ``Mr. President, if you do not do it our way, we will do it no way.'' Mr. Speaker, that has never before happened in history. Not since 1789 to 1994 has any group with the power to do so, but with the responsibility not to, shut down the Government for 20 days.  Have we had shutdowns before? Yes, but not until 1981, 1982, and then it was for hours, then a half a day, then 1 day over the Columbus Day holiday, the 3-day weekend. But what happened? President Reagan was President and President Bush was President during one or more of those shutdowns. There was a Democratic Congress. When the President would not agree with what we wanted, the Democratic Congress accommodated the President, because that is the constitutional system. If we cannot override a veto, we either need to compromise or not take the action. That is what our Framers contemplated. That is the appropriate way to operate a democracy.  Speaker Gingrich said earlier this year, ``I will cooperate, but I will not compromise.'' My friends, in a democracy I do not know how we come together to make policy without compromising. Not compromising our principles, but agreeing that there are different ways to do things, different ways to accomplish objectives, and know that in good faith, Americans acting through their elected representatives could reach those ends. Not stamp their feet. Not point a gun at the President's head and say, If you don't do it my way, I shut down the Government.  Bob Dole said, ``I don't see any sense in what we've been doing.'' America sees no sense in what we have been doing.                          ____________________
