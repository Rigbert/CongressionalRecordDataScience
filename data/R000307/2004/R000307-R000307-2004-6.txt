President, I have two amendments to offer. I wish to offer them in sequence, taking 2 minutes at most for each one. I propose to only give a very brief description of each amendment.                Amendment No. 4019 To Amendment No. 3981  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 4019.
