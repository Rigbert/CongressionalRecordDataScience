Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Skelton], my good friend, for his very kind words and for his support for the amendment I am offering.  Mr. Chairman, eliminating or crippling freedom broadcasting to Cuba, as the Skaggs amendment would do, would sent the wrong message at exactly the wrong time. The Castro dictatorship is at an all-time low in domestic support and international prestige. Like the two recent Clinton-Castro immigration agreements, the silence of Marti-TV would provide new hope for the Castro dictatorship and a fresh dose of despair for the Cuban people.  Mr. Chairman, let me just say that the amendment that I am offering achieves fiscal responsibility by guaranteeing that no funds would be spent for TV-Marti except in accordance with a careful and thoughtful plan for the streamlining and reinvention of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting proposed by the then Director, Mr. Richard Lobo, and approved by USIA Director Dr. Joseph Duffy in March of 1995.  These reforms are going to be implemented; they can save taxpayers money without sacrificing our commitment to end the slavery in Cuba.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
