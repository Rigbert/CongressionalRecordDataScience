President, earlier in this week I was encouraged when Republicans voted with Democrats to approve an amendment I introduced with Senator Sanders that would protect Medicaid beneficiaries from benefit cuts under the budget. But when we actually look at the Republican budget on Medicaid, it is impossible to square that budget, which has $1.2 trillion in cuts, with the vote that was held earlier this week to protect Medicaid. And we can't get those savings without cutting reimbursements for nursing homes and long-term care services. Medicaid pays 40 percent of all nursing home care.  Colleagues, let us be consistent with our Medicaid vote that was cast earlier this week, and support my amendment.
