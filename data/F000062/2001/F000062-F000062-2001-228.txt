 Most people in California find that they can't win statewide the first time out. Money is one of the issues here. The State is so big.  I harken back to a conversation I had with Alan Simpson. He said he could go home and have lunch at the grill in Cody and he would see all 200 people in Cody. He would campaign that way.  Mr. McCONNELL. Right.
