Parran, a member of the Calvert County Board of Commissioners since 2002 and president of that commission from 2006-2010. It is my distinct honor to share his story of commitment, dedication and public service to Calvert County, to our great State of Maryland and to our Nation.  Commissioner Parran was born and raised in Calvert County, where he still resides today with his wife Deborah. The youngest of ten children, he grew up on a tobacco farm where his parents were sharecroppers. Wilson grew up under segregation. At the age of six, he had to walk a mile to catch the school bus every day, even though some buses stopped on his street. Wilson learned at an early age, as he watched his mother go before the County Board of Education to get a her son a bus ride to school, that you must be an advocate and in so doing you can see government in action. Twenty-five years later, Wilson was serving on that same Calvert County Board of Education, motivated by his experiences to give back to his community and support education for the betterment of all students.  Following his parents' model of hard work and high expectations to reach for your dreams, Wilson worked his way from entry-level technology positions to a top telecommunications executive. In 1969 he went on leave to join the military, serving in the Air Force for 4 years during the Vietnam War era. Wilson had been out of high school for 12 years before he received his first degree. While serving on the school boards he was going to school himself, and became the first member of his family to graduate from college. An advocate of lifelong learning, Wilson served on the Calvert County Board of Education for 6 years and the Maryland Board of Education for 5 years. Commissioner Parran is past president of the Maryland Association of Counties, MACo, and represented Calvert County on the MACo Legislative Committee. He has served on numerous civic organizations including being on the Calvert Memorial Hospital Foundation Board and president of the Maryland Association of Board of Education, MABE. He is a member of the NAACP and was the recipient of the MABE 2007 Charles W. Willis Award for outstanding School Board Leadership.  Mr. Parran was elected to the Calvert County Board of County Commissioners in 2002, and achieved re-election in 2006. Following his re-election, board members crossed party lines to elect him as president, a position in which he has demonstrated courage, judgment, and integrity.  Calvert County has been well served by Commissioner Parran's two decades of dedicated public service. He has been an ardent advocate for maintaining Calvert County's quality of life, assuring a balance between its rich agricultural heritage and its expanded economic base. We are indebted to his service and leadership and know that his parent's would be so proud to see that the foundation they set of strong family values and commitment to community have reaped many fruits.  Madam Speaker and colleagues, please join me in honoring Commissioner Wilson H. Parran for his years of public service, dedicated work and commitment to excellence on behalf of the people of Calvert County.                          ____________________
