Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4894) to provide for certain access to national crime information databases by schools and educational agencies for employment purposes, with respect to individuals who work with children.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4894       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ACCESS TO NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION DATABASES BY                    SCHOOLS AND EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FOR CERTAIN                    PURPOSES.       (a) In General.--The Attorney General of the United States      shall, upon request of the chief executive officer of a      State, conduct fingerprint-based checks of the national crime      information databases (as defined in section 534(f)(3)(A) of      title 28, United States Code, as redesignated under      subsection (e)), pursuant to a request submitted by an entity      of the State, or unit of local government, which is      designated to conduct background checks on individuals      employed by, under consideration for employment by, or      volunteering for, a private or public elementary school,      private or public secondary school, local educational agency,      or State educational agency in that State in a position in      which the individual would work with or around children.      Where possible, the check shall include a fingerprint-based      check of State criminal history databases. The Attorney      General and the States may charge any applicable fees for      these checks.       (b) Protection of Information.--An individual having      information derived as a result of a check under subsection      (a) may release that information only to an appropriate      officer of a private elementary school, private secondary      school, local educational agency, or State educational      agency, or to any person authorized by law to receive that      information.       (c) Criminal Penalties.--An individual who knowingly      exceeds the authority in subsection (a), or knowingly      releases information in violation of subsection (b), shall be      imprisoned not more than 10 years or fined under title 18,      United States Code, or both.       (d) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``elementary      school'', ``local educational agency'', ``secondary school'',      and ``State educational agency'', have the meanings given to      those terms in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary      Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).       (e) Technical Correction.--Section 534 of title 28, United      States Code, as amended by section 905(a) of the Violence      Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act      of 2005 (Public Law 109-162), is further amended by      redesignating the second subsection (e) as subsection (f).
