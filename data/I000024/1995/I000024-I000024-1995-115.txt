 Let me compliment both the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from Alaska for being understanding and looking at an amendment with which I have a problem. I believe the section, which is 8078, clearly violates the current statutory 60-40 relationship between contract and private maintenance, inhouse depot maintenance.  I also believe that this section would violate the intent of the whole BRAC process.  I appreciate very much the willingness of the Senator from Hawaii to pull out section 8078, and I inquire of the chairman of the committee, is it necessary to propose it as an amendment?
