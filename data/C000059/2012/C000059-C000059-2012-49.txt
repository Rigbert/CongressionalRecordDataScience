Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of San Clemente, California are exceptional. Courtney Smith is an exceptional young woman and on February 23, 2012, Courtney will receive a prestigious honor when the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce names her the 2012 Citizen of the Year at the organization's annual awards and installation dinner at the Talega Golf Club.  Courtney is the 15-year-old daughter of Christina and Jeff Smith, sister to Amy and Andrew, and sister-in-law to Bobby. Courtney Faye Smith was born with a genetic disorder called Spinal Muscular Atrophy; it is a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy. She has never been able to walk and has been driving a wheelchair since she was four years old and has a service dog, Michaela. Her body is in pain every single day of her life, but you would never know it or hear her complain. Through it all, she always remains light in heart and spirit.  Courtney is a freshman at San Clemente High School and is currently receiving straight A's. Besides choir, all of her classes are Advanced Academic. She is extremely social and attends every football game as well as school plays. She adores singing and is currently saving to go to Hawaii with her high school choir `Acapella' to perform over spring break.  Courtney loves to sew and loves fashion design. She is contemplating the idea of going to college to become a costume designer. She also enjoys horseback riding, which she has done since the age of four and has won several blue ribbons. She also loves to train dogs and hopes to help train service dogs in the future. Courtney has been a Muscular Dystrophy Ambassador for close to 10 years and a Make-A-Wish Ambassador for 7 years.  Courtney is very humble; she never asks for anything, and despite life's challenges, she is happy and content with life. She loves her family dearly and they treasure her. This is a special year for Courtney, as she will see one of her dreams come to fruition, with the development of ``Courtney's SandCastle.''  The idea for ``Courtney's SandCastle'' was cultivated because, as most kids do, Courtney always wanted to play on playgrounds as a little girl. Her mom knew it was next to impossible, so they would drive to Los Angeles in order to play on an accessible playground where, amongst other things, she could reach the sandbox from her wheelchair and actually swing on the swing set by herself, safely buckled in. ``Courtney's SandCastle'' is a universal playground, which was developed as a part of the Vista Hermosa/La Pata Community Park. It will serve special needs children and adults as well as able-bodied children. Special recreational equipment will also be available to handicapped veterans. Along with many amazing and supportive community members, Courtney has remained tenacious and followed this project through after almost 10 years to ensure that ``Courtney's SandCastle'' is completed.  In light of all Courtney has done for the community of San Clemente, the San Clemente Chamber of Commerce named Courtney their Citizen of the Year. I am humbled by the composure and tenacity of this young woman who has faced more challenges in her life than many of us will in our entire lifetime. I know that many community members are inspired and grateful for Courtney's service and I join them in saluting her as she receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
