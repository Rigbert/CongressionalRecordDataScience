Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for taking this Special Order. I certainly welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues on developing a plan that makes sense.  As we go back home, particularly this next week and a half with Congress out of session, as we look at our mail that comes in virtually every day, there is a real human cry for us to do something about pharmaceutical drugs and to try and work together to allow this to happen for today's seniors.  I am sorry that I was a little bit late when this Special Order started. We all have a number of hearings that have been going on, so I missed the beginning. I saw some of the charts just briefly before I left my office to come over. But we are part of a group that is working on a comprehensive plan that tries to do a number of things. Obviously, we have been the leader in terms of the pharmaceutical industry looking for drugs that are going to save lives and in effect save big time in costs. We heard today, the three of us, in our committee a woman from Pennsylvania with osteoporosis, or from Florida, or maybe California. Anyway, she was a wonderful lady.
