President, reserving the right to object.  First, the Senator is chairman of the committee which has jurisdiction for this particular amendment, so he has complete--in fact, more than complete--authority to bring it up in regular order and bring it forward to the floor. In addition, we have been advised by the Department of Justice that these provisions are not necessary, given the scope of existing law with respect to terrorists and with respect to anyone who conducts a terrorist act. Perhaps an example of that is the Boston bombing, where there is now someone condemned to death for terrorist activities--not involving a nuclear device, but I hardly think he would get any less of a sentence regardless of the device he used.  So for all these reasons, I object.
