Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the tragic anniversary of his assassination. In the 38 years since his untimely death, Dr. King and his work for civil rights has remained an inspiration to thos committed to liberty and freedom throughout the world.  While today marks a sad day in American history, it is my hope that as a nation, we will continue to reflect on the actions and accomplishments of Dr. King. It is my hope that we will celebrate his life and learn from his legacy.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born on January 15, 1929. He received a Bachelor of Arts from Morehouse College in 1948, a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1951, and a Ph.D. in Systematic Theology from Boston University. Throughout his education, Dr. King was involved in civil rights, and in 1955, he led the historic Montgomery Bus Boycott that began after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man. After the Montgomery Bus Boycott launched a national civil rights campaign, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. helped form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957. Dr. King led the SCLC as it promoted, organized, and conducted nonviolent protests in the name of fairness and equality.  The nonviolent manner in which Dr. King fought for fundamental freedoms such as the right to vote and desegregation has had a lasting impact on this country. Perhaps the greatest example of Dr. King's leadership and impact on this country is his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, which he gave in front of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington in 1963, where he talked about his four children living in a nation where they would not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.  In 1968 Dr. King set out for Memphis to support a sanitation strike that called for higher wages and better treatment. Days later, on April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  After his death, the country mourned the loss of our greatest modern-day civil rights pioneer. To this day, Dr. King's work, message, and legacy remain imprinted on the minds of those who carry on his noble cause.  Mr. Speaker, today may be the anniversary of the death of one of our Nation's greatest citizens, but I also hope it is day on which we can reflect on the positive changes that were set in motion due to Dr. King's work. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. raised the consciousness of America; he made our nation re-examine our commitment to freedom and liberty, and he did so with a message of peace and non-violence. I speak for all Americans today as we honor a great man.                          ____________________
