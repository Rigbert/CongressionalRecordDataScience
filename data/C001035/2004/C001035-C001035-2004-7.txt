It is my understanding that the ranking member of the committee, the vice chairman of the committee, is also seeking some additional time.  In between, however, Senator Levin has set a schedule to speak. I appreciate the order amongst Members. I will also be happy to yield 5 minutes from Senator Lieberman's time to Senator Rockefeller.
