Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the members of the Hammond, IN branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People [NAACP]. On Thursday, October 19, 1995, they will hold the Annual Freedom Fund Dinner.  The Hammond NAACP, which has chosen the theme of ``Building Family Values,'' was organized in 1934 by a group of residents that felt there was a need for an organization that would monitor and defend the rights of African-Americans in Northwest Indiana. The national organization, of which the Hammond branch is a member, focuses on providing better and more positive ways of addressing the important issues facing minorities in social and job-related settings.  The Annual Fund Dinner is a major fund raiser for the Hammond branch of the NAACP. In addition, the dinner serves to update and keep the community aware of the accomplishments of the local and national chapters on an annual basis.  Moreover, awards are presented at the dinner to members who have given of themselves above and beyond the planned agenda or the President's request. Those special individuals who will receive awards are the following: Rocharda Moore Morris, President's Award; The Reverend Albert Johnson, Jule Alexander Award; Officer Pete Torres, Community Service Award; and Anthony Higgs, Program Support Award. Pearline Jenkins Scholarship Awards, whose joint contributors are the Hammond NAACP and the Northern Indiana Public Service Co., will be presented to Peter Adams, of Hammond High School, and Marquist L. Spencer, of Morton Senior High School. The Master of Ceremonies is Bernard Carter, Lake County Prosecutor, and the Keynote Speaker is Norman Van Lier, former star of the Chicago Bulls. In addition, Norman will receive a special recognition award.  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate the Hammond Branch of the NAACP for commending these outstanding men and women, who have taken the extra step to improve the quality of life for the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
