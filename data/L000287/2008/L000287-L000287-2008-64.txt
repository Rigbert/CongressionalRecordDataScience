Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, like any other great and necessary journey, the journey to improve Medicare must start with a first step. Although we can and must do more, this bill is that first step.  I want to just mention the pulmonary rehabilitation benefit and thekidney provision, which I strongly support, and the increase in the community health center cap. Seniors deserve a Medicare program that delivers services, supports doctors, and prevents disease.  Take this first step. It is a good step, it is a necessary step. It is the right thing to do. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
