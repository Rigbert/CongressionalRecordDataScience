President, I rise today to introduce legislation to extend and improve a program aimed at addressing the unique needs of rural schools. The Rural Education Achievement Program, or REAP, is designed to help level the playing field for small and high-poverty rural school systems. It is the only dedicated federal funding stream to aid rural school districts in overcoming certain challenges associated with geographic isolation.  Nearly \1/3\ of America's public schools are in rural areas, and more than 21 percent of our public school students attend these schools. Students in rural America should have the same access to federal dollars and quality education as those students who attend schools in urban and suburban communities. For this reason, in 2001, I worked with former Senator Kent Conrad to author the law creating REAP, and I am now pleased to work with Senator Max Baucus on its reauthorization. REAP created two grant programs: the Small and Rural Schools Achievement program SRSA, which provides additional funding and flexibility to small rural school districts, and the Rural and Low-Income School program, RLIS, which provides additional funding for poor rural school districts.  Prior to enactment of this law, rural school districts received funds based on school enrollment. In many of these districts, Federal formula programs, which are population-based, do not produce enough resources to carry out important programs, which these grant programs help make possible. One school district in Maine, for example, received only $28 in 2001 to fund a district-wide Safe and Drug-free school program.  In addition, small and rural school districts often forgo Federal education dollars because they lack the personnel and the resources to apply for competitive grants. Having fewer personnel also creates additional challenges in providing professional development opportunities. By allowing rural school districts to combine funds, as well as providing additional funds, REAP gives these districts the levels of resources required to undertake significant educational reform. Funds from this program have already helped to support new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, and professional development activities, as well as a vast array of other programs that will help rural districts.  The REAP Reauthorization Act of 2013 would reauthorize and implement a few improvements to the law. These changes would allow Federal funds to be even more closely targeted to geographically isolated districts. One important reform would allow program eligible districts to participate in the Rural and Low-Income School program if they would not receive financial benefits from the Small and Rural Schools Achievement program.  Education is an essential driver for good jobs for our citizens. This rings true especially in rural America, where schools are the linchpin of rural communities. I am pleased to have the support of the Maine School Management Association for the REAP Reauthorization Act of chair of the Senate Rural Education Caucus, I will continue to work toward our goal of advancing the educational interests of rural schools and districts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Maine School                                       Management Association,                                       Augusta, ME, June 24, 2013.     Re Reauthorization of REAP     Hon. Susan Collins,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins, The Maine School Boards Association      and the Maine School Superintendents Association want to      thank you for your continued sponsorship of the REAP Program.      Specifically, our Associations are pleased to support the      2013 Reauthorization of REAP. Throughout the years, REAP      funding has helped to provide equity for many small schools      in Maine and our expectation is that will continue with this      Reauthorization.       Both the National School Boards Association and the      American Association of School Administrators are also      supportive of the Reauthorization of REAP.       The Maine School Boards Association and the Maine School      Superintendents Association appreciate your continued support      for public education. We want to commend you for your      willingness to pay attention to various legislative issues      that may impact Maine public schools. We also want to praise      your staff for their expertise and accessibility to our      organizations. As always, our Associations are available as a      resource to you and to your staff.           Sincerely,                                                   Cornelia Brown,     Executive Director.                          ____________________
