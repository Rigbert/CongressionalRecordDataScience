 President, there are a number of factors that caused the economic recession we are faced with today. All of us know that.  We can blame executives on Wall Street, who made reckless choices and ignored long-term consequences to make a quick profit.  We can blame the financial industry regulators, whose lax oversight failed to see the potential risks posed by the new, complex financial products that Wall Street was selling, and we can point a finger at those in the mortgage industry, who ignored that all bubbles eventually burst and that--in the case of housing bubble--the American taxpayers would be left to clean up the mess.  But we also need to look a little closer to home as well. The reality is that one of the contributing causes of this recession is the fact that too many Americans made poor and very often uninformed financial choices when they bought homes in the last several years.  Too many overestimated their own resources, didn't read the fine print, and didn't grasp the terms of their mortgages before signing on the dotted line.  In fact, we need to recognize that too many Americans, from college students to senior citizens, are financially illiterate.  The problem is not limited to mortgage holders. Too many Americans don't know how to budget their household expenses, manage their credit card debt, or even pay their bills on time.  We need to ensure that we don't get into this situation again, by giving all Americans the skills to make sound financial decisions.  We used to say the 3 R's of school are reading, writing, and arithmetic. Well, I think we need to add a fourth R--resource management.  That is why today I am introducing legislation that will help ensure that all Americans get the skills they need to make financial decisions that will protect them and their families.  The Financial and Economic Literacy Improvement Act of 2009 will require the Federal Government to step to the plate and become a real partner in helping Americans manage their finances and make good decisions about housing, employment, and education.  This bipartisan bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Cochran, is aimed at helping people of all ages. Our goal is to ensure that high school and college students know the pitfalls of signing up for credit cards and can make informed decisions about student loans.  All young people understand the importance of saving and making smart decisions to ensure a comfortable and dignified retirement and, most important, that we are taking steps to ensure we do not repeat the misguided and uninformed decisions that have contributed to the recession that we find ourselves in today.  Under our bill, the Federal Government will become a strong supporter of making financial literacy education a core part of K-12 education.  I believe that focusing this effort on young people is critical for two reasons:  One, if we are going to avoid another crisis such as this one, we must begin by teaching the next generation to make smart financial decisions; two, because all signs point to another generation that is coming of age already saddled with debt, and we need to help them before it is too late.  This past Sunday, this article ran on the front page of the Olympian newspaper from my State of Washington. I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  [From the Olympian, Mar. 15, 2009]                    Teens Awash in Credit Card Debt                          (By Les Blumenthal)       The numbers are startling. More than half of all high      school seniors have debit cards and nearly one-third have      credit cards.       One-third of college students have four credit cards apiece      when they graduate, and more than half of graduates have      piled up $5,000 each in high-interest debt. The number of 18-      to 24-year-olds who have declared bankruptcy has increased 96      percent in 10 years.       Surveys show that many of these young people also are      financially illiterate: They don't understand such things as      interest, minimum payments, credit reports, identity theft or      that they might be paying off their school loans for years.       The problem isn't just with the young, however. One in five      Americans thinks that the most practical way to become rich      is to win the lottery.       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., remembers that her kids started      receiving credit card applications when they were 16. She      said that she repeatedly heard from people, young and old,      who wished they knew more about financial matters.       Murray will introduce legislation this week that would      authorize $1.2 billion in grants over five years to promote      financial-literacy education beginning in grade school and      stretching into adulthood.       ``It's a perfect time to be doing this,'' Murray said.       Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, agrees.       ``In light of the problems that have arisen in the subprime      mortgage market, we are reminded how critically important it      is for individuals to become financially literate at an early      age so they are better prepared to make decisions and      navigate an increasingly complex financial marketplace,'' he      said nearly a year ago.       Kerry Eickmeyer, 17, a senior at Richland High School in      Richland gave up her debit card after about a year when she      kept overdrawing her account.       ``My mother was getting frustrated,'' she said.       She and other students at Richland High must take a class      in consumer economics before they can graduate. Eickmeyer      said she received credit card offers all the time and      shredded them.       ``I don't need 10 credit cards,'' she said.       Jesus Pedraza, 19, wished he'd been prepared to handle his      personal finances when he entered Washington's Tacoma      Community College, even though he doesn't have a credit card.       ``I thought I was ready, but money is running out faster      than I thought,'' Pedraza said.       As part of its Human Development 101 class for freshman,      Tacoma Community College devotes a section to personal      finance. Students track their weekly spending and learn about      credit cards, minimum payments, savings plans and      investments. James Mendoza, who teaches the class, said he      focused on the nuts and bolts of finance.       ``We don't expect them to be Warren Buffett, George Soros      or any of the big dogs,'' Mendoza said. ``But they need to      understand whether a venti mocha is a need or a want.''       In the past five years, 17 states added personal finance      requirements to their curricula. Last year, former President      George W. Bush appointed an Advisory Council on Financial      Literacy to work with the private and public sectors to      promote financial education. The council is part of the      Treasury Department. Its members range from the chairman of      Charles Schwab to the leader of Junior Achievement USA.       Murray's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.,      would provide grants to state education agencies that agreed      to establish financial literacy standards and assess how well      students were doing in elementary, middle and high school.      Nonprofit organizations also would be eligible for grants. In      addition, grants would be available to community and four-     year colleges to offer financial literacy classes for their      students and for older adults.       In addition to financial literacy classes offered by school      districts, Junior Achievement operates programs in many      districts. About 4.5 million young people participate in      Junior Achievement programs nationwide.       Other programs also are operating in the schools. Founded      by a bankruptcy judge in New York, the Credit Abuse      Resistance Education program sends bankruptcy judges around      the country to high schools to talk about personal finances.       Pat Williams, a bankruptcy Judge in Spokane, said that when      she walked into a class of 25 or so 10th- or 11th-graders, it      wasn't hard for her to spot the five that would end up in      bankruptcy in three years.       ``They are dealing with so much--cell phones, car      insurance, credit cards, debit cards,'' she said. ``It was      stunning to them to learn there were late charges on a credit      card bill.''       High school and college students can end up paying for      their lack of financial knowledge, said Pam Whalley, the      director of the Center for Economic Education at Western      Washington University. One survey of high school students      found that they expected to earn an average of $143,000 a      year and were confident they could handle the money but that      few knew how to do a budget. College students know little      about savings, insurance and retirement, and are lured to      credit card deals too easily, she said.       ``College kids will do anything for a T-shirt,'' Whalley      said.       In the middle of a recession, she said, educating students      about financial matters is crucial.       ``If you make a mistake during a recession, you have less      to fall back on,'' she said. ``If you make a mistake when      your job isn't safe, you could lose your house or your car.      When you have financial literacy, you have more control over      your life.''
