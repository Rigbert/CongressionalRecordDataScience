Speaker, today I recognize my good friend from the other body, Senator Spencer Abraham.  Senator Abraham is a good American and a great Michigander. Over the years, I have gotten to know Senator Abraham well and I can truly say his family has lived the American dream. His maternal grandfather came to America from Lebanon, began a new life in America as a peddler and eventually opened his own grocery store. His paternal grandfather was also a Lebanese immigrant who worked in the West Virginia coal mines before seeking a better life in Michigan as an autoworker and grocery store owner. Spence's dad was also an autoworker, and with his wife, owned a small shop in downtown Lansing.  As Michigan's U.S. Senator, Spencer put the strong values he learned from his family into action. He worked hard and lived his dream. Spence was the first member of his family to attend college and went on to earn his law degree. Prior to serving as our Senator, Spencer served as Michigan's Republican Chairman and in the Reagan Administration.  Since Senator Abraham's election in 1994, I have had the distinct opportunity to work with him on a host of issues of importance both to the people of our state and the nation. And, his record speaks for itself. As a United StatesSenator, he has truly been a workhorse--and it's paid off. Senator Abraham is one of the few Members of the Senate that can say 16 bills he wrote have been signed into law.  One of the things I am most proud of is our work this past Congress to protect kids across America from the dangers of ``date rape'' drugs. By working together, we were able to write and pass a bill that outlaws the dangerous substance, GHB, and its close chemical cousins. This legislation was named in memory of Samantha Reid, a southeast Michigan teenager who died in 1999 after drinking from a can of Mountain Dew that was secretly laced with GHB.  I would personally like to thank Senator Abraham for his assistance this past year to secure badly needed funds from Southwest Michigan's farmers whose crops had been devastated by fireblight. By working together we were able to deliver much needed relief to these farmers.  Mr. Speaker, Senator Spencer Abraham has left a distinct mark on our nation. I submit my remarks into the Congressional Record to ensure that future generations have the opportunity to be inspired by the contributions of Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan.                          ____________________
