Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  It's already been referenced earlier by the Speaker, and by Mr. Blumenauer, that one thing we could do for the ailing American economy to put people back to work, quite quickly this year, this construction year, would be investment in our infrastructure. These would be American jobs with American products. They can't be exported. The benefits are here at home. It will make our country more competitive in the international marketplace. They help businesses with just-in-time delivery. You're now seeing trucks detoured by 100, 200 miles because of failing and weight-limited bridges. There's a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done.  It would also make us more energy efficient by helping to obviate some of the congestion that we're currently suffering from, the detours that I already mentioned.  If we set a goal, for instance, of looking at our largest cities, having 10 percent of people take transit to work, we could save 40 percent from the oil that we currently import from the Middle East. That would be tremendous for national security, our balance of trade, and great for the American people and good for the environment.  Now, some might say that's too ambitious. Well, I just came back, or I took the committee on a trip to Europe. In London, more than 85 percent of the people ride transit to work. And in Barcelona, they're investing more money in one addition to their subway system, which is at capacity right now, than we're investing in all transit in the entire continent of the United States of America.  We are not pushing the margins here in terms of our investment. We can do better and we can learn from the past and, at the same time, look to a more transportation efficient future by observing this commemoration of Gallatin and beginning to construct our own version of a Gallatin report as we move to the reauthorization of the surface transportation and transit legislation in 2009.
