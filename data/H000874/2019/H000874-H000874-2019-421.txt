Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, let me make very clear that which ought to be very clear: We believe the President of the United States, with the aiding and abetting of the majority leader of the United States Senate, has taken the Government of the United States hostage, and the President of the United States is asking for ransom, and that ransom is to accept his policy or go home and stay shut down.  I will tell the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, that I have been in this body for a long time. I am in my fourth decade. I have never supported shutting down the Government of the United States.  Now, the gentleman may point out that I have voted from time to time against bills that would have opened it up because of things that were in the bills and these bills passed the House of Representatives when you were in charge. They did not pass the Senate, of course.                              {time}  1100  I believe that shutting down the people's government is an unacceptable--unacceptable--tactic in a democracy when one is discussing differences that need to be resolved. Unacceptable.  Furthermore, as I said on the floor the other day, Mr. Speaker, I can find no free government in the world that shuts itself down, other than the United States of America. Now, we have a relatively unique system of government.  But I will tell my friend that we are for border security. We have supported bills that affected border security. During our tenure, there was more border security fencing, I will tell the gentleman, constructed than when they had been in charge over the last 8 years. Look at the record.  But the issue is, we are not going to negotiate at the point of a gun, which is shutting down the Government of the United States, affecting 800,000 of our employees.  Some of you say: I run a business. I am a businessman.  Well, if you are a car company, or you are a real estate company, or you are a contractor, or whatever you may do, can you tell your employees: I am going to have you work, but by the way, I am not going to pay you.  Mr. Speaker, we want to negotiate. We want to get this resolved, but we are not going to pretend this is business as usual. This is the longest shutdown in history, and the other side has consistently voted against every bill that we have offered to open up government.  Now, the other side offered a bill where they want to pay employees while they don't work. I voted against that. I think the taxpayer deserves to have his employees or her employees working, and, yes, he should pay them and she should pay them for working, not some stopgap measure to pretend that somehow we are lessening the consequences of a shutdown, in light of a consistent, overwhelming vote on the other side of the aisle to keep government shut down.  I tell my friend, he voted against Boehner, when he was the Speaker of the House, requesting to open up the government. Maybe he believes, Mr. Speaker, that shutting down the government is good policy, good practice, the way to treat your employees. I emphatically reject such a premise.  When the gentleman asked me if will we negotiate, I am pretty proud of my reputation, having negotiated with George H.W. Bush a major piece of legislation that was very controversial, the Americans with Disabilities Act, negotiating in league with Roy Blunt, one of the gentleman's predecessors on his side of the aisle; and Jay Rockefeller and Senator Kit Bond from Missouri to get FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which was a very controversial issue, resolved, with Democratic and Republican support, and President George W. Bush signed that bill.  So anybody who knows my reputation knows that I am prepared to sit down and come to agreement, because that is what you need to do in a democracy. I won't get everything I want; you won't get everything you want.  But the fact of the matter is, as long as government is shut down, we are not going to have business as usual.  I remind the gentleman that his side was in charge last year and went 11 months and 20 days and didn't bring a Homeland Security bill to the floor of this House--11 months and 20 days. It was in the waning 10 days of the year when his majority brought a bill to the floor that they knew wouldn't pass the Senate.  We have passed Senate bills that would open up the government. We have sent simple CRs with no controversy to them that would have opened up the government. We have sent 10 different bills, 11 different bills. The 12th lost on suspension, because their side voted against it.  So I tell my friend, I am prepared to negotiate. I am prepared to negotiate in good faith. I will tell the gentleman, the Speaker of this House is prepared to do the same, and our Members are prepared to do the same.  There are significant, strong differences. We differ on whether the wall is an effective way to keep the border secure. But we agree on a number of other things.  When the gentleman and I were down at the White House, for instance, the magnetic resonance of trucks and vehicles that are carrying contraband, drugs, guns, and other material that we don't want to come into the United States, we can agree on that. We can agree on much, I think, of border security.  That was a long answer to the gentleman's question, but until we open up government, it is not going to be business as usual, until we open up government and put those 800,000 people back to work. I represent 62,000 of them.Now, not all of them are laid off, because we funded some portions of government. But a significant number of them are, and they are hurting.  A TSA agent comes in at $28,000 per year. We make substantially more than that, and they are living paycheck to paycheck. Tomorrow, they are not going to get a paycheck. But they have been told by their government they have to work, and because they are conscientious, patriotic Americans, they are working. But you can't expect them to work much longer. We can't expect people to work when they are not getting paid, when they are not getting respected, when they are not getting treated as we would want to be treated ourselves.  So I say to the gentleman, in answer to his question, we are prepared to discuss and negotiate and compromise, but not in the face of this shutdown.  I would hope that it would end. It is the wrong policy. It is a cruel policy. It is hurting America. It is hurting our economy. It is hurting our reputation around the world. And it is hurting our people who work for us.
