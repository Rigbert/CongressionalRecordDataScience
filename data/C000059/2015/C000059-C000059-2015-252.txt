Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona and Riverside County at large are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent to make their communities a better place to live and work. Brad Robbins is one of these individuals. On April 15, 2015, Brad will be honored for his dedicated service as he ends his tenure as the City of Corona's City Manager.  Brad has worked on behalf of the City of Corona since 1988 and has established himself as a highly regarded leader and active member of the community. Throughout his twenty-eight years of service with the City of Corona, Brad has held a variety of titles including the Department of Water and Power General Manager, Assistant City Manager-Community Development Director, Director of Planning and Assistant City Manager. Due to his success in all of these roles, Brad was then appointed as City Manager in August of 2008. Acting as such, Brad enforced the city ordinances and carried out the policies of the Council through the control and direction of City Departments. During the past seven years, not only did Brad productively navigate the economic recession and the impact on theCity of Corona, but he also encouraged the community to continue to thrive and grow as a leader in Southern California. Numerous Corona City Council members have extensively commended Brad for accomplishing so much during his time as City Manager, most especially because he is such an exceptional person to work with.  In light of all Brad Robbins has done for the community of Corona, I wish him the best as he embarks on his retirement. Brad's tireless passion for the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of Corona, California. I am proud to call Brad a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he ends his time as City Manager for the City of Corona.                          ____________________
