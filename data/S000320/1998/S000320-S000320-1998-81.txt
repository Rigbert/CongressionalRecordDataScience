 The Senator has been very active in keeping the subcommittee informed on the progress of the expansion at RSW. Because of this, I am well aware of the intense growth that this airport has experienced over the past several years.  Likewise, I am aware of the efforts of RSW to work with the FAA in developing an LOI request, and that this effort has resulted in a substantial reduction in their request, making it reasonable within today's budget environment. I believe the behavior and efforts exhibited by RSW in working with the FAA, as well as their established need, are exactly the sorts of things the FAA should be looking for when considering LOI requests. Accordingly, I encourage the FAA to give priority consideration to RSW's request for a Letter of Intent.
