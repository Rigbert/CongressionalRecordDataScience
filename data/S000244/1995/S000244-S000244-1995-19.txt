Chairman, I seem to recall in the 1993 budget agreement which was passed by a single party in Congress and signed by President Clinton, there was a discretionary spending cap which meant that if one account at any discretionary spending area was increased, there had to be a dollar-for-dollar offset in other accounts. Now, this amendment that has been proposed by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Scott] does not even pass the test that was imposed by President Clinton 2 years ago, because there is no offset there.                              {time}  1345
