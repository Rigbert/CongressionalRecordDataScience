I know that the majority whip and myself are working on this, and running it by your office as well as we are the leader's office on our side. Hopefully we can move that. I know that all of us believe that we have an opportunity to at least resolve the violence and hopefully reach towards a peaceful resolution of that dispute, and hopefully we can move forward on this resolution. I thank the leader for his response.  Secondly, Mr. Leader, the supplemental appropriation, we hear about the supplemental appropriation, clearly for the tsunami victims as well as further assistance to our troops and efforts in Iraq and in Afghanistan. Can you tell us whether or not there is any possibility of that coming next week, or do you anticipate that would be the week following or sometime thereafter?  Mr. DeLAY. I am not sure that the White House has even made a decision on when they will send the request for the supplemental to us, or if they will send us one or two requests. I think those decisions are still being made by the White House. Obviously those decisions will help shape how and when we will consider the bill here in the House. At this time I do not expect us to consider the supplemental prior to the President's Day recess, but I would not rule that out, either. We will take the President's request, obviously our Appropriations Committee will do its work, and we will expedite the process and get it to the floor as soon as possible.
