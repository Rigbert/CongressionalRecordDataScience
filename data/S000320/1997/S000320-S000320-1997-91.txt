 President, Senator Collins has been in touch with our subcommittee throughout the year as we prepared the 1998 Transportation appropriation bill. She has talked to us more than once. In particular, the Senator from Maine has made clear that securing available sources of funding for the NEPA study is a very high priority for her and the people in the northern part of her State of Maine. The Senator has also been a strong supporter of higher funding in fiscal year 1998 to meet other necessary transportation priorities on behalf of the State of Maine as well.  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to confirm the inquiry of the Senator and to reiterate that the State of Maine is clearly able to use highway funds provided in this act, subject to ISTEA reauthorization, to conduct a NEPA study. I believe that the Senator from Maine has made a compelling case for moving ahead with this study and, in fact, I believe that the NEPA study would be a good use of a portion of Maine's highway funding.  Mr. President, Senator Collins has made it very clear to the subcommittee how important improving the travel corridor in northern Maine is, and I share her view that this NEPA study would be a very high priority for funding in 1998.
