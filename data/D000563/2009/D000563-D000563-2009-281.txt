This is the only civilized, developed, industrialized country in the world where a person can literally die because they don't have health insurance. Forty-five thousand people a year die because they don't have health insurance. What does that mean? One illustration: If you had a $5,000 copay on your health insurance policy--and people face that--and you go to the doctor and the doctor says: Durbin, we think you need a colonoscopy, and I realize I have to pay the first $5,000 and the colonoscopy is going to cost $3,000, and I say I am going to skip it--which people do, and bad things happen--I develop colon cancer and die, my insurance has failed me. Basic preventive care is not there. We are the only civilized, developed country where that is a fact.
