Speaker, as a former student who attended community college, I stand in strong support of H. Res. 338, a resolution which supports the goals and ideals of National Community College Month. Our nation's community colleges provide the dream of achieving a higher education to millions of students each year. Community colleges are the nation's key supplier of workforce development and retraining needs and in addition, they build lasting partnerships and contribute significantly to the communities they serve. My congressional district is home to one of the oldest and most diverse community colleges in California--the Riverside Community College District--so I am proud to express my support of National Community College Month.                          ____________________
