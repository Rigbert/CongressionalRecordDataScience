Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1086, the Standards Development Organization Advancement Act of 2003. This legislation contains several important revisions to America's antitrust laws.  Title I of the legislation contains limited antitrust protection for standards development organizations. Technical standards play a critical role in fostering competition and promoting public health and safety. Without standards there would be no compatibility among broad categories of products and less confidence in a range of building, fire, and safety codes that promote the public welfare.  In the United States, most standards development is conducted by private nonprofit organizations known as Standards Development Organizations, or SDOs. This approach reflects the fact that private organizations are better able to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change. Congress has recognized the importance of SDOs and requires Federal agencies to adopt standards issued by these organizations whenever possible.  Over the last several years, the critical efforts of SDOs have been undermined by sometimes frivolous antitrust lawsuits. The growing frequency of these claims against SDOs stifles their ability to obtain technical information, hampers their effectiveness, and undermines the public goals that the SDOs advance.  I introduced this bill to remedy this problem. This legislation codifies the rule of reason for antitrust scrutiny of SDOs which requires courts to assesswhether the standards-setting activities of an SDO are procompetitive. It also limits the SDOs civil liability to actual, rather than treble, damages, and provides for the recovery of attorneys fees to substantially prevailing parties in antitrust actions against these organizations.  To receive these limited safeguards, H.R. 1086 requires the SDO to inform Federal antitrust authorities of the scope and nature of their activities and to devise and issue standards in a fair and open process prescribed by the legislation.  The Senate amendment we consider today also contains important bipartisan provisions that deter antitrust violations while strengthening antitrust enforcement efforts. Title II harmonizes the treatment of criminal antitrust offenders and other white collar criminals by increasing maximum prison terms for criminal antitrust violations from 3 to 10 years while increasing maximum individual fines for antitrust violations from $350,000 to $1 million. These provisions send an unmistakable message to those who consider violating the antitrust laws that if they are caught they will spend much more time considering the consequences of their actions within the confinement of their prison cells.  Title II also increases maximum corporate fines for antitrust violations from $10 million to $100 million. This considerable increase sends a clear signal to corporate officers and board members that a decision to violate antitrust laws will be severely punished.  Title II of the legislation also contains important modifications to the antitrust leniency program used by the Department of Justice to facilitate the detection and prosecution of antitrust violations. Under existing practice, parties that cooperate with Federal antitrust authorities to uncover violations may not be subject to government prosecution, but remain liable in civil actions brought by private parties. The bill creates an additional incentive for corporations to disclose antitrust violations by limiting their liability in related civil claims to actual damages. Furthermore, while a cooperating party would be liable only for damages attributable to that party's conduct, noncooperating conspirators will remain jointly and severally liable for treble damages for the misconduct of all of the conspirators.  As a result, the full scope of antitrust remedies against nonparticipating parties will remain available to the government and private antitrust plaintiffs.  Finally, the legislation clarifies the Tunney Act. This act gives Federal district courts some authority to review the merits of civil antitrust settlements with the United States before they enter final consent decrees.                              {time}  1515  Specifically, district courts in which an antitrust suit is brought must assess whether these decrees are ``in the public interest.'' The bill provides legislative guidance to the district courts by listing specific factors to be considered during this analysis. In addition, the legislation facilitates the transmission of comments received during Tunney Act proceedings by allowing Federal judges to order their publication by electronic or other means.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1086 contains important provisions that enhance the effectiveness of the antitrust laws and the authority of antitrust enforcement agencies to implement them.  The legislation is truly bipartisan and bicameral in nature, and while several people deserve credit for this legislation, I would like to recognize the late Committee on Science Chief Counsel Barry Beringer. Barry's hard work and dedication brought this legislation to the floor last year, and his decades of dedication and service brought great credit to this House. I urge my colleagues to support the legislation.  Pursuant to the general leave already granted, I will be placing into the Record a statement of legislative history that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and I have agreed to, and I ask that it appear in the Record at the end of my statement.    Supplemental Legislative History for H.R. 1086, the ``Standards  Development Organization Advancement Act of 2003'' as Enrolled by the                             House and Senate       When the House passed H.R. 1086, the ``Standards      Development Organization Advancement Act of 2003,'' it only      contained provisions directed at including standards-     development activities undertaken by certain standards      development organizations (SDOs) within the treatment      accorded certain joint ventures by the National Cooperative      Research and Production Act ``NCRPA.'' The Senate-passed      version of H.R. 1086, which substantially incorporates the      provisions of the House-passed version in its Title I, also      contains an additional title, the ``Antitrust Criminal      Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2003.'' The following      legislative history is submitted on behalf of the House      Committee on the Judiciary jointly by Chairman Sensenbrenner      and Ranking Member Conyers:                Section-by-Section Analysis of H.R. 1086title I--``standards development organization advancement act of 2003''       Section 101 contains the short title.       Section 102 sets forth the findings and purposes of the      bill as they relate to standards development activities and      standards development organizations (SDOs). The findings      explain the purpose(s) behind the original enactment and      subsequent amendment of the National Cooperative Research and      Production Act (NCRPA). The findings also discuss how passage      of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of      1995 (NTTAA) unintentionally heightened the vulnerability of      SDOs to antitrust litigation. The findings also explain how      SDOs generally do not stand to benefit from any antitrust      violation that might occur during the voluntary consensus      standards development process. Finally, this section finds      that continuing to subject SDOs to potential treble damages      liability under the antitrust laws could impede pro-     competitive standards development activity.       Section 103 adds to the existing definitions contained in      section 2 of the NCRPA: The term ``standards development      activity'' is defined as ``any action taken by a standards      development organization for the purpose of developing,      promulgating, revising, amending, reissuing, interpreting, or      otherwise maintaining a voluntary consensus standard, or      using such standard in conformity assessment activities,      including actions relating to the intellectual property      policies of the standards development organization.'' The      definition of ``standards development activity'' excludes the      following activities: exchanges of information, including      competitively-sensitive information, among competitors      relating to cost, sales, profitability, prices, marketing, or      distribution of any product, process, or service that is not      reasonably required in order to develop or promulgate a      voluntary consensus standard or in order to use the standard      in conformity assessment activities; agreements or other      conduct that would allocate a market among competitors; and      agreements or conspiracies that would set or restrain prices      of any good or service.       The definition of ``standards development activity'' is      broad enough to encompass any action taken by an SDO in      ``developing, promulgating, revising, amending. reissuing,      interpreting or otherwise maintaining a voluntary consensus      standard, or using such standard in conformity assessment      activities, including actions relating to the intellectual      property policies of the SDO.'' The ``Standards Development      Organization Advancement Act of 2003'' is not intended to      change or influence existing intellectually property policies      currently utilized by various SDOs (including but not limited      to, patent searches), nor to affect or influence new      intellectual property policies that may be developed in      the future. Such policies are vitally important to      ensuring a level playing field among all users of a      standard that incorporates patented technology. In      addition, the legislation is not intended to change or      alter the application of existing antitrust laws with      respect to intellectual property. The legislation also      seeks to encourage disclosure by intellectual property      rights owners of relevant intellectual property rights and      proposed licensing terms. It further encourages discussion      among intellectual property rights owners and other      interested standards participants regarding the terms      under which relevant intellectual property rights would be      made available for use in conjunction with the standard or      proposed standard.       The term ``standards development organization'' is defined      as ``a domestic or international organization that plans,      develops, establishes or coordinates voluntary consensus      standards . . . in a manner consistent with Office Management      and Budget (OMB) Circular Number A-119, as revised on      February 10, 1998.'' The definition includes only the      voluntary consensus standards body conducting the particular      standards development activity, and does not include firms      participating in the standards development activity.       The term ``technical standard'' is defined by reference to      section 12(d)(4) of the NTTAA. The term ``voluntary consensus      standard'' is defined with reference to revised OMB Circular      A-119.       Section 104 amends section 3 of the NCRPA to apply the rule      of reason standard to SDOs with respect to covered standards      development activities in which they are engaged.       Section 105 amends section 4 of the NCRPA to include      properly structured standard-setting activity undertaken by      SDOs as eligible for the protections set forth in that      section, provided that such activities have been previously      disclosed to the antitrust agencies in     accordance with the requirements of the NCRPA, as amended.       Section 106 amends section 5 of the NCRPA to include SDOs,      in their involvement in covered standards development      activities, within the scope of the NCRPA scheme for awarding      attorneys' fees to substantially prevailing parties.       Section 107 amends section 6 of the NCRPA to apply the same      disclosure requirements to SDOs as a condition for obtaining      the detrebling of damages. In order to obtain the detrebling,      the required disclosures must occur not later than 90 days      after either the date the SDO commences the standards      development activity or the date H.R. 1086 is enacted,      whichever is later.       Section 108 provides that the legislation shall not be      construed to alter or modify the antitrust treatment of      parties participating in a covered standards development      activity, except for the SDO conducting the activity, nor of      anyone engaged in standard-setting processes that are not      within the scope of the legislation. title II--``antitrust criminal penalty enhancement and reform act of                                  2003''    Subtitle A--Antitrust Enforcement Enhancements and Cooperation                                Incentives       Section 201 contains the short title.       Sections 211-214 strengthen the Antitrust Division's      corporate criminal leniency program, by providing that an      antitrust leniency applicant who cooperates satisfactorily      with the Division in its criminal investigation and      prosecution can also receive limited damages exposure in a      related private civil action in exchange for satisfactorily      cooperating with the private plaintiffs. As Senator Kohl, the      co-sponsor of S. 1797 (which included the leniency      provisions) stated, these provisions ``will remove a      significant disincentive to those who would be likely to seek      criminal amnesty and should result in a substantial increase      in the number of antitrust conspiracies being detected.''      (Statement of Senator Kohl (co-sponsor of S. 1797) upon      introduction of the measure, 149 Cong. Rec. S13520 (daily ed.      October 29, 2003)).       Section 211 states that sections 211-214 of the title shall      sunset five years after the date of enactment, except with      respect to ``an applicant who has entered into an antitrust      leniency agreement on or before'' the sunset date.       Section 212, defines: ``Antitrust Division'' as ``the      United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division'';      ``antitrust leniency agreement'' as ``a leniency letter      agreement, whether conditional or final, between a person and      the Antitrust Division pursuant to the Corporate Leniency      Policy of the Antitrust Division in effect on the date of      execution of the agreement; ``antitrust leniency applicant''      as ``the person who has entered into the agreement''      described above; ``claimant'' as a ``person or class that has      brought, or on whose behalf has been brought, a civil action      alleging a violation of section 1 or 3 of the Sherman Act      (Section 1 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1) prohibits      contracts or combinations in restraint of trade; section 3      (15 U.S.C. Sec. 3) applies Sec. 1 to the District of Columbia      and to territories) or any similar State law,'' but      specifically excludes plaintiffs who are states or      subdivisions of states with respect to civil actions brought      to recover damages sustained by the state or subdivision      (i.e., civil actions not brought as parens patriae);      ``cooperating individual'' as ``a current or former director,      officer, or employee of the antitrust leniency applicant who      is covered by the agreement''; and ``person'' as the term is      defined in subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton      Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 12).       Section 213 states that conduct covered by a ``currently      effective antitrust leniency agreement'' will subject an      antitrust leniency applicant and its cooperating individuals,      as defendants in a private or state enforcement antitrust      action, to liability only for the actual portion of damages      suffered by the claimant ``attributable to the commerce done      by the applicant in the goods or services affected by the      violation'' so long as the court in which the civil action is      brought determines ``that the applicant or cooperating      individual . . . has provided satisfactory cooperation to the      claimant. . . .'' The section does not alter existing      provisions of the antitrust laws with respect to recovery of      costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees.       Satisfactory cooperation shall include ``providing a full      account to the claimant of all facts known to the applicant      or cooperating individual . . . that are potentially relevant      to the civil action'' and ``furnishing all documents or other      items that are potentially relevant to the civil action . . .      that are in the possession, custody, or control of the      applicant or cooperating individual . . . wherever they are      located.'' The section's use of the term ``potentially      relevant'' is intended to preclude a parsimonious view of the      facts or documents to which a claimant is entitled. Documents      or other items in the applicant's possession, custody, or      control must be produced even if they are otherwise arguably      located outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. courts.       If the leniency applicant has applied for a leniency      agreement ``after a State, or subdivision of a State, has      issued compulsory process in connection with an investigation      of allegations of violations of either sections 1 or 3 of the      Sherman Act or any similar State law based on conduct covered      by the antitrust leniency agreement or after a civil action .      . . has been filed,'' the court must consider the timeliness      of the applicant's initial cooperation with the claimant.      Thus, this section is not intended to allow antitrust      defendants in a private lawsuit or state parens patriae      investigation or enforcement action to apply to the      Department of Justice at the last minute to avoid full      treble-damage liability.       The court in which the civil action is brought is empowered      to determine whether the necessary cooperation has occurred.      The power of the court is the same whether the court is a      state or federal court and whether the antitrust claims have      been brought under state or federal laws. That cooperation      includes providing full factual disclosure of all facts,      documents, or other things that are relevant or potentially      relevant. Because many leniency agreements may be with      organizations rather than individuals, the section provides      that any antitrust leniency applicant must use its ``best      efforts'' to obtain and facilitate cooperation from      individuals. Recognizing that there are discovery tools      that plaintiffs can use in discovery of entities, this      section is intended to require cooperation of entities in      such discovery. For example, under Fed. R. Civ. P.      30(b)(6), a corporation or another entity may be noticed      or subpoenaed to provide a corporate representative to      testify on its behalf. If the leniency applicant is an      organization, individuals employed by the organization may      also qualify for reduced private damages exposure if they      cooperate to the court's satisfaction.       Section 214 clarifies that the subtitle does not affect the      right of the Antitrust Division ``to seek a stay or      protective order in a civil action based on conduct covered      by an antitrust leniency agreement,'' to prevent the leniency      applicant's cooperation ``from impairing or impeding'' a      Division investigation or prosecution. It also states that      the subtitle does not create any right to challenge the      decision of the Division concerning whether to grant a      leniency agreement; nor does it affect the joint and several      liability of any of the parties to civil antitrust actions      covered by the subtitle other than the ``antitrust leniency      applicant and cooperating individuals. . . .'' In combination      with section 213, the rule of construction in this section      preserving the application of joint and several liability as      to all defendants other than the leniency applicant provides      an additional incentive to corporations and individuals who      have violated the antitrust laws to be the first to cooperate      with the government and private litigants. While the      antitrust leniency applicant who cooperates with civil      plaintiffs will be liable only for single damages caused by      its own unlawful conduct, the remaining defendants will be      fully, jointly and severally liable for the treble damages      the conspiracy caused, minus only the amount actually paid by      the leniency applicant. This could have the effect of      increasing the amount of damages the remaining defendants are      ultimately required to pay.       Section 215 increases, for violations of sections 1-3 of      the Sherman Act, statutory maximum monetary penalties from      $350,000 to $1 million for individuals and business      organizations other than corporations, and from $10 million      to $100 million for corporations; and increases maximum jail      sentences from three years to 10 years. These increases      reflect Congress' belief that criminal antitrust violations      are serious white collar crimes that should be punished in a      manner commensurate with other felonies. This section will      require the United States Sentencing Commission to revise the      existing antitrust sentencing guidelines to increase terms of      imprisonment for antitrust violations to reflect the new      statutory maximum. No revision in the existing guidelines is      called for with respect to fines, as the increases in the      Sherman Act statutory maximum fines are intended to permit      courts to impose fines for antitrust violations at current      Guideline levels without the need to engage in damages      litigation during the criminal sentencing process.       For example, Congress does not intend for the Commission to      revisit the current presumption that twenty percent of the      volume of commerce is an appropriate proxy for the pecuniary      loss caused by a criminal antitrust conspiracy. This      presumption is sufficiently precise to satisfy the interests      of justice, and promotes efficient and predictable imposition      of penalties for criminal antitrust violations. Comments to      the guidelines provide that if the actual overcharge caused      by cartel behavior can be shown to depart substantially from      the presumed ten percent overcharge that underlies the twenty      percent presumption, this should be considered by the court      in setting the fine within the guideline fine range.                     Subtitle B--Tunney Act Reform       Section 221 makes clear that Congress intends for the      district court reviewing an antitrust consent decree to go      beyond merely considering whether entry of the decree would      ``make a mockery of the judicial function,'' (this is      currently the standard in the Court of Appeals for the D.C.      Circuit) and that the purpose of this section is ``to      effectuate the original Congressional intent in enacting the      Tunney Act. . . .''       The Public Interest Determination provision first amends      the existing Tunney Act by allowing, for good cause shown,      dissemination of public comments on proposed antitrust      consent decrees and responses to them by an alternative to      publication in the Federal Register; replaces ``may'' with      ``shall'' in its directions to district courts reviewing      consent decrees; adds to the factors that a reviewing court      must consider, in determining whether the proposed decree is      in the     public interest, ``whether its terms are ambiguous'' and      ``the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in      the relevant market or markets''; clarifies that nothing in      the section shall be construed as requiring the court to hold      an evidentiary hearing or to permit anyone to intervene; and      specifies that the written or oral communications made on      behalf of a defendant, which the defendant is required to      describe to the court under section 5(g) of the Clayton Act,      include communications ``by any officer, director, employee,      or agent of such defendant, or other person.''  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
