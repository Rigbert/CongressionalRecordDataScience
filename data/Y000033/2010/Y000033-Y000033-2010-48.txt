Madam Speaker, we talk about reform--we're for reform and you're for reform. But 2,700 pages of what? 2,700 pages. The Bible only has 1,341 pages in it.  Let me give you an example on page 752 of this bill. Let me read it to you:  ``Eligibility for non-traditional individuals with income below 133 percent of the Federal poverty level. (1) In general. Section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(a)(10)(A)(i) is amended by striking ``or'' at the end of subclause (VI); by adding ``or'' at the end of subclause (VII); and by adding at the end the following new subclause: (VIII) who are under 65 years of age, who are not described in previous subclauses of this clause, and who are in families whose income (determined using methodologies and procedures specified by the Secretary in consultation with the Health Choices Commissioner) does not exceed 1331 3 percent of the income official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981).  Now, did anybody understand that?                          ____________________
