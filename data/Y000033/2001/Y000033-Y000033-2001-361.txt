Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, I would just take the time to advise the gentleman that our leadership knows of the gentleman's concern. As the gentleman has noticed from the debate that has taken place today, there is a strong disagreement as to whether these amendments would actually solve the problem or add to the problem.  Now, this situation deserves hearings, it deserves an opportunity to be investigated by the committee that has jurisdiction and has more knowledge than the Committee on Appropriations.  So, I would be happy to tell the gentleman, the leadership already knows about this debate. I repeat, there is a strong difference of opinion as to what the effect of these amendments would be. Those on our side believe that they would be negative, have the opposite effect of what your side believes.
