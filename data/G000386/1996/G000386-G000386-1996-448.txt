 I and the farmers in my State truly believe that revenue-based risk management tools are a vital resource for today's and tomorrow's American farmer as the weather, market, and global trading patterns continue to fluctuate and pose often unpredictable risks for farmers worldwide.  The FAIR Act would require the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to offer pilot revenue insurance programs for a number of crops for crop years 1997 through 2000 so that by 2002 and the end of the production flexibility contracts provided under this bill, we will have well-tested revenue based risk management products available for farmers.  It is very important to note, however, that it was never my intent to restrict the authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation as it currently exists under law to conduct pilot programs. There are two revenue insurance pilot programs currently operating for crop year 1996. I, and I do not believe the conferees, intend for this new language in any way to interfere with the operation or expansion of these existing programs to other crops under the same terms and conditions under which they are currently operating. Rather, my intent was to encourage the Corporation to expand current efforts to other crops and speed the development of such products for the American farmer. Does the chairman agree with this interpretation--that the FAIR Act language is not intended to restrict the existing authority of FCIC to approve pilot programs under similar terms as the 1996 revenue pilot programs--for example on a whole State basis, although in a limited number of States?
