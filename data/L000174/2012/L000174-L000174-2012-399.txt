President, Congress has taken an important step today to address the looming spectrum crunch that our country faces as well as provide first responders with the nationwide network that they undoubtedly need. From cell phones to WiFi to broadcast television and radio, spectrum fuels some of the most critical technologies of the modern age. Empowering the Federal Communications Commission to conduct voluntary auctions in order to recover potentially underutilized spectrum will ensure that the public airwaves are being put to the best possible use. I am particularly pleased to see that this provision contains language that will protect broadcast television stations along the Canadian border.  A potential consequence of the spectrum auctions that Congress has been considering is that the Federal Communications Commission may need to ``repack'' or move certain television stations to new channels to appropriately free up spectrum. This type of repacking occurred following the transition to digital television and put some broadcast stations in Vermont in the position of having to reduce power to avoid interference with Canadian broadcast signals. Further repacking without appropriate protection could have serious consequences for stations in Vermont and elsewhere along the border.
