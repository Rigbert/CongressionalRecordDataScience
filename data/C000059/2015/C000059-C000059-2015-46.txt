 I am well aware of just how dedicated to our country the people of American Samoa are, as displayed by their extremely high rate of enlistment in our Nation's Armed Forces.  Your membership in this body is highly valued, and the appointment as vice chairman of the Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee as a first-term member is a testament to the perspective and leadership you bring to Congress.  Through your leadership, your people are well respected and have found themselves a champion for their cause.
