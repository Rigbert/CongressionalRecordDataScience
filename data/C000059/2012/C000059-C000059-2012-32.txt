Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a hero from La Verne, California, Private First Class (PFC) Jose Oscar Belmontes, United States Army. Today I ask that the House of Representatives join me to honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service of our country.  PFC Belmontes was born in Riverside, California in 1984. He graduated from Polytechnic High School in 2002 and joined the Army in February 2011. After training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, he arrived at Fort Drum in July 2011. He was serving as a construction engineer with the 630th Engineer Company, 7th Engineer Battalion, 10th Sustainment Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, which deployed to Afghanistan later that month. He died of injuries sustained from small arms fire in Wardak Province, Afghanistan on July 28, 2012 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. PFC Belmontes was 28 years old.  PFC Belmontes' fellow servicemen and women fondly remember him for his positive attitude; Belmontes was known for stepping up to the plate and helping out whenever he was needed. PFC Belmontes accomplished so much during his short time and he will be dearly missed by his unit and all who knew him. PFC Belmontes served honorably, earning many awards and decorations including the Purple Heart, the Army Achievement Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with one star, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Overseas Service Ribbon and the Combat Action Badge. He is survived by his wife, mother, and father.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like PFC Belmontes, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The day the Belmontes family learned of their husband and son's death was probably the hardest day they have ever faced and our thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice go out to them. There are no words that can relieve their pain and what words we can offer only begin to convey our deep respect and highest appreciation.  PFC Belmontes' family have all given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one and we hope they know that the goodness he brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made, will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
