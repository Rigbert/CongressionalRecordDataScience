President, this bipartisan amendment which I am offering with Senator Alexander would increase funding levels for the Department of Energy Office of Science to a rate of 5 percent annual real growth for 5 years.  The Office of Science is an incredible organization--24 scientists, 10 national labs, research in 300 colleges and universities in all 50 States. It was their work which led to the development of the MRI, and they are currently working on imaging systems to identify Alzheimer's in its early stages. It is an incredible operation. This commitment will pay us back many times over.  I yield to my friend and colleague from Tennessee.
