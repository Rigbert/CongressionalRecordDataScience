President, as a cosponsor of S. 1516, legislation reauthorizing the Federal Emergency Administration's Emergency Food and Shelter program, I am very pleased that the Senate is about to pass this legislation and send it to the House of Representatives. I hope that our colleagues in the House will swiftly approve this important bill, so that it can be sent to President Clinton for his signature before our legislative session adjourns for the year.  FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program provides financial assistance to supplement community efforts to provide food, shelter, and other valuable items to homeless and hungry people around the country. Most of the EFS' monies are distributed directly to local boards, which are comprised of representatives from religious and charitable organizations from the surrounding area. These boards then award grants to non-profit, voluntary, and social service organizations, which assist individuals with their food, shelter, or emergency assistance costs. Using a local distribution network helps to ensure that the EFS' funds are targeted to those who most need assistance.  To its credit, FEMA has been very successful in keeping the administrative costs of this program very low. In fact, these costs consume less than 3 percent of the funding, which is an inspiring example that all of the Federal Government's agencies and departments should strive to follow.  In Maine, the EFS program has been extremely helpful. For example the Sister Mary O'Donnell Shelter, located in Presque Isle, Maine, received a $10,500 grant from this program. Amazingly enough, this shelter was able to use this modest funding to provide the equivalent of 1,974 nights of shelter for the homeless in northern Maine.  EFS is a very successful program that carefully targets its resources where they are needed most, and does so with an absolute minimum of administrative expense. The Government Affairs Committee approved this legislation with a unanimous voice vote on November 3, 1999, and I hope the full Senate will do likewise.                          ____________________
