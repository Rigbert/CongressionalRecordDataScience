Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege and honor, as we approach the March for Life on Friday, to remember the infamous Supreme Court decision that has resulted in the loss of some 60 million unborn babies and tens of millions of women who have been harmed. Sixty million have been killed, a number that equates with the entire population of England, as a result of that very misguided and sad and tragic decision.  It is my honor, as we open up this Special Order, to yield to Congresswoman Jackie Walorski from Indiana, a distinguished Member of this body who serves on the Ways and Means Committee.
