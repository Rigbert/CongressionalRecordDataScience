 President, 2 weeks ago we passed the budget resolution in the Senate. One week after that, the House passed their budget resolution. So we are in a position of being conferenced between the House and the Senate on a budget resolution, and I thought at this point I ought to give some updates, particularly as it relates to the work of the Committee on Finance, and particularly as it relates to the issue of taxes and an impending tax increase that is out there--tomorrow, almost--a few years away if we don't do anything to stop the biggest tax increase in the country, or that will be, in fact, the biggest tax increase in the country.  So as the budget resolution slowly works its way through Congress, one especially important issue wrapped up in this whole great big budget resolution and document is the longevity of the bipartisan tax relief that was enacted in 2001 and 2003, and this very day those tax decreases for working men and women are still in place and will be in place through the year 2010. It has always been my goal, when you have Chairman Greenspan saying that this tax relief for working men and women is the reason the economy has rebounded, that we should continue this tax relief into the future, because if it is the goose that laid the golden egg of 7.8 billion new jobs being created since the recession, then we ought to keep that golden egg working for the American taxpayer.  Some people may not give the contents of a budget resolution much consideration since it does not get signed into law by the President but is merely a set of guidelines for tax and spending decisions that apply to Congress as we make permanent law and as we make decisions on tax policy for the future. Those tax and spending decisions must go to the President for his acting on them and then become law.  For this reason, along with anyone who supports tax relief, we are very concerned about the budget resolutions passed by the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate that are now in conference. Yes, this is a Republican Senator. I am in the minority now since the last election. So I want to raise these concerns as a responsibility of the majority and to alert the American people about what the majority might be up to, or if they are not up to it, what the consequences are if nothing happens.  This concern is derived from the fact that the two budget resolutions--the one in the House and the one in the Senate--do not provide for the extension of tax relief beyond 2010. What does it mean when I use the words the budget resolutions do not provide for ``the extension'' of tax relief beyond 2010? That means, if Congress takes no action, we will have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, and we will have that tax increase without even a vote of the Congress.  For the first time in more than 6 years, Congress is sending a message, then, that there is no guarantee of continued tax relief. In fact, the Democratic budget resolutions say the very opposite. The budget resolution passed by the Senate only provides 44 percent of the revenue necessary to extend these popular, bipartisan--and let me emphasize bipartisan--tax relief bills of 2001. Mr. President, 44 percent is not enough, but that 44 percent is more than the big fat zero percent in the House-passed budget resolution. The House-passed budget resolution provides no revenue room for the extension of tax relief, meaning that the majority of the House of Representatives right now is taking a position on the budget to let the biggest tax increase in the history of our country go into effect without a vote of Congress.  What does that mean, besides the biggest tax increase in history? It means things such as no tuition deduction for people sending their kids to college, no teacher deduction for the supplies the teacher might buy out of their own pocket. Those are just a couple of popular items that would expire at that particular time that would be a small part of the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, happening without the vote of the people.  I would like to think that I am an optimist, but in conferencing two resolutions, which cover 44 percent on the part of the Senate and zero percent on the part of the House, I am doubtful of reaching a number greater than the already inadequate number of 44 percent provided in the Senate. This stands in stark contrast to the budget that the President submitted this February and to the budgets the President has submitted over each of the last 6 years. All of those budgets provided the revenue room to make bipartisan tax relief permanent. In other words, the President is asking Congress to take action so that the biggest tax increase in the history of our country would not happen; and if it did happen, it would happen without a vote of the people. He thinks that Congress making a decision for tax relief for working men and women provided the incentive, according to Chairman Greenspan, for the economic recovery--and we have now created 7.8 million new jobs--and ought to be made permanent tax policy. In other words, don't kill the goose that has laid the golden egg.  The Democratic budget resolutions can be best represented by a chart that I have here which shows that in terms of the guaranteed tax relief proposal, they amount to a big goose egg for the American taxpayer. We have it right here on the chart. That is a big fat zero. If they are lucky, I suppose college-bound taxpayers could sell this goose egg back to the Democratic leaders in the House and Senate because they will need the money if they are not able to deduct the cost of tuition.  What is even more inexplicable than the Democrats' failure to extend the popular and bipartisan tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 are some of the reasons given. The chairman of the Budget Committee this year basically said that since the Republicans wrote that law--forgetting that it was bipartisan in 2001; how clever to ignore that fact--it is our problem. The leftwing of the blogosphere has echoed that message of the Democratic leadership.  In regard to the left side of the blogosphere, I will briefly describe two posts my staff found on the Internet. The first comes from a scholar of government who posts the Daily Kos under the name of ``piec.'' I may be mispronouncing that, and if so, it is unintentional.  According to piec's analysis, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, which was signed last May by President Bush, was a ``poison pill'' designed to sabotage the economy to increase the prospects of Republican candidates in 2012. The argument seems to be that having popular and bipartisan tax relief from 2001 and 2003 all sunset at the end of 2010 would cause such an economic mess that the Democrats, assumed by the blogger, piec, to be in power at that time, will take the blame and suffer at the polls.  Wouldn't it have been nice if I could think as chairman, when we wrote that bill, that I was smart enough to see ahead from 2001 to 2012? Thank you, piec, for giving me that credit. But I didn't know that. We passed it because of the rules in place at that particular time. It had to sunset.  Another observer of Government posted comments under the name of ``Blue Bunting'' to the ``Care2 News Network.'' In a posting titled ``The Monster Republican Tax Hike,'' Blue Bunting says that the ``Republican Congresses chose not to make their tax cuts . . . permanent.'' Her argument seems to be that Republicans put sunset clauses in a bill solely to improve the long-term budget projections and that responsibility for the expiration of tax relief rests completely with the Republicans, even though the Republicans are in the minority. The implication is that by lowering taxes, Republicans are responsible for a tax increase that would occur when the Democratic majorities control both Houses of Congress, even though taxes coming in from all the taxes that the Federal Government collects run to a 50-year average of what they have been, 18.6 percent of GDP. If it has been that way for 50 years, what is the problem?  Now, these blogs I have just referred to, these commentaries, are available to anyone if you want to read them online. But to make it easier, I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Daily Kos, Feb. 27, 2007]                 TIPRA, the Poison Pill (A Commentary)                               (By Piec)       I was reading the diary, ``Capital Gains and Dividend Tax      Cuts Are Robbery'' by Dean Nut 2/18/2007. Interesting thought      . . . to have all your income coming from investment just to      have a lower tax.       I'd say, though, that is a very risky way to live because      then you're totally at the mercy of selfish, economy      saboteurs who we have stupidly elected to our very own      government. What a shameful group of individuals they are,      too! Caring nothing for their country. Caring only for their      selfish, hogging selves! Everyone of them should be tried as      traitors!       Look back to recent history, to May 17, 2006. What happened      on that day? Bush signed the extension of the Jobs and Growth      Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA). The new bill,      called the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of      2005 (TIPRA), didn't have anything to do with stimulating the      economy in a post-911 period. Bush and his fellow Republicans      knew that the war wasn't going well and that the U.S. people      were down on them for it. The mood of the country was      becoming increasing more anti-Republican with every U.S.      soldier that came home in a coffin. The Republican party was      bleakly looking toward the November 2006 elections and surely      would lose their tails off. The party needed to do some long-     range planning. Thus, the TIPRA passed legislature: The House      of Representatives approved (H.R. 4297) by a vote of 244      Republicans to 185 Democrats opposed, and the Senate approved      it 54 Republicans to 44 Democrats opposed.       Yes, this was long-range planning. TIPRA was a poison pill      for the U.S. economy because it extended the pain that people      would start feeling in their pocket books beginning on      January 1, 2008. Originally, 2008, a presidential election      year, was set up to be the ONLY year that the capital gains      tax rates for 10 percent and 15 percent bracketed filers      would drop from 5 percent to 0 percent. Short term, this      bottoming out of tax rates in those tax brackets would      stimulate the market and, thus, the economy. But because of      the extension created with TIPRA, the rock bottom percentage      would not be a ``good thing'', but a huge market-swinger, a      market-swinger toward recession--simply because the      Republicans wished the ``good thing'' to become a poison pill      and, thereby, drag controlling-democrats down into a      spiraling hole for the duration of three, entire years.       On January 1, 2011, as the law now stands, everything will      sunset. This, 2011, is the third year of the next      presidential election cycle. Right when the country will be      deepening into recession, the tax brackets will sunset. This      means that everything tax-wise will be as it was pre-911. Ten      percent, 15 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and      35 percent tax brackets will become, once again, 15 percent,      28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent, and 39.6 brackets. Actual      cash dollars will be squeezed out of every man, women, and      child in the form of raised taxes, and just when they thought      that they couldn't bleed anymore. The capital gains tax rates      will also sunset. The post-911 tax     brackets of capital gains and qualifying dividend rates of 0      percent for 10 percent and 15 percent bracketed filers and 15      percent for everyone else will become the old 10 percent for      gains in the 15 percent bracket and all others will be 20      percent. Plus, that screwing five-year holding period rule      will be back to trap people again for good. Yes, TIPRA's only      purpose was to sabotage the U.S. economy and drive the power      of Congress back to Republicans in 2012.       It absolutely makes me sick to see fellow Americans operate      like this . . . tear the whole country and weaken it, just to      satisfy some evil, selfish desire for power. We never sent      them to government to serve ONLY themselves!
