Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and unable to vote on rollcall vote Nos. 497 through 499. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on roll call No. 497, passage of H.R. 629, to grant the consent of the Congress to the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact; ``yes'' on rollcall No. 498, the Vento amendment to H.R. 901, to exempt sites nominated under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance from the provisions of the bill; and ``yes'' on rollcall No. 499, ordering the previous question on H. Res. 262, the rule governing House consideration of the Senate amendments to the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. I ask unanimous consent to have this statement appear in the appropriate place in the Congressional Record.                          ____________________
