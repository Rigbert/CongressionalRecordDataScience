President, during the past few years, Marcelle and I have come to know Christopher Nolan and his wife Emma Thomas, both of whom are extraordinarily talented and have made breakthrough movies.  One of the things that we have enjoyed talking about with both of them is the concept of what movies can be as real entertainment, and that movie theaters provide an audience an experience they would not have otherwise. Recently, Chris wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal explaining just how movie theaters will survive. That was music to my ears, as I too want them to survive. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Christopher Nolan: Films of the Future Will Still Draw People to                                 Theaters       When Movies Can Look or Sound Like Anything, Says the `Dark      Knight' Director, Extraordinary Work Will Emerge.       In the '90s, newly accessible video technology gave      adventurous filmmakers (such as Lars von Trier and his      colleagues in the filmmaking movement Dogme 95) an      unprecedented wedge for questioning the form of motion      pictures. The resulting 20-year process of radical technical      and aesthetic change has now been co-opted by the very      establishment it sought to challenge.       Hungry for savings, studios are ditching film prints (under      $600 each), while already bridling at the mere $80 per screen      for digital drives. They want satellite distribution up and      running within 10 years. Quentin Tarantino's recent      observation that digital projection is the ``death of      cinema'' identifies this fork in the road: For a century,      movies have been defined by the physical medium (even Dogme      95 insisted on 35mm film as the presentation format).       Savings will be trivial. The real prize the corporations      see is the flexibility of a nonphysical medium.                           Movies as Content       As streams of data, movies would be thrown in with other      endeavors under the reductive term ``content,'' jargon that      pretends to elevate the creative, but actually trivializes      differences of form that have been important to creators and      audiences alike. ``Content'' can be ported across phones,      watches, gas-station pumps or any other screen, and the idea      would be that movie theaters should acknowledge their place      as just another of these ``platforms,'' albeit with bigger      screens and cupholders.       This is a future in which the theater becomes what      Tarantino pinpointed as ``television in public.'' The      channel-changing part is key. The distributor or theater      owner (depending on the vital question of who controls the      remote) would be able to change the content being played,      instantly. A movie's Friday matinees would determine whether      it even gets an evening screening, or whether the projector      switches back to last week's blockbuster. This process could      even be automated based on ticket sales in the interests of      ``fairness.''       Instant reactivity always favors the familiar. New      approaches need time to gather support from audiences.      Smaller, more unusual films would be shut out. Innovation      would shift entirely to home-based entertainment, with the      remaining theaters serving exclusively as gathering places      for fan-based or branded-event titles.       This bleak future is the direction the industry is pointed      in, but even if it arrives it will not last. Once movies can      no longer be defined by technology, you unmask powerful      fundamentals--the timelessness, the otherworldliness, the      shared experience of these narratives. We moan about      intrusive moviegoers, but most of us feel a pang of      disappointment when we find ourselves in an empty theater.       The audience experience is distinct from home      entertainment, but not so much that people seek it out for      its own sake. The experience must distinguish itself in other      ways. And it will. The public will lay down their money to      those studios, theaters and filmmakers who value the      theatrical experience and create a new distinction from home      entertainment that will enthrall--just as movies fought back      with widescreen and multitrack sound when television first      nipped at its heels.       These developments will require innovation, experimentation      and expense, not cost-cutting exercises disguised as digital      ``upgrades'' or gimmickry aimed at justifying variable ticket      pricing. The theatrical window is to the movie business what      live concerts are to the music business--and no one goes to a      concert to be played an MP3 on a bare stage.                           Back to the Future       The theaters of the future will be bigger and more      beautiful than ever before. They will employ expensive      presentation formats that cannot be accessed or reproduced in      the home (such as, ironically, film prints). And they will      still enjoy exclusivity, as studios relearn the tremendous      economic value of the staggered release of their products.       The projects that most obviously lend themselves to such      distinctions are spectacles. But if history is any guide, all      genres, all budgets will follow. Because the cinema of the      future will depend not just on grander presentation, but on      the emergence of filmmakers inventive enough to command the      focused attention of a crowd for hours.       These new voices will emerge just as we despair that there      is nothing left to be discovered. As in the early '90s, when      years of bad multiplexing had soured the public on movies,      and a young director named Quentin Tarantino ripped through      theaters with a profound sense of cinema's past and an      instinct for reclaiming cinema's rightful place at the head      of popular culture.       Never before has a system so willingly embraced the radical      teardown of its own formal standards. But no standards means      no rules. Whether photochemical or video-based, a film can      now look or sound like anything.       It's unthinkable that extraordinary new work won't emerge      from such an open structure. That's the part I can't wait      for.                          ____________________
