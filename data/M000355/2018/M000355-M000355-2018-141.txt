 President, on an entirely different matter, later today the Senate will vote on an attempt by some of our Democratic colleagues to undue a pro-privacy reform that Secretary Mnuchin and the Treasury Department implemented just a few months ago.  As I discussed yesterday, there is neither any valid accounting reason nor a disclosure reason why the IRS needs access to the donor lists of the kinds of tax-exempt, nonprofit organizations in question. The Treasury Department has said that ``the IRS simply does not need tax returns with donor names and addresses to do its job in this area.''  In a climate that is increasingly hostile to certain kinds of political expression and open debate, the last thing Washington needs to do is to chill the exercise of free speech and add to the sense of intimidation. The Senate should take a stand for America's privacy and the First Amendment and reject this misguided resolution.                          ____________________
