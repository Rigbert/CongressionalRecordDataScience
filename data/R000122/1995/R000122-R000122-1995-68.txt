Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I want to first thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Chairman Gekas. We were able to work together in a cooperative and bipartisan process and although we have some principal disagreements, I believe the legislation has been made better because we were able to work together constructively and cooperatively, and at the end of today regardless of the outcome I think we can be very proud of this bipartisan process.  Both of us agree that steps need to be taken to make the regulatory process more sensitive to the needs of small businesses. Small businesses lack the staff and resources to track the daily comings and goings of the Federal Register.
