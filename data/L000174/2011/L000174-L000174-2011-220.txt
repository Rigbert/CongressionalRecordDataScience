President, 6 months ago, the Senate approved the America Invents Act to make the first meaningful, comprehensive reforms to the Nation's patent system in nearly 60 years. Today, the Senate has come together once again, this time to send this important, job-creating legislation to the President to be signed into law.  Casting aside partisan rhetoric, and working together in a bipartisan and bicameral manner, Congress is sending to President Obama the most significant jobs bill of this Congress. The bill originated 6 years ago in the House of Representatives, when Chairman Smith and Mr. Berman introduced the first patent reform proposals.  After dozens of congressional hearings, markup sessions, and briefings, and countless hours of Member and staff meetings, through two Presidential administrations, and three Congresses, patent reform is finally a reality.  The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act is a bipartisan bill and a bipartisan accomplishment. This is what we in Washington can do for our constituents at home when we come together for the benefit of the country, the economy, and all Americans.  I especially thank Senator Kyl for his work in bringing this bill to the floor of the Senate--twice--and Senator Grassley for his commitment to making patent reform the Judiciary Committee's top priority this year. Chairman Smith, in the other body, deserves credit for leading the House's consideration of this important bill. I look forward to working with him on our next intellectual property priority--combating online infringement.  I thank the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who worked together to get quorums and get this passed. I thank them for their contribution.  Mr. President, I acknowledge several members of my Judiciary Committee staff, specifically Aaron Cooper, who sits here beside me. He spent more hours than I even want to think about, or his family wants to think about, working with me, other Senators, Members of the House, other staff, and stakeholders to preserve the meaningful reforms included in the America Invents Act, as did Susan Davis before him. Ed Pagano, my chief of staff, kept everybody together. I also thank Bruce Cohen, my chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee, who every time I thought maybe we are not going to make it would tell me ``You have to keep going,'' and he was right. Erica Chabot, Curtis LeGeyt, and Scott Wilson of my Judiciary Committee staff have also spent many hours working on this legislation.  I also commend the hard-working staff of other Senators, including Joe Matal, Rita Lari, Tim Molino, and Matt Sandgren for their dedication to this legislation. Chairman Smith's dedicated staff deserves thanks as well, including Richard Hertling, Blaine Merritt, Vishal Amin, and Kim Smith.  I would also like to thank the majority leader for his help in passing this critical piece of legislation.  The America Invents Act is now going to be the law of the land. I thank all my colleagues who worked together on this.  In March, the Senate passed its version of the America Invents Act, S. 23, by a 95-5 vote. One of the key provisions of the legislation transitions the United States patent system from a first-to-invent system to a first-inventor-to-file system. The Senate considered and rejected an amendment to strike this provision, with 87 Senators voting to retain the transition.  When this body first considered the America Invents Act, some suggested that along with the first-inventor-to-file transition, the legislation should expand the prior user rights defense. The prior user rights defense, in general, is important for American manufacturers because it protects companies that invent and use a technology, whether embodied in a process or product, but choose not to disclose the invention through the patenting process, and instead rely on trade secret protection. The use of trade secrets instead of patenting may be justified in certain instances to avoid, for example, the misappropriation by third parties where detection of that usage may be difficult. These companies should be permitted to continue to practice the invention, even if another party later invents and patents the same invention.  In the United States, unlike in our major trading partners, prior user rights are limited to inventions on methods of doing or conducting business. The Senate bill included only a very limited expansion of this defense, and required the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, ``PTO'', to study and report to Congress on the operation of prior user rights in other countries in the industrialized world, and include an analysis of whether there is a particular need for prior user rights given the transition to a first-inventor-to-file system.  The House-originated bill, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, which the Senate is considering today, makes important improvements to expand prior user rights beyond just methods of doing business. These improvements will be good for domestic manufacturing and job creation. I agree with the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary that inclusion of expanded prior user rights is essential to ensure that those who have invested in and used a technology are provided a defense against someone who later patents the technology.  I understand that there is some confusion regarding the scope of the defense in the bill. The phrase ``commercially used the subject matter'' is intended to apply broadly, and to cover a person's commercial use of any form of subject matter, whether embodied in a process or embodied in a machine, manufacture, or composition of matter that is used in a manufacturing or other commercial process. This is important particularly where businesses have made substantial investments to develop these proprietary technologies. And if the technology is embedded in a product, as soon as that product is available publicly it will constitute prior art against any other patent or application for patent because the technology is inherently disclosed.  The legislation we are considering today also retains the PTO study and report on prior user rights. I again agree with the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, that one important area of focus will be how we protect those who make substantial investments in the development and preparation of proprietary technologies. It is my hope and expectation that Congress will act quickly on any recommendations made by the PTO.  Section 27 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act requires a study by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, on effective ways to provide independent, confirming genetic diagnostic test activity where gen patents and exclusive licensing for primary genetic diagnostic tests exist. I support this section, which was championed by Ms. Wasserman Schultz, and look forward to the USPTO's report.  I want to be clear that one of the reasons I support section 27 is that nothing in it implies that ``gene patents'' are valid or invalid, nor that any particular claim in any particular patent is valid or invalid. In particular, this section has no bearing on the ongoing litigation in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, ___ F.3d ___, 2011 WL 3211513 (Fed. Cir. July 29, 2011).  In Kappos v. Bilksi, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S. Ct. 3218 (2010), the Court found that the fact that a limited defense to business method patents existed in title 35 undermined the argument thatbusiness method patents were categorically exempt from patentability. Specifically, the Court held that a ``conclusion that business methods are not patentable in any circumstances would render Sec. 273 [of title 35] meaningless.'' Bilski, 130 S. Ct. at 3228. But the section 27 study is readily distinguishable from the substantive prior user rights defense codified in title 35 referenced in Bilski. A ``gene patent'' may or may not be valid, and that has no impact on the USPTO study, which mentions the existence of gene patents issued by the USPTO (but still subject to a validity challenge), but focuses on the effect of patents and exclusive licensing of genetic diagnostic tests, regardless of whether there are relevant patents. This study will be useful and informative for policymakers no matter how section 101 of title 35 is interpreted by the courts.  There has been some question about the scope of patents that may be subject to the transitional program for covered business method patents, which is section 18 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This provision is intended to cover only those business method patents intended to be used in the practice, administration, or management of financial services or products, and not to technologies common in business environments across sectors and that have no particular relation to the financial services sector, such as computers, communications networks, and business software.  A financial product or service is not, however, intended to be limited solely to the operation of banks. Rather, it is intended to have a broader industry definition that includes insurance,brokerages, mutual funds, annuities, andan array offinancial companies outside of traditional banking.  Section 34 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act requires a study by the Government Accountability Office, GAO, on the consequences of patent infringement lawsuits brought by non-practicing entities under title 35, United States Code. The legislation requires that GAO's study compile information on (1) the annual volume of such litigation, (2) the number of such cases found to be without merit, (3) the impact of such litigation on the time to resolve patent claims, (4) the related costs, (5) the economic impact, and (6) the benefit to commerce.  Following the House passage of H.R. 1249, the Comptroller General expressed concern that Section 34 may require it to answer certain questions for which the underlying data either does not exist, or is not reasonably available. Where that is the case, I want to make clear my view that GAO is under no obligation to include or examine information on a subject for which there is either no existing data, or that data is not reasonably obtainable. Further, GAO is not required to study a quantity of data that it deems unreasonable.  In my view, GAO can satisfy its requirements under section 34 by compiling reasonably available information on the nature and impact of lawsuits brought by non-practicing entities under title 35 on the topics outlined in section 34(b). Where it deems necessary, GAO may use a smaller sample size of litigation data to fulfill this obligation. GAO should simply note any limitations on data or methodology in its report.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from Gene L. Dodaro, Comptroller General of the United States, detailing GAO's possible limitations in complying with section 34.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     United States                              Government Accountability Office                                Washington, DC, September 7, 2011.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, Chairman,     Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Ranking Member,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate.     Hon. Lamar S. Smith, Chairman,     Hon. John Conyers, Jr., Ranking Member,     Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives.     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,     House of Representatives.       I am writing to express our concern regarding a provision      relating to GAO in H.R. 1249, the Leahy-Smith America Invents      Act. Section 34 of the bill would require GAO to conduct a      study of patent litigation brought by so-called non-     practicing entities, that is, plaintiffs who file suits for      infringement of their patents but who themselves do not have      the capability to design, manufacture, or distribute products      based on those patents. As the Supreme Court and Federal      Trade Commission have noted, an industry of such firms has      developed; the firms obtain patents not to produce and sell      goods but to obtain licensing fees from other companies.       The GAO study required by H.R. 1249 would mandate a review      of: (1) the annual volume of such litigation for the last 20      years; (2) the number of these cases found to be without      merit after judicial review; (3) the impacts of such      litigation on the time required to resolve patent claims; (4)      the estimated costs associated with such litigation; (5) the      economic impact of such litigation on the economy; and (6)      the benefit to commerce, if any, supplied by such non-     practicing entities.       We believe this mandate would require GAO to undertake a      study involving several questions for which reliable data are      not available and cannot be obtained. In the first instance,      the mandate would require identification of non-practicing      entities that bring patent lawsuits. While some information      about these entities may be obtainable, a definitive list of      such entities does not exist and there is no reliable method      that would allow us to identify the entire set from court      documents or other available databases. Moreover, quantifying      the cases found to be meritless by a court would produce a      misleading result, because we understand most of these      lawsuits are resolved by confidential settlement. Similarly,      there is no current reliable source of information from which      to estimate the effects of litigation by such entities on      patent claims, litigation costs, economic impacts, or      benefits to commerce. Further, because GAO does not have      legal access to these private parties, we would have to rely      on voluntary production of such information, a method we      believe would be unreliable under these circumstances and      would yield information that is not likely to be comparable      from entity to entity.       Finally, empirical estimates of the effects of patent      litigation on various economic variables would likely be      highly tenuous. Measures of the cost of litigation or other      variables related to quantifying patents or litigation would      be highly uncertain and any relationships derived would      likely be highly sensitive to small changes in these      measures. Such relationships are likely to lead to      inconclusive results, or results so heavily qualified that      they likely would not be meaningful or helpful to the      Congress. In that regard, we understand recent regulatory      efforts to determine the economic and anti-competitive      effects of such litigation have not been successful.       We appreciate your consideration of this matter and we      would be happy to work with your staff regarding potential      alternatives. GAO could, for example, identify what is      currently known about each of the specific elements      identified in Section 34.
