President, I am pleased to join my colleague and dear friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing a ``Medicare Fairness'' package of bills that will ensure that the Medicare system rewards rather than punishes states like Maine and Wisconsin that deliver high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services to our elderly and disabled citizens.  The good people of Maine pay the same payroll taxes to Medicare, and our seniors pay the same premiums, deductibles and copayments as Medicare beneficiaries in other parts of the country. Yet Maine's patients, physicians, hospitals and other providers receive far less from the program in return when it comes to Medicare payments.  According to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Maine ranks third in the Nation when it comes to the quality of care delivered to our Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we are 11th from the bottom when it comes to per-beneficiary Medicare spending.  The fact is that Maine's Medicare dollars are being used to subsidize higher reimbursements in other parts of the country. Maine's Medicare patients receive, on average, $3,856 worth of Medicare services per year, far below the national average of $5,034. By way of contrast, in the District of Columbia, Medicare patients receive about $15,620 in Medicare payments a year. Moreover, these dramatically higher payments have not bought any bettercare for the District's Medicare beneficiaries. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, the District is ranked 34th out of 52, in the bottom third, when it comes to quality.  This simply is not fair. Medicare's reimbursement systems have historically tended to favor urban areas and failed to take the special needs of rural States into account. Ironically, Maine's low payment rates are also the result of its long history of providing high-quality, cost-effective care. In the early 1980s, Maine's lower than average costs were used to justify lower payment rates. Since then, Medicare's payment policies have only served to widen the gap between low and high-cost states.  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals, physicians and other providers have experienced a serious Medicare shortfall, which has forced them to shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. This Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the highest health insurance premiums in the nation. Small businesses, for example, are facing increases of 20 to 30 percent, jeopardizing their ability to provide coverage for their employees.  Moreover, the fact that Medicare underpays our hospitals and nursing facilities has significantly handicapped Maine's providers as they compete for nurses and other health care professionals in an increasingly tight labor market.  As a recent study by Dr. John Wennberg of the Dartmouth Medical School points out, more Medicare spending does not necessarily buy better quality health care. According to the Dartmouth study, Medicare beneficiaries in high-cost states don't live any longer or enjoy better quality care. High cost states simply provide more care. They rely on inpatient and specialist care more than outpatient and primary care, and they tend to treat the chronically ill and those near death much more aggressively, with possible adverse effects on their quality of life. According to the Dartmouth study, this pattern of practice is driven not by medical evidence, but instead by community practice patterns and the availability of hospital beds.  The legislative package we are introducing today will reform the current Medicare reimbursement system by reducing regional inequities in Medicare spending and providing incentives to hospitals and physicians to encourage the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective care.  The first bill, the Physician Wage Fairness Act of 2001, will promote fairness in Medicare payments to physicians and other health professionals by eliminating the outdated geographic physician work adjustor in the physician fee schedule that has resulted in a significant differential in payment levels to urban and rural health care providers.  We are concerned that the current formula does not accurately measure the cost of providing services. As a consequence, Medicare pays rural providers far less than it should for equal work. We also don't think that it makes sense to pay physicians more for their work in areas like New York City, which tend to have an oversupply of physicians, and pay physicians less for the same services in areas that are more likely to experience shortages. Eliminating the georgraphic physician work adjustor will bring an estimated $1 million a year in Medicare payments to physicians and other providers in Southern Maine and $3 million more to providers in the rest of Maine.  The second bill, the Medicare Value and Quality Demonstration Act of 2002, will authorize a series of demonstration programs to encourage high-quality, low-cost health care to Medicare beneficiaries. These programs would reward hospitals and physicians who deliver high quality care at a lower cost. It would also require that the states chosen for the pilot projects create a plan to increase the number of providers who deliver high-quality, cost-effective care to Medicare beneficiaries.  A third bill, the Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Act, will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use existing Graduate Medical Education funds to create a program to encourage hospitals in underserved areas to host clinical rotations to encourage more medical students to practice in these areas when they graduate.  And finally, the Skilled Nursing Facility Wage Information Improvement Act will promote fairness in Medicare payments to nursing homes by collecting and using accurate nursing home wage data rather than, as is the current practice, using the inaccurate hospital wage data that discriminates against States like Maine.  As Congress works to modernize Medicare, we must also restore basic fairness to the program and find ways to reward, rather than penalize, providers of high-quality, cost-effective care. This is what our legislation will do, and I encourage all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By
