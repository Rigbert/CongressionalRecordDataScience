Speaker, I rise today to honor the Burch Oil Company, an excellent example of successful American entrepreneurship that has evolved to become a pillar of a local community. I am proud to recognize my good friends at Burch Oil Company who have been serving the citizens of Southern Maryland since 1928 and are celebrating their seventy-fifth anniversary this month. Whether it has been supplying the services of vital oil resources or helping to serve the community, the Burch Oil Company has built a solid reputation within the Southern Maryland community.  Founded in May of 1928, by cousins S. Bernard Burch, Thaddeus Burch, and Thaddeus' son Joe Burch, the company quickly began to service the community's gasoline, motor oil, and, most important to the area at the time, kerosene needs. With the onset of the Great Depression many businesses failed, but Burch Oil was able to steadily grow.  From the beginning of the company, the Burch family took an active role in the community. S. Bernard Burch served as the chairman for the Democratic State Central Committee and helped to establish the MechanicsvllleVolunteer Fire Department. Even during the worst of times, such as the Great Storm of 1933, the company delivered kerosene by skiff to hard hit St. George Island.  After S. Bernard Burch's death in May of 1944, a new era began with his son, F. Elliott Burch, Sr., who took over the reigns of the operation and guided the company through a period of steady growth for several decades until turning over the day-to-day duties to his two sons so he could devote more time to local politics. Serving as St. Mary's County Commissioner President from 1962 to 1970, F. Elliott, Sr. helped to steer St. Mary's County through a period of important community investments, during a time when local government was expanding to provide more services.  Outstanding service and high quality products have been the hallmarks of the Burch Oil Company since its founding by S. Bernard Burch in 1928; and on its 75th Anniversary, four generations of the Burch family, with a fifth soon to come of age, help to guide the hardworking and dedicated employees that have helped to make this company successful. In addition to their business success, they have been an integral component in helping to build St. Mary's County through their selfless commitment and belief in also performing public service to give back to the community in which they live. Today Burch Oil Company is led by F. Elliott (Sonny) Burch, Jr. and his brother Donald (Buddy) Burch, who have set their own high standard for community involvement, supported by 300 plus employees who carry on that proud tradition.  On behalf of the citizens of St. Mary's, Charles, and Calvert Counties, it is a great privilege to honor the Burch Oil Company for reaching the milestone of 75 years in serving the community of Southern Maryland. I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting a great example of American enterprise at its best. This company has been successful by its community, but continues to plough back its dividends every day through its public service. Congratulations to members of the Burch family and their employees and we wish you another 75 years of quality and reliable service to our community.                          ____________________
