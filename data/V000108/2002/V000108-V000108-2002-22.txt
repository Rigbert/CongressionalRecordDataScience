Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3479, the National Aviation Capacity Expansion Act.  First, I am a supporter of increased airport capacity for the Chicago metropolitan area, and I commend the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski) and the leadership of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure for achieving this equitable regional solution that will help relieve air congestion in our Nation and the Chicago region.  Second, increasing air capacity in the Chicago metropolitan area is a national concern and not just a Chicago or an Illinois problem. Air congestion is also a regional problem and it demands a regional answer. I happen to believe that the Gary/Chicago Airport has a role in helping solve the air traffic congestion problems facing the region and Nation. H.R. 3479 provides full consideration for expansion and improvement projects at the Gary/Chicago Airport.  I have worked in this body for my entire career to modernize and improve the Gary/Chicago Airport. It can play an increasingly valuable role in delivering passenger and cargo service to the area. Last year, the FAA approved the Gary/Chicago Airport's 20-year master plan. The master plan outlines the airport's existing facilities and ability to handle air traffic growth and economic forecasts.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3479 would guarantee that the Gary/Chicago Airport would be considered for growth and needed improvements, which will enhance its role as the Chicago airport.
