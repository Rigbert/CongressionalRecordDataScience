 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote on the Johanns nomination, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 2, Margaret Spellings, to be Secretary of Education; provided further that there be 45 minutes of debate under the control of Chairman Enzi, 15 minutes under the control of Senator Kennedy, 10 minutes under the control of Senator Lautenberg, 10 minutes under the control of Senator Wyden, and 10 minutes under the control of Senator Dodd; provided further that at the conclusion of that time the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination with no intervening action or debate.  Finally, I ask that the President then be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
