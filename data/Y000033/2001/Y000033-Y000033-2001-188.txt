Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague from Kansas, I too am greatly concerned about this issue of potential unlimited liability for the air transport industry. It is always my intent to ensure adequate liability and protection for all transport elements such as aircraft manufacturers and manufacturers of aircraft components and parts. I had hoped we could have this specifically addressed in this bill. However, I too agree that the definition of ``air carrier'' in section 402 should include those elements of air transportation.
