 President, this amendment would create a deficit neutral fund in order to provide for reform of the current foster care system.  The foster care system is broken tremendously overburdened and needs to be fixed.  The system is understaffed and under trained. Children linger too long before securing a safe and permanent home. More funding could be available for family reunification services. Administrative funds could be used more efficiently.  Data collection is insufficient. The foster care financing structure is antiquated and inflexible and prevents states from responding to a variety of challenges.  We need to replace the old system with one that improves the foster care payment structure to support childrenrather than programs, promotes and improves family preservation and ensures that public funds are used effectively.  Our amendment sets us on a course to make these vital improvements to the foster care system.  I urge my colleagues to support the Landrieu-Grassley amendment.
