 President, today there will be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. The Republicans will control the first half, the majority will control the final half.  After morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 2881, a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration. At 2:30 p.m., there will be a rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the substitute amendment.  As a reminder, the filing deadline for second-degree amendments on the FAA bill is 1:30 p.m. today. If cloture is not invoked on the substitute, we expect to vitiate the cloture vote on the underlying bill and immediately proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 2284, a bill to restore the financial solvency of the national flood insurance fund.                          ____________________
