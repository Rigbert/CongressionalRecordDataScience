Chairman, this is the amendment that makes the personnel account whole. It adds a total of $81.5 million to the personnel account, $73 million comes as a result of reductions in other accounts, and there is a transfer of $8.5 million from travel into personnel.  The biggest reduction in the other accounts is space science, which is reduced by $60 million, mission communications by $5 million, academic by $3 million, and space communications by $5 million. This, I think, is the proper way to go about making sure that the personnel account is enough to avoid furloughs. It is done in a fiscally responsible manner in providing offsets to other accounts.  I would urge the adoption of the amendment to the amendment, which would bring the amendment of the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Weldon] back in the shape that he wanted it in prior to the objection to his request to modify it. amendment offered by ms. jackson-lee of texas as a substitute for the                amendment offered by mr. weldon of florida
