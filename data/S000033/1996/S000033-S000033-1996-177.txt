 Speaker, I want to offer my complete gratitude to the House of Representatives and the leadership for their support of full-funding for the Low-Income Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] to be allocated to States immediately. Last night I delivered the following letter to the chairman of appropriations, which was signed by 154 Members of Congress, asking for the immediate release of the $190 million remaining in fiscal year 1996 allocation for LIHEAP:     Hon. Bob Livingston,     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, Capitol, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Livingston: As you know there is      approximately $190 million remaining in FY 1996 allocation      for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).      When a continuing resolution is developed on January 26th, we      would very much appreciate your releasing 100 percent of      these funds immediately.       While $810 million in LIHEAP funds have been released so      far this year, these funds are not even half of the LIHEAP      monies allotted to the states in FY 1994 and significantly      less than the $1.3 billion allocated in      FY 1995. In order to deal with the problems that our cold weather      states are currently experiencing, it is essential that the      full $1 billion in LIHEAP funds be released this year.       As you know LIHEAP is a time sensitive program, providing      heating assistance to low-income households during the cold      winter months. As you also know there has been brutally cold      weather throughout America, and states are in desperate need      of funding for heating assistance.       Last year, an estimated 6.1 million households received      LIHEAP benefits. Three-quarters of those households had      incomes of less than $8,000 per year. The average LIHEAP      family spent 18.4 percent of their income on the cost of home      energy, compared with 6.7 percent for all households. Unless      action is taken immediately, hundreds of thousands of      Americans who live in the coldest states will again be unable      to heat their homes. We don't want to see families forced      from their homes because of unpredictably cold weather.       We encourage you to take immediate action in the next      continuing resolution to assist millions of low-income      Americans in need of heating assistance this winter.           Sincerely,       Representatives: Bernard Sanders, Peter Blute, Martin Sabo,      Peter Torkildsen, Amo Houghton, Mike Ward, John Elias      Baldacci, Joseph Moakley, Joseph Kennedy, John Olver, Phil      English, Rick Boucher, Sam Gejdenson, John McHugh, Harry      Johnston, Paul McHale, Ronald Dellums, Tim Johnson, Jose      Serrano, Eddie Bernice Johnson, Nydia Velazquez, Sheila      Jackson-Lee, Michael Doyle, Robert Borski, Collin Peterson,      Luis Gutierrez, Sue Kelly, Carrie Meek, Albert Wynn, Victor      Frazer, James Oberstar, Glenn Poshard, Gerry Studds, Barney      Frank, Thomas Sawyer, Ed Whitfield, Frank Lobiondo, and      Sherwood Boehlert.
