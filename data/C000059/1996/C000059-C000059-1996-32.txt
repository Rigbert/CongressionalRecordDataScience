Madam Speaker, under current law, the Bureau of Justice may transfer any surplus property which they administer over to the State and local authorities provided that the property is used for the establishment of prisons. I am introducing a bill that would allow State and local authorities to use surplus Federal properties and other public safety needs such as police and firefighting training facilities. This will help prevent terror and lawlessness in our own country. Prisons may still be build under this measure.  This bill provides flexibility to make the best use of these facilities, based on local needs.  This is particularly helpful for communities attempting to reuse closed or realigned military bases. I work closely with the Bureau of Justice on this measure and it has bipartisan support. I intend to introduce this legislation tomorrow. Please join me and cosponsor this important measure.                          ____________________
