President, I rise today to introduce the Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999. This legislation is intended to ensure the ability of the United States Secret Service to fulfill its vital mission of protecting the life and safety of the President and other important persons.  Almost five months have passed since the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton were concluded, and the time has come for Congress to repair some of the damage that was done during that divisive episode. I refer to the misguided efforts of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to compel Secret Service agents to answer questions about what may have observed or overheard while protecting the life of the President.  Few national interests are more compelling than protecting the life of the President of the United States. The Supreme Court has said that the nation has ``an overwhelming interest in protecting the safety of its Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence.'' [Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707 (1969).] What's at stake is not merely the safety of one person. What's at stake is the ability of the Executive Branch to function in an effective and orderly fashion, and the capacity of the United States to respond to threats and crises. Think of the shock waves that rocked the world in November 1963 when President Kennedy was assassinated. The assassination of a President has international repercussions and threatens the security and future of the entire nation.  The threat to our national security and to our democracy extends beyond the life of the President to those in direct line of the Office of the President--the Vice President, the President-elect, and the Vice President elect. By Act of Congress, these officials are required to accept the protection of the Secret Service--they may not turn it down. This statutory mandate reflects the critical importance that Congress has attached to the physical safety of these officials.  Congress has also charged the Secret Service with responsibility for protecting visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments. The assassination of a foreign head of state on American soil could be catastrophic from a foreign relations standpoint and could seriously threaten national security.  The Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999 would enhance the Secret Service's ability to protect these officials, and the nation, from the risk of assassination. It would do this by facilitating the relationship of trust between these officials and their Secret Service protectors that is essential to the Service's protective strategy.  The Service uses a ``protective envelope'' method of protection. Agents and officers surround the protectee with an all-encompassing zone of protection on a 24-hour-a-day basis. In the face of danger, they will shield the protectee's body with their own bodies and move him to a secure location.  That is how the Secret Service averted a national tragedy on March 30, 1981, when John Hinckley attempted to assassinate President Reagan. Within seconds of the first shot being fired, Secret Service personnel had shielded the President's body and maneuvered him into the waiting limousine. One agent in particular, Agent Tim McCarthy, positioned his body to intercept a bullet intended for the President. If Agent McCarthy had been even a few feet farther from the President, history might have gone very differently.  For the Secret Service to maintain this sort of close, unremitting proximity to the President and other protectees, it must have their complete, unhesitating trust and confidence. Secret Service personnel must be able to remain at the President's side even during confidential and sensitive conversations, when they may overhear military secrets, diplomatic exchanges, and family and private matters. If our Presidents do not have complete trust in the Secret Service personnel who protect them, they could try to push away the Service's ``protective envelope'' or undermine it to the point where it could no longer be fully effective.  This is more than a theoretical possibility. Consider what former President Bush wrote last April, after hearing of the independent counsel's efforts to compel Secret Service testimony:       The bottom line is I hope that [Secret Service] agents will      be exempted from testifying before the Grand Jury. What's at      stake here it the protection of the life of the President and      his family and the confidence and trust that a President must      have in the [Secret Service].       If a President feels that Secret Service agents can be      called to testify about what they might have seen or heard      then it is likely that the President will be uncomfortable      having the agents near by.       I allowed the agents to have proximity first because they      had my full confidence and secondly because I knew them to be      totally discreet and honorable. . . .       . . . I can assure you that had I felt they would be      compelled to testify as to what they had seen or heard, no      matter what the subject, I would not have felt comfortable      having them close in       . . . I feel very strongly that the [Secret Service] agents      should not be made to appear in court to discuss that which      they might or might not have seen or heard.       What's at stake here is the confidence of the President in      the discretion of the [Secret Service]. If that confidence      evaporates the agents, denied proximity, cannot properly      protect the President.  As President Bush's letter makes plain, requiring Secret Service agents to betray the confidence of the people whose lives they protect could seriously jeopardize the ability of the Service to perform its crucial national security function.  The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be compelled to testify about their protectees could have a particularly devastating affect on the Service's ability to protect foreign dignitaries. The mere fact that this issue has surfaced is likely to make foreign governments less willing to accommodate Secret Service both with respect to the protection of the President and Vice President on foreign trips, and the protection of foreign heads of state traveling in the United States.  The recent court decisions, which refused to recognize a protective function privilege, could have a devastating impact upon the Secret Service's ability to provide effective protection. The courts ignored the voices of experience--former Presidents, Secret Service Directors, and others--who warned of the potentially deadly consequences. The courts disregarded the lessons of history. We cannot afford to be so cavalier; the stakes are just too high.  The security of our chief executive officers and visiting foreign heads of state is a matter that transcends all partisan politics. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1360       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Secret Service Protective      Privilege Act of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The physical safety of the Nation's top elected      officials is a public good of transcendent importance.       (2) By virtue of the critical importance of the Office of      the President, the President and those in direct line of the      Presidency are subject to unique and mortal jeopardy--     jeopardy that in turn threatens profound disruption to our      system of representative government and to the security and      future of the Nation.       (3) The physical safety of visiting heads of foreign states      and foreign governments is also a matter of paramount      importance. The assassination of such a person while on      American soil could have calamitous consequences for our      foreign relations and national security.       (4) Given these grave concerns, Congress has provided for      the Secret Service to protect the President and those in      direct line of the Presidency, and has directed that these      officials may not waive such protection. Congress has also      provided for the Secret Service to protect visiting heads of      foreign states and foreign governments.       (5) The protective strategy of the Secret Service depends      critically on the ability of its personnel to maintain close      and unremitting physical proximity to the protectee.       (6) Secret Service personnel must remain at the side of the      protectee on occasions of confidential conversations and, as      a result, may overhear top secret discussions, diplomatic      exchanges, sensitive conversations, and matters of personal      privacy.       (7) The necessary level of proximity can be maintained only      in an atmosphere of complete trust and confidence between the      protectee and his or her protectors.       (8) If a protectee has reason to doubt the confidentiality      of actions or conversations taken in sight or hearing of      Secret Service personnel, the protectee may seek to push the      protective envelope away or undermine it to the point at      which it could no longer be fully effective.       (9) The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be      compelled to testify against their protectees could induce      foreign nations to refuse Secret Service protection in future      state visits, making it impossible for the Secret Service to      fulfill its important statutory mission of protecting the      life and safety of foreign dignitaries.       (10) A privilege protecting information acquired by Secret      Service personnel while performing their protective function      in physical proximity to a protectee will preserve the      security of the protectee by lessening the incentive of the      protectee to distance Secret Service personnel in situations      in which there is some risk to the safety of the protectee.       (11) Recognition of a protective function privilege for the      President and those in direct line of the Presidency, and for      visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments,      will promote sufficiently important interests to outweigh the      need for probative evidence.       (12) Because Secret Service personnel retain law      enforcement responsibility even while engaged in their      protective function, the privilege must be subject to a      crime/treason exception.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to facilitate the relationship of trust and confidence      between Secret Service personnel and certain protected      officials that is essential to the ability of the Secret      Service to protect these officials, and the Nation, from the      risk of assassination; and       (2) to ensure that Secret Service personnel are not      precluded from testifying in a criminal investigation or      prosecution about unlawful activity committed within their      view or hearing.     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTIVE FUNCTION PRIVILEGE.       (a) Admissibility of Information Acquired by Secret Service      Personnel While Performing Their Protective Function.--     Chapter 203 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      inserting after section 3056 the following:     ``Sec. 3056A. Testimony by Secret Service personnel;        protective function privilege       ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:       ``(1) Protectee.--The term `protectee' means--       ``(A) the President;       ``(B) the Vice President (or other officer next in the      order of succession to the Office of President);       ``(C) the President-elect;       ``(D) the Vice President-elect; and       ``(E) visiting heads of foreign states or foreign      governments who, at the time and place concerned, are being      provided protection by the United States Secret Service.       ``(2) Secret service personnel.--The term `Secret Service      personnel' means any officer or agent of the United States      Secret Service.       ``(b) General Rule of Privilege.--Subject to subsection      (c), testimony by Secret Service personnel or former Secret      Service personnel regarding information affecting a protectee      that was acquired during the performance of a protective      function in physical proximity to the protectee shall not be      received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial,      hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand      jury, department, officer, agency, regulatory body, or other      authority of the United States, a State, or a political      subdivision thereof.       ``(c) Exceptions.--There is no privilege under this      section--       ``(1) with respect to information that, at the time the      information was acquired by Secret Service personnel, was      sufficient to provide reasonable grounds to believe that a      crime had been, was being, or would be committed; or       ``(2) if the privilege is waived by the protectee or the      legal representative of a protectee or deceased protectee.       ``(d) Concurrent Privileges.--The proximity of Secret      Service personnel to a protectee engaged in a privileged      communication with another shall not, by itself, defeat an      otherwise valid claim of privilege.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The analysis for      chapter 203 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      inserting after the item relating to section 3056 the      following:``3056A. Testimony by Secret Service personnel; protective function               privilege.''.     SEC. 4. APPLICATION.       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall apply to      any proceeding commenced on or after the date of enactment of      this Act.                                  ____     Summary of the Secret Service Protective Privilege Act of 1999  The proposed legislation would add a new section 2056A to title 18, United States Code, establishing a protective function privilege. There are four subsections.  Subsection (a) establishes the definitions used in the section.  Subsection (b) states the general rule that testimony by Secret Service personnel or former Secret Service personnel regarding information affecting a protectee that was acquired during the performance of a protective function in physical proximity to the protectee shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed. The privilege operates only with respect to the President, the Vice President (or other officer next in the order of succession to the Office of President), the President-elect, the Vice President-elect, and visiting heads of foreign states or foreign governments.  Subsection (c) creates a crime-fraud exception to the privilege, which applies with respect to information that, at the time it was acquired by Secret Service personnel, was sufficient to provide reasonable grounds to believe that a crime had been, was being, or would be committed. This subsection also provides that the privilege may be waived by a protectee or by his or her legal representative.  Subsection (d) provides that the proximity of Secret Service personnel to a protectee shall not, by itself, defeat an otherwise valid claim of privilege. This addresses the situation in which Secret Service personnel overhear confidential communications between the protectee and, say, the protectee's spouse or attorney.                                 ______                                       By
