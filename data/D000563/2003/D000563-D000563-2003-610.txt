President, I strongly support the Specter amendment to S. 824, the Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act, that would address safety and security issues at foreign aircraft repair stations working on U.S. aircraft.  For a number of years, I have been working with the AFL-CIO's Transportation Trades Department and its mechanic unions)--the International Association of Machinists, the Transport Workers Union, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters--to close the safety loopholes that many foreign stations present.  I would like to submit for the Record a letter I received from these unions expressing their continued opposition to unsafe foreign stations.  I would also like to submit for the Record a letter recently sent from the AFL-CIO and its Transportation Trades Department to the Administration highlighting their concerns about the security at foreign stations.  As these letters clearly demonstrate, we have legitimate concerns with regard to the current rules governing certification and oversight of foreign stations. For these reasons, I am cosponsoring the Specter amendment and urge my colleagues to support it as well.  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letters, dated April 10, 2003, and May 22, 2003, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial            Organizations,                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2003.     Hon. Norman Y. Mineta,     Secretary of Transportation, Washington, DC.     Hon. Marion Blakey,     Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington,          DC.     Hon. James M. Loy,     Under Secretary for Security, Transportation Security          Administration, Arlington, VA.       Dear Secretary Mineta, Administrator Blakey and Admiral      Loy: On behalf of the 13 million members of the AFL-CIO and      the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO (TTD) we urge      you to take immediate action to temporarily revoke the      certification of certain foreign-based aircraft repair      stations until such time as thorough security audits are      conducted by responsible agencies and rules are put in place      to ensure that these stations do not pose an imminent      national and aviation security risk. As you know, there are      currently over 600 foreign aircraft repair stations,      certified under 14 CFR Part 145 (Subpart C), that are      permitted to work on U.S. registered aircraft. Because of the      unique combination of national security and economic      conditions that currently exist in the aviation industry, as      outlined below, we believe that the Department of      Transportation (DOT), the Federal Aviation Administration      (FAA), and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)      are required to act upon this petition in the interest of      aviation safety.       It is well known that this nation continues to be the      target of terrorist intentions both domestically and abroad.      In fact, the U.S. State Department and other government      agencies have frequently warned about threats occurring      outside the U.S. but directed at U.S. citizens and interests.      We are concerned that certified foreign aircraft repair      stations that are eligible to work on U.S. aircraft, could      provide terrorists with an opportunity to jeopardize U.S.      aviation safety without having to physically enter this      country. At a time of heightened alert around the globe, our      government must do everything possible to protect against      terrorist agents infiltrating foreign repair stations and      sabotaging air operations headed back to the United States.       While there is no publicly known evidence that terrorists      have pursued this agenda, it makes little sense for the Bush      Administration to leave it to chance. In fact, the DOT's      Inspector General recently announced that as part of a larger      audit of air carriers' use of aircraft repair stations, it      found security vulnerabilities at stations located at      commercial and general-aviation airports and off airport      property. While the IG recommended that the TSA conduct risk-     based security assessments as a first-step in determining the      actions needed to address repair station security, we would      maintain that until the security ``fitness'' of foreign      stations can be assured, their FAR 145 rights to work on U.S.      aircraft should be suspended.       The security risks posed by foreign stations is compounded      by the unprecedented financial distress faced by the      commercial aviation industry. Two major carriers have      declared bankruptcy, others have announced severe workforce      and service cuts, and virtually every airline has been forced      to institute dramatic cost cuts to satisfy lenders and to      keep flying. In this environment, U.S. carrier will      undoubtedly pursue, over the strong objections of the      International Association Machinists and Aerospace Workers,      the Transport Workers Union and the International Brotherhood      of Teamsters, the outsourcing of major overhaul and other      repair work to lower cost, potentially substandard third      party contractors including those based overseas. A real life      illustration of these concerns are the management rights      secured by Northwest Airlines in its 2001 collective      bargaining agreement with its mechanics union under which the      airline can contract out almost 40 percent of repair and      overhaul work to outside contractors around the globe. In      fact, Northwest Airlines already relies on a Singapore-based      repair operation for significant overhaul work on its DC-10      aircraft and the carrier could use the freedoms it secured in      its 2001 collective bargaining agreement for mechanics to      ship significantly more of that work abroad. And with the lax      FAA oversight and surveillance of unknown security procedures      at many foreign stations, the potential for terrorist      security breaches grows as these stations see more work from      the U.S.       It is interesting that in the pursuit of aviation security      the FAA and the TSA recently issued rules that require the      FAA to revoke the airman certificate, which includes a Part      65 mechanic certification, of any individual who the TSA      determines poses a threat to aviation security. But from a      practical standpoint these rules will only affect mechanics      at domestic stations since only domestic stations, and not      foreign stations, are required to have FAA-certified      employees on premise. Furthermore, there are a number of      oversight activities that occur at domestic facilities, both      formally and informally, that simply do not occur at foreign      facilities.       Indeed, the AFL-CIO, TTD and its mechanics union affiliates      have long been concerned that foreign aircraft repair      stations can receive FAA certification and then work on U.S.-     registered aircraft without meeting the same safety and      security standards imposed on domestic facilities and their      employees. In addition to regulatory differences, we know      that the oversight of foreign stations pales in comparison to      the surveillance performed on domestic stations, especially      those managed within major air carrier operations. For      example, FAA inspectors, represented by the Professional      Airways Systems Specialists (PASS), do not have the same type      of access to foreign stations as they do with domestic      facilities. This reality is complicated by the fact that      insufficient FAA inspector staffing levels do not allow for      proper oversight of stations located outside the U.S. Given      this situation, it is troubling that the effective date for      modifications to Part 145 was recently and inexplicably      postponed at the request of industry trade groups and that      such postponement was granted without giving the public any      notice or opportunity to comment.       For these reasons we urge the DOT, the FAA, and the TSA to      issue an emergency order to temporarily prevent certain      foreign stations certified under 14 CFR Part 145 from working      on U.S. aircraft or components. The FAA should use these      temporary revocations to conduct thorough security audits of      foreign stations and to promulgate rules that impose security      procedures at these facilities. In particular, the FAA should      focus on ensuring that mechanics and other workers who come      into contact with U.S. aircraft or components do not pose      a security risk and that other precautions are taken to      ensure the integrity of the aircraft maintenance work      performed. We would suggest that Joint Aviation Authority      members and certain countries that have current Bilateral      Aviation Safety Agreements with the U.S. may already meet      many of the security standards needed and would not need      to have their FAR 145 rights suspended while rules are      being drafted.       As you know, the Secretary of Transportation is charged      with the responsibility of ``assigning and maintaining safety      as the highest priority in air commerce.'' 49 U.S.C.      Sec. 40101(a)(1). Furthermore, when the Administrator is of      the ``opinion that an emergency related to safety in air      commerce requires immediate action, the Administrator, on the      initiative of the Administrator or on complaint, may      prescribe regulations and issue orders immediately to meet      the emergency . . .'' 49 U.S.C. Sec. 46105(c). We would      maintain that a unique confluence of factors described above      create a situation that necessitates federal government      action in the public interest and to maintain aviation      safety.       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter and      we look forward to your response.           Sincerely,     Richard L. Trumka,       Secretary-Treasurer, AFL-CIO.     Sonny Hall,       President, Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO.                                  ____                                             Transportation Trades                                          Department, AFL-CIO,                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the Transportation Trades      Department, AFL-     CIO (TTD) and its aircraft mechanics unions, we write to ask      for your assistance in protecting the safety and security of      our aviation system and the jobs of thousands of aircraft      mechanics due to deficient federal government policy and      efforts by the major airlines to cut costs through      outsourcing of maintenance and heavy overhaul work to      foreign-based repair stations.       As an original cosponsor of the Aircraft Repair Station      Safety Act (S. 1089) in the 105th Congress, legislation      strongly supported by AFL-CIO unions, we know that you are      well aware of this problem and we appreciate your leadership      in protecting aviation safety and U.S. jobs. As we have      discussed with you over many years, the Federal Aviation      Administration (FAA), pursuant to 14 CFR Part 145 (Subpart      C), allows foreign stations to receive certification to work      on U.S. aircraft even though these stations do not have to      meet the same standards as those located in this country.      While AFL-CIO mechanics unions have long argued that this      situation threatens mechanics' jobs and the safety of the      flying public, the current drive by air carriers to ship work      overseas, combined with unique security concerns at these      stations, has exacerbated this problem and your help is      urgently needed to address this issue.       We know that U.S. carriers will pursue, over the strong      objections of the International Association of Machinists and      Aerospace Workers, the Transport Workers Union and the      International Brotherhood of Teamsters, outsourcing of major      overhaul and other repair work to lower cost and potentially      substandard third party contractors based overseas. In fact,      Northwest Airlines, secured the right in its 2001 collective      bargaining agreement with its non-mechanics union (AMFA) to      contract out almost 40 percent of repair and overhaul work to      outside contractors in Singapore and around the globe. While      the mechanics at Northwest are not members of our unions, we      are deeply concerned that the carrier will continue to      exploit these harmful contract concessions to the detriment      of all the nation's professional aircraft mechanics, the vast      majority of which are our members. Mechanics at other      airlines will face increasing pressure to adopt the dangerous      practices of Northwest-AMFA that permit almost four out of 10      jobs to be shipped to foreign contractors. Unless Congress      steps in aggressively, aviation safety and security will      suffer and the jobs of thousands of workers will be at risk.       For these reasons, we urge you to work with us to address      this issue as part of the FAA Reauthorization bill that will      be considered by the full Senate in the coming weeks.      Together, we can protect the flying public and in the process      ensure the future of America's highly skilled and      professional aircraft mechanics. Thank you for your attention      to this matter.           Sincerely,     Robert Roach,       General Vice President, International Association of      Machinists and Aerospace Workers.     Sonny Hall,       International President, Transport Workers Union.     Don Treichler,       Director, Airline Division, International Brotherhood of      Teamsters.     Edward Wytkind,       Executive Director, Transportation Trades Dept., AFL-CIO.
