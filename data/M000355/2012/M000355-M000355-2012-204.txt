Res. 482       Whereas the United States Chamber of Commerce (referred to      in this preamble as the ``Chamber'') was founded on April 22,      1912, at the request of President William Howard Taft,      thereby creating a unified voice for business in the United      States;       Whereas, on that date, President Taft supported the      creation of the Chamber by declaring before 700 delegates      from businesses, chambers, and associations representing      every State, ``We want your assistance in carrying on the      government in reference to those matters that affect the      business and the business welfare of the country, and we do      not wish to limit your discretion in that matter. We wish      that your advice should be as free and unrestricted as      possible, but we need your assistance and we ask for it.'';       Whereas, during the 100 years since its founding, the      Chamber has represented and advocated the interests of the      business community in Washington, DC, across the United      States, and around the world;       Whereas the Chamber continues to give voice to business in      the United States and rally the business community around      policies that create jobs and grow the economy;       Whereas the Chamber is committed to preserving and      advancing free market principles and the free enterprise      system of the United States, which has created growth,      opportunities, innovation, and jobs, and has empowered      generations of individuals in the United States to fulfill      the American dream;       Whereas, for a century, the Chamber has played an      instrumental role in major pieces of legislation on trade,      infrastructure, energy, and a host of other issues integral      to generating economic growth, supporting the business      community, and creating jobs in the United States; and       Whereas, for the next 100 years, and well beyond, the      Chamber will continue to work to restore and strengthen the      prosperity and competitiveness of the United States and will      continue to represent the interests of businesses in the      United States of every size, sector, and region before      Congress, the executive branch, the courts, and the court of      public opinion: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the United States      Chamber of Commerce on its 100th anniversary.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution congratulating the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on defending and advancing free market principles for the past 100 years.  For a century, the Chamber has helped business owners all across the country, from the Great Depression to the current fiscal crisis our Nation is struggling with today. The chamber and its member chambers and businesses have continued to find ways to help keep our economy growing and businesses hiring.  In 1962, marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the chamber, President Kennedy said: ``The foundation of the Chamber in April of 1912 marked a turning point in the relations between government and business.'' This remains true to this day.  When the Chamber turned 70, President Reagan joked:       I remember the day you started. And like good wine, you      have grown better, not older.  He then quipped:       The membership of the Chamber of Commerce of the United      States is the only thing that has grown faster than the      Federal Government--thank heaven!  The free enterprise system is the backbone of the American economy, and nobody embodies it more than the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. So on the year marking the 100th anniversary, I, along with my colleagues, wish to extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation for all the work they do to help businesses grow and create jobs. Through their efforts, millions of Americans have been able to pursue and achieve the American dream.  To the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, thank you for your contribution to society, and congratulations on 100 years of representing and advocating for job creators across our country.                          ____________________
