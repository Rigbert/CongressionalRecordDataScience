President, today I am introducing the Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of1999, a bill to restore federal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights of States.  Innvoation and creativity have been the fuel of our national economic boom over the past decade. The United States now leads the world in computing, communications and biotechnologies, and American authors and brand names are recognized across the globe.  Our national prosperity is, first and foremost, a tribute to American ingenuity. But it is also a tribute to the wisdom of our Founding Fathers, who made the promotion of what they called ``Science and the Useful Arts'' a national project, which they constitutionally assigned to Congress. And it is no less of a tribute to the successive Congresses and Administrations of both parties who have striven to provide real incentives and rewards for innovation and creativity by providing strong and even-handed protection to intellectual property rights. Congress passed the first federal patent law in 1790, and the U.S. Government issued its first patent the same year--to Samuel Hopkins of my home State of Vermont. The first federal copyright law was also enacted in 1790, and the first federal trademark laws date back to the 1870s.  The Supreme Court has long recognized that intellectual property rights bear the hallmark of true constitutional property rights--the right of exclusion against the world--and are therefore protection against appropriation both by individuals and by government. Consistent with this understanding of intellectual property, Congress has long ensured that the rights secured by the federal intellectual property laws were enforceable against the federal governments by waiving the government's immunity in suits alleging infringements of those rights.  No doubt Congress would have legislated similarly with respect to infringements by State entities and bureaucrats had there been any doubt that they were already fully subject to federal intellectual property laws. But there was no doubt. States had long enjoyed the benefits of the intellectual property laws on an equal footing with private parties. By the same token, and in accordance with the fundamental principles of equity on which our intellectual property laws are founded, the States bore the burdens of the intellectual property laws, being liable for infringements just like private parties. States were free to join intellectual property markets as participants, or to hold back from commerce and limit themselves to a narrower governmental role. The intellectual property right of exclusion meant what it said and was enforced evenhandley for public and private entities alike.  This harmonious state of affairs ended in 1985, with the Supreme Court's announced of the so-called ``clear statement'' rule in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon. The Court in Atascadero held that Congress must express its intention to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity ``in unmistakable language in the statute itself.'' A few years later, in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., the Supreme Court assured us that if the intent to abrogate were expressed clearly enough, it would be honored.  Following Atascadero, some courts held that States and State entities and officials could escape liability for patent, copyright and trademark infringement because the patent, copyright and trademark laws lacked the clear statement of congressional intent that was now necessary to abrogate State sovereign immunity.  To close this new loophole in the law, Congress promptly did precisely what the Supreme Court had told us was necessary. In 1990 and 1992, Congress passed three laws--the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act, the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Acts. The sole purpose of these Clarification Acts was to make it absolutely, unambiguously, 100 percent clear that Congress intended the patent, copyright and trademark laws to apply to everyone, including the States, and that Congress did not intend the States to be immune from liability for money damages. Each of three Clarification Acts passed unanimously.  In 1996, however, by a five-to-four-vote, the Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida reversed its earlier decision in Union Gas and held that Congress lacked authority under article I of the Constitution to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court.  Then, on June 23, by the same bare majority, the Supreme Court in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings Bank told us that it did not really mean what it said in Atascadero and invalidated the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act. In a companion case decided on the same day, the same five Justices held that the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act also failed to abrogate State sovereign immunity.  The Court's latest decisions have been the subject of bipartism criticism. In a floor statement on July 1, I highlighted the anti-democratic implications of the approach of the activist majority of the Supreme Court, who have left constitutional text behind, ripped up precedent, and treated Congress with less respect than that due to an administrative agency in their haste to impose their natural laws notions of sovereignty as a barrier to democratic regulations. I also noted that ``the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences about how . . . intellectual property rights may be protected against even egregious infringements and violation by the State.''  One of my Republican colleagues on the Judicial Committee, Senator Specter, expressed similar concerns in a floor statement on August 5. He noted that the Court decisions ``leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitions.''  Not surprisingly, alarm has also been expressed in the business community about the potential of the Court's recent decisions to harm intellectual property owners in a wide variety of ways. A commentary in Business Week on August 2, 1999, gave these examples:       Watch out if you publish software that someone at a State      university wants to copy for free . . . Watch out if you own      a patent on a medical procedure that some doctor in a State      medical school wants to use. Watch out if you've invested      heavily in a great trademark, like Nike's Swoosh, and a      bureaucrat decides his State program would be wildly promoted      if it used the same mark.  Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor General during the Reagan Administration, has called the Court's decisions in Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank ``truly bizarre.'' He observed, in a July 6 opinion editorial in the New York Times:       [The Court's decisions] did not question that States are      subject to the patent and trademark laws of the United      States. It's just that when a State violates those laws--as      when it uses a patented invention without permission and      without paying for it--the patent holder cannot sue the State      for infringement. So a State hospital can manufacture      medicines patented by others and sell or use them, and State      schools universities can pirate textbooks and software, and      the victims cannot sue for infringement.  I believe that these concerns are very real. As Congress realized when it waived federal sovereign immunity in the area, it would be naive to imagine that reliance on the commercial decency of the government and its myriad agencies and officials would provide the security needed to promote investment in research and development and to facilitate negotiation in the exclusive licensing arrangements that are often necessary to bring valuable products and creations to market.  The issue is not whether State infringement has been frequent in the past, but rather whether we can assure American inventors and investors and our design trading partners that, as State involvement in intellectual property becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual property rights are backed by guaranteed legal remedies. It is a question of economics: our national economy depends on real and effective intellectual property rights. It is also a question of justice: in conceding that the States are constitutionally bound to respect federal intellectual property rights but invalidating the remedies Congress has created to enforce those rights, the Court has jeopardized one of the key principles that distinguishes our Constitution from the Constitution of the old Soviet Union--the principle that where there is a right, there must also be a remedy.  Some have suggested that a constitutional amendment may be the only way to restore protection to patent, copyright and trademark owners as against States. But even if Congress were to adopt such an amendment, I do not expect that we will see a lot of States rushing to ratify an amendment that forces them to pay for things that they can currently get for free.  Fortunately, however, while the implications of the Court's decisions for our constitutional scheme are serious, we can restore the guarantees of our intellectual property laws without resorting to a constitutional amendment. After close consideration of Florida Prepaid and the other recent Supreme Court precedents, I have no doubt that they leave several constitutional mechanisms open to us to restore substantial protection for patents, copyrights and trademarks through ordinary legislation. The Supreme Court's hyper-technical constitutional interpretations require us to jump through some technical constitutional hoops of our own, but that the exercise is now not merely worthwhile, but essential to safeguard both U.S. prosperity and the continued authority of Congress.  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act is based on a simple supposition--that there is no inherent entitlement to federal intellectual property rights. In discussing the policies underlying the patent laws, the Supreme Court has emphasized that ``[t]he grant of a patent is the grant of a special privilege `to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts,' '' and that ``[i]t is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system.'' Similarly, in discussing the copyright laws, the Court has underscored that ``the monopoly privileges that Congress has authorized, while `intended to motivate the creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a special reward,' are limited in nature and must ultimately serve the public good.''  The Constitution empowers but does not require Congress to make intellectual property rights available, and Congress should do so on in a manner that encourages and protects innovation in the public and private sector alike.  States and their institutions, especially State universities, benefit hugely from the federal intellectual property laws. All 50 States own or have obtained patents--some hold many hundreds of patents. States also hold other intellectual property rights secured by federal law, and the trend is toward increased participation by the States in commerce involving intellectual property rights.  Principles of State sovereignty tell us that States are entitled to a free and informed choice of whether or not to participate in the federal intellectual property schemes, subject only to their constitutional obligations. Equity and common sense tell us that one who chooses to enjoy the benefits of a law--whether it be a federal grant or the multimillion-dollar benefits of intellectual property protections--should also bear its burdens. Sound economics and traditional notions of federalism tell us that it is appropriate for the federal government to assist and encourage the sovereign States in their sponsorship of whatever innovation and creation they freely choose to sponsor by giving them intellectual property protection and, on occasion, funding, so long as the States reciprocate by assisting the federal governments to keep its promise of guaranteed exclusive rights to intellectual property owners.  The IPPRA builds on these principles. In order to promote cooperative federalism in the intellectual property arena, it provides a mechanism for States to affirm their willingness to participate in our national intellectual property project and so ``opt in'' as full and equal participants. A State would opt in to the federal intellectual property system every time it applied for protection under a federal intellectual property law, by promising to waive its sovereign immunity from any subsequent suit against the State arising under such a law.  States take their commitments seriously. We can therefore expect that a State, having promised to waive its immunity if called upon to do so, would take whatever steps were necessary to fulfill that promise. At least in theory, however, a State could assert its immunity regardless of any assurance to the contrary.  The IPPRA addresses this problem by conditioning a State's intellectual property rights on its adherence to its promise to waive immunity. Thus, a State's refusal to waive immunity in an intellectual property suit after it has accepted benefits under an intellectual property law would have a number of consequences. Most significantly, it would give private parties the right to assert an immunity-like defense to damages claims in any action to enforce an intellectual property right that is or has been owned by the State during the five years preceding the State's assertion of immunity. This quid pro quo provision restores the level playing field by putting States that assert immunity in essentially the same position as private parties who seek to endorse federal intellectual property rights against them.  The IPPRA does this without coercing the State to waive by threatening pre-existing benefits. The quid pro quo provision only affects those intellectual property rights that the State acquired by virtue of its promise to waive immunity. To ensure that State waivers are voluntary, State intellectual property rights that pre-date the passage of the IPPRA are preserved regardless of waiver.  This scheme is consistent with the spirit of federalism, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, because it gives the States a free, informed and meaningful choice to waive or not to waive immunity at any time. It is also plainly authorized by the letter of the Constitution. Article I empowers Congress to ``promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' Incident to this power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt of exclusive intellectual property rights. Indeed, we have always attached certain conditions, such as the requirements of public disclosure of an invention at the Patent and Trademark Office in order to obtain a patent.  Congress may attach conditions on States' receipt of federal intellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual property power just as Congress may attach conditions on States' receipt of federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach conditions to the federal benefit is an integral part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. Either way, States have a choice--to forgo the federal benefit and exercise their sovereign power however they wish subject to the Constitution, or to take the benefit and exercise their sovereign power in the manner requested by Congress. In South Dakota v. Dole, for example, the Supreme Court held that Congress may condition federal highway funds on a State's agreement to raise its minimum drinking age to 21. The condition imposed on receipt of federal benefits by the IPPRA--submitting to suit under laws that are already binding on the States--is not onerous, nor does it co-opt any State resources to the service of federal policy.  Given the choice between opting in to the intellectual property laws and forgoing intellectual property protection under the federal laws, most States are likely to choose to former. The benefits secured by those laws far outweigh the burdens. Most States already respect intellectual property rights and will seldom find themselves in infringement suits. To deny the States the choice that the IPPRA offers them would amount to penalizing States that play by the federal intellectual property rules for the free-riding violations of the minority of States that refuse to commit to do so. As is normally the case in a federal system, cooperation between the States and the federal government is likely to be beneficial to all concerned.  However, some States and some State entities and officials have infringed patents and violated other intellectual property rights in the past, and the massive growth of both intellectual property and State participation in intellectual property that we are seeing as we move into the next century give ample cause for concern that such violations will continue. Now that the Supreme Court has seemingly given States and State entities carteblanche to violate intellectual property rights free from any adverse financial consequences so long as they stand on their newly augmented sovereign immunity, the prospect of States violating federal law and then asserting immunity is too serious to ignore.  The IPPRA therefore also provides for the limited set of remedies that the Supreme Court's new jurisprudence leaves available to Congress to enforce a non-waiving State's obligations under federal law and the United States Constitution. The key point here is that, while the Court struck down our prior effort to enforce the intellectual property laws themselves by authorizing actions for damages against the States, it nonetheless acknowledged Congress' power to enforce constitutional rights related to intellectual property.  First, for the avoidance of doubt, the IPPRA ensures the full availability of prospective equitable relief to prevent States from violating or exceeding their rights under federal intellectual property laws. As the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in its Seminole Tribe decision in 1996, such relief is available, notwithstanding any assertion of State sovereign immunity, under what is generally known as the doctrine of Ex parte Young.  Second, to address the harm done to the rights of intellectual property owners before they can secure an injunction, the IPPA also provides a damages remedy against non-consenting States, to the full extent of Congress' power to enforce the constitutional rights of intellectual property owners. Under the Supreme Court's recent decisions, this remedy is necessarily limited to the redress of constitutional violations, not violations of the federal intellectual property laws themselves. However, as I have already noted, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed on many occasions that the intellectual property owner's right of exclusion is a property right fully protected from governmental violation under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  Under the Fifth Amendment, a State can be sued for damages for taking an intellectual property right. Although States can normally take a property right constitutionally, so long as they do so for a ``public purpose'' and provide ``just compensation,'' the Supreme Court held in 1984 that the ``public purpose'' requirement for a lawful taking means that the taking must be a valid exercise of the State's eminent domain powers. Because of the uniquely federal nature of federal intellectual property rights of exclusion, States have no eminent domain or other sovereign power over them. ``When Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its effects are pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its reach.'' Therefore, every State taking of an intellectual property right, with or without some promise of subsequent compensation, is a constitutional violation ripe for congressional enforcement under section five of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Stangely, and I think improperly, the Supreme Court declined to decide in Florida Prepaid whether our earlier Clarification Acts could be sustained as an enforcement of the Takings Clause. The Court also did not resolve when a violation of intellectual property rights amounts to an unconstitutional taking. Because the Court emphasized that the resolution of such constitutional questions is its job, and not ours, the IPPRA simply provides a federal cause of action for an unconstitutional taking of intellectual property rights, leaving the courts to make the final determination of what is a constitutional violation and what remedy is constitutionally authorized. The IPPRA does, however, instruct the courts to interpret both the right and the remedy as broadly as constitutionally permissible. At the same time, by excluding treble damages from the remedies provided and by adopting the same standard of compensation--``reasonable and entire compensation''--that is currently available against the federal government for patient infringements, the bill respects the States' dignity and responds to the Court's objection that the Clarification Acts provided identical remedies against States and private parties.  Finally, in order to ensure the full availability of constitutionally permissible remedies if the courts adopt a narrow view of the Takings Clause in this context, the IPPRA adopts a similar approach in providing the fullest remedies constitutionally available, up to and including ``reasonable and entire compensation'' but excluding treble damages, for State violations of a federal intellectual property owner's Fourteenth Amendment right not to be deprived of her property without due process of law.  In sum, the constitutional remedy provided by the IPPRA closely resembles the remedy that Congress provided decades ago for deprivations of federal rights by persons acting under color of State law. The bill does not expand the property rights secured by the federal intellectual property laws--these laws are already binding on the States--nor does the bill interfere with any governmental authority to regulate businesses that own such rights. It simply restores the ability of private persons to sue in federal court to enforce such rights against the States.  I view this bill as an exercise in cooperative federalism. Clear, certain and uniform national rules protecting federal intellectual property rights benefit everyone: consumers, businesses, the federal government and the States. The IPPRA preserves States' rights, and gives the States a free choice. At the same time, it ensures effective protection for individual constitutional rights, and fills the gap left by recent Supreme Court decisions in which there are federal rights unsupported by effective remedies.  There are, to be sure, other approaches that Congress could take to address the problems created by the Court's decisions. For example, Congress could condition a State's receipt of federal funds--including federal research funds used to generate intellectual property--on the State's wavier of immunity from any suit arising under the federal intellectual property laws. As I previously discussed, this approach is squarely supported by the Court's decisions in the spending cases. In my view, however, such an approach would be less respectful of State sovereignty than the opt-in-scheme proposed by the IPPRA. It would also impede the States' ability to conduct research in a manner that the IPPRA would not.  There is another approach that remains open to Congress that would provide a remedy for intellectual property owners against States, respect State sovereignty, and restore some degree of uniformity and consistency in the construction of the federal intellectual property laws. That is, Congress could give State courts jurisdiction over intellectual property suits or just compensation claims against the States, and then require the United States Supreme Court to exercise appellate review of the resulting State court judgment. There is no possible constitutional objection to this approach; the Eleventh Amendment does not defeat the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction over suits brought against the States. We should not, however, burden the Supreme Court in this manner when, as the IPPRA demonstrates, there are efficient and proper ways to bring these claims into the lower federal courts in which intellectual property expertise resides.  Intellectual property is the currency of the new global economy. As we move into the 21st century, we should not allow that currency to be devalued by abstruse 18th century legal formalities. For that reason, I believe that legislation is imperative to minimize the ill effects of the Supreme Court's latest attack on our ability to protect our national economic assets. The IPPRA restores protection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, under current law, go unremedied, and so provides the certainty and security necessary to foster innovation and creativity. We unanimously passed more sweeping legislation earlier this decade, but were thwarted by Supreme Court technicalities. The IPPRA is designed to restore the benefits we sought to provide intellectual property owners while meeting the Supreme Court's technical requirements. We should move to consider this legislation as soon as we return next year.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-by-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1835       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The protection of Federal intellectual property rights      is of critical importance to the Nation's ability to compete      in the global market.       (2) There is a strong Federal interest in the development      of uniform and consistent law regarding Federal intellectual      property rights, and in the fulfillment of international      treaty obligations that the Federal Government has      undertaken.       (3) Prior to 1985 and the Supreme Court ruling in      Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985) (in      this section referred to as ``Atascadero''), owners of      Federal intellectual property rights could fully protect      their rights against infringement by States.       (4) Following Atascadero, a number of courts held that      Federal patent, copyright and trademark laws failed to      contain the clear statement of intent to abrogate State      sovereign immunity necessary to permit owners of Federal      intellectual property rights to protect their rights against      infringement by States.       (5) In 1990, Congress passed the Copyright Remedy      Clarification Act (Public Law 101-553), to clarify its intent      to abrogate State sovereign immunity from suits for      infringement of copyrights and exclusive rights in mask      works.       (6) In 1992, Congress passed the Patent and Plant Variety      Protection Remedy Clarification Act (Public Law 102-206) and      the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (Public Law 102-542)      to clarify its intent to abrogate State sovereign immunity      from suits for infringement of patents, protected plant      varieties and trademarks.       (7) In 1996, the Supreme Court held in Seminole Tribe of      Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) (in this section      referred to as ``Seminole Tribe'') that Congress may not      abrogate State sovereign immunity under article I of the      United States Constitution. Under the Supreme Court decision      in Seminole Tribe, the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act,      the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification      Act, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act could not be      sustained under clause 3 or 8 of section 8 of article I of      the United States Constitution.       (8) In 1999, the Supreme Court held in Florida Prepaid      Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings      Bank, 119 S. Ct. 2199 (1999) (in this section referred to as      ``Florida Prepaid'') that the Patent and Plant Variety      Protection Remedy Clarification Act could not be sustained as      legislation enacted to enforce the guarantees of the due      process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the United      States Constitution.       (9) As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Florida      Prepaid, and absent remedial legislation, a patent owner's      only remedy under the Federal patent laws against a State      infringer of a patent is prospective relief under the      doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).       (10) On the same day that it decided Florida Prepaid, the      Supreme Court in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid      Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 119 S. Ct. 2219 (1999)      (in this section referred to as ``College Savings Bank'')      extended State sovereign immunity to purely commercial      activities of certain State entities.       (11) The Seminole Tribe, Florida Prepaid and College      Savings Bank decisions have the potential to--       (A) deprive private intellectual property owners of      effective protection for both their Federal intellectual      property rights and their constitutional rights under the      fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United States      Constitution; and       (B) compromise the ability of the United States to fulfill      its obligations under a variety of international treaties.       (12) Article I of the United States Constitution empowers,      but does not require, Congress to offer Federal intellectual      property protection to any person on such terms as appear      reasonable and appropriate to serve the public interest by      encouraging scientific and artistic innovation and promoting      commerce and fair competition.       (13) Congress can best accomplish the public interests      described under paragraph (12) by providing clear and certain      national rules protecting Federal intellectual property      rights that establish a level playing field for everyone,      including States.       (14) In recent years, States have increasingly elected to      avail themselves of the benefits of the Federal intellectual      property system by obtaining and enforcing Federal      intellectual property rights.       (15) Any State should continue to enjoy the benefits of the      Federal intellectual property system, if that State accepts      the burdens with the benefits.       (16) A State should not enjoy the benefits of the Federal      intellectual property laws unless it is prepared to have      those same laws enforced against that State.       (17) Limiting the ability of a State to enjoy the benefits      of the Federal intellectual property system will neither      prevent the State from providing any services to citizens of      that State, nor stop the State from engaging in any      commercial activity.       (18) If a State waives its sovereign immunity from suit      under the Federal intellectual property laws, any      constitutional violation resulting from its infringement of a      Federal intellectual property right may be remedied in an      infringement suit in Federal court.       (19) If a State does not waive sovereign immunity with      respect to Federal intellectual property laws, it is      necessary and appropriate for Congress to exercise its power      under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to the United      States Constitution to protect the constitutional rights of      owners of Federal intellectual property rights, which are      property interests protected by the fifth and fourteenth      amendments of the United States Constitution.       (20) According to the Supreme Court in College Savings      Bank, ``The hallmark of a protected property interest is the      right to exclude others.''. Patents, copyrights, and      trademarks are constitutionally cognizable species of      property because they secure for their owners rights of      exclusion against others.       (21) A State may not exercise any of the rights conferred      by a Federal intellectual property law without the      authorization of the right holder, except in the manner and      to the extent authorized by such law. In Goldstein v.      California, 412 U.S. 546 (1973), the Supreme Court stated      ``When Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its      effects are pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its      reach.''.       (22) Because a State engaged in an infringing use of a      Federal intellectual property right is acting outside the      scope of its sovereign power, such State fails to meet the      public use requirement for a taking of property imposed by      the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution (made      applicable to the States through the fourteenth amendment).       (23) According to the Supreme Court in Hawaii Housing      Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), a claim for the      taking of property     in violation of the public use requirement is ripe at the      time of the taking.       (24) A violation of the Federal intellectual property laws      by a State may also constitute an unconstitutional      deprivation of property under the due process clause of the      fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution.       (25) In order to enforce Federal intellectual property      rights against States under the fifth and fourteenth      amendments of the United States Constitution, it is      appropriate to provide a right to enjoin any continuing or      future constitutional violation and a right to recover      sufficient damages to make the injured party whole.       (26) Violations of the Federal intellectual property laws      by States not only impair the constitutional rights of the      individual intellectual property owner, but also discourage      technological innovation and artistic creation. Moreover, the      potential for future violations to go unremedied as a result      of State sovereign immunity prevents intellectual property      owners from securing fair and efficient fees in licensing      negotiations.       (27) States and instrumentalities of States have been      involved in many intellectual property cases. Some States      have violated Federal intellectual property rights and the      constitutional provisions which protect such rights and have      refused to waive their constitutional immunities, thereby      securing unfair economic advantages over other States and      private entities with whom such States may be in competition.       (28) States and instrumentalities of States have become      increasingly involved in commerce involving intellectual      property rights in recent years, and this trend is likely to      continue. As a result, violations of Federal intellectual      property rights by States have become increasingly more      widespread.       (29) It is not practical for Congress to engage in an      ongoing particularized inquiry as to which States are      violating the United States Constitution at any given time.      Accordingly, a national, uniform remedy for constitutional      violations is appropriate.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) provide States an opportunity to participate in the      Federal intellectual property system on equal terms with      private entities;       (2) reaffirm the availability of prospective relief to      prevent State officials from violating Federal intellectual      property laws, and to allow challenges to assertions by State      officials of rights secured under such laws, on the same      terms and in the same manner as if such State officials were      private parties;       (3) provide other Federal remedies to owners of Federal      intellectual property rights as against the States, State      instrumentalities and State officials, to the maximum extent      permitted by the United States Constitution; and       (4) abrogate State sovereign immunity in suits alleging      violations of Federal intellectual property laws or      challenging assertions of Federal intellectual property      rights by States to the maximum extent permitted by the      United States Constitution, pursuant to Congress's powers      under the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United      States Constitution and any other applicable provisions.

Recent Supreme Court decisions      invalidated prior efforts by Congress to abrogate State      sovereign immunity in actions arising under the federal      intellectual property laws. The IPPRA encourages States to      participate in the federal intellectual property system on      equal terms with private entities, by conditioning a State's      receipt of future benefits under the federal intellectual      property laws on an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.      As against States that choose not to participate, the bill      also provides new remedies for federal intellectual property      rights, to the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution.                            detailed summary   TITLE I--STATE PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY                                  SYSTEM                        Subtitle A--Definitions                         Sec. 101. Definitions       Section 101 defines terms used in this title.     Subtitle B--Procedures for State Participation in the Federal                       Intellectual Property System                       Sec. 111. Opt-in procedure       Section 111 provides that no State or State instrumentality      may acquire a federal intellectual property right unless the      State opts in to the federal intellectual property system by      agreeing to waive sovereign immunity in any subsequent action      that either arises under a federal intellectual property law      or seeks a declaration with respect to a federal intellectual      property right. Thus, if a State elects to receive the      benefits of a nationally recognized right governed by uniform      federal laws, then it must accept the obligation to defend      any suits arising under those laws in the federal courts.       An assurance provided under section 111 is binding on the      State and fully enforceable. ``A State may effectuate a      waiver of its constitutional immunity . . . in the context of      a particular federal program,'' so long as the State's      intention to waive its immunity is unequivocal. Atascadero      State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238 n.1 & 241 (1985).      See also Litman v. George Mason Univ., 186 F.3d 544 (4th Cir.      1999) (holding that a State's acceptance of federal education      funding resulted in a binding waiver of immunity in a      subsequent action against a State university under Title IX);      Innes v. Kansas State Univ., 184 F.3d 1275 (10th Cir. 1999)      (holding that a State university's agreement to participate      in a federal loan program acted as a binding waiver of      immunity).                Sec. 112. Breach of assurance by a State       Section 112 establishes procedures for determining whether      a State that has opted in to the federal intellectual      property system is in breach of its agreement to waive      sovereign immunity.        Sec. 113. Consequences of breach of assurance by a State       Section 113 sets forth three consequences of a breach of an      agreement to waive sovereign immunity.       First, under subsection (a), any pending applications by or      on behalf of the State for federal intellectual property      rights shall be regarded as abandoned and shall not be      subject to revival thereafter.       Second, under subsection (b), no damages or other monetary      relief shall be awarded in any action to enforce a federal      intellectual property right that is or has been owned by or      on behalf of the State during the preceding five years.       Third, under subsection (c), the State is barred from      acquiring any new rights under the federal intellectual      property laws for a period of one year. If, however, the      State opts back in to the system after a year has passed, by      providing a new assurance that it will henceforth waive its      sovereign immunity in federal intellectual property      litigation, it can then acquire new rights that will be      enforceable by the full panoply of federal intellectual      property remedies.Subtitle C--Administration of Procedures for State Participation in the                   Federal Intellectual Property System    Sec. 121. Notification by court of State assertion of sovereign                                 immunity       Section 121 directs federal courts to notify the      Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks within 20 days of      finding that a State has asserted sovereign immunity in any      action to enforce or challenge a federal intellectual      property right.  Sec. 122. Confirmation by Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks of                  State assertion of sovereign immunity       Section 122 directs the Commissioner of Patents and      Trademarks, within 20 days of receiving a notification under      section 121, to forward such notification to the Attorney      General of the State, together with a copy of title I of the      IPPRA, and inquire whether the State intends to withdraw its      assertion of immunity and consent tot he continuation or      refiling of the action in which it was made within the 60-     day grace period provided in section 112(b)(2).  Sec. 123. Publication by Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks of                  State assertion of sovereign immunity       Section 123 directs the Commissioner of Patents and      Trademarks, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture      and the Register of Copyrights, to publish in the Federal      Register and maintain on the Internet information concerning      the participation of each State in the federal intellectual      property system. The information must include, for each      State, whether the State's sovereign immunity has been      asserted, and the name of the case and court in which any      such assertion of immunity was made.                     Sec. 124. Rulemaking authority       Section 124 authorizes the Commissioner of Patents and      Trademarks to promulgate such rules as necessary to implement      the provisions of this subtitle.    Subtitle D--Amendments to the Federal Intellectual Property Laws  Sec. 131. Conditions for State participation in the federal patent                                  system       Section 131 amends the federal patent statute to require      any State that seeks to register for patent protection to      provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's intention to      waive sovereign immunity in any action to enforce or      challenge a federal intellectual property right. A State must      also certify that the State's sovereign immunity has not been      asserted in any such action during the past year.   Sec. 132. Conditions for State participation in the federal plant                        variety protection system       Section 132 amends the federal plant variety statute to      require any State that seeks to register for plant variety      protection to provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's      intention to waive sovereign immunity in any action to      enforce or challenge a federal intellectual property right. A      State must also certify that the State's sovereign immunity      has not been asserted in any such action during the past      year. Sec. 133. Conditions for State participation in the federal copyright                                  system       Section 133 amends the federal copyright statute to require      any State that seeks to register for copyright protection to      provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's intention to      waive sovereign immunity in any action to enforce or      challenge a federal intellectual property right. A State must      also certify that the State's sovereign immunity has not been      asserted in any such action during the past year. Sec. 134. Conditions for State participation in the federal mask work                                  system       Section 134 amends the federal mask work statute to require      any State that seeks to register for mask work protection to      provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's intention to      waive sovereign immunity in any action to enforce or      challenge a federal intellectual property right. A State must      also certify that the State's sovereign immunity has not been      asserted in any such action during the past year. Sec. 135. Conditions for State participation in the federal original                              design system       Section 135 amends the federal original design statute to      require any State that seeks to register for design      protection to provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's      intention to waive sovereign immunity in any action to      enforce or challenge a federal intellectual property right. A      State must also certify that the State's sovereign immunity      has not been asserted in any such action during the past      year. Sec. 136. Conditions for State participation in the federal trademark                                  system       Section 136 amends the federal trademark statute to require      any State that seeks to     register for trademark protection to provide an unequivocal      assurance of the State's intention to waive sovereign      immunity in any action to enforce or challenge a federal      intellectual property right. A State must also certify that      the State's sovereign immunity has not been asserted in any      such action during the past year.                    Sec. 137. No retroactive effect       Section 137 ensures that the amendments made by this      subtitle are not given retroactive effect. Specifically, the      amendments do not apply to any application by a State that      was pending before the effective date of this subtitle, or to      any assertion of sovereign immunity by a State made before      the enactment of the IPPRA. TITLE II--RESTORATION OF PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY                                  RIGHTS          Sec. 201. Liability of States for patent violations       Section 201 replaces section 296 of title 35, which was      enacted pursuant to the Patent and Plant Variety Remedy      Clarification Act of 1992 and invalidated by the Supreme      Court in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v.      College Savings Bank, 119 S. Ct. 2199 (1999).       Subsection (a) ensures the full availability of prospective      relief to prevent State officials from violating the federal      patent laws, and to allow challenges to assertions by State      officials of rights secured under such laws, on the same      terms and in the same manner as if such State officials were      private individuals. Such relief is authorized under the      doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which held      that an individual may sue a State official in an official      capacity for prospective relief requiring the State official      to cease violating federal law, even if the State itself is      immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.       Subsection (b) provides a cause of action against States,      State instrumentalities, and State officials acting in an      official capacity for (1) taking a patent right in violation      of the Fifth Amendment or (2) depriving a person of a patent      right without due process of law in violation of the      Fourteenth Amendment. Damages are fixed at ``reasonable and      entire compensation,'' which is the measure of damages      available against the United States for infringement of a      patent (see 28 U.S.C. 1498); treble damages are not      available under this subsection. Injunctive relief is      available to prevent or deter constitutional violations.       The remedy provided under subsection (b) is not available      against States that have waived their sovereign immunity from      suit in federal court, nor is it available against State      officials in their individual capacity, who do not partake of      the State's sovereign immunity. Such States and State      officials remain subject to the remedies provided by other      provisions of the federal patent laws, to the same extent as      such remedies are available in an action against any private      entity or individual. Thus, for example, a State official      sued in an individual capacity may not assert any defense or      claim of absolute or qualified immunity that would not be      available to a private individual under similar      circumstances.       Subsection (b) abrogates State sovereign immunity to the      maximum extent permitted by the Constitution, pursuant to      Congress's powers under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments      and any other applicable provisions.       A claim under subsection (b) for taking a patent right is      ripe at the time of the taking. In Hawaii Housing Authority      v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), the Supreme Court held that      the Public Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable      to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits a      State from taking private property for a non-public use, even      with just compensation. The Court further stated that ``[t]he      `public use' requirement is . . . coterminous with the scope      of a sovereign's police powers.'' 457 U.S. at 240. Because      States making unauthorized uses of federal intellectual      property rights are acting outside the scope of their      sovereign powers, a State's infringement of a patent, even if      compensated, is an unconstitutional taking of property for a      non-public use; accordingly, the patent holder need not seek      a remedy in State proceedings before filing a claim under      subsection (b) in federal court.       Subsection (b)(4) addresses the burden of proof when a      claimant produces prima facie evidence to support a claim      under this subsection. Under subsection (b)(4), the burden of      proof is on the State, except as to any elements of the claim      that would have to be proved if the action were brought under      another provision of this title. As to such elements, the      burden of proof is unaffected. Thus, for example, if the      adequacy of any State remedies became an issue, the State      would bear the burden of proof thereon.       Subsection (c) clarifies that the federal patent laws and      treaties supersede and preempt any power of a State to      acquire or otherwise affect patent rights through the      exercise of eminent domain.Sec. 202. Liability of States for violation of plant variety protection       Section 202 establishes the same sorts of remedies for      violations of protected plant varieties as section 201      establishes with respect to patents.         Sec. 203. Liability of States for copyright violations       Section 203 establishes the same sorts of remedies for      violations of copyrights as section 201 establishes with      respect to patents.         Sec. 204. Liability of States for mask work violations       Section 204 establishes the same sorts of remedies for      violations of federally-protected rights in mask works as      section 201 establishes with respect to patents.      Sec. 205. Liability of States for original design violations       Section 205 establishes the same sorts of remedies for      violations of federally-protected rights in original designs      as section 201 establishes with respect to patents.           Sec. 206. Liability of States trademark violations       Section 206 establishes the same sorts of remedies for      violations of federally-registered trademarks and service      marks as section 201 establishes with respect to patents.                    Sec. 207. Rules of construction       Subsection (a) makes clear that the district courts shall      have original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338 of any      action arising under this title. It follows that, pursuant to      28 U.S.C. Sec. 1295, the United States Court of Appeals for      the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any      appeal from a final decision of a district court in an action      arising under this title relating to patents, plant variety      protection, and exclusive rights in designs under chapter 13      of title 17.       Subsection (b) provides that this title shall be construed      in favor of a broad protection of intellectual property      rights, to the maximum extent permitted by its terms and the      Constitution.                       TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATES                       Sec. 301. Effective dates       Subsection (a) provides that the opt-in procedures      established by title I of the IPPRA shall take effect 90 days      after the date of enactment of the IPPRA.       Subsection (b) provides that the remedial provisions      established by title II of the IPPRA shall take effect with      respect to violations by States that occur on or after the      date of enactment of the IPPRA.                         Sec. 302. Severability       Section 302 contains a strong severability clause. If any      provision of the IPPRA or of any amendment made by the IPPRA,      or any application of such provision to any person or      circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder      of the IPPRA, the amendments made by the IPPRA, and the      application of the provision to any other person or      circumstance shall not be affected.                          ____________________
