Speaker, critics often hasten to draw attention to government agencies' failures, while ignoring successes if they notice them at all. Today I want to draw the House's attention to two prestigious awards and other accolades recently received by the Government Printing Office (GPO) for its leading role in electronic information dissemination through GPO Access, its acclaimed Internet information service (www.access.gpo.gov).  First, the Vice-President's National Partnership for Reinventing Government has honored the GPO and the Energy Department (DOE) jointly with a ``Hammer Award'' for the ``Information Bridge,'' a project which makes available thousands of unclassified DOE scientific and technical reports in electronic format.  Using the World Wide Web, users enter the DOE electronic dissemination system through GPO Access, where they can view over 30,000 DOE reports already on-line, with more becoming available every day. The Information Bridge eliminates the need to disseminate these reports to depository libraries in printed form, thereby saving production and distribution costs to the government, and processing and storage costs to the libraries.  This is GPO's second ``Hammer Award'' for GPO Access; the first came in 1997 for reengineering the Commerce Business Daily with the Commerce Department. In 1998 Vice-President Gore and Government Executive magazine named GPO Access one of the 15 ``Best Feds on the Web.''  In addition, the legal community has recently lauded GPO Access. Law Office Computing magazine's April/May issue named GPO Access one of the top 50 legal-research web sites for 1999. The magazine's top 50 web sites, which included only seven federal sites, were chosen as favorites of law librarians, attorneys and paralegals based on experience with the sites and their usability.  Further, the April 1999 issue of Chicago Lawyer magazine reports that the newsletter legal.online has selected GPO Access as both the ``best research site for laws'' and the ``overall best Government site.'' Finally, the GPO just received the first American Association of Law Libraries' ``Public Access to Government Information Award'' as the ``official, no-fee, one-stop public access point for the growing universe of web-based electronic Government information.'' These accolades follow GPO's selection in February by In-Plant Graphics magazine as the top in-plant operation in the country, and in March as a top technology innovator by PC Week magazine.  Public- and private-sector entities alike appreciate the leading role GPO is playing as we advance into the information age. Let's join in the applause for the dedicated professionals of the GPO.                          ____________________
