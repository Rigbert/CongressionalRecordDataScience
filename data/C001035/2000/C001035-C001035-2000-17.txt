President, on November 11th, people across the United States will celebrate Veterans' Day--a day in which we pause to remember and to honor the brave men and women who served their country in our armed forces.  November 11th also marks the anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, a conflict that promised to be the ``war to end all wars.'' Unfortunately, the peace that followed World War I was short-lived. The world soon was plunged into the cauldron of World War II, followed by the terror of the Cold War--played out on so many fronts, most tragically in Korea and Vietnam. Today we face continued threats to our liberty, with outlaw leaders of rogue states waging extremist campaigns against freedom and democracy, as well as the persistent danger of terrorist attacks--which we have seen all too recently with the USS Cole tragedy.  Indeed, the world is still a dangerous place, and World War I's promise of a lasting, worldwide peace has yet to be realized. The conflicts of the last century remind us that freedom constantly requires great sacrifices and often the lives of those who defend it. It is these patriots, the men and women of our armed forces, who answered the call of service and protected the freedoms we cherish. Although we can never fully repay the debt we owe these courageous Americans, we can and must continue to recognize the price they paid.  This year, Veterans' Day falls just four days after Election Day. I find this particularly fitting, as there is no greater symbol of American liberty than our ability to participate in free and fair elections. Above all else, we owe this freedom to our veterans. Time and again, our democracy has been preserved by these brave men and women.  This Veterans' Day marks another special occasion; the groundbreaking ceremony for the World War II Memorial, to be located on the National Mall in our nation's capital. This monument will stand in recognition of a generation of Americans who served their country so ably in resisting the forces of Nazism and oppression. This was a defining moment in our nation's history, and one to which almost every American feels some connection. My own father is a World War II veteran, and Purple Heart recipient.  Unlike my father, however, many Americans did not return home from this noble campaign. They were the duty-bound sons and daughters of our nation, who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country and for freedom. In the words of President Lincoln, they ``gave the last full measure of devotion,'' and we must uphold the memory of their heroism with respect, with reverence, and with our heartfelt admiration.  This is the purpose of Veterans' Day. Although mere words do not pay adequate tribute to the sacrifices our veterans have laid upon the altar of freedom, the knowledge of their noble deeds lives in the hearts and minds of those who are free--and shall not be forgotten.                          ____________________
