 Adult day care is an important issue, and being that the Senate and House of Representatives will have different language on this issue, it must be conferenced in a way to ensure that all with interests in this matter, including interested provider and senior organizations, are involved and approving of the final adult day care language. I am looking forward to further working with both of you on this matter.
