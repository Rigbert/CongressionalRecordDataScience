President, I know the Senator from Missouri has addressed similar questions before the conference on this legislation was convened, but now that we have the actual text of the statement of managers before us, I would like to clarify a section in the statement of managers. The language directs EPA to take no action to initiate or order the use of certain technologies such as dredging or capping until specific steps have been taken with respect to the National Academy of Science report on sediment remediation technologies, with limited exceptions. It is my understanding that in directing that the report's findings be properly considered by the Agency, the conferees are not directing any change in remediation standards. However, the conferees are directing EPA to consider the findings and recommendations of the forthcoming report, in addition to the existing guidance provided by the Agency's Contaminated Sediments Management Strategy, when making remedy selection decisions at contaminated sediment sites, and as the Agency develops guidance on remediating contaminated sediments.
