President, I rise today to introduce the Offshore Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act. This bill closes a tax loophole that is being used by some U.S.-based hedge funds that set up insurance companies in places like Bermuda and the Cayman Islands where they aren't taxed and where their earnings are sheltered from U.S. taxes. Offshore businesses that reinsure risks and that invest in U.S. hedge funds create the potential for tax avoidance of hundreds of millions of dollars.  Under these arrangements, a hedge fund or hedge fund investors make a capital investment in an offshore reinsurance company. The offshore reinsurance company then reinvests that capital, as well as premiums it receives, in the hedge fund. The owners of the reinsurer take the position that they are not taxed on corporate earnings until either those earnings are distributed, or the investors sell the corporation's stock at a gain reflecting those earnings.  However, the hedge fund ``reinsurers'' are taking advantage of an exception to the passive foreign investment company--or PFIC--rules of U.S. tax law. The PFIC rules are designed to prevent U.S. taxpayers from delaying U.S. tax on investment income by holding investments through offshore corporations. However, the PFIC rules provide an exception for income derived from the active conduct of an insurance business. The exception applies to income derived from the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is predominantly engaged in an insurance business and which would be subject to tax under Subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.  Current law does not prescribe how much insurance or reinsurance business the company must do to be considered predominantly engaged in an insurance business. Our investigative efforts show that some companies that are not legitimate insurance companies are taking advantage of this favorable tax treatment.  About a year ago I asked the Treasury Department and IRS to issue guidance to shut down this abuse. And in April, Treasury and IRS issued regulations that take a first step at addressing this issue. However, while the guidance offers clarity in this area, a legislative fix is required to fully close this loophole.  Therefore, today I am introducing the Offshore Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act to shut down this abuse once and for all. My bill would provide a bright-line test for determining whether a company is truly an insurance company for purposes of the exception to the PFIC rules.  Under the new rule, to be considered an insurance company, the company's insurance liabilities must exceed 25 percent of its assets. If the company fails to qualify because it has 25 percent or less--but not less than 10 percent--in insurance liability assets, the company may still be predominantly engaged in the insurance business based on facts and circumstances. A company with less than 10 percent of insurance liability assets will not be considered an insurance company and, therefore, would be ineligible for the PFIC exception and subject to current taxation.  The Offshore Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act will disqualify most of the hedge fund reinsurance companies that are taking advantage of the current law loophole, making them ineligible for the PFIC exception and stopping this abuse. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important reform.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a technical explanation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1687       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31,      2015.  Technical Explanation of the Offshore Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act               Introduced by Senator Wyden on June 25, 2015                              Present Law     Passive foreign investment companies       A U.S. person who is a shareholder of a passive foreign      investment company (``PFIC'') is subject to U.S. tax in      respect to that person's share of the PFIC's income under one      of three alternative anti-deferral regimes. A PFIC generally      is defined as any foreign corporation if 75 percent or more      of its gross income for the taxable year consists of passive      income, or 50 percent or more of its assets consists of      assets that produce, or are held for the production of,      passive income. Alternative sets of income inclusion rules      apply to U.S. persons that are shareholders in a PFIC,      regardless of their percentage ownership in the company. One      set of rules applies to passive foreign investment companies      that are ``qualified electing funds,'' under which electing      U.S. shareholders currently include in gross income their      respective shares of the company's earnings, with a separate      election to defer payment of tax, subject to an interest      charge, on income not currently received. A second set of      rules applies to passive foreign investment companies that      are not qualified electing funds, under which U.S.      shareholders pay tax on certain income or gain realized      through the company, plus an interest charge that is      attributable to the value of deferral. A third set of rules      applies to PFIC stock that is marketable, under which      electing U.S. shareholders currently take into account as      income (or loss) the difference between the fair market value      of the stock as of the close of the taxable year and their      adjusted basis in such stock (subject to certain      limitations), often referred to as ``marking to market.''     Passive income       Passive income means any income which is of a kind that      would be foreign personal holding company income, including      dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and certain gains on      the sale or exchange of property, commodities, or foreign      currency.       However, among other exceptions, passive income does not      include any income derived in the active conduct of an      insurance business by a corporation that is predominantly      engaged in an insurance business and that would be subject to      tax under subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.       In Notice 2003-34, the Internal Revenue Service identified      issues in applying the insurance exception under the PFIC      rules. One issue involves whether risks assumed under      contracts issued by a foreign company organized as an insurer      are truly insurance risks, and whether the risks are limited      under the terms of the contracts. In the Notice, the Service      also analyzed the status of the company as an insurance      company. The Service looked to Treasury Regulations issued in      1960 and last amended in 1972, as well as to the statutory      definition of an insurance company and to the case law. The      question to resolve in determining a company's status as an      insurance company is whether ``the character of all of the      business actually done by [the company] . . . indicate[s]      whether [the company] uses its capital and efforts primarily      in investing rather than primarily in the insurance      business.'' The Notice concluded that ``[t]he Service will      scrutinize these arrangements and will apply the PFIC rules      where it determines that [a company] is not an insurance      company for federal tax purposes.''       Proposed regulations on the insurance exception under the      PFIC rules published on April 24, 2015, provide that ``the      term insurance business means the business of issuing      insurance and annuity contracts and the reinsuring of risks      underwritten by insurance companies, together with those      investment activities and administrative services that are      required to support or are substantially related to insurance      and annuity contracts issued or reinsured by the foreign      corporation.'' The proposed regulations provide that an      investment activity is an activity producing foreign personal      holding company income, and that is ``required to support or      [is] substantially related to insurance and annuity contracts      issued or reinsured by the foreign corporation to the extent      that income from the activities is earned from assets held by      the foreign corporation to meet obligations under the      contracts.''       The preamble to the proposed regulations specifically      requests comments on the proposed regulations ``with regard      to how to determine the portion of a foreign insurance      company's assets that are held to meet obligations under      insurance contracts issued or reinsured by the company,'' for      example, if the assets ``do not exceed a specified percentage      of the corporation's total insurance liabilities for the      year.''                           Reasons for Change       The establishment of offshore businesses that reinsure      risks and that invest in U.S. hedge funds has been      characterized as creating the potential for tax avoidance. In      these arrangements, a hedge fund or hedge fund investors make      a capital investment in an offshore reinsurance company. The      offshore reinsurance company then reinvests that capital (as      well as premiums it receives) as reserves in the hedge fund.      Because the capital may be held largely or completely in one      investment (the hedge fund), an insurance regulator may      require a higher level of reserves to compensate for the lack      of diversification. This can magnify the effect of holding a      high level of reserves relative to a low level of insurance      liabilities.       The owners of the offshore reinsurance company take the      position that the reinsurance company is not a PFIC, and that      investors in it are not taxed on its earnings until those      earnings are distributed or the investors sell the      reinsurance company stock at a gain reflecting those      earnings. U.S. PFIC rules designed to prevent tax deferral      through offshore corporations provide an exception for income      derived in the active conduct of an insurance business. What      it takes to qualify under this exception as an insurance      business, including how much insurance or reinsurance      business the company must do to qualify under the exception,      may not be completely clear.       The hedge fund reinsurance arrangement is said to provide      indefinite deferral of U.S. taxation of the hedge fund's      investment earnings, such as interest and dividends. At the      time the taxpayer chooses to liquidate the investment,      ordinary investment earnings are said to be converted to      capital gains, which are subject to a lower rate of tax. The      use of offshore reinsurance companies allows large-scale      investments that are said to be consistent with capital and      reserve requirements applicable to the insurance and      reinsurance business.       Media attention to hedge fund reinsurance has described the      practice as dating from an arrangement set up in 1999. In      recent years, the practice has grown, giving rise to a      serious income mismeasurement problem. The ``Offshore      Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act'' seeks to prevent this income      mismeasurement by modifying the definition of an insurance      company for purposes of the PFIC rules. The ``Offshore      Reinsurance Tax Fairness Act'' provides that objective      measures of a firm's real insurance risks compared to its      assets are used to determine whether a firm is an insurance      company, or is a disguise cloaking untaxed offshore income.                        Explanation of Provision     Applicable insurance liabilities as a percentage of total          assets       Under the provision, passive income for purposes of the      PFIC rules does not include income derived in the active      conduct of an insurance business by a corporation (1) that      would be subject to tax under subchapter L if it were a      domestic corporation; and (2) the applicable insurance      liabilities of which constitute more than 25 percent of its      total assets as reported on the company's applicable      financial statement for the last year ending with or within      the taxable year.       For the purpose of the provision's exception from passive      income, applicable insurance liabilities means, with respect      to any property and casualty or life insurance business (1)      loss and loss adjustment expenses, (2) reserves (other than      deficiency, contingency, or unearned premium reserves) for      life and health insurance risks and life and health insurance      claims with respect to contracts providing coverage for      mortality or morbidity risks. This includes loss reserves for      property and casualty, life, and health insurance contracts      and annuity contracts. Unearned premium reserves with respect      to any type of risk are not treated as applicable insurance      liabilities for purposes of the provision. For purposes of      the provision, the amount of any applicable insurance      liability may not exceed the lesser of such amount (1) as      reported to the applicable insurance regulatory body in the      applicable financial statement (or, if less, the amount      required by applicable law or regulation), or (2) as      determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.       An applicable financial statement is a statement for      financial reporting purposes that (1) is made on the basis of      generally accepted accounting principles, (2) is made on the      basis of international financial reporting standards, but      only if there is no statement made on the basis of generally      accepted accounting principles, or (3) except as otherwise      provided by the Secretary in regulations, is the annual      statement required to be filed with the applicable insurance      regulatory body, but only if there is no statement made on      either of the foregoing bases. Unless otherwise provided in      regulations, it is intended that generally accepted      accounting principles means U.S. GAAP.       The applicable insurance regulatory body means, with      respect to any insurance business, the entity established by      law to license, authorize, or regulate such insurance      business and to which the applicable financial statement is      provided. For example, in the United States, the applicable      insurance regulatory body is the State insurance regulator to      which the corporation provides its annual statement.     Election to apply alternative test in certain circumstances       If a corporation fails to qualify solely because its      applicable insurance liabilities constitute 25 percent or      less of its total assets, a United States person who owns      stock of the corporation may elect in such manner as the      Secretary prescribes to treat the stock as stock of a      qualifying insurance corporation if (1) the corporation's      applicable insurance liabilities constitute at least 10      percent of its total assets, and (2) based on the applicable      facts and circumstances, the corporation is predominantly      engaged in an insurance business, and its failure to qualify      under the 25 percent threshold is due solely to temporary      circumstances involving such insurance business.       Whether the corporation's applicable insurance liabilities      constitute at least 10 percent of its total assets is      determined in the same manner as whether the corporation's      applicable insurance liabilities constitute more than 25      percent of its total assets.       In determining whether the corporation is predominantly      engaged in an insurance business, relevant facts and      circumstances under this election include: the number of      insurance contracts issued or taken on through reinsurance by      the firm; the amount of insurance liabilities (determined as      above) with respect to such contracts; the total assets of      the firm (determined as above); information with respect to      claims payment patterns for the current and prior years; the      nature of risks underwritten and the data available on      likelihood of the risk occurring (extremely low-risk but      extremely high cost risks are less indicative of being      engaged in an insurance business); the firm's loss exposure      as calculated for a regulator such as the SEC or for a rating      agency, or if those are not calculated, for internal pricing      purposes; the percentage of gross receipts constituting      premiums for the current and prior years; whether the firm      makes substantial expenditures during the taxable year with      respect to marketing or soliciting new insurance or      reinsurance business; and such other facts or circumstances      as the Secretary may prescribe.       Facts and circumstances that tend to show the firm may not      be predominantly engaged in an insurance business include a      small number of insured risks with low likelihood but large      potential costs; workers focused to a greater degree on      investment activities than underwriting activities; and low      loss exposure. The fact that a firm has been holding itself      out as an insurer for a long period is not determinative      either way.       Temporary circumstances include the fact that the company      is in runoff, that is, it is not taking on new insurance      business (and consequently has little or no premium income),      and is using its remaining assets to pay off claims with      respect to pre-existing insurance risks on its books.      Temporary circumstances may also include specific      requirements with respect to capital and surplus relating to      insurance liabilities imposed by a rating agency as a      condition of obtaining a rating necessary to write new      insurance business for the current year.       Temporary circumstances do not refer to starting up an      insurance business; the present-law PFIC rules include a      special start-up year rule under which a foreign corporation      that would be a PFIC under the income or assets test will not      be considered a PFIC in the first year in which it has gross      income if, among other requirements, the corporation is not a      PFIC in either of the two following years. This start-up year      exception to status as a PFIC applies broadly to all foreign      corporations including those in the insurance business.                             Effective Date       The provision applies to taxable years beginning after      December 31, 2015.                                 ______                                       By
