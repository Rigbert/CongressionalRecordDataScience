 It is not my intention, by not sending up the amendment, to be able to elongate the time that would have otherwise been allotted to the Senator from Delaware. I will do that. The reason why I have not sent the amendment to the desk is there are a few changes several of my Republican colleagues want, in the form they want it in to be able to send it up. That is the reason.  I see my colleague from Missouri on the floor. I am told he would like to speak to the drug court issue. If that is the case, I ask the permission of my friend from New Hampshire whether I could ask unanimous consent to yield to him 5 minutes of whatever time I have, if we reach an agreement on that time?
