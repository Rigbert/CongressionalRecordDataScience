Speaker, all of us here have been elected to represent the 600,000 people in each of our respective districts, but each of us also knows that we need to put always the interests of our great country ahead, No. 1. We are all Americans and we are proud of our heritage and this body.  Today, we have a terrible deficit and debt, $5 trillion. Each of us has to look under every rock and stone to try to get that deficit down. Somehow, though, certain interests have been able to keep mining royalties tied to 1872 law. That is ridiculous, and what a bargain for them.  Mr. Speaker, I am aware that if this bill goes forward there are interests that have a lock on about 1,200 acres of land that they are going to be able to put a claim on for about $8,000 or $9,000, and they are going to make a windfall profit of $10 billion on that money that they invest. That is not right. That is not right at all.  In fact, that is why the Citizens Against Government Waste say this, and I will include the letter for the Record. Mr. Speaker, the letter reads, in part, as follows: ``Dear Representative. In July, the House voted 271 to 153 against corporate special interests. This sounds like reform, but it is not; it is pure corporate welfare. As much as $15.5 billion in taxpayer-owned minerals will be sold beginning September 30 if the moratorium is not renewed.'' That is tomorrow.  ``Instead of taxpayers receiving billions in return from these sales, CBO estimates that the Senate reforms will provide a mere $150 million over 7 years. Simply put, a moratorium period must be adopted to allow for more comprehensive reform.''  ``The Interior Department estimates this single action could result in the issuance of 600 patents covering 230,000 acres of taxpayer land in the next 2 years. The Citizens Against Government Waste urge you to support the motion to recommit and pass mining claim patent moratorium language.''  Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this Interior appropriation bill unless we also pass and adopt the motion to recommit. The rape and pillage of taxpayers across this country has got to stop and we can do it with this motion, and I hope that we are successful.                            Citizens Against Government Waste,                               Washington, DC, September 28, 1995.       Dear Representative: The 600,000 members of the Council for      Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) urge you to support      the motion to recommit the FY 1996 Interior Appropriations      conference report and instruct the conferees to renew the      moratorium on patent applications for public lands.       In July, the House of Representatives boldly voted 271-153      against corporate special interests and extended the      moratorium for another year. However, during the conference,      a Senate provision was adopted which lifts the patent      moratorium and allows mining claim patents for the price of      the land surface. This sounds like reform, but it's not: it's      pure corporate welfare. As much as $15.5 billion in taxpayer-     owned minerals will be sold beginning September 30 if the      moratorium is not renewed. Instead of taxpayers receiving      billions in return from these sales, CBO estimates the Senate      reforms will provide a mere $150 million over seven years.      Simply put, a moratorium period must be adopted to allow for      more comprehensive reform.       The Interior Department estimates this single action could      result in the issuance of more than 600 patents covering      230,000 acres of taxpayer land in the next two years. CCAGW      urges you to support the motion to recommit and pass mining      claim patent moratorium language.           Sincerely,     Thomas A. Schatz,       President.
