President, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is correct in a technical sense.But I am going to discuss something that will have, in my view, great ramifications for the Federal budget generally, and I am going to outline that briefly this afternoon.

But yesterday, the Alaska Gasline Port Authority, an Alaska state-chartered agency, charged two of the companies that have drilling rights in the Arctic Refuge with conspiring to manipulate the State of Alaska's energy market.
