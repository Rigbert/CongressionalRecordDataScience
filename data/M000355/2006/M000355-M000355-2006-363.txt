 It is narrowly targeted but represents a delicate compromise between the gulf coast Senators, Senators from Florida, and it is the feeling of all those involved in developing this legislation, as I say, again, on a truly bipartisan basis, that if we open this bill up to amendments--we have lots of good ideas on this side of the aisle, and I expect there are lots of good ideas on that side of the aisle. I recall when we were doing the major Energy bill last year about this time, we spent several weeks on it as we considered virtually everybody's good idea about what to do, either on the conservation side or the production side.  So I say to my good friend, the only way to achieve success, it strikes the sponsors of the bill, is to keep it very narrowly crafted and to pass it as is out of the Senate.  I know that is not what we customarily do, but this is an unusual situation. We are trying to respond to high energy prices in America. Even though natural gas prices have subsided somewhat in recent months, we anticipate them going up again next fall. There is a good chance that the futures market in natural gas will actually respond favorably to this measure, if we can get it out of the Senate. Natural gas prices, we all know, are set in America. It is not a global price setting. It could provide immediate relief to natural gas customers all over America.  For all of those reasons, I object.
