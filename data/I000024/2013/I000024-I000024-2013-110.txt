President, let me go ahead and tell the floor what it is all about. I know I am going to be wanting to come back to the floor and get this in the queue.  It is very rare in this body that we come up with something everyone is for, something that wasn't a part of the original legislation, for a very good reason. We are talking about geothermal.  Right now we all recall in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, there is a provision that requires the Federal Government have a percentage of its energy be from renewable sources. The problem is this: Geothermal doesn't create any new energy. It lets you use the energy that is there, recover it, heat our homes, cool our homes, put it back, and then reuse it again.  As I say, it is something everyone is for. It is 100 percent renewable. The only oversight originally was that it did not actually create energy. The amendment would change this to allow geothermal heat pumps to be among the renewable energies that could be used by the Federal Government to meet its obligation under the 2005 Energy law.  This amendment doesn't cost anything, it doesn't mandate anything. It simply provides another acceptable way for the Federal Government to meet its obligations in a cost-effective way. It is noncontroversial and something everyone wants.  It would be my hope after that explanation the Senator from Louisiana would be willing to let me bring it up for the purpose of considering it, putting it in the queue, and then going back to where we were, acknowledging objections that he might have to other amendments.
