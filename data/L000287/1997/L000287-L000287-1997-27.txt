Mr. Speaker, I asked for this time because I noticed that the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey], is on the floor of the House, and I would like to know something about the schedule for the rest of tonight and tomorrow.  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow is the beginning of a high holiday for many of our Members.
