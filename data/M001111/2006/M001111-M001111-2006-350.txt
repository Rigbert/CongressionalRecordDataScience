 President, I wanted to take a minute to express my deep gratitude to Chairman Cochran who, as I stated earlier, has demonstrated extraordinary patience over the past 2 weeks we have been debating this supplemental bill.  I also want to express my thanks to the ranking member, Senator Byrd, who has continued to demonstrate his strong and resolute leadership on this bill.  I also want to thank the many members of our Appropriations Committee staff who have worked very hard.  First and foremost, I thank our staff director and deputy staff director on our side, Terry Sauvain and Chuck Kieffer.  I also thank the majority staff director, Keith Kennedy, and his staff, Clayton Heil and Les Spivey.  I want to make special mention of the extraordinary hard work of B.G. Wright, Kate Fitzpatrick, and Rachael Taylor. They have been keeping us all on track on this side as to which of the hundreds of filed amendments have been cleared and which have not.  Finally, I thank Peter Rogoff who has dedicated his life on the Senate floor for the last 2 weeks above and beyond the call.  I thank all our staff and floor staff for being here many long hours for the completion of this bill.  I yield the floor.
