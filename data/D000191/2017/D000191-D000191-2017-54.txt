Speaker, on June 29th I voted in favor of H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, which increases penalties for deported criminals that return to the United States.  The bill is named after Kate Steinle, who was killed in San Francisco by a Mexican national who had seven felony convictions on his record and had been deported five times and had once again returned to the United States.  I have always argued that we need comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system. In 2013, I cosponsored the House Democratic comprehensive immigration reform bill, H.R. 15, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. This bill included similar provisions to Kate's Law and had broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate.  Opponents of the bill argue that the bill does not make exceptions for asylum seekers or victims of human trafficking. That is why I voted in favor of a Motion to Recommit H.R. 3004 offered by Representative Zoe Lofgren which would safeguard vulnerable victims of human trafficking that voluntarily present themselves at a port of entry. Unfortunately, it failed on a 193 to 232 vote.  I have always maintained that undocumented immigrants who commit a crime in the U.S. should be deported. While this bill is not perfect, Kate's Law ensures that dangerous criminals are prosecuted accordingly. I am committed to regaining control of our country's borders and have fought to restrict individuals who would do our citizens harm--both through terrorist attacks, drug smuggling, and other illicit activity--from entering the United States.  H.R. 3004 is not a perfect bill. It now heads to the Senate, where I hope it will be improved to include exceptions for victims of trafficking and those seeking asylum, similar to the comprehensive bill in 2013, and sent back to the House for further debate.                          ____________________
