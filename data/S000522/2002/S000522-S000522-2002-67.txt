Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to bring to the floor legislation that I introduced almost a year ago to respond to the diabolical terrorist attacks of September 11 and the anthrax attacks that followed.  The legislation, H.R. 3253, as amended, the Department of Veterans Affairs Emergency Preparedness Act of 2002, provides the Federal Government with another tool to prevent or, if necessary, respond to future acts of terrorism against the United States. This legislation is designed to mobilize the underappreciated strength of the VA health care infrastructure in defending our Nation against future acts of terrorism.  Although it may come as a surprise to many, the Department of Veterans Affairs operates our Nation's largest integrated health care network, with over 200,000 health care practitioners, 163 medical centers, more than 800 outpatient clinics, 115 medical research programs, affiliations with over 100 schools of medicine, and a $25 billion annual budget including over $1 billion for research programs.  The VA health care system must, Madam Speaker, be an integral component of any homeland security strategy. In fact, the VA already does have defined roles in both the National Disaster Medical System and the Federal Response Plan in the event of national emergencies.  Among the VA's current specialized duties are, one, conducting and evaluating disaster and terrorist attack simulation exercises; second, managing the Nation's stockpile of drugs to counter the effects of chemical and biological poisons; third, maintaining a rapid response team for radioactive releases; and, fourth, training public and private NDMS medical center personnel around the country in properly responding to biological, chemical, or radiological disasters.  H.R. 3253 was developed in order to apply the existing experience and expertise in the VA's health care research programs as a defensive tool in the war on terrorism.  Madam Speaker, I know from my own experience with the anthrax attacks last October, which hit my own district and hit it hard in central New Jersey in Hamilton Township, putting thousands of dedicated postal workers and the public as well at risk, that we need to move very quickly, develop new tests and new treatments for anthrax and scores of other biological and dangerous chemical agents and radiological weapons that might be employed by terrorists.  When anthrax was discovered in the Hamilton Post Office, I was astounded to discover that there were no existing protocols to test, quarantine, or treat victims. The confusion that emanated, the fog, if my colleagues will, that followed the discovery of anthrax made a bad situation even worse. I saw it over and over again, well-intentioned experts from the departments of health, State and Federal, CDC and the like were flying by the seat of their collective pants. Far too many pertinent questions were not answered and were not answered with scientific or any kind of precision.  It was during that crisis, frankly, that I thought that we needed to develop a new policy that would establish protocols which would try to deal with the details before the unthinkable, which now had become thinkable, actually happened; and that was the genesis of this legislation.  H.R. 3253, we believe, will marshal some of our Nation's best and brightest scientists in a focused effort to develop new protocols for testing, vaccinating, and treating our citizens who may be victims of biological, chemical, or radiological terrorism.  Madam Speaker, the House previously approved H.R. 3253, as amended, on May 20. I am very grateful that the Senate passed an amended bill on August 1. The bill before us today represents the compromise language agreed to after discussions and negotiations between the House and the Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs.  As amended, H.R. 3253 will authorize the VA to establish four National Medical Preparedness Centers. These centers would undertake research and develop new protocols for detecting, diagnosing, vaccinating, and treating potential victims of terrorism. In particular, the centers would focus onways to prevent and treat victims of biological, chemical, and radiological or explosive terrorist acts.  The new centers would conduct direct research and coordinate ongoing and promising new research with affiliated universities and other government agencies. These centers would serve as training resources for thousands of community hospital staffs; hazardous materials, HAZMAT teams; emergency medical technicians, EMTs; and firefighters and police officers, who must be the first medical responders in the event of terrorist attacks.  The emergency preparedness centers would also be charged with establishing state-of-the-art laboratories to help local health officials detect the presence of dangerous biological and chemical poisons.  The funding to support these centers would come from the additional funds provided for combating terrorism and would not use or otherwise reduce funding for veterans' health care.  Under the compromise agreement reached with the Senate, VA's authority to provide emergency medical treatment would be expanded to include first responders, other Federal agencies, veterans not enrolled in the VA health care system, active duty service members, and others receiving VA care in declared domestic emergencies. Reimbursements collected for the cost of care, whether coming from FEMA, the Department of Defense, or an insurance company, would be credited to the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund, the same as in other VA collection efforts.  In addition, a new Assistant Secretary for preparedness security and law enforcement would be established at the VA.  Finally, Madam Speaker, the compromise bill would codify in title 38 of the U.S. Code various provisions from Public Law 107-188, the ``Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002,'' that pertain to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Madam Speaker, as we pass the 1-year anniversary of 9-11 and the subsequent anthrax attacks, we are all thankful that no additional acts of terror have been carried out against the United States. However, there can be no doubt that serious dangers and threats remain. Our government must remain vigilant in defending and protecting our citizens from every threat, of any kind, and H.R. 3253 is another step towards homeland security. I urge all Members to support this legislation.  The House amendment to the Senate amendments to H.R. 3253 reflects a Compromise Agreement that the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have reached on H.R. 3253 and S. 2132. H.R. 3253 (hereinafter known as the ``House bill'') passed the House on May 20, 2002. The Senate considered S. 2132 (hereinafter known as the ``Senate bill'') on August 1, 2002. This measure was incorporated in H.R. 3253 as an amendment and passed the Senate by unanimous consent on August 1, 2002.  The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have prepared the following explanations of H.R. 3253, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise Agreement''). Differences between the preparedness provisions contained in the Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of H.R. 3253 and S. 2132 are noted in this document, except for clerical corrections, conforming changes made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.                              short title       Current Law--Public Law 105-368, the ``Veterans Programs      Enhancement Act of 1998,'' charged Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) to investigate potential long-term health      effects of biological and chemical warfare agents. Under      current law, the VA does not possess specific authority to      establish centers dedicated to research, education, and      training activities related to managing the health      consequences of terrorist use of weapons of mass destruction.       House Bill--Section 1 of H.R. 3253 provides that the short      title of the bill is the ``Department of Veterans Affairs      Emergency Preparedness Research, Education, and Bio-Terrorism      Prevention Act of 2002''.       Senate Bill--Section 1 of S. 2132 provides that the short      title of the bill is the ``Department of Veterans Affairs      Emergency Preparedness Act of 2002''.       Compromise Agreement--Section 1 of the Compromise Agreement      would adopt the Senate language.  establishment of medical emergency preparedness research centers at              department of veterans affairs medical centers       Current Law--No provision.       House Bill--Section 2(a) of H.R. 3253 would amend Chapter      73 of title 38, United States Code, by establishing a new      section 7325.       Subsection (a) of section 7325 of title 38, United States      Code, would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to      establish at least four national medical emergency      preparedness centers at existing VA medical centers, to be      staffed with department employees. The Under Secretary for      Health, in consultation with the assistant secretary for      operations, preparedness, and security, would be responsible      for supervising and evaluating the operation of these      centers.       Proposed section 7325(b) of title 38, United States Code,      would define the centers' three-fold mission as follows: (1)      to a conduct research and development into ``detection,      diagnosis, vaccination, protection, and treatment for      chemical, biological and radiological threats;'' (2) to      provide education, training, and expert advice to department      and community health-care practitioners; and (3) to provide      ``contingent rapid response laboratory assistance'' to local      health-care authorities during national emergencies. The      House bill would specify that at least one center concentrate      solely on biological threats, one on chemical threats, and      one on radiological threats to public health and safety.       Proposed section 7325(c) of title 38, United States Code,      would define qualifications for center directors, and section      7325(d) would direct the Secretary to designate sites through      a competitive selection process. Proposed section 7325(g)      would establish a consulting peer-review panel, including      experts in relevant fields, to assist the Under Secretary for      Health in evaluating the scientific and clinical merits to      proposals and offering recommendations concerning site      designations for the four centers.       Paragraph 2 of proposed section 7325(d) of title 38, United      States Code, would require that a candidate site demonstrate      the ability to attract qualified scientists; develop      arrangements with at least one accredited, affiliated school      of medicine and school of public health; be affiliated with a      graduate program in epidemiology; and offer training and      education programs for nursing, social work, counseling, and/     or other allied health personnel.       Subsection (e) of the proposed section 7325 of title 38,      United States Code, would authorize to be appropriated $20      million for each of fiscal years 2003-2007, and would      authorize the Under Secretary for Health to expend Medical      Care funds as appropriate for the support of such centers, in      coordination with the assistant secretary with responsibility      for operations, preparedness, and security. Subsection (f) of      the proposed section 7325 would authorize each center to seek      other public or private research funds to fulfill its      research mission.       Proposed section 7325(h) of title 38, United States Code,      would require that VA make the centers' findings available to      health-care providers in the United States through      publications and medical education programs, and that      research programs be coordinated and shared with other      Federal departments and agencies. The House bill would      authorize the Department to assist Federal, State, and local      civil and criminal authorities upon request to deal with      biological, chemical, or radiological threats. Proposed      subsection (j) of section 7325 would authorize details on a      non-reimbursable basis of other Federal employees to assist      the centers in accomplishing center missions.       Senate Bill--Section 101 in the Senate bill would add      section 7320A to title 38, United States Code.       Proposed section 7320A in the Senate bill would establish      four centers to carry out research on ``the detection,      diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of injuries, diseases,      and illnesses arising from the use of chemical, biological,      radiological, or incendiary or other explosive weapons or      devices.'' This section would require that centers provide      education and training to VA health-care professionals, and      to non-VA professionals at the direction of the Secretary      through the National Disaster Medical System (hereinafter      ``NDMS'') or other interagency agreements. This section would      also authorize the Secretary to provide appropriate      ``laboratory, epidemiological, medical, or other assistance''      to Federal, State, and local health-care agencies and      personnel involved in or responding to a national emergency.      The Senate bill would not assign specific areas of research      to single centers.       The Senate bill would require that the Secretary designate      centers after peer review of competitive proposals submitted      by existing qualified VA medical centers. The Senate bill      would require the same qualifications as the House bill, but      would require geographic dispersal ``to the maximum extent      practicable.''       The Senate bill would require the offices responsible for      directing research and medical emergency preparedness to      administer the centers. This section would require those      offices to work in close coordination with the Departments of      Defense and Health and Human Services, the Office of Homeland      Security, and other agencies, interagency working groups, or      committees charged with coordinating Federal research into      the response to casualties caused by terrorist use of weapons      of mass destruction.       Subsection (e) of proposed section 7320A would require that      centers be staffed by VA employees or employees detailed from      other Federal agencies, on a non-reimbursable basis.       Proposed section (f) section 7320A would authorize the      Secretary to provide assistance to Federal, State, and local      agencies engaged in investigations or inquiries to protect      against threats posed by terrorist use of weapons of mass      destruction. Proposed section 7320A(g) would authorize the      centers to seek grants from outside sources, and would      authorize to be appropriated $20 million for each of fiscal      years 2003-2007.       Compromise Agreement--The Compromise Agreement would      incorporate the Senate provisions in proposed section 7325 of      title 38, United States Code, authorizing a total of four      medical emergency preparedness centers, dispersed      geographically to the maximum extent practicable. The      Committees intend for VA to select sites based upon the      strength of existing resources and scientific merit of the      proposals; although regional distribution of these centers      would be encouraged, predicted research productivity should      be paramount in designating sites.       The proposed section 7325(a) of title 38, United States      Code, would follow the House bill assigning responsibility      for operation and supervision of the centers to the Under      Secretary for Health, in consultation with the assistant      secretary with responsibility for operations, preparedness,      security, and law enforcement. The Compromise Agreement would      not include House language defining qualifications for center      directors. The centers would be situated organizationally      within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and would      report to the Under Secretary for Health. Nevertheless, the      research products and educational tools arising from the work      of the centers would link directly to the mission and      function that the compromise Agreement would assign to the      assistant secretary responsible for operations, preparedness,      security and law enforcement. Thus, there would be a clearly      defined line of accountability and coordination among the      centers and the responsible departmental officials. This need      is clearly acknowledged in the Compromise Agreement by the      requirement to link the Under Secretary's decisions with      regard to the operations of the centers to the work of the      assistant secretary.       Proposed section 7325(b)(1) of title 38, United States      Code, in the Compromise Agreement would follow the Senate      language by substituting ``prevention'' for ``vaccination and      protection,'' and adding to the list of potential threats      incendiary and other explosive sources. The Committees agree      that contingency planning would include an all-hazards      approach and acknowledge that strategies for mass casualty      management overlap, irrespective of the particular nature of      a terrorist attack or source of other mass-casualty disaster.      The Compromise Agreement would not require individual centers      to be dedicated to specific fields of study. Nevertheless,      the Compromise Agreement would allow the Department to pursue      multiple approaches to the medical management of mass      casualties. In exercising the authority, the Department could      designate any, some, or none of the centers as lead agent for      developing subject matter expertise in a particular focused      research area dealing with bioterrorism.       Proposed section 7325(b)(2) of title 38, United States      Code, would require centers to provide education, training,      and advice to health-care professionals within VHA as      proposed in both bills, but would follow the Senate language      to specify that such training be provided to outside      professionals and practitioners through the NDMS as      authorized by Public Law 107-188, the ``Public Health      Security and bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of      2002,'' or through specific interagency agreements executed      for the purpose. The committees intend that VA take steps to      ensure that potentially valuable research findings and      educational developments in medical emergency preparedness be      translated from the centers into clinical practice as quickly      as practicable, but that VA accomplish this task through      channels established as part of VA's role in existing federal      response partnerships and the evolving U.S. national homeland      security policy.       Proposed section 7325(b)(3) of title 38, United States      Code, would adapt language from both bills authorizing      centers to provide such laboratory, epidemiological, medical,      or other assistance as the Secretary considers appropriate to      Federal, State, and local health-care agencies and personnel      in the event of a disaster or emergency.       Proposed section 7325(c) of title 38, United States Code,      would direct the Secretary to select sites for centers as      delineated in language shared by both bills, following the      House language that would require proposals for the      designation of centers be coordinated between the United      Secretary for Health and the assistant secretary for      operations, preparedness, and security, and be subject to a      scientific peer-review process. The Compromise Agreement      would follow House language describing the composition of the      peer-review panel, but would replace the term ``bio-hazards      management education and training'' with the term      ``infectious diseases,'' in describing the types of expertise      called for in such peer-review panel participation. The      Compromise Agreement would also follow House language      requiring that to be qualified, centers would need to develop      an arrangement under which nursing, social work, counseling,      or allied health personnel would receive training and      education from the centers, in addition to other provisions      shared by both bills.       Sections 7325(d) and (e) of title 38, United States Code,      would adopt the House language on research activities and      dissemination of research products. Section 7325(f) would      follow the Senate language requiring that research be      coordinated with departments, agencies, and working groups      charged with coordinating Federal research into responses to      weapons of mass destruction.       Proposed section 7325(i) of title 38, United States Code,      in the Compromise Agreement, would follow House language on      the authorization of appropriations to support the efforts of      these centers.education and training programs on medical responses to consequences of                           terrorist activities       House bill--Section 3(a) of the House bill would amend      chapter 73 of title 38, United States Code, by adding a new      section 7326.       Section 7326(a), of title 38, United States Code, would      require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop and      disseminate programs to educate and train health-care      professionals to respond to the consequences of terrorist      activities.       Proposed section 7326(b), of title 38, United States Code,      would designate the Under Secretary for Health, in      consultation with the assistance secretary responsible for      operations, preparedness and security, as the implementing      officials or entity.       Under section 7326(c), of title 38, United States Code, the      education and training programs currently established at the      F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine of the Uniformed Services      University of the Health Sciences would provide baseline      national curriculum and clinical protocols for training      health-care professionals.       Section 7326(d), of title 38, United States Code, would      require the education and training programs to cover the      needs of health-care professionals at every level of learning      and in a variety of fields.       Under section 7326(e), of title 38, United States Code, the      Secretary would be required to consult with the accrediting,      certifying and coordinating bodies representing the various      fields of health professions' education.       Section 3(b), of the House bill would require the      Secretaries to implement this section within 90 days of      enactment.       Senate bill--The Senate bill contains no comparable      provisions.       Compromise Agreement--Section 3 of the Compromise Agreement      would follow the House language with one amendment requiring      that programs be designed for health-care professionals ``in      Department medical centers.''  AUTHORITY TO FURNISH HEALTH CARE DURING MAJOR DISASTERS AND MEDICAL                               EMERGENCIES       Current Law--Section 8111A of title 38, United States Code,      authorizes VA to serve as a supportive contingency health-     care system to the Department of Defense, requiring VA to      furnish hospital care, nursing home care, and medical      services to members of the Armed Forces on active duty during      and following a period of foreign war. This provision      addresses the potential needs of post-deployment forces      following an armed conflict abroad, when active-duty military      casualties might quickly overwhelm available military      treatment facility resources. Under section 1784 of title 38,      United States Code, the Secretary is authorized to ``furnish      hospital care or medical services as a humanitarian service      in emergency cases, but the Secretary shall charge for such      care and services at rates prescribed by the Secretary.'' The      authority of section 1784 addresses humanitarian care      provided by the Department to non-veterans.       Neither provision authorizes VA to care for active-duty      military casualties following a domestic disaster or      conflict, a possibility that must be acknowledged following      the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September      11, 2001. In addition, current law does not recognize VA's      already considerable commitment to providing emergency care      during disasters as part of the Federal Response Plan      established under Executive Orders 12148 and 12656.       House bill--The House bill contains no comparable      provisions.       Senate bill--Section 301(a) of the Senate bill would add a      new section 1785 to title 38, United States Code, to      authorize the Secretary to furnish hospital care and medical      services to individuals responding to, involved in, or      otherwise affected by a declared major disaster or emergency,      or following activation of the NDMS. Proposed section 1785(c)      of title 38, United States Code, would allow VA to care for      veterans during such a disaster without regard to enrollment      required under section 1705 of title 38, United States Code.      Proposed section 1785(d) of title 38, United States Code,      would authorize the Secretary to give higher priority to      furnishing care to individuals affected by disasters than to      anyone except service-connected veterans and members of the      Armed Forces receiving care under section 8111A of title 38,      United States Code. Proposed section 1785(e)(1) of title 38,      United States Code, would authorize VA to be reimbursed for      care furnished to an officer or employee of another Federal      department or agency, with amounts credited in the Medical      Care Collections Fund to the facility providing care. Under      proposed section 1785(f) of title 38, United States Code, the      Secretary would be required to report to the House and Senate      Committees on Veterans' Affairs the volume of care furnished      by VA under these provisions.       Section 301(b) of the Senate bill would amend title 38 of      the United States Code,     section 1784, to provide an exception to the requirement that      VA charge individuals for emergency care during a covered      disaster or emergency.       Finally, the Senate bill would amend section 8111A of title      38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary to furnish      hospital care or medical services to members of the Armed      Forces on active duty in this country, whose need for care is      related to their response to a covered disaster or national      emergency.       Compromise Agreement--Section 4 of the compromise Agreement      would follow the Senate language, but would amend it by      striking references to priorities for furnishing care. Also,      the Compromise Agreement would delete language that would      have suspended VA charges for emergency care under section      1784 of title 38, United States Code, during disasters.    INCREASE IN NUMBER OF ASSISTANT SECRETARIES OF VETERANS AFFAIRS       Current law--Section 308 of title 38, United States Code,      currently authorizes six assistant secretaries of the      Department of Veterans Affairs and 18 deputy assistant      secretaries.       House bill--Section 4 of the House bill would amend section      308 of title 38, United States Code, by increasing the number      of authorized assistant secretaries to ``seven'' and would      amend subsection (b) of that section by adding ``operations,      preparedness, security, and law enforcement functions'' to      currently authorized functions.       Senate bill--Section 201 of the Senate bill is identical to      section 4 of the House bill. Section 202 of the Senate bill      would amend section 308(d)(1) of title 38, United States      Code, by increasing the number of authorized deputy assistant      secretaries from 18 to 20.       Compromise Agreement--Sections 6(a) and (b) of the      Compromise Agreement would follow identical provisions from      both bills. Section 6(c) of the Compromise Agreement would      increase the number of deputy assistant secretaries from 18      to 19. The Committees urge the Secretary to examine the      deployment of existing deputy assistant secretaries to ensure      that the Department is properly staffed with deputy assistant      secretaries to fulfill its various functions and missions.  CODIFICATION OF DUTIES OF SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS RELATING TO                          EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS       Current law--Section 154 of Public Law 107-188, the      ``Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and      Response Act of 2002,'' enacted on June 12, 2002, mandated a      series of responsibilities for the Secretary of Veterans      Affairs related to bioterrorism and other emergency      preparedness functions.       House bill--The House bill contains no comparable      provisions.       Senate bill--The Senate bill contains no comparable      provisions.       Compromise Agreement--The compromise Agreement is intended      to codify authorities related to the Secretary's emergency      preparedness duties, enacted in Public Law 107-188 into      chapter 81 of title 38, United States Code.       The Compromise Agreement would add a new section 8117 to      title 38, United States Code. Proposed section 8117(a)      codifies the requirement that the Secretary provide for the      readiness of VA medical centers against chemical or      biological attacks in order to protect patients and staff and      to fulfill other emergency response missions. Proposed      section 8117(a)(2) codifies the requirement that these      preparations include provision and training in the use of      decontamination and personal protection equipment.       Proposed section 8117(b) of title 38, United States Code,      would codify the requirement that the Secretary provide for      the security of VA medical and research facilities, taking      into account the security evaluation required by section      154(b)(1) of Public Law 107-188.       Proposed section 8117(c) of title 38, United States Code,      would codify the requirement that the Secretary develop and      maintain a centralized system for tracking the location and      availability of pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and      medical equipment throughout the VA's health-care system so      that these items might be accessed quickly during disasters.       Proposed section 8117(d) of title 38, United States Code,      would codify the requirement that the Secretary ensure that      VA medical centers, in consultation with affiliated medical      schools, take steps to train resident physicians and other      health-care personnel in the potential medical consequences      of a terrorist attack.       Proposed section 8117(e) of title 38, United States Code,      would codify the requirement that the Secretary establish and      maintain a training program for VA health-care professionals      and their community partners in the NDMS, in accordance with      recommendations of the bioterrorism preparedness working      group established in title 42, United States Code, and in      consultation with the other NDMS Federal partners.       Proposed section 8117(f) of title 38, United States Code,      would codify the requirement that the Secretary develop and      maintain strategies that would allow VA expert personnel to      provide mental health assistance, including counseling and      assistance for post-traumatic stress disorder, following a      terrorist attack or other public health emergency. Such a      strategy would be developed in consultation with the      Secretary of Health and Human Services, the American Red      Cross and the bioterrorism preparedness working group      established in title 42, United States Code. The Secretary      would be responsible for training and coordinating VA      providers in the treatment of veterans, emergency responders,      active-duty military personnel, or others seeking care at a      VA medical center.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
