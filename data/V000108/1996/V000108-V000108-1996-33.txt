Speaker, it is my great honor to congratulate the Polish Army Veterans Association [PAVA] Post 40 in Hammond, IN on its 75th anniversary. PAVA Post 40 will hold an anniversary celebration at its banquet hall in Hammond this Saturday, May 18, 1996. I especially would like to congratulate post commander, Mr. Walter Prygon, and post financial secretary, Mr. Zenon Wiecinski, and all the other members of PAVA Post 40 for their time-honored dedication to preserve their Polish heritage and to assist their fellow countrymen in times of need. Joining the celebration will be Edward Repay, president of the Hammond City Council, and Lake County sheriff, John Buncich.  The history of the PAVA is one of pride and honor. At the beginning of World War I, while the United States was still a neutral country, several prominent Polish-Americans issued an appeal to organize a volunteer army to fight the threat to Poland's freedom. Because the United States was still neutral at this time, it granted permission to Polish-American leaders to form an army to help with the war in Poland. Within the framework of the so-called Act of Arming, thousands of young Polish immigrants in the United States and Canada presented themselves for training. This training took place at Camp Niagara, in Canada.  After training, the recruits were sent to France under the command of the leader of the Polish Armed Forces, Gen. Jozef Haller. General Haller named these troops the ``Blekitna Armia'' (Blue Army) after the color of their uniforms. Under the command of General Haller, the Blue Army contributed to the end of the Polish-Red Communist conflict. However, because Poland was destroyed by war and 150 years of bondage by neighboring countries, Poland could not compensate General Haller and the Blue Army for their heroic stand and sacrifice. After completing their duties, the Blue Army soldiers returned to the United States and Canada in tattered uniforms.  Once back in the United States, the soldiers sought to continue the traditions they developed in Poland by forming a veterans organization in the United States and Canada. This organization was registered in the United States under the name of the Polish Army Veterans Association. Currently, the national headquarters is located in Cleveland, OH, and there are 70 posts with about 2,000 members throughout the country. The purpose of the organization, as incorporated in its own constitution, is to bring help to those less fortunate, as well as to hold social gatherings in an effort to cultivate and continue Polish traditions.  Before World War I, the majority of Polish immigrants in the United States settled in industrial towns, such as Hammond, IN and others in northwest Indiana. These Polish-American settlers included discharged soldiers of General Haller's army. These immigrants registered with the national headquarters of the Polish Army Veterans Association, and, on May 5, 1921, they were officially designated as Post 40. Eventually, the members of Post40 realized they needed their own home office, which led to the purchase of the building at 241 Gostlin Street in Hammond. This remains their current home office. Local organizations hold special events at Post 40, including the Soccer Club ``Polonia,'' Saturday School of Polish Language, and academia group 3095. In 1936, the Women's Auxiliary at Post 40 was organized by Mrs. W. Wytrzymalski, who also became the first president. The Women's Auxiliary has offered its assistance in all veterans' undertakings, especially in its collection of ``Blawateck'' (Polish Buddy Poppies), which are sold to help raise money for the veterans.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate my congratulations to Post 40 Commander Prygon, Financial Secretary Wiecinski, and all members of PAVA Post 40 for their commitment to remembering their Polish heritage, as well as their commitment to improving the quality of life for all residents of Indiana's First Congressional District. May their 75th anniversary celebration be a joyous one.                          ____________________
