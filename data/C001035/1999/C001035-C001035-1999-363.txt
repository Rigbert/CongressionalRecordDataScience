Last year, the FY99 Omnibus Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (105-277) delayed the implementation of Section 110 on land and sea ports of entry until March 31, 2001, and included language stating that the entry/exit control system must ``not significantly disrupt trade, tourism, or other legitimate cross-border traffic at land border points of entry''. And in today's Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill, Section 110 is repealed outright. I salute your efforts on behalf of this very important measure which will benefit both of our states and the northern economy as a whole.
