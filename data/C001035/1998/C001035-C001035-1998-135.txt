President, tomorrow the Senate will be in a period for morning business from 10 a.m. until 12 noon. It is hoped that at 12 noon the Senate will be able to proceed to the consideration of Senate bill 414, the international shipping bill.  In addition, the Senate may consider any executive or legislative business cleared for Senate action. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes during tomorrow's session.  When the Senate reconvenes following the Easter holidays, the Senate will resume consideration of the Coverdell A+ Education Act. Also, as announced, the next rollcall votes will occur on that legislation on Tuesday, April 21, at a time to be announced by the majority leader.
