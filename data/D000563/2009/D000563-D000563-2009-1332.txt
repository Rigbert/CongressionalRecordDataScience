President, I ask unanimous consent that after the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has an opportunity to be recognized and speak, that Senator Corker be recognized at that point and that I then follow him with another unanimous consent recognition, and after that moment, Senator McCaskill be recognized to speak for 5 minutes, Senator Mikulski for 5 minutes, and Senator Burris for 5 minutes.  I wish to amend that UC request to include 10 minutes following Senator Burris for Senator Sessions and 10 minutes for Senator Grassley.
