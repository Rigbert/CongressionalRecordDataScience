 I commend Chairman D'Amato and Senators Dodd and Domenici for their work on this bill. They have done a fine job of crafting a strong bipartisan measure and then guiding it successfully through conference--and I have been pleased to work with them on this issue over the past 3 years.  Madam President, this is an important day for many of the small investors in Washington State and throughout the country. This bill takes the power out of the hands of a few lawyers and puts the power back in the hands of the investors. We all know that in many of these class action lawsuits, the investor often recovers as little as 10 percent of the damages caused by fraudulent activity while their lawyer takes millions.  Madam President, I recently heard from a constituent who received a settlement in a suit against a high technology firm in Washington State. This particular investor received a prorata share of the damages amounting to 3 cents per share, or just $30, while the lawyer in that suit walked away with the rest. The individual in this suit told me, ``my investment was hurt much more by my lawyer's actions, and his extortion of $1 million from the firm, than by any alleged actions on the part of the company's management.''  Madam President, this is neither what our investors want nor expect. It is outrageous and needs to be corrected.  The legislation before us will reform our securities law so that investors will have more of a say in the outcome of their suit. It will restore the plaintiff's role and enable them to exercise traditional plaintiff functions--including the selection of lead counsel, negotiating fees, and determining the distribution of settlements. Quite simply, it puts some common sense back into our legal system.  Madam President, I've seen the ads denouncing this legislation, and I've heard the arguments opposing this legislation. This bill has inspired some very intense, focused, and well-funded opposition.  The bill's opponents claim this legislation will harm small and elderly investors. Well, I believe that assertion is completely false. In no way does this bill take away one's ability to file suit. Nor does it undermine the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to sue for damages in securities fraud. In fact, the legislation enhances the SEC's ability to do so.  Madam President, Americans have a right to know their investments are secure--that our money has been invested in good faith. Today, investors are denied valuable information because companies are reluctant to disclose forecasts in fear of litigation. This serves nobody well; and it especially hurts investors that are trying to make sound, well-educated investments.  I am pleased to note that the SEC has endorsed the safe harbor provision in this bill. SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has written, ``the current version represents a workable balance that we can support since it should encourage companies to provide valuable forward-looking information to investors while, at the same time, it limits the opportunity for abuse.'' I agree with Chairman Levitt and I value his opinion. This safe harbor provision will be good for both investors and corporations.  Ultimately, if an investor has been the victim of fraud--no matter how big or how little--they have a right to equal treatment under the law. This legislation ensures that will happen, better than under today's laws.  And, Madam President, Congress has a unique role in promoting investor confidence. We must encourage investments; investments that are needed for capital formation, economic growth, and job creation.  This is especially true in Washington State--which is home to many high technology and biotech companies. And investors in Washington State like to invest in these companies.  Unfortunately, Washington State's investors are well aware of the damage that is caused by unwarranted court cases. They know these cases inhibit job creation and slow economic growth.  They know how companies are forced to waste resources and settle suits with capital that could have been used for the research and development of a new product.  I have heard from many of these companies in my home State. Companies such as these--new, growing, forward-looking--are a point of pride in the Pacific Northwest. They reflect the high technology, high wage economy of the future.  Nobody likes to see these companies attacked by a few overzealous lawyers. These companies lose millions of dollars each year fighting the allegations of fraud--while the actual investor receives just pennies on the dollar when a settlement is finally reached.  Madam President, this system needs reform, and Congress is obligated to correct the situation. And, I want to make it very clear--this bill retains an investor's right to bring suit if they are victims of securities fraud.  At the same time, it will clamp down on the abusive suits they prey on investors and small business owners. It is honest effort to reduce the excessive costs that burden our investors and our economy.  Madam President, let me conclude by recalling the first Senate vote on this bill. When I voted for this bill in June, I said I would not support a conference report if it contained some of the more onerous provisions in the House bill. Well, not only is this conference report almost identical to the Senate bill, it is even stronger in some respects. It is a good compromise and it restores some common sense to our legal system. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                              SAFE HARBOR
