 He was the former Speaker of the House, John O'Brien, and he passed away just this past weekend.  It is no exaggeration to say that John O'Brien had one of the longest and most accomplished careers of anyone who served in our Washington State Legislature. I was really lucky to have an opportunity to work with him when I was in the Washington State Senate and he was serving in the House. He was one of those people whom, whenever he walked into a room, everyone noticed. I always thought he was just so tall, but then I am only 5 feet tall, so to me he was tall. But it is amazing to me how many people say that his stature brought the respect of everyone who ever met him, and it certainly was true for me and for so many of us.  As Speaker of the House, he was known to be very tough but always fair. He was always firm, and he was always compassionate. I think I learned most from him that when you know the rules and use them for the betterment of all people, that is the kind of power which leaves you with a legacy everybody admires.  John leaves us many legacies. He leaves us a record of long and distinguished service in the State legislature. There is a building on our capitol grounds in Washington State that bears his name. He leaves behind laws that made our State a better place to work, to live, and to raise a family. Most importantly, he left a legacy of service that lives on in all of us who were lucky enough to serve with him and to be inspired by his leadership. It is the kind of legacy that any elected official would be proud of.  On this sad occasion, I extend my condolences to his family, to his many friends, and to all of us who served with him. We will not forget his legacy.  Madam President, I yield the floor.
