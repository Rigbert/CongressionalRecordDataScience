 President, I send to the desk a joint resolution. This joint resolution is being introduced with the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who is now in the chair, to address a very important issue. It is not an easy one to grasp on its face. This is largely because of an effort by some to misrepresent the facts of the case. In offering this resolution and asking my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing it, I would like to make some things very clear.  What this resolution expresses is the sense of the Congress for supporting existing procedures for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs made available to the public.  Specifically, it puts the Congress and the administration on record opposing the legalization of dangerous drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and LSD.  As we consider this language, we are likely to hear from many of the drug legalization lobbies. They are going to try to misrepresent their true goals and the meaning of this resolution. We have already seen some of these tactics in the House earlier this week. They are going to tell you that this resolution opposes sick people. They are going to tell you that they only want to make medicine available to the desperately ill. They imply, of course, that the rest of us are opposed to helping the sick. But the agenda here is not about helping sick people; it's about drug legalization.  Let's look at who's lobbying against our resolution. Since this is supposed to be about medicine, who's lobbying Congress? It is not the American Medical Association. It is not the American Psychiatric Association. It is not the American Cancer Society, the Glaucoma Society, the American Pediatrics Association, or any professional association of treatment specialists and scientists. It is the Drug Policy Foundation which opposes it, and the Marijuana Policy Project, the magazine High Times, and the marijuana legalization lobby, NORML--the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. All of these groups are drug legalization lobbies. And have been for years. None of these groups are medical associations or have any scientific expertise. What they rely on is anecdotes, scare tactics, and misinformation. Now, what is the agenda here? Is the goal medicine or legalization?  Their agenda and their goal is not medicine, but it is legalization of drugs.  Let me note who's supporting our resolution. It is the Nation's drug czar. It is Gen. Barry McCaffrey. It is national parent groups, like National Families in Action and Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. It is the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, or PRIDE. It is supported by virtually every anti-legalization group across the country in every state in the Union. They know the answer to my question.  But, let's consider another point. How do we normally make a dangerous drug with a high potential for abuse available as a legitimate medicine? Normally we do so with scientific validation. We do so by prescription. We control the quantities, the quality, and the distribution. We do not permit self-diagnosis and treatment. We do not license private citizens to manufacture the drugs in their kitchens or bathrooms. But what is happening with the efforts to make marijuana and other Schedule I drugs legal?  In most states where this effort is afoot, there is no prescription requirement. There is no scientific validation required. There are no controls and no supervision. People are authorized to grow marijuana, for example, at home. They are authorized to self administer it in any dose for any length of time for any ailment they think necessary. This does not mean for the terminally ill or those with desperate conditions. It means for any condition, from migraines to athlete's foot. Is this the way we treat Valium or anti-depressants? Is this the way we treat heart medicine or blood pressure medicine? Is this about medicine or about legalization? The answer is all too clear.  Our resolution addresses the effort by the drug legalization lobby in this country to get marijuana and other dangerous drugs on the streets, in our homes, and in our schools. These groups have been trying to do this for years. Sadly, they have been somewhat successful.  They have failed because the public won't have anything to do with legalization. The public overwhelmingly opposes efforts to legalize. Knowing this, the legalization lobby has hit upon a subterfuge to slip legalization through by calling it a medicine. It is a cynical and deceptive campaign.  What is being done here by these groups is to manipulate the public's concerns for the desperately ill. In efforts across the country, well-funded lobbying groups are promoting initiatives to declare marijuana and other dangerous drugs medicine. They are exploiting compassion to push their drug agenda. This effort is as fully sincere as anything we saw from the tobacco companies in their efforts to sell cigarettes.  What our resolution does is to put the Congress and the administration on record opposing this effort. We are taking this step to protect the present and future generations of young people from illegal drugs. The resolution passed the other body on Tuesday 310 to 93. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from General McCaffrey, the Nation's drug czar, to me. He endorses this resolution. The administration supports it.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of National            Drug Control Policy,                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1998.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC       Dear Senator Grassley: Thank you for the opportunity to      review your proposed Joint Resolution regarding the medicinal      use of marijuana. The Office of National Drug Control Policy      applauds your continuing contribution to the nation's drug      policy. We at ONDCP offer our support for this important      resolution and urge the Senate to send a clear signal to      those who advocate for legalization of marijuana when the      resolution comes to the Floor for a vote.       State ballot initiatives that define marijuana as a      ``medicine'' fail to address the negative impact such      legislation would have on the health of our youth or the      nation's scientific process of approving medications.      Designating medicine through ballot initiatives would      undermine the long-established process which ensures that      substances provided to the American public as medicines have      undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny. This procedure      protects Americans from unproven, ineffective, or dangerous      treatments. Making an exception for marijuana would create a      dangerous precedent. Medicine must be based on science rather      than ideology.       Proponents of marijuana initiatives present marijuana as a      benign substances. However, the latest scientific evidence      demonstrates that marijuana is not. Smoked marijuana damages      the brain, heart, lungs,     amd immune system. It impairs learning and interferes with      memory, preception and judgment. Smoked marijuana contains      cancer-causing components and has been implicated in a high      percentage of automobile crashes and workplace accidents.       As your resolution points out, marijuana is also associated      with behavior leading to more extensive drug use.      Legalization of marijuana as medicine sends a confusing      message to America's children at a time when drug use by      young people has increased at an alarming rate. The increase      in youth marijuana use has been fueled by a measurable      decrease in the proportion of young people who perceive      marijuana as dangerous.       Some Americans are unclear about what the scientific      research shows about the effects of marijuana. To clarify      this issue, ONDCP has commissioned a comprehensive study by      the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. It      is crucial that America tell the truth to our children about      the dangers of drug use. Toward that end, we congratulate you      and the other sponsors of this Joint Resolution.           Respectfully,                                               Barry R. McCaffrey,                                                         Director.
