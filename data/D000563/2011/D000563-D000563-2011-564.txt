My wife over the weekend, in Springfield, said: I would like you to clean the garage. I said: Well, I have decided to clean half the garage. It is a compromise. She said: With whom did you compromise? That is what we are faced with. Senators Corker and Tester have come to the floor and said: We have a compromise. With whom did you compromise?  It was not with the people who are affected by these debit card fees. No.
