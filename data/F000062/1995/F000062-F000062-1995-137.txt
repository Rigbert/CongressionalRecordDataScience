 President, this amendment strikes the language in the Dole bill which precludes a naturalized citizen from obtaining at any time any cash or noncash welfare benefit.  The language in this bill, as presently drafted, is the first time in the history of the United States that naturalized citizens would be treated differently than native-born citizens.  The Constitution of the United States says that there is only one instance where there is a difference between the two; that is, one who seeks the Presidency of the United States.  My mother became a naturalized citizen. My mother had very little formal education. She had difficulty reading and writing. She had to take the test three times before she became a citizen. I have to say the day she was naturalized she was prouder than any time in her life that I can remember. It meant a great deal because she was as good as any American citizen in her eyes. That is a very big thing.  The amendment I am proposing is supported by the Department of Justice. I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senator Kennedy from Justice, pointing out serious concerns about section 204's constitutionality as applied to naturalized citizens, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
