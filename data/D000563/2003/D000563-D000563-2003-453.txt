 My question is, Why do we need to consider a bill of this magnitude without taking it through the ordinary committee process? The Senator from Nevada said yesterday, we just know we would never get it out of committee. I am a little bit surprised at that because, if I am not mistaken, it is the party of the Senator from Nevada that is the majority in every committee that would consider this bill. If they are truly looking for a bill that is fair and one that compromises where necessary and negotiates a good-faith outcome, then it would come out of committee. And certainly with the direction of the majority leader, Senator Frist, who has spoken in favor of it, there would be an urgency to it.  That is not the way this bill is being considered. This bill is coming to the floor without committee hearing. They haven't had a chance to hear the witnesses, not the four malpractice victims and their families we met yesterday, not the doctors on both sides of the issue, not the practicing attorneys, not representatives of the insurance companies, none of them, no hearings from them, no statements from them, no suggestions from them. I don't know where this bill came from.  I can tell you the people who want it: Not only the American Medical Association but clearly those who represent HMOs and managed care companies that are insulated from liability under this bill, those who represent prescription drug companies that are insulated from liability under the bill, as well as medical device manufacturers. They put this bill together.
