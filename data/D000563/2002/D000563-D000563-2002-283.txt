REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, upon disposition of the Durbin amendment, Senator Gregg be recognized to offer an amendment which will strike the wage insurance portion of the underlying substitute amendment; that the amendment be debated tonight; on tomorrow, when the Senate resumes consideration of the bill at 10 a.m., there be 90 minutes remaining for debate in relation to the Gregg amendment, with the time on Thursday equally divided and controlled in the usual form, with no second-degree amendment in order, nor to any language which may be stricken.
