 President, I do object to moving to this bill at this time, although I understand the underlying bill has much in it that is important. I do not want to keep us from moving toward that. Section 2 of this bill is extremely important, critical. It has been under the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee for the last several years that I know of that I have been here. It has not been debated in that committee and I believe it should go back to that committee to be looked at.  It is an extremely important section that allows the lifting of the ban on oil for Alaska exports. It has tremendous impact to the west coast, and particularly to my State of Washington, as well as Oregon and California, and is a measure that should see much more light of day, particularly in the Banking Committee, before it is debated on this floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
