President, I seek to clarify a part of the Leahy-Breaux amendment (No. 1421) on intraLATA toll dialing parity that was adopted yesterday. As the amendment states, the joint marketing provision in subparagraph (iii) of the amendment applies only in those States that have implemented intraLATA toll dialing parity during the relevant period and to telecommunications carriers in those States offering intraLATA services using ``1+'' dialing parity. The prohibition on joint marketing however, was not intended to apply to telecommunications carriers offering intraLATA services that do not make use of ``1+'' dialing parity. That is my understanding of the Breaux-Leahy amendment. Is this consistent with your understanding?
