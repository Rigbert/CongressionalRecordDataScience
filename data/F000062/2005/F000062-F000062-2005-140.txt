 President, I rise to pay tribute to the Hispanic community. As we commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, I want to recognize the contributions made by millions of Hispanics to our Nation. The greatness of California is that it is truly a multicultural State and I am honored to represent California's Hispanic community in the U.S. Senate.  This month we celebrate a community that believes in the American goals of freedom, opportunity, and a chance to build a better life. In pursuing these aspirations, Hispanics have made enormous contributions to life in the United States through business, politics, science, culture, sports, and entertainment. Hispanics have served in the armed services with bravery and courage and many have made the ultimate sacrifice in giving their lives for the common good of our country. Through their service, they have brought honor to America and their Hispanic heritage--a rich heritage from which all of America benefits.  Today, I rise to honor the sacrifices that these brave Americans and their families have made. I also want to honor Hispanic heroes and heroines, such as the late Cesar Chavez. Indeed, Hispanics are changing the way America looks at itself. Today there are 31 million Hispanics in the U.S. By 2050, our Nation's Hispanic population is projected to reach 96 million--an increase of more than 200 percent.  Hispanics are making their mark; between 1984 and 1998 Hispanic voting increased nationwide in midterm elections by 27 percent, even as overall voter turnout declined by 13 percent. In my own State of California, where nearly 11.5 million Hispanics comprise over 32 percent of the population, Hispanics are participating and contributing to civic life in important ways. Two of the California State legislature's three highest offices are occupied by Hispanics: Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Speaker of the Assembly Fabian Nunez. On the local level, the people of Los Angeles elected Antonio Villaraigosa as the first Hispanic mayor in over a century, and 20 percent of Los Angeles' city council seats are held by Hispanics. The Hispanic community has provided great leadership for California, and will provide important leadership for our country.  Hispanics are visibly successful in other areas as well. From Sammy Sosa in sports to Jennifer Lopez, Andy Garcia, and Salma Hayek in the entertainment industry, Hispanics have added greatly to the fabric of our Nation.  We must not forget the critical contributions Hispanics have made to education and science. The 1995 Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry, Dr. Mario Molina, joined the University of California, San Diego last year, and Dr. Eduardo Macagno is the founding dean of the Division of Biological Sciences at the same University.  A democratic and prosperous society should not step back from a national commitment to provide assistance to those who strive to achieve the American dream, despite the odds. In particular, I want to emphasize the importance of quality education for the success of Hispanic children. The University of California system alone enrolled nearly 25,000 Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students last year. Hispanic youths are a great source of strength and hope for the future of this Nation and they should be able to participate fully in the American experience; that is the primary reason why I have been a strong supporter of the DREAM Act.  Mr. President, I am proud to honor California's Hispanic community and to have the opportunity to ensure that Hispanic contributions and sacrifices do not go unnoticed.                          ____________________[Page S10372]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH
