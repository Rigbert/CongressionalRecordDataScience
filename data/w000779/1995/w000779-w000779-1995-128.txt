Speaker, the debate in this House concerning Tax Code reforms traditionally has been focused on two primary issues: Is the current tax law fair, and does the code encourage economic growth and new jobs?  Today, I want to suggest that we address one other question: does the code encourage sustained management of an increasingly threatened national treasure--our 350 million acres of privately owned, commercial forest land.  Global warming, the deforestation of tropical timberlands, and our own efforts to preserve our dwindling supply of native, old growth timberlands have all lead us to reevaluate our planet's crucial need for trees.  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have for years advocated the position that our Tax Code contains severe disincentives for private forestry. With many of my colleagues from the Congressional Forestry 2000 Task Force, I have worked for reasonable changes in the law to overturn unfair obstacles to small woodlot owners who wish to keep their lands in long-term, sustained-yield, timber production.  Today, I and 16 of my colleagues reintroduce legislation which takes dead aim at one of the most egregious of the code's disincentives to private forestry, IRS passive loss rules. Our bill, the Forest Stewardship Act of 1995, puts our tax policy on the side of jobs, wildlife conservation and proper timber management--where the code always should have been.  This bill will restore to tens of thousands of small woodlot owners the right to deduct reasonable business expenses in managing their nonindustrial private timberlands. Incredibly, the Internal Revenue Service in the mid-1980s stripped these woodlot owners of this favorable tax treatment even though it would cost States like Oregon, which has more than 42,000 tree farmers, an untold number of timber industry jobs and undercut proper forest management.  I believe the IRS' position is entirely inconsistent with the intent and will of Congress in enacting the 1986 tax reforms. At the heart of the problem is the agency's stringent rule on material participation, the test that separates passive investors from active managers. Under the IRS' interpretation, which is based on an inflexible hours-per-year activity standard, many tree growers have been unfairly barred from deducting costs of doing business. That means they can't even use professional foresters to help manage their lands without endangering their active status under the law. The resulting mismanagement can mean less timber, inadequate conservation measures, and, ultimately, loss of the lands from the timber base.  This bill redefines the code to allow these farmers to deduct normal business expenses.  I'm proud to be joined in this effort by a bipartisan coalition of cospnsors--Representatives Herger, Callahan, Deal, Cramer, Cooley, Emerson, DeFazio, Stupak, Klug, Wilson, Oberstar, Spratt, Hayes, Furse, Chapman, and Richard Baker--who have worked very hard with me in crafting this legislation.  I would also point out that besides having the broad support of major timber associations representing both tree growers and the wood products manufacturing industry, this legislation has been advocated by environmental organizations including the Sierra Club, One Thousand Friends of Oregon, the Audubon Society, and others.  Mr. Speaker, it is not often that both the timber products industry and the environmental community agree on congressional legislation effecting forests management. The reason both of these often warring factions back this bill is quite simple: they understand that this narrow Tax Code change will: First, encourage better forest management by allowing tree growers to deduct the cost of professional forestry consultants; and two, discourage tree farmers from converting their increasingly valuable lands to non-forest uses.  As a consequence, wildlife habitat, watersheds, recreational values, and timber resources will be preserved.  In Oregon, we have something in excess of 3.3 million acres in small woodlot management. Our State forecasts on future timber needs already have identified these acres as an increasingly important source of trees for our mills. Already, these woodlands account for more than 10 percent of our tree harvest--public and private--in Oregon.  My colleagues, these forestlands account for real dollars, and real jobs. Discouraging their best-use management will have real, long-term, adverse impacts on employment and, consequently, IRS tax collections. No less a conservationist organization than our own One Thousand Friends of Oregon has sued the IRS, asking that the agency reconsider its regulations in this area.  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the vital legislation.                          ____________________
