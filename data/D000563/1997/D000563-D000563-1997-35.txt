 Consider this possibility. On Monday of next week you go out to buy a Pontiac. On Tuesday when you go to the doctor, he says, ``You are going to have to go to the hospital, and you are going to need a pacemaker.'' In 1 week you have a Pontiac and a pacemaker. What is the difference? When you bought the Pontiac, General Motors took note of your name and address. If anything went wrong with the Pontiac, they would contact you in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or even later, and say, ``Bring it in. It needs to be fixed.'' It might not be safe, if you didn't. However, under this bill the pacemaker that you are going to have implanted by the surgeon perhaps a few days later doesn't have the same kind of following. Why? Because we let that exist.  Why would we let people have lifesaving devices implanted in their bodies and not keep track of that fact? That is what this amendment is all about, because this bill, as good as it is, takes away the mandatory requirement that we have surveillance and tracking of these high-risk devices that can be implanted in people.  I am glad to be joined by Senators Harkin and Senator Johnson in offering this amendment which strikes the sections of the bill that undermine many of the patient protections for medical devices put in place by the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990.  This act of 1990 instituted a mandatory surveillance program to identify quickly any potential problems with approved high-risk devices. A mandatory tracking system to locate patients in the event a safety recall was also added.  Sections 605 and 606 in this act are nothing more than a backdoor attempt to eliminate these programs that industry considers burdensome. Yes, they are burdensome. To keep track of the name and address of each person who is given a pacemaker is a big burden on industry. But what kind of burden is it on the patient when the pacemaker fails and the patient can't be found? I would suggest that it is a much greater burden. That is what this amendment addresses.  Proponents of sections 605 and 606 say that the FDA has not been vigilant with respect to overseeing these vital programs. Does anyone imagine they are going to be more vigilant in enforcing these safety protections when they are relegated to an optional or discretionary status? Especially given CBO's high estimate of this bill's additional costs to the FDA without any corresponding increase in funding. Pressure can only increase on the agency to curtail its efforts in discretionary programs.  Opponents of this amendment will point to the fact that the administration went along with this change. This point is in fact even more worrisome when you look at what types of devices we are talking about, and the tragedies that may occur.  Many of us remember the tragedies that resulted from the Bjork-Shiley heart valve failures. Extensive congressional hearings were held in the late 1980's examining what had gone wrong and how we might prevent future repeats of these terrible tragedies.  Over 300 people died in the United States from these heart valve failures, and over 1,000 worldwide.  After it was concluded that these heart valves were defective--after they realized the product had failed--over 50 percent of the patients with these heart valves couldn't be located.  One widow testified--and this is a tragic story--about how her husband, who had a Bjork-Shiley heart valve implant, suffered chest pains but had no idea that the heart valve was the cause of the problem. She was in a position to choose from two hospitals. She quickly raced to one hospital, and made the wrong choice. She went to the hospital that didn't specialize in heart surgery when her husband needed to live. She didn't know. Why didn't she know? She wasn't on the list. Her husband's name and address were not on the list to be notified that the heart valve he carried in his body was failing him.  What does tracking actually involve? It involves a patient--this is I don't think a burden from that perspective--filling out a registration form with their address so they can be located if there is a recall of a pacemaker, or high-risk device. Most companies make this request already.  What kind of devices are we talking about? Just about anything? No. There are 17 specific types of devices that require mandatory tracking. We are talking about heart valves; pacemakers and pacemaker leads; vascular stents; jaw, shoulder, and hip joint replacements; windpipe prosthesis; breathing monitors and ventilators.  It is hard to imagine the tracking of these high-risk devices could ever been made optional, and yet that is exactly what this bill does.  FDA has already complained that they find it extremely difficult to enforce this provision, and yet, instead of making it stronger and helping them with enforcement, this bill weakens it. It weakens the FDA's ability to make this kind of adequate tracking and surveillance available.  Automobile manufacturers are required to have a tracking system to notify those who buy cars. It even happens with motorcycles. Look at this. What a coincidence. In the Phoenix Gazette of Friday, January 11, 1991, there are two articles next to one another. Harley-Davison recalls its motorcycles. We have a problem here. It turns out that their brake calipers are defective and could cause their front wheels to lock while driving.  Right next to it, on Consumer Watch, jaw implants. It is found that the implants of Vitek of Houston caused bone degeneration. If we cannot track the people who bought the jaw implants through their surgeon, we can certainly find the owners of the Harley-Davidsons. Does that make sense?  I would like to submit for the Record a letter that I received from Victims Against Lethal Valves, a support group out of Pittsburgh for those who have suffered from defective heart valves. They urge the Senate to adopt my amendment. If you read this letter from the families of those who were caught unaware that they had a defective heart valve, you might think twice. I hope my colleagues will.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Victims Against Lethal Valves,                               Pittsburgh, PA, September 16, 1997.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As a Bjork-Shiley heart valve survivor and      founder of VALV, a support group for people with the Bjork-     Shiley heart valve, I strongly urge you to support Senator      Durbin's amendment to S. 830 to maintain mandatory tracking      and postmarket surveillance of high risk medical devices like      heart valves.       The Bjork-Shiley heart valve experience was a major impetus      to enacting these two provisions in 1990. Almost 1,000 people      (world-wide, the device was marketed longer in Europe than in      the U.S.) have died as a result of the fracture of the Bjork-     Shiley valve. S. 830 makes tracking and postmarket      surveillance of these very high risk devices discretionary      rather than mandatory.       The Bjork-Shiley disaster highlighted the need to implement      a systematic method for tracking the device recipients. When      the FDA finally ``caught up'' with the significant numbers of      Bjork-Shiley heart valve fractures and ordered the company to      notify recipients of the valve's potential failure, what      symptoms to look for, and what to do if these symptoms      appeared, the manufacturer claimed that they had no record of      how to find as many as half of the recipients. Should a      defect in a device be identified, it is critical that device      recipients be notified so they can seek medical attention.       The manufacturer knew that the Bjork-Shiley heart valve had      a tendency to fracture very soon after it went on the market.      But the firm conducted no systematic surveillance, and did      not accurately report the information about problems it      received to the FDA. Section 522 was designed to remedy this      gap in reliable, verifiable information--so that the      manufacturer would know, and the FDA could check--on problems      with new post-1991 devices.       Most Market surveillance and tracking are consumer      safeguards that were won with the lives of people like me and      the members of     VALV. We urge you to adopt Senator Durbin's amendment and      keep these consumer protections in place.           Sincerely,                                                  Elaine Levenson,                                                          Founder.
