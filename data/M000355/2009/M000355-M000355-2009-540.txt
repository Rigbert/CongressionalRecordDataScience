 President, let me just say I think the amendment process has been well handled. We had a lot of amendments to offer today, and they are in the process of being voted on. We have a lot more amendments to offer tomorrow, and then I think we can discuss sometime during the day tomorrow exactly what the endgame might be on this legislation.  I am pleased and my Members are pleased, I would say to the majority leader, with the way it has been handled to this point, and sometime tomorrow we will discuss how we might move toward a conclusion.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 277
