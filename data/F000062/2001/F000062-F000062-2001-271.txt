 President, I thank the distinguished Senator and Chairman of the Committee for his comments. He asked, what do the two utilities at issue think of this? I will respond and I will give the comment of Robert Glynn--the Chairman, President, and CEO of Pacific Gas and Electric. This is his company's position:       PG is at a critical point in sensitive negotiations to      resolve an energy crisis that is affecting the Western United      States. Our creditors have been willing to forbear in the      interest of achieving a comprehensive solution that is fair      to all parties. This amendment would change the relationship      among creditors and could destabilize the fragile cooperation      that currently exists. It would be a terrible irony if      actions of the United States Government were responsible for      tipping this situation over the edge.  That is the response of one of the major investor-owned utilities in the State of California.  I have input from the other, Southern California Edison, and I will read from a letter by John Bryson, CEO of Southern California Edison:       Unfortunately, the Wyden amendment undermines the solution      being crafted within the State. The Wyden amendment would      require that, in the event of bankruptcy, the power      generators who have made significant profits from this crisis      receive full payment before small businesses, banks and bond      holders. This is not fair to the other creditors.       Furthermore, this amendment could trigger the bankruptcies      that everyone is trying to avoid. Other creditors will not      stand by and just watch as the amendment takes away their      rights.  This is the reason I so strongly oppose this amendment. I don't believe the Senators who support this Wyden amendment have an understanding of what might happen. There is $13 billion of debt out there. It involves banks all over the United States. It involves high-tech companies, it involves cities, it involves generators, it involves natural gas companies, it involves a wide range of debtors and creditors.  Right now, the State of California has made considerable progress toward resolving this crisis. More than anything, the State needs some time to conclude those negotiations. If the State is able to conclude negotiations, this means that the debt could be paid to the utilities, and would help exactly the creditors that Senators Wyden and Smith want to help.  At this point, the State doesn't need the Federal Government to step in and destroy the progress they have made. I have checked with bankruptcy attorneys, and I believe I am right. This amendment is unprecedented. Never before without a hearing has the Senate of the United States decided the pecking order of creditors and debtors for a potential bankruptcy of this size. This amendment rewrites the bankruptcy rules in favor of one set of creditors. It creates an enormous incentive, as the Chairman has just said, for other creditors to now push the utilities into bankruptcy before this amendment would be signed into law. It is like a run on the bank. So without a hearing, this amendment seeks to determine winners and losers.  There is not a single debtor or creditor that I know that supports this amendment. Virtually all of them have opposed to this amendment. Even some of the people helped by the amendment are opposed. That includes the California Municipal Utilities Association, the City of Los Angeles, Duke, Enron, Calpine, and Williams who all oppose this amendment.  Let me quote from some of the letters I have received. I begin with the Governor of the State of California.       A critical component of the plan to resolve California's      energy challenge is the return of our utilities to financial      solvency. Our efforts have taken the form of painstaking      negotiations between the State and the utilities to stabilize      their financial condition. Any attempt to create a special      class of debtor under Federal bankruptcy laws, may have      serious repercussions to our efforts. Therefore, I am writing      to express my strong opposition to Senator Ron Wyden's      amendment to S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001. Any      actions on the part of the United States Senate might very      well undermine all the progress we have made to this point in      our negotiations with the utilities. This is a very delicate      process and we urge the Senate to allow all parties in      California to continue their work together to solve this      crisis.  Now from the Electric Power Supply Association, which is the electric generating companies together:       This amendment seeks to give certain entities a favorable      status in the event that California utilities fall into      bankruptcy. Many companies have provided power to      California's consumers and EPSA, the Electrical Power Supply      Association, believes emphatically that all these entities      deserve to be fully and fairly compensated. However, it is      inappropriate for the Senate to try and create winners and      losers in this desperate situation. Rather than orderly      resolution, this legislation could lead to a premature      declaration of bankruptcy and the inevitable liquidation of      the California electric utilities assets in a legal free-for-     all. We urge you to oppose the Wyden amendment.  Let me read from a letter submitted by a big electric generator, Williams--a generator that has profited mightily from this situation:       Williams is strongly opposed to any such proposal. In our      judgment, intervention by the Congress in the California      market in a way that picks winners and losers among similarly      situated parties will only precipitate a deepening of the      crisis. It will cripple ongoing efforts within the State to      resolve the crisis and trigger an outpouring of litigation      and legal maneuvering that would prolong the crisis, not      resolve it. Restoring financial solvency to the local      utilities is a critical element of any long-term solution to      the electricity problem in California. If those utilities are      forced into bankruptcy, the immediate result would be to      plunge everyone involved in the crisis into protracted,      uncertain, court proceedings. In our judgment, this proposed      legislation will only serve to precipitate that bankruptcy. I      fear the mere possibility that such an amendment might become      law will leave those involved little choice but to trigger      bankruptcy proceedings in order to protect their own      interests.  Let me give you another generator's view, Calpine:       Under Senator Wyden's amendment, many out-of-state power      producers, both public and private entities, would be made      whole under any eventual utility bankruptcy, while QF's,      forced to sell by virtue of contracts rather than a federal      emergency order, would likely be left with little or no      recourse. Some of the cleanest, most environmentally      desirable sources of energy would be severely disadvantaged      by this action.       While on fairness grounds alone, we believe the Wyden      amendment should be defeated, perhaps more importantly, we      think the amendment would only worsen the California energy      crisis. Creditors have shown remarkable patience to date,      giving California state officials an opportunity to seek a      solution that avoids utility bankruptcy. This amendment,      however, could trigger an immediate bankruptcy filing in      order for the filing to precede enactment of the legislation.  So you see, just by passing this, what we do is, to all the community out there that is owed money, we trigger their urge to move the companies into bankruptcy. That would be a huge mistake.  This letter is signed by the vice president of the company.  Mr. President, I would like to read from a statement by the Edison Electric Institute which, as I understand it, represents most electric utilities with the exception of Pacific Gas and Electric:       I am writing to express our concerns regarding a proposed      amendment to S. 420, the ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001'',      that may be offered by Senator Wyden for himself and Senators      Baucus and Murray. While there appear to have been several      iterations of that amendment, the thrust appears to favor      public power electricity suppliers in a utility bankruptcy      proceeding by providing that debts to them for electricity      are not dischargeable. The amendment also applies to debts      for wholesale electric power received pursuant to the      emergency order issued by     the Secretary of Energy under section 202(c) of the Federal      Power Act. This amendment raises large public policy concerns      by affecting all utilities as well as those involved in      bankruptcy proceedings.       First, it primarily advantages government-owned utilities      who already are uniquely able to sell power at rates which      are not subject to regulation by FERC. It makes no sense to      give a bankruptcy preference to the only generators whose      rates are unregu-     lated. . . .       This amendment would undermine efforts underway to address      the current electricity situation in California. All parties,      including the Governor, the utilities and creditors, are      trying to work out an agreement. Passage (as well as concern      about the possible passage) of this amendment could disrupt      these efforts and lead to immediate initiation of bankruptcy      proceedings.  Mr. President, this is not me saying this. These are the major creditors and debtors in this situation, all of whom are saying that once you give preference to one, the others will trigger bankruptcy to protect their rights. And, in protecting their rights, it will push these utilities into bankruptcy because that is the only way they can do it.  If you push these utilities into bankruptcy, I believe it is likely they will go into chapter 7--not 11 or 13, but 7, and, therefore, they will go out of business altogether. So it is a very dangerous thing to do.  The surprising thing is we have this amendment on the floor, in view of the fact that virtually all of the major creditors and debtors oppose it because they know exactly what is going to happen.  We also have unions. I would like to have printed in the Record the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers' letter. They represent over 800,000 electrical workers, who also believe the effect this would have would be to trigger a bankruptcy.  I ask unanimous consent these letters in their entirety be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                          Calpine,                              1200 18th Street, NW, Suite 850,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to urge your      opposition to an amendment that will be offered by Senator      Wyden to the bankruptcy legislation currently being      considered by the full Senate. It is my understanding that      Senator Wyden intends to offer an amendment that would ensure      that public power producers and others who sold power to      California under the Federal emergency order are made whole      in any bankruptcy proceeding, thus allowing these select      creditors to be treated preferentially.       As you may know, most of Calpine's power plants in      California are ``qualifying facilities,'' commonly referred      to as QFs. QFs are cogeneration and renewable energy      facilities, all located in the state of California, which      provide power to the California utilities under contracts.      Despite the contractual obligations of the utilities, the QFs      have not been paid for several months and today over $1      billion is owed collectively to these in-state companies.       Under Senator Wyden's amendment, many out-of-state power      producers, both public and private entities, would be made      whole under any eventual utility bankruptcy, while QFs,      forced to sell by virtue of contracts rather than a Federal      emergency order, would likely be left with little or no      recourse. Some of the cleanest, most environmentally      desirable sources of energy would be severely disadvantaged      by this action.       While on fairness grounds alone, we believe the Wyden      amendment should be defeated, perhaps more importantly, we      think the amendment would only worsen the California energy      crisis. Creditors have shown remarkable patience to date,      giving California state officials an opportunity to seek a      solution that avoids utility bankruptcy. This amendment,      however, could trigger an immediate bankruptcy filing in      order for the filing to precede enactment of the legislation.       I urge you to do everything possible to help your      colleagues understand the very negative consequences of this      amendment for clean, renewable sources of energy. Thank you      for your assistance and please let me know if I can provide      you with any additional information.           Sincerely,                                                  Jeanne Connelly,     Vice President--Federal Relations.                                  ____                                    Edison Electric Institute,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to express our      concerns regarding a proposed amendment to S. 420, the      ``Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001'', that may be offered by      Senator Wyden for himself and Senators Baucus and Murray.      While there appear to have been several iterations of that      amendment, the thrust appears to favor public power      electricity suppliers in a utility bankruptcy proceeding by      providing that debts to them for electricity are not      dischargeable. The amendment also applies to debts for      wholesale electric power received pursuant to the emergency      order issued by the Secretary of Energy under section 202(c)      of the Federal Power Act. This amendment raises large public      policy concerns by affecting all utilities as well as those      involved in bankruptcy proceedings.       First, it primarily advantages government-owned utilities      who already are uniquely able to sell power at rates which      are not subject to regulation by FERC. It makes no sense to      give a bankruptcy preference to the only generators whose      rates are unregulated.       Second, the amendment appears to have little benefit for      generators which are not publicly-owned, even though their      rates are fully subject to FERC regulation. Many of these      suppliers sold into the California market voluntarily without      being compelled to by the DOE order and most of their sales      took place both before and after the DOE order was in effect.      Thus, most of their sales would not be covered.       Third, the amendment would have long term impacts      increasing all utilities' cost of capital by downgrading the      protections afforded to lending institutions and investors.      Such institutions lent money to California utilities to allow      them to continue to provide service to consumers in      California despite the retail rate freeze. Legislating      reductions in a lender's and an investor's bankruptcy      protections may lead investors to increase the cost of      capital to all utilities to compensate for the added risk.      This would result in higher costs to all consumers. Since      significant amounts of new capital are needed to fund      necessary expansions of generation and transmission      facilities, this would have a negative impact on the entire      economy.       Fourth, this amendment would undermine efforts underway to      address the current electricity situation in California. All      parties, including the Governor, the utilities and creditors,      are trying to work out an agreement. Passage (as well as      concern about the possible passage) of this amendment could      disrupt these efforts and lead to immediate initiation of      bankruptcy proceedings.       Finally, this amendment would do nothing to solve the      underlying problem that retail rates in California are frozen      at a level far below the cost of wholesale power purchases.      It does nothing to provide for new supplies of electricity,      does nothing to clarify existing provisions of the bankruptcy      code which may limit the authority of a bankruptcy judge to      increase rates and in effect merely ``reshuffles the deck      chairs'' in the California electricity crisis.       We urge you to vote against the amendment.           Sincerely,     Thomas R. Kuhn.                                  ____                                           The Williams Companies,                                          One Williams Center,                                  Tulsa, Oklahoma, March 12, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, 331 Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I understand that Sen. Wyden may      offer an amendment to the bankruptcy legislation before the      Senate that would adversely affect the California electricity      situation. I understand this amendment would give      preferential standing in any bankruptcy proceeding to private      or public providers of electricity who were required to sell      power pursuant to the Department of Energy orders. That is an      illogical outcome when private providers within the state may      have provided electricity outside of the DOE order and other      creditors may be equally deserving of payment.       Williams is strongly opposed to any such proposal. In our      judgement, intervention by Congress in the California market      in a way that picks winners and losers among similarly      situated parties will only precipitate a deepening of the      crisis. It will cripple ongoing efforts within the State to      resolve the crisis, and trigger an outpouring of litigation      and legal maneuvering that would prolong the crisis, not      resolve it.       Williams is a national energy company who has been an      active participant in the California market. Williams      dispatches as much as 4,000 megawatts of power in the Los      Angeles region, although the amount available on any given      day may be less, depending on a variety of factors. This      represents about 40 percent of the independent generating      capacity in the Los Angeles area and about 9 percent of the      available in-state generation that is available to the      independent system operator.       Restoring financial solvency to the local utilities is a      critical element of any long-term solution to the electricity      problem in California. If those utilities are forced into      bankruptcy the immediate result would be to plunge everyone      involved in the crisis into protracted, uncertain court      proceedings. In our judgement, this proposed legislation will      only serve to precipitate that bankruptcy. I fear the more      possibility that such an amendment might become law will      leave those involved little choice but to trigger bankruptcy      proceedings in order to protect their own interests.       In our view, a far more constructive course is for those      involved to work in good faith to find a comprehensive      solution to the problem. Congressional encouragement of that     approach would be welcome, but partial solutions, especially      those that would increase the probability of litigation,      should be rejected.       At the end of the day, if recovery efforts do fail and      there is the unfortunate outcome of a bankruptcy of one or      more of the California utilities, then leaving the existing      provisions of law in place will produce the fairest outcome.      Adoption of this amendment would create subsets of rights      among similarly situated parties with unpredictable and quite      possibly inequitable results.           Sincerely,     Keith E. Bailey.                                  ____                                                             TURN,                                   The Utility Reform Network,                                San Francisco, CA, March 12, 2001.     Re: Wyden-Baucus Amendments to S. 240--TURN Opposition     Senator Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter is written to express      TURN's opposition to the Wyden-Baucus Amendment to S. 420.      The amendment would give preferential treatment to wholesale      power generators, who sold electricity into California's      severely dysfunctional market. By making debt incurred by      utilities for wholesale purchase of electricity non-     dischargeable in the event of utility bankruptcy, the      legislation would unfairly favor generators at the expense of      ratepayers. During the worst part of the energy crisis,      wholesale generators, both public and private, realized      windfall profits in California. There is no justification to      protect 100 percent of these profits at the expense of      ratepayers and other creditors. Even power that was      dispatched subject to a federal order was sold at prices way      in excess of the just and reasonable rates that are required      by federal law. Why should Federal legislators protect      windfall profits at the expense of other creditors who were      loaning money to the utilities to purchase power during the      same emergency?       We are afraid that this kind of legislation will harmfully      impact whatever negotiations are happening at the state level      to strike a balance that would cause all players to make some      sort of sacrifice so that we can all move forward. Let the      bankruptcy laws remain status quo ante in order to allow the      settlement of all claims going forward. The Senate should not      modify laws that were in place during this period in order to      choose winners or losers in California's energy debacle.      Either there will be a settlement at the state level or the      utilities will be forced to bankruptcy. If bankruptcy is the      eventual solution, let the federal bankruptcy judge, applying      the laws that were in place during the crisis, resolve the      equities. Senate intervention at this point influences the      negotiating dynamics unfairly. Such intervention could      actually hasten bankruptcy if other creditors perceive an      advantage to forcing early involuntary bankruptcy. This could      happen if bankers or commercial paper holders believe they      have more opportunity to recover their losses by filing      before the effective date of any legislation that could      compromise their claims.           Sincerely,                                                      Nettie Hoge,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                         Edison International,                                                   March 12, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to you to express      Edison International's opposition to an amendment from Oregon      Senator Ron Wyden to the Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 420.       As you know, California and the western states have been      hard hit by an electricity shortage and dramatic price spikes      for the last eight months. Edison has incurred an      undercollection of nearly $5.5 billion procuring wholesale      power at prices that greatly exceed retail rates in      California. In mid-January, after we ran out of credit and      stopped payment on most of our outstanding debt, the state      stepped in to pick up the funding shortfall for daily power      purchases. The state has spent an additional $3 billion in      electricity purchases so far.       At this moment, California Governor Gray Davis is trying to      craft a solution that will get the system working again.      Those who hold utility debt, including banks, pension funds,      municipalities, retirees and other bondholders, small      businesses and electricity generators, have been patient,      working with us to avert utility bankruptcy while the state      works to resolve these very difficult issues.       Unfortunately, the Wyden amendment undermines the solution      being crafted within the state. The Wyden amendment would      require that, in the event of bankruptcy, the power      generators who have made significant profits from this crisis      receive full payment before small businesses, banks and      bondholders. This is not fair to the other creditors.       Furthermore, this amendment could trigger the bankruptcies      that everyone is trying to avoid. Other creditors will not      stand by and just watch as the amendment takes away their      rights.       It is Edison's sincerest hope that a comprehensive solution      will be crafted that will allow us to make our creditors      whole. The state is currently in the midst of delicate      negotiations with generators and utilities. The Wyden      amendment should not be allowed to disrupt this process, and      we thank you for your efforts to oppose it.           Sincerely,                                                   John E. Bryson,     Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                                             PG Corporation,                                 San Francisco, CA, March 8, 2001.     Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, 331 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter addresses the proposed      Wyden amendment which would modify the relationship among      creditors in some bankruptcies. We are in opposition to this      amendment.       PG is at a critical point in sensitive negotiations to      resolve an energy crisis that is affecting the Western United      States. Our creditors have been willing to forbear in the      interest of achieving a comprehensive solution that is fair      to all parties. This amendment would change the relationship      among creditors and could destabilize the fragile cooperation      that currently exists.       It would be a terrible irony if actions of the United      States Government were responsible for tipping this situation      over the edge.           Sincerely,                                                  Robert D. Glynn,     Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.                                  ____                            Electric Power Supply Association,                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senate          Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The Electric Power Supply      Association (EPSA) is the national trade group representing      competitive power suppliers, both developers of power      projects and marketers of electric energy. Our members are      active nationally and include many of the companies that      produce and market power for the California wholesale market.      Few have a greater stake in the orderly and effective      resolution of California's electricity crisis than these      companies.       We are writing to express our deep concern and opposition      to an amendment that may be offered by Senator Ron Wyden to      the bankruptcy legislation now before the Senate. Our fear is      that this amendment could precipitate a financial crisis and      exacerbate the already precarious situation in the West.       This amendment seeks to give certain entities a favorable      status in the event that California utilities fall into      bankruptcy. Many companies have provided power to      California's consumers and EPSA believes emphatically that      all these entities deserve to be fully and fairly      compensated. However, it is inappropriate for the Senate to      try and create winners and losers in this desperate      situation. Rather than orderly resolution, this legislation      could lead to a premature declaration of bankruptcy and the      inevitable liquidation of the California electric utilities'      assets in a legal free-for-all.       We urge you to oppose the Wyden amendment. EPSA is prepared      to assist you in structuring a more effective remedy to the      energy and financial crisis in western wholesale electric      power markets.           Sincerely,                                                  Lynne H. Church,     President.                                  ____                                                 Governors Office,                                                State Capitol,                                   Sacramento, CA, March 13, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Diane: I want to express my sincere appreciation for      your efforts on behalf of California as we work to solve the      electricity challenge we inherited.       We have taken immediate steps to build new power plants.      Not one major power plant was built during the 12 years      before I was elected. Starting in April, 1999, we have      approved 9 plants, with 6 plants under construction, and with      3 plants on-line by this summer. Moreover, under my emergency      authority, I acted to accelerate and incentive the      development of new generation, including distributed      generation and peaking facilities, with an aggressive but      attainable goal of putting 5000 MW of new power on-line this      summer, and another 5000 MW by the summer of 2002.       Today, I announced a major energy conservation initiative,      the 20/20 Rebate Program, which will reward consumers with a      20 percent reduction in their summer 2001 electricity bill if      they reduce their use by 20 percent or greater. This program      will be the centerpiece of $800 million in energy      conservation programs including a $30 million public      education program which features conservation messages in 12      media markets throughout California. The state, itself, has      initiated electricity conservation programs which have      produced an average savings of 8 percent, increasing to over      20 percent of its use during stage 2 and 3 alerts.       A critical component of the plan to resolve California's      energy challenge is the return of our utilities to financial      solvency. Our efforts have taken the form of painstaking      negotiations between the state and the utilities to stabilize      their financial condition. Any attempt to create a special      class of debtor under federal bankruptcy laws may have      serious repercussions to our efforts.       Therefore, I am writing to express my strong opposition to      Senator Ron Wyden's amendment to S. 420, the Bankruptcy      Reform Act of 2001. Any actions on the part of the United      States Senate might very well     undermine all the progress we have made to this point in our      negotiations with the utilities. This is a very delicate      process and we urge the Senate to allow all parties in      California to continue their work together to solve this      crisis.           Sincerely,     Gray Davis.                                  ____              International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,     U.S. Senate, SH-720 Senate Hart Office Building, Washington,          DC.       Dear Senator Akaka: We understand the Senate will be voting      on an amendment to the Bankruptcy Reform Act (S. 240) today,      submitted by Oregon Senator Ron Wyden. The International      Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) has a number of      concerns with this amendment and urges your opposition.       The Wyden Amendment would make any debts incurred under a      federal order imposed during the power crisis in California      non-dischargeable in a bankruptcy proceeding. Inevitably,      power suppliers would be given preference above other      creditors, pushing workers' interests further down the      ladder. This looming threat also adds pressure to bargaining      efforts during contract negotiations, putting our members at      higher financial risk.       It is understandable that public agencies who supplied      power during the crisis want guarantees for their ratepayers,      and should, at just and reasonable rates that cover the cost      of producing the power. However, privately owned suppliers      took part in predatory behavior during the spot market price      spikes, selling electricity at 1,000-3,000 percent profit      margins. Should these suppliers who inflated their power      prices be the priority in a bankruptcy proceeding? Should      small bondholders, workers, pension trust funds and other      creditors be left to pick up the crumbs?       Governor Gray Davis is working tirelessly to resolve the      electricity deregulation disaster in California. We are      hoping the state's solution will avert utility bankruptcy and      protect workers who could lose their jobs if these delicate      negotiations are not successful. We believe the Wyden      Amendment could disrupt this fragile process.       On behalf of over 800,000 IBEW members and their working      families, we urge you to ``OPPOSE'' The Wyden Amendment to S.      420.           Sincerely,     Edwin D. Hill,       International President.     Jerry J. O'Connor,       International Secretary-Treasurer.
