Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) is right on. This bill expands abortion funding to the greatest extent in history.  I have heard that the President is contemplating issuing an Executive order to try to limit this. Members should not be fooled. Executive orders cannot override the clear intent of a statute.  Secondly, yesterday everybody in this House voted in favor of the TRICARE bill, which preserved the DOD's right to administer this program. If an Executive order moves the abortion funding in this bill away from where it is now, it will be struck down as unconstitutional because Executive orders cannot constitutionally do that.
