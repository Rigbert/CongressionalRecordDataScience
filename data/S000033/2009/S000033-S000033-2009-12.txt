 What this amendment does is it imposes a 5.4-percent surtax on adjusted gross incomes above $2.4 million for individuals and $4.8 million for couples.  What that means, I would tell the Senator from Ohio, is that this impacts the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent, which means 99.98 percent of the American people would not pay one penny in additional taxes. It is the top two one-hundredths of 1 percent, and I think that is in fact the proper thing to do.
