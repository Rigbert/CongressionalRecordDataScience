 President, I rise to explain my position on the nomination of Miguel Estrada and to speak more generally on the state of the nomination process in today's Senate.  This is a difficult time for all of us in the Senate and, indeed, the Nation. We stand on the brink of war, with an economy that is sputtering, and the threat of international terrorism as close at hand as it has ever been. These are serious issues, issues the American people have sent us here to debate and to try to solve. In doing so, it is vital we come together as a Government, not as Democrats versus Republicans, or Congress versus the White House, but as one Government and one Nation. As best we can, we should work together, consult each other, debate the issues forthrightly and with strength of purpose, and then come to agreement on how to solve the problems that confront us.  One of the reasons this issue is so important is because the judges we confirm over the next few years will help decide whether acts of Congress will stand or will be struck down. They will decide how far the law will go to protect the safety and rights of the American people. They will have the power to limit or expand civil rights protections. They will have great leeway to interpret the laws protecting or limiting a woman's right to choose. They will be able to expand or limit gun control laws, laws against child pornography, campaign finance laws, and many more. In a real sense, these judges will have as much power, or more, than any of us in this body. Clearly, the court with the biggest impact will be the Supreme Court. But the District of Columbia Circuit Court is a close second and is often cited as the most powerful court in the Nation. It is no coincidence that the DC Circuit has produced more Supreme Court Justices than any other circuit. Three of the nine current Justices--Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg sat on the DC Circuit. In fact, it is hard to overstate the importance of an appointment to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals and particularly the DC Circuit.  The Supreme Court of the United States is our Nation's court of last resort. But it heard less than 80 cases in the 2000-2001 session. In contrast, the Federal courts of appeal considered over 27,000 cases during the same period. For so many of the legal injuries for which people seek redress, the courts of appeal are the last stop, the ultimate decisionmaker. And the DC Circuit is the most important of all circuit courts because it is the court that most closely oversees the actions of Federal agencies; actions that havereal, everyday impact on the lives of all Americans. The DC Circuit reviews appeals regarding decisions by the Federal Communications Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Election Commission, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Endangered Species Act, and the Environmental Protection Act, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Superfund, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and countless other agencies and statutes.  Because the Supreme Court reviews so few cases, the DC Circuit essentially has the last say on whether decisions by these agencies will stand or will not stand. In recent years, the DC Circuit has become a hostile forum for environmental protections. Since 1990, the DC Circuit has struck down or hindered a long list of crucial environmental protections, including clean air protections for soot and smog, habitat protection under the Endangered Species Act, clean water protection for millions of acres of wetlands, fuel efficiency standards known as CAFE standards, designation of sites on the Superfund National Priorities List, and guidelines on treatment of petroleum wastewater.  As Senator Kennedy pointed out in Miguel Estrada's hearing, the recent case of Maryland/DC/Delaware Broadcasters Association v. the FCC, the DC Circuit found a portion of the FCC's equal opportunity policy unconstitutional. Specifically, the court struck down a policy of broad outreach for minority broadcasters. This decision, right or wrong, will have a significant impact on the ability of the FCC to encourage minority participation in the broadcast industry.  Incidentally, Mr. Estrada essentially refused to comment on this case when asked to do so.  Steffan v. Perry involved a young man at the U.S. Naval academy, Joseph Steffan, who admitted to two of his classmates that he was gay, although he never admitted actually performing any homosexual acts. Steffan was discharged under Department of Defense regulations indicating that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. Steffan argued his dismissal was impermissible, as it was based on status--being gay--not conduct. The DC Circuit held, in 1994, that the Defense Department regulations were permissible, however, and that the Steffan dismissal would stand.  I could go on and on with cases--United States v. Bailey, for instance. Or AKA v. Washington Hospital Center, where the court ruled in favor of an orderly who, after 19 years of work, was forced to have heart surgery and who was then denied the right to transfer to another job within the hospital that would not require the same level of physical activity.  The District of Columbia Circuit is also the court that most often reviews terrorism cases on appeal.  All in all, it is quite clear that the District of Columbia Circuit is constantly at the center of complex key issues of the day.  Currently, there is a delicate balance on this court. There are four Republican appointees, four Democratic appointees, and four vacancies. Therefore, this nominee effectively tilts the balance on that court. That is why many of us believe it is so important to learn how this nominee thinks, what his judicial temperament would be, and so on.  During the last several years of the Clinton administration, two highly qualified Clinton nominees were blocked permanently. Some believe its purpose was to initiate a concerted, planned effort to keep vacancies open on that court so they could be filled with conservatives in the event of a Republican President.  When President Bush took office, he sent us two nominees for the district circuit. One of them is Miguel Estrada. I don't believe it is appropriate for us to simply block all nominees to the District of Columbia Circuit in retaliation for that having been done to Democratic nominees. That is not why I am here today. But at the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that this important circuit is now so closely divided. In deciding whether to confirm a given nominee to such a delicately balanced court, we must ensure that the judges we send to the court can administer the law fairly and impartially. That is the case before us today: Can Miguel Estrada administer the law fairly and impartially?  We have before us a 41-year-old nominee about whom we know very little. To properly discharge our constitutionally derived advise and consent function, the Members of the Senate must be given enough information to make the right decision about a given nominee.  In this case, I have heard many comments on this nominee as a very bright but ideologically driven young attorney, one who would put his beliefs ahead of the law if confirmed to the Federal bench. So I want to try to figure out whether or not that is true. Many who knew him, know him, have supervised him, or have spoken to him believe strongly that he does not have the temperament or impartiality necessary to fairly administer the law.  My office has received literally thousands of calls about this nomination--more than 7,900 phone calls, to be exact. Fewer than 300 of those 7,900 calls were in favor of Miguel Estrada's nomination.  To counteract serious concerns from those who know him and from those whom we represent, we need evidence that would contradict these opinions. Quite frankly, we do not have that evidence.  Miguel Estrada has never been a judge. So we have no record of judicial decision-making to examine. This is not dispositive in itself, but it is the first area where we find no record to help us in our decision.  Mr. Estrada is not a prolific writer. So we have no real record of writing to examine. Again, this alone would not be dispositive, but it is strike 2 in terms of where we can get information about this nominee.  We have not been granted access to the memos he wrote at the Department of Justice. So we can only take the word of the man who supervised him that those memos were ideologically driven and that he could not be trusted.  Mr. Estrada refused to adequately participate in his own confirmation hearings, which I will comment on as a great surprise to me and the reason I changed my view. So we have no real answers to our questions.  Let me expand on this last point because I think it is instructive to examine and contrast our experience with Mr. Estrada and our experience with one other nominee.  At last week's markup, I was struck by the lack of information about this nominee. Yet, as I said, I liked him very much when I met with him personally. But I was startled by his performance at the public hearing.  So I got the transcripts, and I reread the transcripts to try to see if there was anything I missed--something I could zero in on that would let me know he would in fact be fair and impartial.  What came to my mind was the real contrast with another nominee. That nominee is a man by the name of Jeffrey Sutton. He also was controversial. The disabilities community had a lot of concerns about him. But Mr. Sutton at his hearing answered every question put to him intelligently, in a fulsome way, and I thought forthrightly. So I could tell how he would act as an appellate court judge. The committee was able to gauge his intelligence, his manner of thinking, and we can use that back-and-forth to help us predict whether Mr. Sutton would be a good and fair judge or whether he would skew outcomes of cases to meet his own ideological goals.  Mr. Estrada, on the other hand, did his best to keep from putting himself on the record on any issue of real substance. For instance, when Senator Schumer asked Mr. Estrada to name three Supreme Court cases in the last 40 years with which he disagreed, Mr. Estrada simply refused to answer.  When I asked him whether he believed Roe v. Wade was correctly decided, he declined to answer on the basis that he had not done what the ``judicial function would require'' to determine whether the Court correctly decided the case.  When Senator Leahy asked him what he thought of the decision in Romer v. Evans, a case involving discrimination against homosexuals, Estrada responded ``I can't know because I was not a judge in the case.''  When Senator Kennedy asked Mr. Estrada a written question about aunion retaliation case decided by the DC Circuit in 2001 and reversed by the Supreme Court last term, Estrada responded ``Although I have read the Supreme Court's opinion . . . I have not read the briefs in the case, was not present at the oral argument, and have not independently researched the issue decided by the Court. For those reasons, I am not in a position to know how I might have resolved the issue . . . nor am I in a position to answer the question whether the Supreme Court acted appropriately.''  When Senator Kennedy asked him in writing whether another case involving diversity outreach had been decided correctly, Estrada again fell back on the argument that because he had not heard oral arguments and had not read the briefs, he could not answer.  When Senator Kennedy asked Estrada about yet another Supreme Court case, American Trucking v. EPA, where the Supreme Court reversed the District of Columbia Circuit, Estrada again fell back on the argument that he had not been present for oral arguments and could not, therefore, comment on whether the case had been correctly decided.  That kind of answer makes it truly difficult to get a sense of where a nominee is coming from in terms of thoughtful process, analysis, and legal expertise.  When it comes to the most important circuit court in the Nation and there is no record and there is no writing, the Senate of the United States is entitled to know these answers.  It strains credibility that a nominee for the circuit court of appeals would still have no opinion on whether a case such as Roe was correctly decided or whether any case in the last 40 years was incorrectly decided.  Finally, it is troubling to get these answers from a nominee about whom we know so little and who is nominated to a court that will decide so much for so many.  Taken as a whole, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this nominee, with so little information, recommending him to such an important lifetime appointment. And I cannot help but wonder: Why didn't the President appoint him to a District court? He is younger than my daughter. Give him an opportunity to produce a record and then move him on to an appellate court when that record could, in fact, be examined.  A few days after I cast my committee vote against Mr. Estrada, White House Counsel Al Gonzales sent a letter addressed to me personally criticizing my vote and asking me to reconsider. Because Judge Gonzales has made the letter available to others, and it has now appeared in the press, I find it necessary that I correct the record. And I would like to do so.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, dated February 3, 2003, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write in response to your vote in      the Judiciary Committee on the nomination of Miguel Estrada      and to respectfully urge that you reconsider this important      nomination when you vote on it in the full Senate. I write in      particular because it appears from your statement in the      Committee (and on your web site) that you may possess      inaccurate or incomplete information on certain issues that      you have deemed important to the Estrada nomination.       First, it appears you relied on the fact that Estrada has      no previous judicial service. But five of the eight judges      currently serving on the D.C. Circuit had no previous      judicial experience when appointed. That includes two of      President Clinton's nominees, Merrick Garland, whose Justice      Department record was quite similar to that of Miguel      Estrada, and David Tatel. In addition, Judge Harry Edwards      had no prior judicial experience when he was nominated by      President Carter in 1979, and he was younger than Estrada. In      addition, several Ninth Circuit judges from California who      were appointed by President Clinton, and had your support,      had no prior judicial experience. That includes Judge William      Fletcher, Judge Raymond Fisher, and Judge Marsha Berzon.       The American Bar Association, which Democrat Senators Leahy      and Schumer have referred to as the ``gold standard,''      unanimously rated Estrada ``well qualified'' for the D.C.      Circuit, the ABA's highest possible rating. We think the ABA      rating was quite appropriate in light of Estrada's excellent      record, including his work as an Assistant Solicitor General      in the Clinton and Bush Administrations, his record as a      federal prosecutor in New York, his service as a law clerk to      Justice Kennedy, and his pro bono work including his      volunteer representation of a death row inmate before the      Supreme Court. He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme      Court of the United States, a figure that few lawyers can      match, and particularly impressive for someone who immigrated      to this country at age 17 speaking little English.       Second, you also referenced a news report quoting the views      of Paul Bender, a former Deputy Solicitor General. Mr. Bender      has not written a letter to the Committee or otherwise      publicly explained his views, so we are unclear whether this      news report was accurate. But more important, as I explained      in a September 17, 2002, letter to then-Chairman Leahy and      Senator Hatch, Paul Bender in fact signed the performance      reviews of Miguel Estrada for the two years that they worked      together. The performance reviews for those years gave      Estrada the highest possible rating of ``outstanding'' in      every possible category. Significantly, the performance      reviews that Bender signed also stated the following to      support the judgment that Estrada's performance was      ``outstanding.''       ``States the operative facts and applicable law completely      and persuasively, with record citations, and in conformation      with court and office rules, and with concern for fairness,      clarity, simplicity, and conciseness.''       ``[I]s extremely knowledgeable of resource materials and      uses them expertly; acting independently, goes directly to      point of the matter and gives reliable, accurate, responsive      information in communicating position to others.''       ``[A]ll dealings, oral and written, with the courts,      clients, and others are conducted in a diplomatic,      cooperative, and candid manner.''       ``[A]ll briefs, motions or memoranda reviewed consistently      reflect no policies at variance with Department or      Governmental policies, or fails to discuss and analyze      relevant authorities.''       ``[i]s constantly sought for advice and counsel. Inspires      co-workers by example.''       Apart from the contemporaneous reviews that Mr. Bender      himself signed, it also bears mention that the Committee has      received letters from Seth Waxman, President Clinton's      Solicitor General, and a bipartisan group of 14 former      colleagues of Mr. Estrada in the Solicitor General's office.      Seth Waxman wrote to the Committee that Estrada is a ``model      of professionalism and competence'' and that he has ``great      respect both for Mr. Estrada's intellect and for his      integrity.'' He continued: ``In no way did I ever discern      that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or the views he      propounded were colored in any way by his personnel views--or      indeed that they reflected anything other than the long-term      interests of the United States.'' And the bipartisan group of      former colleagues from the Office of Solicitor General wrote      to the Committee that Estrada ``would be a fair and honest      judge who would decide cases in accordance with applicable      legal principles and precedents.'' Finally, to the extent Mr.      Bender's own personal political and ideological views are      relevant, we call your attention to Senator Hatch's opening      statement at the hearing on September 26, 2002.       Third, you referenced the fact that Miguel Estrada has been      `accused'' of using an ideological litmus test when assisting      Justice Kennedy in the selection of his law clerks. We      respectfully do not think this ``accusation'' is credible or      supported. In fact, Mr. Estrada explained at his hearing that      he in fact has been very supportive, for example, of the      hiring of one law clerk for Justice Kennedy who at the time      worked for President Clinton, is a strong Democrat, and now      works for Senator Leahy on the Judiciary Committee.       Fourth, you noted concern among ``Hispanic organizations.''      In fact, the overwhelming majority of national Hispanic      organizations have supported Mr. Estrada. That includes the      Hispanic National Bar Association, the League of United Latin      American Citizens, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the      Hispanic Business Roundtable, and the Latino Coalition, among      many others. To be sure, MALDEF and PRLDEF do oppose Mr.      Estrada. As to Hispanic members of the House, we understand      that all of the Republican Hispanics support him while the      Democrat Hispanics do not. In any event, LULAC's statement is      noteworthy, as it states: ``[Estrada] is truly one of the      rising stars in the Hispanic community and a role model for      our youth.''       Thank you for considering this nominee in light of the      above information. This is an historic nomination, as Miguel      Estrade would be the first Hispanic to serve on the D.C.      Circuit. We urge you to vote to confirm him.           Sincerely,                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,                                         Counsel to the President.
