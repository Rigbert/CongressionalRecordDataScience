 President, I introduce the Homeland Security Information Sharing Act, a bill to increase state and local access to security information that could save American lives. The House has already passed similar legislation bill sponsored by Representatives Harman and Chambliss, and it is my understanding that the Administration supports this legislation as well.  The bill I introduce today will not solve our intelligence problems--we have a long road ahead of us before we can accomplish that. But this legislation will send a clear signal to our federal agencies that information gathered at the federal level must be shared with states and localities if we are to triumph in the battle against terrorism.  State and local law enforcement are first-line defenders of our homeland security. Too often, though, state and local officials do not receive information necessary for them to protect us. If, for instance, there were a terrorist threat against the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, we would want a cooperative effort between the Federal government and local officials.  This bill would:  Direct the President to establish procedures for federal agencies to share homeland security information with state and local officials, and for all government officials to be able to communicate with each other. Local officials should quickly have access to relevant intelligence necessary to prevent or respond to attacks in their communities.  Direct the President to address concerns about too much dissemination of classified or sensitive information, by setting procedures to protect this material. This could include requiring background checks of local officials who seek access to classified information, or perhaps even non disclosure agreements so that secret information stays secret.  Direct the President to ensure that our current information sharing systems and computers are capable of sharing relevant homeland security information with each other and with state and local systems.  Mr. President, we can improve information sharing without re-inventing the wheel. The legislation applies technology already used to share information with our NATO allies and with Interpol. The information can be shared through existing networks, such as the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, the Regional Information Sharing Systems, and the Terrorist Threat Warning System. These systems already reach law enforcement offices throughout America.  Better information sharing will result in better homeland security. As a Congress, we are already working on making intelligence gathering and dissemination work better within the federal government. We must not forget to improve communications with state and local law enforcement as well.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I hope that we can pass it quickly in September. It is non-controversial, and would help send a clear signal that information gathering and dissemination may be our best defense against terror.                                 ______                                       By
