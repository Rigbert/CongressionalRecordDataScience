Speaker, the American people have made it clear that they support all-of-the-above energy solutions that increase the production of American-made energy, including offshore energy. Unfortunately, the Democrats' so-called energy bill is anything but an all-of-the-above energy bill.  The Democrat bill claims to expand offshore drilling, and yet it expands drilling in areas where there isn't any oil.  The energy bill also requires the States to opt in to allow offshore energy exploration off their coast. However, it doesn't even provide them with a share of the royalty revenues.  I think the American people would agree that we should be providing coastal States with incentives to produce energy, not discourage them. I strongly oppose any effort to treat California as a second-class State, and I am frankly surprised that the Speaker would support a bill that denies our State royalty revenue benefits that other States currently enjoy.  This bill does nothing to increase production of nuclear power, nothing for hydropower, and nothing to increase refining capability. This bill is hardly change we can believe in. In fact, this bill isn't change at all.
