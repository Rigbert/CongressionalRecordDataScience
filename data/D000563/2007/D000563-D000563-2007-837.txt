President, pending is the regular order of the amendment by Senator Dodd, which has been pending since before the Memorial Day break. So any argument that Members haven't had a chance to take a look at this amendment--they could have taken it home over the Memorial Day recess and read it almost every day and be ready to debate it right now.  I don't want to speak for Senator Dodd--no one could--but I think it might be appropriate for us to consider that amendment in a shorter time span.
