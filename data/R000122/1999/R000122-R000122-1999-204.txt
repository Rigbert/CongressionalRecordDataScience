President, I rise to join my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, in offering this important amendment to express the Sense of the Senate that funding for need-based student financial aid programs should be increased.  The Republican budget proposal provides some welcome news when compared with past Republican budget proposals because it at least includes increased funding for elementary and secondary education. Indeed, it can be called much improved in contrast with past Republican proposals to eliminate the Department of Education.  However, I am deeply concerned that this funding increase may be financed by cutting critical programs like Head Start, Summer Jobs for Youth, and job training by up to 10% in FY2000, and 20% in the following years.  Moreover, this budget proposal assumes an increase for elementary and secondary education programs of $2.6 billion over a freeze. However, it only assumes a $2.4 billion overall increase for all education programs in fiscal year 2000, which means other vital education programs, like student financial aid programs, would have to be deeply cut or frozen in order to meet these assumptions.  It would be a shame to limit our ability to realize the reforms we just recently enacted as part of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 to enhance federal assistance to college students. That is why I have joined Senator Collins and others in offering this amendment.  Mr. President, this amendment simply urges increases in funding for need-based student financial aid programs. These programs include Pell Grants, the Federal Work Study Program, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership (LEAP) program, and TRIO.  I strongly support a greater investment in all of these important programs than is provided by the budget resolution. And, in particular, I have long been a champion of more robust funding for the LEAP program, a federal-state partnership that is essential to our efforts to help needy students attend and graduate from college.  I worked closely with Senator Collins on a successful amendment two years ago to save LEAP from elimination and on legislation to reform this program, which was included in the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. These reforms seek to encourage states to increase their commitments to need-based student grant aid in exchange for increased flexibility to provide a broader array of higher education assistance to needy students.  We are currently working together to secure $75 million for LEAP in the Fiscal Year 2000 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill to trigger these reforms, and I urge my colleagues to join us in this important effort.  LEAP and the rest of the federal financial aid programs are critical to helping students achieve their higher education goals.  All higher education and student groups endorse the effort to increase funding for need-based student financial aid programs, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support our amendment in order to meet the commitment to higher education that we reaffirmed last fall by passing the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.                           amendment no. 230   (Purpose: To provide an exception for emergency defense spending)       At the end of section 205 of the resolution, add the      following:       (f) Exception for Defense Spending.--This section shall not      apply to a provision making discretionary appropriations in      the defense category.''.
