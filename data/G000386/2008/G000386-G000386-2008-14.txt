 President, as the ranking Republican of the FinanceCommittee acting on behalf of a number of Republicans on the Finance Committee, I am objecting to discharging S. 3656 from the committee. While there are several provisions in the bill I personally strongly support, there are many problems in this bill and questions that have been raised about this bill. In addition, this bill has not come before the committee and the issues it addresses have not had the benefit of hearings or any committee action. As a result, I cannot support this bill being discharged from the committee at this time.  One of the provisions in S. 3656 that I personally support would delay implementing provisions of a CMS proposed rule that would change conditions of participation for rural health clinics and decertify clinics that are no longer in nonurbanized areas. The provision would also delay the proposed changes to the existing payment methodology for rural health clinics and Federally qualified health centers.  The CMS proposed rule would impose new location requirements for RHCs and require that clinics be located in a nonurbanized area, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as meet shortage area designation requirements. Only new RHCs applying for the program are currently required to meet these criteria, but the CMS proposal would extend these requirements to already certified RHCs. According to CMS, about 500 of the approximately 3,700 RHCs operating today may not meet these requirements. Rural clinics in Iowa and elsewhere could also be severely impacted by the CMS proposed payment changes since RHC costs in Iowa and other States are already higher than the existing Medicare reimbursement cap.  Iowa is currently in the throes of a growing shortage of physicians, especially in the more rural areas of the State, due to inequitable geographic adjustments in physician payment that result in Iowa physicians receiving some of the lowest Medicare payments in the country even though they provide some of the highest quality care. These geographic payment disparities, which discriminate against rural areas, have further exacerbated the problems of access to care for beneficiaries in rural areas.  The CMS proposed rule could have a severe adverse impact on a number of rural health clinics in Iowa, including many located in counties that have been declared disaster areas from the severe flooding Iowa suffered earlier this year. If the CMS rule is finalized as proposed, rural health clinics in Iowa and elsewhere may be forced to close their doors, even though they have served rural populations very well for many years, leaving Iowa with fewer physicians and some patients with little access to primary care and other critical medical services.  As you can see, these provisions for rural health centers are important, which makes it all the more disappointing that my friends on the other side of the aisle did not work together with us to develop a bipartisan bill and that the committee is not in a position at this time to consider these important issues properly. I am very pleased, however, that a key issue for rural health centers in the proposal has already been addressed through a provision that was included in the Health Care Safety Net Act. That provision changes the CMS certification period for shortage area designations from 3 to 4 years in order to align the CMS certification period for shortage area designations with the Health Resources and Services Administration's, HRSA's, designation review period. I want to thank Senators Orrin Hatch, Pat Roberts, Gordon Smith, Tom Harkin, Ron Wyden, Kent Conrad, and John Barasso for championing the resolution of this important issue and Senator Max Baucus for working together with me to facilitate its inclusion in the Health Care Safety Net Act. And, of course, I want to again thank Senators Kennedy and Enzi for working with us on this issue. Thanks to this bipartisan collaborative effort, that bill with the RHC provision in it has now passed both Chambers and is on its way to being signed into law.  Another provision in S. 3656 would prevent the application of a CMS policy to phase out a payment adjustment for indirect medical education, IME, under the Medicare capital Inpatient Prospective Payment System, IPPS. Currently, teaching hospitals receive this upward payment adjustment under the capital IPPS. CMS announced in the fiscal year 2008 Medicare Hospital IPPS final rule that they would begin to phase out the IME adjustment for capital IPPS in fiscal year 2009.  As the former chair and currently the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, it has long been one of my priorities to ensure Medicare payments are both accurate and equitable. I question whether this proposed change to IME payments would further this goal, which many of us share.  The appropriateness of the IME capital IPPS adjustment has been analyzed extensively not only by CMS, but also by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, which advises Congress on Medicare payment issues. CMS has documented relatively high and continued positive margins for teaching hospitals under the capital IPPS compared to nonteaching hospitals. In fact, from 1998 through 2006, teaching hospitals had an aggregate positive capital IPPS margin of 11.2 percent while nonteaching hospitals had an aggregate capital IPPS margin of -0.8 percent. Based on those figures, it leaves open the question of whether the proposed change to IME payments is not justified. Certainly this is something the Finance Committee should explore further.  S. 3656 also proposes to establish a moratorium on a CMS rule regarding Medicaid payments for hospital outpatient services. Earlier this year, Congress placed moratoriums on 6 other proposed Medicaid regulations. Just as I opposed those moratoriums, I strongly oppose this one as well. The Finance Committee has not held the first hearing as to why a delay in this regulation is justified. The Finance Committee has not considered whether payments currently being made by some states to hospitals for outpatient services are being made consistent with the statutory rules governing the upper payment limit. The CMS regulation in question was intended to clarify what payments from States to hospitals are allowable. We should not simply place a moratorium on this regulation without the committee properly investigating the issue first. Medicaid is a critical program for children, pregnant women, the disabled, and the elderly. We have a responsibility to the people who depend on the program to make sure that funds are being appropriately spent. Placing a moratorium on these regulations without fully exploring these issues in the committee first is not consistent with that responsibility.  This bill also would intervene in a dispute between CMS and the State of California. The State of California has been seeking approval of an extension of their family planning waiver for 6 years. For 6 years, CMS has been urging California to improve their collection of Social Security numbers and citizenship documentation for women enrolled in the program. Given the concerns that have been raised about noncitizens receiving benefits to which they are not entitled, this provision raises a number of serious concerns. This bill would essentially require CMS to approve of the extension of California's waiver without requiring California to fulfill their obligation to improve their process of ensuring that people who receive benefits are actually eligible for those benefits.  In addition, this bill does nothing to assist ``tweener hospitals,'' which are hospitals that are too large to be critical access hospitals but too small to be financially viable under Medicare's prospective payment systems. I consider this to be a high priority because so many seniors in Iowa rely on these tweener hospitals for vitally needed health care services in rural areas of our State. If the Senate is going to consider Medicare legislation that is along the size and scope of the provisions proposed in S. 3656, including provisions to address the problems tweener hospitals face is a must.  I understand that legislation is often the art of compromise. We can't always get everything we want in every bill and keep everything we dislike out. It is a balance. This bill is currently pending before the Finance Committee, and it raises significant issues of Medicare and Medicaid payment policies. The Finance Committee has not held hearings on these issues nor has it given these important issues proper consideration. Without allowing thecommittee process to work, this bill has not been subject to the rigorous analysis and debate that the legislative process should require to avoid unintended consequences and poor decisionmaking. This process should be permitted to take place before legislation of this magnitude is sent to the full Senate. That is the committee's role and it is an important one.  If the full Senate were to routinely bypass the Finance Committee and consider major Medicare bills like this one that have not been processed by the members of the committee, then nothing would prevent the Senate from legislating on other Medicare and Medicaid issues without the benefit of hearings or committee action. Occasionally, the committee does process extensions of current law and smaller, generally technical bills through a more informal committee process, but it is a committee process nonetheless. If the committee is routinely bypassed entirely and not allowed to perform its vital role in the legislative process, it would be almost impossible to cope with the number and assortment of Medicare, Medicaid, and other issues that would come directly to the Senate floor in bills like S. 3656. To avoid that result is why the Senate has committees in the first place.  Just an initial review of this legislation today produces more questions than answers and many obvious and serious concerns. It is disappointing that some of the important provisions in this bill, like the rural health center provisions and IME policy, are packaged into a bill that has not been presented in a timely way or brought before the committee for appropriate consideration, debate, and amendment. Just a quick review of this bill today quickly reveals, in any case, that both in terms of process and policy, this bill does not sufficiently achieve a balance I think is necessary, and I must, on behalf of myself and other members of the committee, object to discharging S. 3656 from committee for consideration by the full Senate.                          ____________________
