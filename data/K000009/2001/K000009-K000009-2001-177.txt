Speaker, I thank the hardworking and able gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Tierney) for sponsoring this special order this evening, and it is a pleasure to join the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Holt) and the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) in this important discussion.  Today in Madrid, a reporter asked President Bush how he could reconcile his opposition to the Kyoto Treaty, an opposition that he says is based upon a lack of scientific evidence, with his support for Star Wars which is also not supported by scientific evidence.  ``How do we know it is going to work?'' President Bush stated. ``Well, we have to spend the dollars on research and development.'' But I am sure President Bush is aware, he is not proposing only research and development. The Bush Star Wars proposal involves deployment of the system, not just research and development. Indeed, this shocking lack of scientific evidence is the Achilles' heel of the administration's single-minded pursuit of this system.  As others have mentioned, a Star Wars program will cost our people over $50 billion or more and still counting, and that is only the first phase.
