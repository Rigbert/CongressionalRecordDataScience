Since the enactment of the statute in 1965, every Supreme Court case to address the question has rejected the claim that section 5 is an ``affront'' to our system of federalism. Whether under Earl Warren, Warren Burger, or William Rehnquist, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that guaranteeing all citizens the right to cast an equal vote is essential to our democracy--no a ``burden'' that has ``outlived its usefulness.''  Indeed, Congressman Lewis sponsored a resolution, which is being considered on the floor of the House today, commemorating the passage of the Voting Rights Act 40 years ago this summer. The resolution recalls the struggle for the act's landmark protections--from the brutal suppression of marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, AL, on ``Bloody Sunday'' in March 1965, to the passage of the bill by a bipartisan Congress months later--and reaffirms its importance. Forty years after President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, Congressman Lewis and I remain committed to this essential piece of legislation.                               Exhibit 1                                    Congress of the United States,                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2005.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: During the Senate debate on the      nomination of Judge William Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court      of Appeals, Senator Saxby Chambliss quoted a few words of my      testimony in the case of the State of Georgia v. John      Ashcroft, and implied that I agree with Judge Pryor's      assessment of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. I take      issue with Senator Chambliss's remarks and want to make clear      that his reference to my remarks were taken out of context.       I regret that my colleague, the senior Senator from      Georgia, would use my support of a Georgia redistricting plan      to justify the confirmation of Justice William Pryor to the      11th Circuit Court of Appeals. I strongly disagree with the      views of Judge Pryor and do not think he is fit to serve.       I further regret that Senator Chambliss would use my very      general statements to suggest that I am not in favor of      renewing Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Section 5 of the      Voting Rights Act must be renewed. There is a continued,      proven need for the pre-clearance provisions of the Voting      Rights Act, which ensure that local and state jurisdictions      do not develop laws that intentionally or unintentionally      discriminate against groups who may have little or no voice      in the establishment of those laws.       We have come a long way in the last two decades, and      certainly have come a long way since the 1960's, however,      voting obstacles and disparities still exist for far too many      minorities. In Florida in 2000, voters were confused by their      ballots, polling equipment broke down, and polls did not open      as scheduled. In Ohio in 2004, many people stood in what      appeared to be unmovable lines for eight and nine hours      trying to exercise their right to vote. There were an      inadequate number of voting machines and in some instances,      bogus officials were sent to polling stations and were found      disseminating misinformation and questioning the choices of      voters.       As a result of these problems, many Americans were denied      the right to vote. These truths continue to demonstrate the      importance of the Voting Rights Act to prevent discrimination      and to ensure that people are not denied the right to vote.      The vote is the most powerful, nonviolent tool that our      citizens have in a democratic society, and nothing but      nothing should discourage, hamper or interfere with the right      of every citizen to cast a vote for the person of their      choice.       The history of the right to vote in America is a history of      conflict, of struggling for the right to vote. Many people      died trying to protect that right. I was beaten, and jailed      because I stood up for it. For millions like me, the struggle      for the right to vote is not mere history; it is experience.      The experience of the last two presidential elections tells      us that the struggle is not over and that the special      provisions of the Voting Rights Act are still necessary. We      should not take a step backward, when there is still much to      be done to ensure every vote and every voter counts.       As we work toward reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act, we      must move in a deliberative manner, conduct open and adequate      hearings, and ensure that we create the appropriate      legislative history and factual findings. I look forward to      working with you to protect the voting rights of all      Americans, by reauthorizing and strengthening the provisions      of the Voting Rights Act.           Sincerely,                                                       John Lewis,     Member of Congress.                          ____________________[Pages S9150-S9151]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]            CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT
