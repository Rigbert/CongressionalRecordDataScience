Chairman, the WIC Program is structured in such a way to allow approximately 2 percent of total funding to be carried over from one fiscal year to the next fiscal year because in the act, in the statute, WIC cannot create any deficits. So those dollars are dollars that pay for current beneficiaries.  I am sure that the gentlewoman that just spoke is unfamiliar with the program, being a new Member, but there is absolutely no way that WIC can overspend its dollars, and in addition to that, the fund for rural America is already over subscribed. We are going to have to cut water projects, sewer projects all over this country, housing projects. To throw the WIC's dollars in there makes absolutely no sense because there is not enough money to begin with.
