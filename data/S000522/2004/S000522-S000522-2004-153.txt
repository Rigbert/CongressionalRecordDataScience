Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letter for the Record.                                          The American Legion,                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2004.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Rayburn House Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Smith: The American Legion applauds      your continuing leadership in fighting for the rights of the      abused     minorities in Vietnam. The United States must maintain      constant pressure on the Vietnamese government to honor the      rights of its citizens and our former allies. The Legion      stands in strong support of the Vietnam Human Rights Act of      2004.       The American Legion has grave concerns about the plight of      ethnic groups such as the Montagnards, as well as religious      minorities, including Buddhists and Catholics who are under      constant attack and persecution by Vietnamese authorities for      practicing their religion. The American Legion strongly      believes that successful passage of the Vietnam Human Rights      Act of 2004 will greatly benefit the future of minority      ethnic and religious populations in Vietnam. If the U.S. does      not have the tools that would be available through the      Vietnam Human Rights Act, we will lose the only remaining      leverage we have in persuading the Vietnamese to change their      egregious behavior.       As a nation at war, I think it is important that America's      allies know they serve beside a committed, loyal partner--one      that will not desert or betray them in their time of need.      Simply ignoring the current violations of human rights is not      an acceptable option for The American Legion's membership of      wartime veterans, many who served in Vietnam side-by-side      with these current victims of tyranny.           Sincerely,                                              John F. Sommer, Jr.,                                               Executive Director.
