SEC. 206. UNITED STATES PENSION PLANS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) The United States and the international community face      no greater threat to their security than the prospect of      rogue regimes who support international terrorism obtaining      weapons of mass destruction, and particularly nuclear      weapons.       (2) Iran is the leading state sponsor of international      terrorism and is close to achieving nuclear weapons      capability but has paid no price for nearly twenty years of      deception over its nuclear program. Foreign entities that      have invested in Iran's energy sector, despite Iran's support      of international terrorism and its nuclear program, have      afforded Iran a free pass while many United States entities      have unknowingly invested in those same foreign entities.       (3) United States investors have a great deal at stake in      preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.       (4) United States investors can have considerable influence      over the commercial decisions of the foreign entities in      which they have invested.       (b) Publication in Federal Register.--Not later than six      months after the date of the enactment of this Act and every      six months thereafter, the Secretary of State shall ensure      publication in the Federal Register of a list of all United      States and foreign entities that have invested more than      $20,000,000 in Iran's energy sector between August 5, 1996,      and the date of such publication. Such list shall include an      itemization of individual investments of each such entity,      including the dollar value, intended purpose, and current      status of each such investment.       (c) Sense of Congress Relating to Divestiture From Iran.--     It is the sense of Congress that, upon publication of a list      in the relevant Federal Register under subsection (b),      managers of United States Government pension plans or thrift      savings plans, managers of pension plans maintained in the      private sector by plan sponsors in the United States, and      managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the United      States should, to the extent consistent with the legal and      fiduciary duties otherwise imposed on them, immediately      initiate efforts to divest all investments of such plans or      funds in any entity included on the list.       (d) Sense of Congress Relating to Prohibition on Future      Investment.--It is the sense of Congress that, upon      publication of a list in the relevant Federal Register under      subsection (b), there should be, to the extent consistent      with the legal and fiduciary duties otherwise imposed on      them, no future investment in any entity included on the list      by managers of United States Government pension plans or      thrift savings plans, managers of pension plans maintained in      the private sector by plan sponsors in the United States, and      managers of mutual funds sold or distributed in the United      States.

(b) Declaration of Policy.--Section 3 of the Iran and Libya      Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``(a) Policy With      Respect to Iran.--''; and       (2) by striking subsection (b).       (c) Termination of Sanctions.--Section 8 of the Iran and      Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is      amended--       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``(a) Iran.--''; and       (2) by striking subsection (b).       (d) Duration of Sanctions; Presidential Waiver.--Section      9(c)(2)(C) of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (50      U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended to read as follows:       ``(C) an estimate of the significance of the provision of      the items described in section 5(a) or section 5(b) to Iran's      ability to, respectively, develop its petroleum resources or      its weapons of mass destruction or other military      capabilities; and''.

(g) Short Title.--       (1) In general.--Section 1 of the Iran and Libya Sanctions      Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended by striking      ``and Libya''.       (2) References.--Any reference in any other provision of      law, regulation, document, or other record of the United      States to the ``Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996'' shall      be deemed to be a reference to the ``Iran Sanctions Act of      1996''.TITLE III--DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO CURTAIL IRANIAN NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION                AND SPONSORSHIP OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM     SEC. 301. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.       (a) Sense of Congress Relating to United Nations Security      Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency.--It is      the sense of Congress that the President should instruct the      United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations      to work to secure support at the United Nations Security      Council for a resolution that would impose sanctions on Iran      as a result of its repeated breaches of its nuclear      nonproliferation obligations, to remain in effect until Iran      has verifiably dismantled its weapons of mass destruction      programs.       (b) Prohibition on Assistance to Countries That Invest in      the Energy Sector of Iran.--       (1) Withholding of assistance.--If, on or after April 13,      2005, a foreign person (as defined in section 14 of the Iran      Sanctions Act of 1996 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), as renamed      pursuant to section 208(g)(1)) or an agency or      instrumentality of a foreign government has more than      $20,000,000 invested in Iran's energy sector, the President      shall, until the date on which such person or agency or      instrumentality of such government terminates such      investment, withhold assistance under the Foreign Assistance      Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) to the government of the      country to which such person owes allegiance or to which      control is exercised over such agency or instrumentality.       (2) Waiver.--Assistance prohibited by this section may be      furnished to the government of a foreign country described in      subsection (a) if the President determines that furnishing      such assistance is important to the national security      interests of the United States, furthers the goals described      in this Act, and, not later that 15 days before obligating      such assistance, notifies the Committee on International      Relations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on      Foreign Relations of the Senate, the Committee on      Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and the      Committee on Appropriations of the Senate of such      determination and submits to such committees a report that      includes--       (A) a statement of the determination;       (B) a detailed explanation of the assistance to be      provided;       (C) the estimated dollar amount of the assistance; and       (D) an explanation of how the assistance furthers United      States national security interests.     SEC. 302. STRENGTHENING THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of      Nuclear Weapons (commonly referred to as the ``Nuclear      Nonproliferation Treaty'' or ``NPT'') states that countries      that are parties to the Treaty have the ``inalienable right .      . . to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy      for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in      conformity with articles I and II of this Treaty.''.       (2) Iran has manipulated Article IV of the Nuclear      Nonproliferation Treaty to acquire technologies needed to      manufacture nuclear weapons under the guise of developing      peaceful nuclear technology.       (3) Legal authorities, diplomatic historians, and officials      closely involved in the negotiation and ratification of the      Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty state that the Treaty neither      recognizes nor protects such a per se right to all nuclear      technology, such as enrichment and reprocessing, but rather      affirms that the right to the use of peaceful nuclear energy      is qualified.       (b) Declaration of Congress Regarding United States Policy      to Strengthen the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.--Congress      declares that it should be the policy of     the United States to support diplomatic efforts to end the      manipulation of Article IV of the Nuclear Nonproliferation      Treaty, as undertaken by Iran, without undermining the Treaty      itself.

(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be      construed as authorizing the use of force against Iran.     SEC. 402. ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT DEMOCRACY IN IRAN.
