President, the Senate will not be in session until 8:20 p.m. tomorrow because of the Republicans' 1-day issues conference.  Tomorrow is the State of the Union Address and Senators are encouraged to gather in the Senate Chamber at 8:20 p.m. so that we may proceed to the Hall of the House at 8:30 p.m. to hear President Obama's address.  Senators should expect a series of five rollcall votes to begin as early as 10:30 a.m. on Thursday. Those votes will be in relation to the debt limit resolution.  Also, under a previous order, following the series of votes Thursday morning, there will be 1 hour for debate prior to a cloture vote on the Bernanke nomination.  Mr. President, I would like to clarify my unanimous consent request, and that is that there be 1 hour of morning business before the 1 hour of debate closing.
