Mr. Speaker, this is a Democrat bill, I would say to the gentleman from California [Mr. Condit]. I am sure the gentleman is going to ask for a vote, too.  The legislation by the delegate from Guam, H.R. 1460, will change existing Federal law to permit the Government of Guam to elect a delegate by other than separate ballot. The bill, as reported unanimously by the Committee on Resources, is being amended at my urging to continue a crucial program for certain small communities in the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands which were affected by the United States nuclear testing. As the current authorization expires at the end of this fiscal year, it is essential to take action to permit the continuance of this necessary program.  As H.R. 1460 is consistent with increasing local self-government both in Guam and in the small atoll communities in the former U.S.-administered trust territory, and does not result in any adverse budgetary impact, I would urge my colleagues to adopt the measure. This is a good piece of legislation. I congratulate the gentleman from Guam for introducing the legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
