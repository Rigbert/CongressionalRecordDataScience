  Less than a month after the 20th anniversary of the tragic shooting at Columbine High School, another Colorado community was shattered yesterday afternoon. Just miles away, at the STEM School Highlands Ranch, one student has been killed, eight others have been wounded, and many more young lives have been changed forever at the hands of two of their fellow students.  I know the entire Senate joins me in holding the victims of yesterday's shooting, their families, and their entire community in our prayers today.  Our gratitude is with the first responders of Douglas County, whose swift action to engage the shooters saved untold lives.                              Nominations  Madam President, on a completely different matter, as I have been discussing, the Senate is continuing to make better progress in its filling of vacancies in the executive branch and the Federal judiciary. After last month's action to restore a more functional, straightforward system for considering lower level nominations, we have begun the process of clearing the executive calendar backlog that has been left by literally years of partisan obstruction.  This morning, we will vote to confirm three qualified individuals the President nominated for the Export-Import Bank: Kimberley Reed, of West Virginia, to serve as President and Spencer Bachus, of Alabama, and Judith Pryor, of Ohio, to serve on the Board of Directors. Combined, they have spent years waiting for confirmation. Now, thanks to last month's action, we will consider them on the floor this week.  We will also vote to confirm Joseph Bianco, of New York, as U.S. circuit judge for the Second Circuit. Mr. Bianco is a graduate of Georgetown University and of Columbia University School of Law. He has contributed years of distinguished service as an assistant U.S. attorney and now as a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York.
