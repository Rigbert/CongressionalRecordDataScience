Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Utah for his comments and his undertaking the responsibility to make sure this bill passes in a timely fashion. He is one of the good Members of this body and is always there when you need him.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to speak in support of H.R. 5212, as amended, the Veterans' Oral History Project Act. The manager's amendment in my opinion has strengthened an already good bill and I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), certainly the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton) for all their work in getting this legislation to the floor.  This bill directs the American Folklife Center, as the gentleman from Utah said, at the Library of Congress to establish a program to collect video and audio of personal histories and testimonials of America's war veterans.                              {time}  2030  Our war veterans include 19 million men and women who risked their lives so that this bold experiment in democracy could flourish. Their record of valor, courage, and bravery is unmatched in world history.  The numbers of men and women, Mr. Speaker, who have served our Nation is staggering: 4.7 million in World War I; 16.5 million in World War II; 6.8 million in the Korean War; 9.2 million in the Vietnam War; and 3.8 million in the Persian Gulf War. Of these veterans, almost 19 million are still with us today. In my district, there are more than 11,000 military retirees.  Though these numbers are astounding, the veterans' stories and achievements are even more remarkable. Among these 19 million nationwide and 11,000 in Maryland's fifth district are the Doughboys, who broke the German resistance at Meuse-Argonne and forged victory in World War I; the brave paratroopers who jumped behind enemy lines and the courageous soldiers who charged the beaches of Normandy; the men who endured the vicious fighting in the Pacific theater, including five brutal months at Guadalcanal.  These veterans climbed Pork Chop Hill and endured the losses at Heartbreak Ridge in the Korean War, a war, Mr. Speaker, whose 50th anniversary we are honoring this year.  They quietly patrolled the rivers in search for a hidden enemy in the jungles of Vietnam.  These 19 million veterans saw their countrymen fall around them; yet they continued to march forward. They continued to fight, not for their personal glory, but for our freedom. By passing this bill, Mr. Speaker, we allow their firsthand accounts to become part of our Nation's history.  It is imperative that we act soon, tonight. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 572,000 veterans will die this year, including an estimated 1,500 World War II veterans each day, as the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen) pointed out. As we lose these men and women of courage, we also lose their stories of valor and honor. We must make every effort to learn their stories. These remembrances will help not only those interested in America's past; they will guide those who will lead America's future.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate two of our body, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), a Democrat, and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton), a Republican, two distinguished Representatives in this body, who have joined together to make sure that we remember and that generations yet to come will remember.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to ask unanimous consent to yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), a distinguished leader on this legislation, whose efforts, along with those of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Houghton), have resulted in this being on the floor and on the front lobes of our brains tonight, and ask that he be allowed to control this time.
