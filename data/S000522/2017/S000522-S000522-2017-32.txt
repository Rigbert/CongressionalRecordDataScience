I want to thank the distinguished chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee for her kind remarks and again thank her for her leadership for so many years.  I now yield to the gentleman from Arizona, Congressman Andy Biggs. While a new Member of the House, he is a very experienced lawmaker, having served 14 years in the Arizona Legislature.                              {time}  1745
