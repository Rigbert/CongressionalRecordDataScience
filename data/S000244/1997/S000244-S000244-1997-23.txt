Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1903) to amend the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act to enhance the ability of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to improve computer security, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                                H.R. 1903       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Computer Security      Enhancement Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) The National Institute of Standards and Technology has      responsibility for developing standards and guidelines needed      to ensure the cost-effective security and privacy of      sensitive information in Federal computer systems.       (2) The Federal Government has an important role in      ensuring the protection of sensitive, but unclassified,      information controlled by Federal agencies.       (3) Technology that is based on the application of      cryptography exists and can be readily provided by private      sector companies to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity,      and integrity of information associated with public and      private activities.       (4) The development and use of encryption technologies      should be driven by market forces rather than by Government      imposed requirements.       (5) Federal policy for control of the export of encryption      technologies should be determined in light of the public      availability of comparable encryption technologies outside of      the United States in order to avoid harming the      competitiveness of United States computer hardware and      software companies.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) reinforce the role of the National Institute of      Standards and Technology in ensuring the security of      unclassified information in Federal computer systems;       (2) promote technology solutions based on private sector      offerings to protect the security of Federal computer      systems; and       (3) provide the assessment of the capabilities of      information security products incorporating cryptography that      are generally available outside the United States.     SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC KEY MANAGEMENT                    INFRASTRUCTURE.
