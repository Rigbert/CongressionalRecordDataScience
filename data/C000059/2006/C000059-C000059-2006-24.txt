Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the resolution (H. Con. Res. 366) to congratulate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on the 25th anniversary of the first flight of the Space Transportation System, to honor Commander John Young and the Pilot Robert Crippen, who flew Space Shuttle Columbia on April 12-14, 1981, on its first orbital test flight, and to commend the men and women of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and all those supporting America's space program for their accomplishments and their role in inspiring the American people.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 366       Whereas Space Shuttle Columbia was the first manned,      reusable spacecraft that was flown into orbit without benefit      of previous unmanned orbital test flights;       Whereas the Space Shuttle Columbia was the first spacecraft      to launch with wings, using solid rocket boosters;       Whereas the Space Shuttle Columbia was the first reentry      spacecraft to land on a conventional runway;       Whereas the Space Shuttle program has allowed the United      States to partner with other nations to build and to inhabit      the International Space Station;       Whereas the successful return to flight of the Space      Shuttle represents the first leg of the Nation's Vision for      Space Exploration;       Whereas the men and women of America's Space Shuttle      program have been instrumental in ensuring the Nation's      preeminence in space exploration for 25 years;       Whereas the very specialized and highly valued workforce of      the Space Shuttle program will contribute greatly to the      Vision for Space Exploration as we return to the Moon, and go      on to Mars and beyond;       Whereas, like the explorers Lewis and Clark who explored      our great Nation, John Young and Robert Crippen opened a new      era of human exploration beyond our planet; and       Whereas heroes such as John Young and Robert Crippen are a      great inspiration to our next generation of Americans as they      stimulate interest in the study of math and science: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That the Congress--       (1) congratulates the National Aeronautics and Space      Administration on the 25th anniversary of the first flight of      the Space Transportation System;       (2) honors Commander John Young and the Pilot Robert      Crippen, who flew Space Shuttle Columbia on April 12-14,      1981, on its first orbital test flight; and       (3) commends the men and women of the National Aeronautics      and Space Administration and all those supporting America's      space program for their accomplishments and their role in      inspiring the American people.
