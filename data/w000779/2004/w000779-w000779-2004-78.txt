I wish to consult with the chairman and also Senator Allen, but it has always been our intent--and as the prime Senate sponsor of the law back in 1998 it was always my intent--that franchise fees not be affected by the Internet tax moratorium.  As the Senator has correctly noted, I say to the distinguished Senator from Texas, Texas has changed the name of its franchise fee to an access line fee. It was never our intention that franchise fees be affected by the moratorium.  I am very happy to work with the Senator from Texas on it. I will have to consult with the Senator from Virginia, but he has always been very gracious working with our colleagues. The two of us will be consulting with the chairman of the committee. I want to make it clear I am very anxious to accommodate the distinguished Senator from Texas.
