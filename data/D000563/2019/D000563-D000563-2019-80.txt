Also, the State of Illinois is about to embark on a massive $45 billion infrastructure modernization and construction plan. Simply put, these are life-changing achievements. And behind both is Michael Carrigan.  Since 2010, Mike Carrigan has served as the president of the Illinois AFL-CIO, fighting for working families across the State. At the end of the year, Mike is retiring from his decades' long service to Illinois' labor unions and its nearly 900,000 members.  In the fall of 2011, Mike was my guest for then-President Obama's joint session of Congress focusing on the economy. Mike had been an authority on creating jobs and putting people back to work for years so the invitation made perfect sense. And Mike was there to applaud a President he had worked hard to elect.  Michael Carrigan was born in Kankakee, IL, and grew up in Kankakee County. After graduating from MacMurray College in Jacksonville and completing a 4-year apprenticeship in Decatur, he became a journeyman electrician. Mike installed wiring at construction sites for everything from nuclear powerplants to fast-food restaurants. Later, he became the business manager and financial secretary for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 146 in Decatur.  In 1995, Mike ran for the city council in Decatur and won. Four years later, Margaret Blackshere chose Mike to be her running mate in an historic bid for the leadership of the Illinois AFL-CIO. Margaret was the first woman to serve as president of the labor organization, and they were the right people for the jobs at the right time. Under the leadership of Margaret and Mike, the AFL-CIO led the fight to raise the State's minimum wage multiple times, developed infrastructure plans, and strengthened labor union membership in Illinois. They brought together diverse groups and built coalitions to improve the lives of working families in Illinois, from infrastructure to healthcare.  When Margaret stepped away from her post in 2007, Mike seamlessly continued the hard work of leading Illinois AFL-CIO. In 2008, the mayor of Decatur resigned abruptly, and the city council picked Mike to finish the term. Like his work in labor, Mike took to his temporary role with enthusiasm. He served for 10 months, providing steady leadership, before returning full time to the AFL-CIO.  In 2015, a newly elected Republican Governor purposely chose Mike's hometown of Decatur to launch a campaign to break Illinois unions with right to work laws. Mike Carrigan did not back away. Mike fought then-Governor Rauner's efforts to weaken workers' rights in every corner of our State. From courtrooms to the picket line, Mike took the fight to Rauner. In 2018, the voters of Illinois retired Bruce Rauner. Within 6 months, Mike had worked behind the scenes to ensure that State workers had a new contract under our new Governor, J.B. Pritzker.  After 20 years of service to the Illinois AFL-CIO, Mike is retiring. Thanks to his hard work and dedication, the outlook for Illinois labor is bright.  Even in retirement, I know Mike will keep busy and will only be a phone callaway. I look forward to catching another Illini/Mizzou Braggin' Rights basketball game with Mike. And his holiday dinner is a favorite of the season for my wife, Loretta, and me.  I am excited to see what Mike does next and I am proud to call him a friend.
