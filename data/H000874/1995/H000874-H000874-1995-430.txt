Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. [[Page H 6221]]   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman talks about a printing plant. I hope the gentleman has visited that plant. In point of fact, it is in the Internet, it is on the World Net. It, in fact, has the state of the art technology in terms of information transfer available to it. Individuals anywhere in this country can get the Congressional Record and other Government documents in their home and can print it, presuming that they have the proper facilities, as we get it ourselves.  The fact of the matter is, in addition, 80 percent of the GPO's workload is contracted out right now to the private sector. The fact of the matter is there are certain things; namely the Congressional Record and other documents that we need inhouse for security reasons or other reasons.  The gentleman talks about a glide path. Approximately 5,000 employees 3 years ago, down to 4,104. This bill brings them down to 3,900. They are on a glide path, they are reinventing, they are downsizing.  This will cost 20 million additional dollars. The reason being, because it will require RIF's, 554 to be exact if they come down that fast, and there will be a tremendous cost, not a cost savings.  This is a bad amendment, it is not timely, and it will undermine the ability to get the information that this Congress needs in a timely fashion.
