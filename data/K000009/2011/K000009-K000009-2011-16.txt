So I look at the space in these stores, and I thought, I could do this. I could clear one of these aisles. I could consolidate over there. I could provide a place for locally made items, and let the local entrepreneurs compete. But give them a place on the shelf, and don't make them pay these exorbitant fees. It doesn't take an act of Congress for some business innovation in these big box stories. And I am thinking, you know, maybe America in some ways is losing her edge. Because if the CEOs in charge of these retail stores can't be creative enough to figure out how to help us encourage innovation at the local level, what are they getting paid so much for?  I think of all the local food products, all the hand-made sweaters, all of the artwork, all of the pottery that's made locally, the food products that can't get to shelf because they keep them out. Come on, men and women out there in the retail world. Show a little creativity here. We have a lot of innovation at the local level.
