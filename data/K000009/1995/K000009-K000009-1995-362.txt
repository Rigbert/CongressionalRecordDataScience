Speaker, the Republican budget proposal can be summarized as gouging Medicare recipients, nursing home patients, and college students to fund over $300 billion in tax breaks for the privileged few and to increase defense spending. This is not the formula to achieve a balanced budget. What it does is squeeze our middle class to reward those at the high end.

But their budget does nothing to actually reduce the cost of health care in our country. Why not rein in the insurance companies, the doctors, the pharmaceutical companies rather than take it from our seniors? Anyone who has studied the Federal budget over the years knows that the most important factor driving our budget deficit has been increased health cots.  I favor balancing the budget. I have voted for a balanced budget. I fight everyday to cut wasteful spending. The Republicans want to balance the budget on the backs of our grandmothers to turn over nearly $350 billion in tax breaks to the rich and powerful. Instead, why not get rid of the ``Benedict Arnold'' tax break that allows a U.S. citizen who has made his millions here to renounce his citizenship and take his millions to some Caribbean island tax free. To balance the budget, health services are being cut for those who are most in need of our attention: seniors on Medicare, nursing home residents, disabled veterans.                                medicare  The best way to look at the effects of the budget proposal on Medicare recipients is to look at per capita benefits under the program. Republicans argue that there are no cuts in Medicare and that spending increases over the 7 years of their budget. This is a half-truth. Their budget falls far short of keeping benefit levels where they are today. Their future projections do not offset health insurance inflation, rising costs of services, and the 3.5 million more Americans who will reach 65 in the next 7 years. Under their plan even the current level of Medicare benefits will not be maintained into the future. Seniors will end up $3,000 short. This translates into cuts in services, rising out-of-pocket expenses, and higher deductibles and copyaments for every senior in this Nation--no matter how in need they are.  Medicare population increases: 37.0 million--1996; 40.5 million--2002.------------------------------------------------------------------------                         Money                                                                required to     Money                   Additional                        maintain   proposed in    Medicare       cost           Year            current     Republican   short-fall   shifted to                        services      budget     (billions)    seniors                         (billions)   (billions)                each year ------------------------------------------------------------------------1995................        179.0        179.0          0.0        $0.001996................        196.0        168.0         28.0       744.001997................        217.0        180.5         36.5       955.001998................        238.0        191.7         46.3      1196.001999................        262.0        206.1         55.9      1426.002000................        286.0        215.4         70.6      1773.002001................        319.5        218.3        101.2      2523.002002................        353.8        229.0        124.8      3081.00------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Republican budget will ration health care for millions of seniors while other Americans who are better off will not face health care rationing, but they will continue to pay ever higher prices for health care services because the fundamental challenge of health inflation is not solved.  For every senior, this $3081-reduction over current benefits means the average American senior has to make it up, either by increased out-of-pocket payments, reductions in covered services, limitation of physician choice, or reductions in already limited physician or hospital reimbursements.  In regard to Medicaid, the Republican budget cuts Medicaid by $187 billion over the 7 years and shifts the burden of caring for the [[Page E1093]] long-term chronically ill from the Federal Government to the States.  Ohio's Medicaid budget is $5.1 billion in 1995. Nursing home benefits account for $1.9 billion of that budget or 37 percent. The State estimates that Medicaid spending will increase at 8-9 percent a year. If the State has to absorb that increase, it will jeopardize OhioCare. OhioCare is a health care reform plan which would put all current low-income recipients on Medicaid into managed care plans and use the savings to expand Medicaid coverage to working poor families, thereby reducing overall health care costs. In Ohio we are trying to get health care costs under control. The Republican budget does nothing about them, and it may very well sabotage Ohio's efforts.  Who benefits from the $353 billion in tax breaks assumed in this budget? Fifty-one percent of these breaks go to people who earn over $100,000 annually. The most wealthy 1 percent of Americans will get a tax cut of more than $20,000. The poorest 20 percent of Americans will get an average tax cut of $36. Let's look at some of these.  Eliminating the alternative minimum tax by 1999 will cost $16.9 billion--for the first 5 years. The alternative minimum tax requires profitable corporations including many foreign corporations operating in the United States to pay a minimum amount of corporate income tax even if under normal tax rules they can write off all their profits.  Before the 1986 tax reform, highly profitable corporations were able to eliminate their tax liability through various tax loopholes. A 1986 survey found that 130 of America's largest and most profitable corporations managed to pay absolutely nothing in Federal income taxes at least 1 year between 1981 and 1985. Forty-two of these companies paid no taxes at all for all those years. Congress, in 1986, decided that made no sense and established the alternative minimum tax so that profitable corporations doing business in the United States had to pay something, if only a minimal amount, in taxes to our country.  The Republican plan includes a $500 tax credit for children for families with incomes as high as $250,000. A responsible proposal to limit this credit to families making under $95,000 was rejected earlier this year.  Mr. Speaker, over $300 billion in tax breaks in the face of huge budget deficits Americans must pay are irresponsible. Tax breaks that overwhelmingly favor the richest corporations and individuals are wrong. I cannot support them.  We must get on track to a balanced budget first before we consider tax cuts.  The Republican budget changes the cost of living calculation for Social Security benefits, in effect lowering the cost of living by 0.6 percent. This will reduce the average Social Security benefit by an estimated $240 a month by 2002. Their budget commits us to tax cuts for the wealthy while cutting essential income for seniors. I can't countenance that.  The Republican budget would make student loan recipients pay interest on their loan while attending school. This will increase the average student's indebtedness by $3,400. Over the life of the loan the student would pay an extra $41 a month, $5,000 in all. The cut would amount to $18.7 billion over 7 years. How can anyone justify making it more difficult to get a higher education in our country as we enter a new century which will be characterized by increased international economic competition? I ask you, are the Japanese or the Germans making it harder for their children to get the education they need?  Mr. Speaker, I cannot support this Republican budget proposal. It's anti-family at its core. It is ironic that some Members of Congress, who earn over $130,000 a year, may think that a budget which gives a $20,000 tax break to the richest 1 percent of Americans and pays for it by reducing health benefits for our grandmother is good for the country. I don't and I won't vote for it.                          ____________________
