 President, the debate we are now having is an extraordinarily important debate; in fact, it will be one of the most important votes we will be casting this year.  This vote is about whether we stand with the American people, millions of whom are having a very difficult time paying their prescription drug bills or whether we stand with the most powerful and greedy lobby on Capitol Hill, and that is the pharmaceutical industry which has spent extraordinary sums of money to make sure the American people pay outrageously high prices for the medicine they desperately need.  I wish to briefly examine a chart which talks about the very high profit margin of the pharmaceutical industry. One of the reasons why the pharmaceutical industry can spend so much money on lobbying, on campaign contributions, on advertising is because of the profits they make year after year.  In 2004, drug companies ranked as the third most profitable industry in the United States with a 15.8-percent profit margin, which is about three times higher than the profitability of a median Fortune 500 company, which is at about 5.3 percent. This is in 2004. This comes from the Kaiser Foundation.  What we can also see, and what this chart tells us, is the extraordinary profits the drug companies are making from particular drugs. Epogen is the drug. Amgen is the company with profits of $2.5 billion. Taxol is the drug; the firm is Bristol-Myers Squibb, $2.1 billion for one drug, and on it goes. They are profitable year after year. The pharmaceutical industry continues to be one of the most profitable industries in this country.  I have another chart. One of the issues I look forward to discussing with Members of the Senate is the fact that as taxpayers in our country, we contribute billions and billions of dollars to the National Institutes of Health, the universities, the foundations for the very noble and important purpose all of us support: to create drugs that will address the major illnesses facing us, whether it is cancer, diabetes, AIDS, whatever it may be. We have spent billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars in a sense subsidizing the drug companies and, in fact, taxpayers do not get any reasonable price returns from them. We just give them the money.  Here is an example. Taxol is a very important and widely used medicine. According to a 2003 GAO report, the NIH spent $484 million on research for Taxol, Bristol-Myers Squibb spent $1 billion and subsequently earned $9 billion in profits.  In other words, American taxpayers are paying twice: once in the form of underwriting pharmaceutical research and the second time in the form of monopoly prices.  When we talk about the drug companies, we should also deal with the issue they often bring up. PhRMA is a very powerful lobbying group, the most powerful trade group on Capitol Hill. What they tell us is they need these veryhigh prices, they need all of the taxpayers' money because they are putting all of that into research and development. Don't we all want new drugs for diabetes, cancer, AIDS, and a dozen other terrible illnesses? This chart tells us something a little bit different.  This chart tells us the pharmaceutical industry spends far more for marketing--and goodness knows we have seen their ads on television over and over again, and guess who is paying for those ads. We are, in terms of high prices for the drugs, far more for marketing than for research and development.  Let me get back to the thrust of what this debate is all about, and let me be very clear. As I mentioned a little while ago, the Cochran amendment is a poison pill. If anyone is serious about prescription drug reimportation, if people are serious about lowering the cost of prescription drugs from 25 to 50 percent, if people are serious about standing up for consumers in this country, they will vote against the Cochran amendment.  So that no Senator has any doubt about what is going on, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Statement of Administration Policy, dated May 1, 2007, from the President's office, and I will quote from the bottom of page 2, where there it is in black and white. This is a two-page letter. It says:       As a result, if any such importation provision were      included in the final version of the bill presented to the      President, the President's senior advisers would recommend      that he veto the bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2007.                   Statement of Administration Policy        S. 1082--Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act                         (Sen. Kennedy (D) MA)       The Administration strongly supports reauthorization of the      Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and the Medical Device      User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA). These two programs      account for nearly one quarter of the Food and Drug      Administration's (FDA) annual budget and support more than      two thousand Agency employees who work diligently to ensure      the safety and efficacy of the medical products on which the      American people rely. Reauthorizing PDUFA and MDUFMA will      enhance FDA's ability to more efficiently and effectively      regulate drugs, biological products, and medical devices, a      critical component of the Agency's public health mission.      Additionally, the Administration is committed to      reauthorizing the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act      (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), which      have provided invaluable information to the Agency about      medical products' interaction with pediatric populations.       The Administration shares the goal of S. 1082 to provide      FDA with the appropriate tools and resources to enhance the      safety and efficacy of the products the agency regulates.      However, the Administration has serious concerns with S. 1082      in its current form and will work with Congress to address      them as the legislative process moves forward.       The Administration appreciates that portions of S. 1082 are      consistent with the Administration's recommendations for      reauthorization, which strengthen FDA's ability to ensure the      safety and availability of new drugs and medical devices,      create a new program for review of television advertisements,      and strengthen post-market review. These user fee programs      expire at the end of the current fiscal year, and their      timely reauthorization is critical to the ability of FDA to      continue to carefully and expeditiously review and approve      new drugs and devices to benefit the health of the American      people.       The Administration is committed to further improving drug      safety through better tools for surveillance of drug events,      improved scientific tools for evaluating drug safety      problems, and better means of communicating drug safety      problems to providers and patients. However, the      Administration is concerned that the bill, as written, would      require significant resources to implement burdensome process      changes that will not contribute meaningfully to improving      drug safety. For example, the prescriptive timeframes to      develop and process Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies      are particularly burdensome and are not likely to contribute      to improving drug safety. Additionally, the Administration is      concerned about the provision in S. 1082 that would use      increased user fees to fund certain additional drug safety      activities that were not agreed to during the statutorily      required Agency-industry negotiations. This provision reopens      and is inconsistent with the Administration PDUFA proposal      that was developed through extensive consultation.       There are other provisions in S. 1082 that also raise      serious concerns. Specifically, the bill would make changes      to the BPCA and PREA to reduce the incentives to conduct      clinical trials for children, thus reducing the effectiveness      of the program. It also would impose administrative burdens      that would make the programs inefficient and in many ways      unworkable. These provisions would reduce the flexibility the      agency needs to conduct these programs, require an      inefficient duplication of scientific expertise, and cause      delays in the review of pediatric assessments. Both BPCA and      PREA have been very successful in providing the necessary      incentives for drug companies to conduct pediatric clinical      trials to improve our understanding of how drugs work in      children, thus enhancing the quality of their medical care.      BPCA and PREA should be extended without modification.     Potential Amendments: Follow-on Protein Products and          Importation of Prescription Drugs       The Administration supports the goal of making safe and      effective drugs available and affordable for American      consumers. While some in Congress may be interested in      attaching legislation related to follow-on protein products      to this bill, the Administration believes that these complex      issues should be considered thoroughly through a robust      scientific, regulatory, and legal discussion. Sufficient      discussion has not yet occurred and should not be abbreviated      for the convenience of a particular legislative vehicle. Any      legislative proposal considered to authorize a regulatory      pathway for follow-on protein products must, as a first      priority, ensure the safety and efficacy of the resulting      products, thus protecting patient safety. Furthermore, it      should also include adequate intellectual property      protections for innovators, in order to maintain the research      enterprise that has generated life-saving medications. The      Administration believes further discussion must take place      before addressing these issues in legislation. The      Administration strongly opposes the inclusion in this bill of      any provision related to follow-on protein products.       The Administration would also strongly oppose any provision      that might be added on the Senate Floor regarding the      importation of prescription drugs that does not address the      serious safety concerns identified in the December 2004      Department of Health and Human Services Task Force Report on      Prescription Drug Importation. The Administration believes      that allowing importation of drugs outside the current safety      system established by the FDA without addressing these      serious safety concerns would threaten public health and      result in unsafe, unapproved, and counterfeit drugs being      imported into the United States. As a result, if any such      importation provision were included in the final version of      the bill presented to the President, the President's senior      advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.       The Administration strongly opposes the inclusion of any      unrelated provisions that would disrupt the timely      reauthorization of the user fee program. The Administration      looks forward to working with Congress to reauthorize PDUFA      and MDUFMA expeditiously to avoid any disruptions to these      successful programs.
