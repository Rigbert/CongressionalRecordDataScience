President, this year the waiting list for organ transplants among Americans stands at more than 75,000. I rise to urge all Senators, and all Americans to become organ donors. I rise to introduce legislation to make it easier for individuals to donate and make it simpler to identify the decedents's donation wishes. I am pleased that Senators Collins, Biden, Clinton, Feingold, Feinstein, Johnson, and Inouye join me in this effort.  Access to organ transplantation remains limited by the shortage of donated organs. Each day, an average of17 people on the waiting list will die. And the waiting list is growing. In fact, since 1990 the number of men, women and children awaiting life-saving transplants has grown by at least 10 percent easy year. We need to move expeditiously to reduce these deaths due to the scarcity of willing organ donors. Every 14 minutes we do not act, another name is added to the national transplant waiting list.  Over the last several years, I have worked with many of my colleagues on a variety of initiatives to increase organ donation. In 1996, I authored legislation to include an organ donation card with every Federal income tax refund mailed. More than 70 million donor cards were mailed, the largest distribution in history. In 1997, I authored a provision in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriation bill that authorized a study of hospital best practices for increasing organ donation. More recently, I launched a campaign known as ``Give Thanks, Give Life'' with the National Football League and a large coalition of advocacy organizations to promote family discussions over Thanksgiving of family members' desire to become organ donors.  But we need to do more. Major barriers to donation still exist. A recent analysis by the Lewin Group, Inc., found low rates of family consent to donation. In addition, there are many missed opportunities in the process of identifying and referring all potential donors to procurement organizations so that families may be approached. A 1996 study of potential organ donors in hospitals found that in nearly a third of all cases, potential donors were not identified or no request was made to the family.  Today I am introducing a comprehensive proposal to address these obstacles, including a number of new initiatives. The DONATE Act: 1. Establishes a national organ and tissue donor registry resource center at the Department of Health and Human Services; 2. Authorizes grants to States to support the development, enhancement, expansion and evaluation of statewide organ and tissue donor registries; 3. Funds additional research to learn more about effective strategies that increase donation rates; 4. Provides financial assistance to donors for travel and subsistence expenses incurred toward making living donations of their organs; 5. Expands Federal efforts to educate the public about organ donation and improve outreach activities; 6. Provides grants to hospitals and organ procurement organizations to fund organ coordinators; and 7. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to strike a bronze medal to commemorate organ donors and their families.  Organ and tissue donor registries have the potential to greatly improve donation rates. Registries provide medical and/or procurement personnel easy access to the donation wishes of brain-dead patients. By indicating the potential donors wishes to the family, a registry documentation can aid in securing next of kin consent. Despite the fact that 85 percent of Americans support organ donation for transplants, studies indicate that only about 50 percent of families consent to donation. Well-designed databases can improve coordination between hospitals, physicians, organ procurement organizations and families. Registries can also assist in evaluating education and outreach efforts by providing information about registrant demographics and audience-specific effectiveness of awareness campaigns. Yet currently only about a dozen States operate mature, centralized organ and tissue donor registries.  I am proud that the State of Illinois was one of the first and is currently the largest such system. In Illinois, individuals can indicate their willingness to donate by signing their drivers license. Drivers' license applicants are also asked if they wish to have their name listed on the confidential statewide registry. In addition to signing up at a driver services facility, persons can join the registry by calling an eight hundred number or electronically via the web. More than 3 million Illinoisans have already joined and 100,000 more sign up each month. Today, participation in the Illinois Donor Registry is 39 percent statewide, an increase of 77 percent since 1993. In addition, about one fifth of all facilities are reporting participation rates at or above 50 percent. Most importantly, organ donation has risen 40 percent since 1993 and the Regional Organ Bank of Illinois has led the nation in the number of organs recovered for transplantation since 1994.  But unfortunately Illinois is the exception and not the rule. Most States do not have programs and gaps in knowledge exist. In fact, no one kept track of which States operate organ donor registries until recently. We have little information about what works best when developing registries. Guidance for States about the basic components of effective systems such as the core functions and content, legal and ethical standards, privacy protections and data exchange protocols, is scarce.  And in addition to the fact that most States do not operate registries, among those who do, currently no mechanism exists to share information between these registries. So if a Illinoisan dies in Wisconsin, law enforcement or hospital officials in Wisconsin have no easy way of knowing of the victims intent to donate. To be effective, registries need to be accessible to the proper authorities around the clock without regard for State boundaries. To be effective, registries also need to function as an advance directive, ensuring that the donors wishes are honored.  The DONATE Act both funds State registry development and creates the technical expertise States need to do so. The bill establishes a National Organ and Tissue Donation Resource Center, informed by a task force of national experts, to develop registry guidelines for States based on best practices. The Center would maintain a donor registry clearinghouse, including a web site, to collect, synthesize, and distribute information about what works. The proposal also requires that a mechanism be established to link State registries and to provide around-the-clock access to information. To help ensure that registry development is based on evidence of effectiveness and best practices, and to help us understand better how to utilize the registry tool to increase donations, the DONATE Act asks an advisory task force to examine state registries and make recommendations to Congress about the states of such systems and ways to develop linkages between state registries.  Public education is equally as important as developing better technical tools and programs to increase donation if we are to do a better job of matching the number of donors to people in need of a transplant. The DONATE Act launches a national effort to raise public awareness about the importance of organ donation and funds research to find better ways to improve donation rates. The bill authorizes State grants for innovative organ donor awareness and outreach initiatives and programs aimed at increasing donation.  A number of additional innovative initiatives are included in this bill. The DONATE Act would directly assist living donors, providing financial assistance to offset travel, subsistence and other expenses incurred toward making living donations of their organs. Similar provisions recently cleared the House of Representatives by more than 400 votes. The DONATE Act includes the House passed bill, with a number of improvements. For example, the Act does not restrict such assistance to artificial residency requirements and it does not limit assistance only to those who donate organs to low income recipients.  The DONATE Act also provides grants to hospitals and organ procurement organizations to fund staff positions for organ coordinators. These in-house organ coordinators would be responsible for coordinating organ donation and recovery at a hospital or a group of hospitals. Research has shown that these types of initiatives can have dramatic results. A four-year retrospective study of a large public hospital in Houston that implemented a coordinator program resulted in a 64 percent increase in the consent rate along with a 94 percent increase in the number of organ donors.  Finally, the DONATE Act incorporates a valuable initiative developed by Senator Bill Frist to present donors or the family of a donor with a Congressional medal recognizing their gift of life. The bronze medal is justone small, meaningful way we can acknowledge the important act of donating to save another person's life.  A great deal of input from experts, and from my colleagues as well, contributed to this legislation. All of these important provisions come with the strong support and input of many groups whose mission it is to help save lives by increasing organ donation, including the American Liver Foundation, the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons. I strongly believe that this type of concrete investment and commitment from the Federal government is overdue and will make a real difference. And in this case a real difference is someone's life.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to wipe out the waiting list for transplants. I urge you all to cosponsor the DONATE Act and move expeditiously to pass this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
