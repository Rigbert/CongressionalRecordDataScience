Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise courageous fire fighters in the City of Atlanta.  On Monday afternoon, members of the Atlanta City Fire Department fought a raging fire through the historic Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill in southeast Atlanta. Mr. Ivers Sims was trapped on a crane 220 feet in the air. As I watched this human drama unfold from my office, my heart stopped.  Demonstrating extraordinary courage and skill, fire fighter Matt Moseley lifted Mr. Sims from his dangerous perch like angels from the heavens. They saved his life. This brilliant rescue has made the City of Atlanta, the State of Georgia, and our Nation proud.  The fire fighters and Mr. Sims have my profound respect for their raw courage and extraordinary calm and determination under the most dangerous of circumstances.  Mr. Speaker, let me take this opportunity to praise fire fighters throughout the Nation who put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities.                          ____________________
