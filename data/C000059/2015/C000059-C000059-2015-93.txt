 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment. This amendment is consistent with policy agreed to last year in the conference on a bipartisan basis. Fishing is a national pastime, to which the national fish hatchery plays an important role.  Therefore, I support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I urge an ``aye'' vote.
