 President, I rise today with Senator Hutchison to introduce legislation to reauthorize the extraordinarily successful Breast Cancer Research Stamp for 4 additional years.  Without Congressional action, this important stamp will expire on December 31 of this year.  This stamp deserves to be extended as it has proven to be highly effective.  Since 1998, over 907 million breast cancer research stamps have been sold--raising over $72 million for breast cancer research.  Furthermore, in October 2007, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, released a report showing that the Breast Cancer Research Stamp has been a success and an effective fund-raiser in the effort to increase funds to fight the disease.  The National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Department of Defense have received approximately $50.4 million and $21.6 million, respectively, putting these research dollars to good use by funding innovative advances in breast cancer research.  For example, in 2006, NIH began funding the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment Program, TAILORx, with proceeds from the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. The trial is designed to determine which patients with early stage breast cancer would be more likely to benefit from chemotherapy and, therefore, reduce the use of chemotherapy in those patients who are unlikely to benefit. The goal of TAILORx is to determine the most effective current approach to cancer treatment, with the fewest side effects, for women with early-stage breast cancer by using a validated diagnostic test.  Thanks to breakthroughs in cancer research, more and more people are becoming cancer survivors rather than cancer victims. Every dollar we continue to raise will help save lives.  One cannot calculate in dollars and cents how the stamp has focused public awareness on this terrible disease and the need for additional research funding.  There is still so much more to do because this disease has far reaching effects on our Nation.  Breast cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among women after skin cancer.  More than 2.5 million women in the U.S. are living with breast cancer today.  Over 200,000 women have been diagnosed with cancer in each of the past few years, and will be diagnosed in the coming year.  Though male breast cancer is much less common, 1,970 men were diagnosed with breast cancer last year.  This legislation would extend the authorization of the Breast Cancer Research stamp for 4 additional years--until December 31, 2015.  It also will allow the stamp to continue to have a surcharge above the value of a first-class stamp with the surplus revenues going to breast cancer research.  It will not affect any other semi-postal proposals under consideration by the U.S. Postal Service.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Hutchison in passing this important legislation to extend the Breast Cancer Research Stamp for another 4 years.  Until a cure is found, the money from the sale of this unique postal stamp will continue to focus public awareness on this devastating disease and provide hope to breast cancer survivors.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 384       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Section 414(h) of title 39, United States Code, is amended      by striking ``2011'' and inserting ``2015''.                                 ______                                       By
