Make no mistake, what Senator Wellstone is proposing before this Senate is the other side of the argument of the Senator from Alabama. The Senator from Alabama came before us and basically said, even though we are not talking about any Federal dollars here, even though we are not talking about any action in any Federal court, we as a Federal legislature will dictate to the State of Minnesota, the State of Illinois, I suppose even the State of Alabama that they cannot enter into an agreement with any attorneys to proceed with tobacco litigation unless it meets the Federal guidelines proposed by the Senator from Alabama.  Well, I am sorry, but I do not believe that that is our responsibility. I think it goes beyond our constitutional responsibility. I think what the Senator from Minnesota has offered is reasonable. How can we ever presume to judge what are the appropriate attorneys' fees and arrangements in a State like Minnesota where Attorney General Humphrey has probably gone to greater lengths than any attorney general in the United States bringing these documents together, filing a creative lawsuit, being assertive, making certain that the people of Minnesota are represented. For any Senator from Illinois, Alabama or anywhere to stand up and say, I am sorry, Minnesota, this is not yours to decide, this is to be decided by the Federal Congress, even though there is no Federal money, no Federal court. We are dealing in State courts, we are dealing with tobacco companies making payments. I think it is entirely presumptuous for us to go along with the premise that we in theSenate will decide attorneys' fees case by case and State by State.  I stand in support of the Senator from Minnesota.
