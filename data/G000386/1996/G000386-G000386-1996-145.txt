 President, we have accomplished many things this Congress. Just this week we passed a comprehensive welfare reform proposal which will end welfare as we know it. We passed a meaningful small business tax relief bill. And, we will pass a momentous health insurance reform bill that will improve the availability and portability of health insurance coverage.  I would like to point out another opportunity Congress has to pass a significant reform proposal and that is the Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act. I hope we can consider this bill when we return in September.  The Senate Labor Committee has spent a considerable amount of time on this comprehensive piece of legislation. And, let me point out, this reform proposal passed out of committee on an 11 to 4 vote.  The commonsense proposals in this bill are designed to strengthen the agency's ability to ensure that safe and effective new medicines are made available to patients without delay by eliminating redtape and streamlining operations.  The FDA is designed to achieve the goal of ensuring a safe and efficient approval process. And, the FDA has been concerned to protect the public from unsafe drugs.  But, it is time to ensure that the agency becomes equally concerned about promoting public health by making safe and effective new therapies available to patients as soon as possible. Patients can be harmed by delay in approving safe and effective new medicines just as they can by the approval of unsafe new medicines.  I urge the majority leader to consider this legislation in a timely enough matter so that we can send it to the President and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial by Senators Kassebaum and Mikulski in support of this piece of legislation.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 1996]                        The FDA Can Work Better                (ByBarbara Mikulski and Nancy Kassebaum)       The Post's July 17 editorial ``Reform Isn't Risk-Free''      continues the drumbeat of negative commentary on our efforts      and the efforts of a bipartisan group of our colleagues on      the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee to achieve      meaningful reform of the Food and Drug Administration.       At the outset, we would make the point that a failure to      make needed reforms is by no means a risk-free proposition.      Inaction and delay victimize just as surely as the wrong      action. We hear constantly about the deformities prevented in      the early 1960s by the agency's not approving thalidomide.      Rarely, however, is a word spoken about the cases of spina      bifida that could have been averted had the FDA not delayed      for years in permitting health claims to be made about the      benefits of folic acid in preventing such neural tube      disorders.       As the 1989 ``Edwards Commission'' report put it: ``The      agency should be guided by the principle that expeditious      approval of useful and safe new products enhances the health      of the American people. Approving such products can be as      important as preventing the marketing of harmful or      ineffective products.'' The Edwards Commission was but one of      a series of distinguished panels convened during the past two      decades that have urged FDA reform.       During the year-long process in which our legislation was      developed, we drew heavily from the work on these expert      panels. Contrary to The Post's suggestion that we are rushing      a poorly though-out piece of legislation to the Senate floor,      we believe that this bill embodies the best thinking on this      topic produced over years and years of study.       Moreover, we have drawn as well from the successful      experience of the FDA in expediting approval of AIDS drugs      without jeopardizing safety and effectiveness. In response to      sustained pressure from the AIDS community, the agency      demonstrated that it could, in fact, change its culture and      its procedures to implement reforms it had resisted for      years.       Unfortunately, this experience has not been regarded as a      foundation upon which to build further improvements but,      rather, has been seized upon as ``proof'' that further      changes are unnecessary. Scientific methods and technology      have changed dramatically since the thalidomide incident,      while regulatory structures have barely bulged. Applications      for the approval of new drugs typically run to hundreds of      thousands of pages.       An incentive is growing for U.S. companies to move      research, development and production abroad, threatening our      nation's continued world leadership in new product      development, costing American jobs and further delaying      the public's access to important new products.       It is disconcerting to us that our efforts are being      regarded as a ``hostile takeover'' of the agency, as opposed      to the sincere effort it is to enhance the professionalism,      stature and effectiveness of the agency. The bill maintains      the FDA firmly in the driver's seat; it does not turn over      all the regulatory power to the private sector, as critics      have charged inaccurately. It encourages cooperation from the      very beginning of the process so that costly delays can be      avoided at the end of the road.       It is perhaps even more disconcerting to hear critics of      our efforts suggest that we are willing to put people's lives      at risk in order to collect large campaign contributions from      the drug industry.       The strong bipartisan vote in the Senate Labor and Human      Resources Committee reflects the desire of Republicans and      Democrats alike to make the FDA work better for all      Americans. We have reached out to the administration, and we      are more than willing to make constructive changes in the      legislation as reported by the committee. We are not,      however, willing to tolerate endless rationalizations as to      why the status quo should be maintained. Our goal is to      maintain these core principles: streamline and clarify the      regulatory process while maintaining safety and efficacy.       Our determination to move forward is fueled by the plight      of countless individuals who have contacted us over the years      to request assistance in speeding the FDA's evaluation of new      therapies that hold promise for treating serious illnesses,      such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple      sclerosis and cancer. For these individuals, the real risk is      not that we will act in haste, but rather that we will fail      to act at all.       Barbara Mikulski is a Democratic senator from Maryland.
