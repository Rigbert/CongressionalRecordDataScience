 President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we expect the group that has been working on a compromise on the hard money contribution limit to come back to the floor at some point in the next hour or so. Rather than sit around and churn, it is agreeable to both sides for Senator DeWine, who will have the next amendment after we finish the disposition of the Thompson and Feinstein matter, to go on and lay his amendment down, which he can set aside when those involved in the discussions come back to the floor. He can lay down his amendment and begin the discussion. I believe that is all right with the Senator from Connecticut.
