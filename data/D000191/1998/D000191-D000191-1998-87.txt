         Tragedy At Thurston High School In Springfield, Oregon  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, a tragic event has occurred in my congressional district, in my hometown; and I am requesting a leave of absence for Friday and the balance of the week, as the eyes of the country turn toward my hometown of Springfield where, early this morning, a number of students at Thurston High School were shot by a fellow student.  Our hearts and prayers go out to the victims and their families. At this time, many, many questions remain about the circumstances of this horrible tragedy. But what we do know is that a terrible tragedy has occurred. I need to return to Oregon to be with my family and my community in this time of sorrow.
