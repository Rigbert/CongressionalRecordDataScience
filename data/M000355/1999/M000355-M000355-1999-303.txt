 President, the senior Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Bob Smith, introduced a ruleschange which I, as chairman of the Rules Committee, am happy to cosponsor. I commend our colleague, Senator Bob Smith, for an excellent and outstanding idea.  Since 1892, Americans have expressed their reverence for the flag of this Nation and all it represents by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge was first recited at the 1892 World's Fair to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of America. Since that time, hundreds and thousands of civic organizations and schoolchildren have taken time before turning to their work to recite these moving words:       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of      America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation      under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.  Mr. President, I can remember as a schoolchild in Athens, Alabama, standing at my desk, placing my hand over my heart, fixing my eyes upon the flag, and reciting these eloquent words. I suspect many of our colleagues here in the Senate had the same experience in school as they were growing up.  Even at that early age, pledging allegiance to the flag encouraged me to think about the history and ideals of this Nation. It was an important ritual for schoolchildren then. It should be an important ritual for the Senate now.  Presently, we begin each day's business here in the Senate with a prayer. This solemn act reminds us of certain principles and values that we as a people hold dear. Similarly, daily recitation of the pledge would serve as an inspirational start to each legislative day.  The pledge is a time for reflecting on the inspiring history and ideals of liberty and freedom that the Stars and Stripes represents. Setting aside this time each day will serve to remind Americans of the venerated place the flag holds in our country and our culture.  Mr. President, among my most prized possessions is the American flag which honored, as he was laid to rest, my father's service to our Nation. That flag rests proudly on the marble mantel in my Senate office.  A clinical assessment of that flag would conclude that it is some mixture of cotton fabric, dyed red, white, and blue. But for me, it harkens back to the selfless patriotism of a father who fought for his Nation during World War II, a father who instilled in his son an awe and abiding respect for this great Nation we are all so fortunate to call home.  Old Glory has been a beacon of hope for over 200 years, a touchstone for patriotic Americans, and a source of comfort and pride for individuals at home and abroad. In the words of Senator Charles Sumner, ``In a foreign land, the flag is companionship, and country itself, with all its endearments.''  The flag is, without question, a powerful symbol the world over. For nearly every American, it is the most powerful patriotic inspiration.  It is my distinct honor today to cosponsor this resolution as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee. I also want to commend my good friend from New Hampshire, Senator Bob Smith, for an excellent idea and for his leadership on this issue. The Senate should promptly pass this resolution to begin every day in the Senate Chamber with the pledge of allegiance to our flag and to the Republic for which it stands, the Republic to which we have dedicated ourselves as Senators.                          ____________________
