It is another success story for the pharmaceutical industry because they bring the drugs to market, brand name drugs, under patent, and during a period of time they have a right to sell them exclusively in America. But when that patent runs out, then other companies can make that same drug and sell it, usually at a much lower cost. So the pharmaceutical companies that make the brand-name drugs found ways to delay the process so that the generic drugs could not replace the brand-name drugs, so they could continue to make millions and millions of dollars off the brand-name drugs even when their patents expired. We changed that in the Senate.  We put in language that said we are going to move toward generic drugs so consumers can have affordable drugs. And, frankly, in conference committee, the pharmaceutical companies won again, another reason they are running ads about this Senator and the Senator from Maryland saying vote for this bill right now, because they know it means more money to an industry that is already the most profitable industry in America.
