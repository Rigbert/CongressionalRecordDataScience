 President, today I would like to make you aware of five individuals who were recently recognized at the Central Vermont Community Action Council's annual meeting.  Sergio Colon moved to White River Junction with his two adopted sons after his community in Port Charlotte, FL, was devastated by Hurricane Charlie in 2004. A single father working hard to make ends meet, Sergio at onepoint was forced to move his family to a homeless shelter in Vermont. Yet, even while his family relied on social services to get by, he volunteered for multiple organizations just as he had always done in Florida. Sergio has since returned to college to work on his psychology degree and is currently looking for a job in human services so he can continue to help people who are struggling.  Borgi von Trapp has been a leader in her community for many years. In 1993, Borgi, a mother of six children, founded Children First, an organization devoted to designing and implementing creative educational environments for children. A year later, she helped develop the Mad River Green Farmers' Market, a successful incubator for locally owned, innovative, healthy, and creative businesses. Since then it has grown to include more than 50 full time vendors and over 12,000 customers per season. Borgi is a model of community leadership and creative learning.  Sherrie Pomainville was a single mother for 22 years, raising four children on a minimum-wage salary. She knew the value of education and worked to obtain it. With the help of the Reach Up Program, she was one of the first clients to successfully complete the postsecondary Education program and earn a bachelor's degree in social work. In 2002, Sherrie graduated cum laude and was on the National Association for Social Workers Board for 3 years. This has allowed her to make a better life for herself and her children, while at the same time giving back to the community that helped her. She currently works for various community organizations in southwestern Vermont.  Jessica Kelley has been actively involved as a parent volunteer in Head Start and an important advocate for children and families in her community. She has served on the Head Start Policy Council for the past 2 years and last year was elected the parent representative of the Vermont Head Start Association. In this role, Jessica attends statewide meetings and participates in policy discussions and initiatives, such as parent leadership, Head Start reauthorization, and No Child Left Behind legislation.  Lydia Chartier is a tireless community leader in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. Presently, she donates most of her time to Lincoln Center Child Care, where she uses her own vast experience to assist support staff and other volunteers. She also serves as an invaluable resource to the Lincoln Center's staff. In addition, Lydia volunteers at her church, her son's school, and on many other community projects. If there is a good community event happening, there can be little doubt that Lydia is aware of it and promoting it. But most of all, Lydia is dedicated to ending poverty and doing whatever it takes to help those in need.  The quality of life in Vermont, and in our Nation, is strengthened by individuals like these five community leaders, men and women who work to improve our communities and who strive to give back to the places in which they live. I commend their great contributions and the contributions of many like them across the nation to our American society.                          ____________________
