President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to Steve Arms, a technology inventor, innovator, and successful entrepreneur from Vermont.  Steve founded and developed a high tech firm, MicroStrain, which creates sophisticated micro sensors that were originally designed for arthroscopic implantation on human knee ligaments. Their sensors have since evolved and are now used by NASA, on car engines, for advanced manufacturing, on civil structures, and by the U.S. military.  When Philadelphia's Liberty Bell needed to be moved in 2003, the National Park Service used MicroStrain to detect whether the 250-year-old bell's famous crack was worsening, even by a hundredth of a hair's width. Fortunately, and thanks to MicroStrain's sensors, the Liberty Bell was moved without damage.  A product of Vermont's public education system and flagship state university, Steve grew a one-man businessbased out of his Burlington apartment into a more than $12 million a year company. Based in Williston, VT, and now employing 55 people, MicroStrain's constant innovation and product improvement has earned the company numerous top awards in the industry.  I am proud to see to see Vermonters working on cutting-edge technology that will benefit both Vermont's and the country's economy. I thank Steve and all of the employees at MicroStrain for their hard work.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the recent Burlington Free Press article entitled Vt. Tech innovator: Be in the moment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Nov. 2, 2011]                  Vt. Tech Innovator: Be in the Moment                            (By Molly Walsh)       Williston.--Back in high school, Steve Arms thought he      might want to be a journalist. He'd grown up reading non-stop      and often sneaked books and a flashlight under the covers      when he was supposed to be asleep.       He changed direction shortly before graduating from      Burlington High School in 1977. During his junior and senior      years, a math teacher and a physics teacher ignited a fuse      that prompted Arms to become an engineer, inventor and      successful tech entrepreneur who runs a Vermont company with      55 employees and gross sales of $12.8 million in 2010.       ``I have a dream job. I can't believe I get paid to do      this,'' Arms said during an interview at MicroStrain, the      sensor company he founded and leads in Williston.       The company designs and sells tiny, highly sophisticated      sensors used in U.S. military drones, NASA rocket tests,      tracking devices and a range of industrial and medical      products. Arms founded the company when he was a Ph.D.      candidate at the University of Vermont, where he studied      engineering and biomechanics. His first product was a mini-     sensor used in arthroscopic knee surgeries that he began      selling after writing the federal grant to help fund the      development himself.       In the early days at his company, Arms typed up the      invoices, answered the phone and hustled sales in addition to      designing products. He slowly grew the company and says a      careful, conservative approach to expansion--no outside      investors and a pay-as-you go approach as much as possible--     allowed the business to thrive and continue developing      cutting-edge products as requested by various customers.      Because there were no outside money people demanding quick      growth, Arms and his staff had the time to try, fail and      retry new product design--in other words, innovate.       Now much of the work is solving problems for clients and      continuously pushing for new designs--and that's what science      education should teach as well, Arms said. Schools that help      young people use science and math to find solutions--whether      it's flood prevention or saving the rain forest--are on the      right track. ``Kids are amazingly creative and they really      want to make the world a better place,'' Arms said.       It can take MicroStrain up to a year to find certain      employees and the company regularly recruits out of state.      But many employees are Vermonters or returning Vermonters.      And Arms has had great success with summer internship      programs for college students, many of whom are studying      electrical engineering at local colleges and out-of-state      schools such as Clarkson, Stanford and MIT. Some interns      spend three summers at the company before they graduate.      MicroStrain regularly hires from the intern pool because the      interns are up to speed on the work and because they've      basically succeeded during an extended job interview.       As a student, Arms responded to teachers who were well      organized, animated and happy to let a curious student run      with questions. His foray into bioengineering happened      largely because his UVM work study job put him in a      department full of doctors and medical researchers. He loved      talking to them and soon was writing grants as part of his      job--a skill that came in handy when it was time for Arms to      found MicroStrain.       His advice for students is similar to what he gives his      three children, including a son at Reed College and twin      daughters at Champlain Valley Union High School. Arms was      never a grind who obsessed over getting As in everything and      he left some homework undone. He worked, but not obsessively.      One thing he did learn was to follow his interests and be      efficient--by paying attention in class, for example. ``Be in      the moment. . . . Make the most of your time when you are      there.''       Schools could help inspire a love of science by making it      real, he added. Simple props--chalk and a two-by-four, a      bicycle wheel--are great ways to teach calculus, physics and      other STEM topics. Computers are can be useful tools but they      do not guarantee engagement in class, he said.       Bringing speakers from STEM employers is another way to      reach students, as is career mentoring. Arms still remembers      the conversation he had with Sir John Charnley, who pioneered      modern hip replacement, after Charnley visited UVM to give a      lecture in which he detailed the series of failures he      experienced before his big medical breakthrough.       ``For me, that was just all I needed,'' Arms said. The talk      left him with the sense of: ``I'm not giving up either.''                          ____________________
