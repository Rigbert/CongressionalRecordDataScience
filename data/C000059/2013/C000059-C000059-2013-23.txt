Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Perris, California and greater Riverside County are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Parameshwaran ``Ravi'' Ravishanker is one of these individuals. This year, Mr. Ravishanker will end his tenure as the Deputy General Manager of the Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD) after over 20 years of service.  Under his guidance as Assistant General Manager and Deputy General Manager, Mr. Ravishanker has helped EMWD become an industry leader in water and wastewater management. He is responsible for having helped EMWD reach a historic water rights settlement with the Soboba Band of Luiseno Indians, which was signed into law by the President of the United States on July 31, 2008. This settlement has resulted in the recharging of an overdrawn groundwater basin, helping to secure water reliability in the region for future generations.  Mr. Ravishanker has been instrumental in the surface and groundwater basin plans for the Santa Ana Watershed and San Jacinto Watershed, which have a combined population of just fewer than five million people. He helped initiate the implementation of three groundwater desalination facilities, a multipurpose wetlands facility and five wastewater treatment facilities. In addition, Mr. Ravishanker helped develop a water resources management plan that helped maximize state and federal funding opportunities, resulting in a more sustainable water supply portfolio for the District.  Mr. Ravishanker previously served as a United Nations Consultant and the Deputy General Manager of the Santa Ana Watershed Project Authority. He has dedicated his career to the water industry and has always worked with a commitment to resource and environmental sustainability.  In light of all Mr. Ravishanker has done for the city of Perris and the greater community, it is only fitting that he be honored for his many years of dedicated service. Mr. Ravishanker's tireless passion for the industry in which he serves has contributed immensely to the betterment of Riverside County and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I commend Mr. Ravishanker for his tireless work with the Eastern Municipal Water District. I know that many are grateful for his service and salute him as he prepares to end his tenure later this year.                          ____________________
