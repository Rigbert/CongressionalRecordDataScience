It's a message bill. It's politics as usual. It is spurring the base while spurning the average working American.  I outlined several proposals yesterday that are bipartisan in nature and ought to come to this floor immediately. It's called ``Make It in America.'' Let's vote on those bills. Let's vote on those bills to create opportunities, not this one to take them away.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and let us work together constructively for a better economic future for our people, more economic security, more health care security, and a better America.
