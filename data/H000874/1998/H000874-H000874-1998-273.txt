Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Puerto Rico for yielding time to me.  I rise in strong support of this legislation. I rise in strong support for the substitute that will be put forth to the Solomon amendment, and in opposition to the Solomon amendment.  Since 1985 I have served on the Helsinki Commission, which was charged since 1976 to oversee the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act. Within that act it said that the international community ought to respect the self-determination of peoples.  It is one of the most troubling issues that confronts the international community and the emerging democraciesaround the world. It is difficult because we need to determine what group, what size, how many do you need for self-determination. Does it need to be an identifiable, geographic area? If so, how large? It is an issue that we deal with in Yugoslavia.  Always, always, always the United States is on the side of those who aspire to make their own decisions. On this floor we have heard some very articulate expressions on both sides of this issue, from people who know the politics of Puerto Rico far more than I. But I know that those articulate people will debate this issue vigorously, and it will be the people of Puerto Rico who make this decision, as it should be. But it is important that this Congress express at home, within our own Nation, that same conviction on behalf of self-determination that we express around the world.  I would hope that we would overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, pass this legislation. I want to commend the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) for his leadership on this issue, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller), and indeed, the delegate from Puerto Rico, and all of those who participate in this debate.
