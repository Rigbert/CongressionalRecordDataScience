Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Dale Stormer, longtime labor leader in both our community and in our nation. Dale, who had a gruff exterior and a heart of gold, passed from this life on October 28, 2001. He leaves behind a lasting legacy of union activism and commitment to bettering the lives of our nation's workers. No one mastered the intricacies of health insurance and employee benefits more thoroughly or with more vision, compassion, and zeal.  Dale was president of the Toledo Area AFL-CIO from its inception in 1966 until 1973. Upon his leave, the union boasted 31,000 members. He returned after a two-year hiatus, serving as Executive Secretary until 1991. In that year, he went to Chicago, where he is credited with saving the union's health and welfare fund. He finally retired to Florida in 1997, though his heart remained in his union. His eye was always on the underrepresented, the exploited and the needy.  After being discharged from the U.S. Navy, Dale entered his life's work when he helped organize the employees of the Sears Roebuck and Company store in which he worked. In 1956, he became the head of the Detroit retail workers union, and joined the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees (HERE) in 1961. Dale first came to Toledo in 1961 to serve the HERE Local 868, which had been placed in trusteeship, and he represented the union's members for almost thirty years. He also served the HERE international union as a vice president.  His crowning achievement in organizing came when he was a founder of the Toledo United Labor Committee. This local consortium of union policymaking brought together the AFL-CIO, the UAW, and the Teamsters into a collective 50,000 members strong. To build strength through unity remains a hallmark of his leadership and acumen.  In addition to his union activities, Dale also found time to participate on the boards of the local United Way, Red Cross, and Toledo Lucas County Convention Center. He was asked to serve on former Ohio Governor Richard Celeste's Advisory Council on Travel and Tourism and was appointed by former Governor Celeste to the board of the Medical College of Ohio in Toledo.  His love of boating yielded him a twenty-year membership in the Bay View Yacht Club. If Dale ever relaxed, surely it was by boating on Lake Erie and on Florida's Caloosahatchee River. It was the one hobby in which he indulged, according to his son.  A man of humble origins who led his union brothers and sisters and our entire community to a better life, Dale was a labor leader first and last, He leaves behind this legacy, along with cherished memories his wife Ruth and sons John, Don, Ron, Tom, and Tony hold close in their hearts.                          ____________________
