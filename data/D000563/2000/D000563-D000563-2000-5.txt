President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary contributions of Allan W. ``Buck'' Witte to the people of Adams County, Illinois, and to congratulate him on his recent retirement.  One week ago, Al Witte quietly retired as Adams County Treasurer, a post he had held since 1992. But his public service contributions extend far beyond the treasurer's office. Al spent three years on the Adams County Board, winning a district in 1990 that, quite frankly, he wasn't supposed to win.  During his tenure on the County Board and in the treasurer's office, he became one of the most popular public servants in Adams County, drawing the largest vote totals of any county official. He followed in the footsteps of his late father, Art Witte, a hard working Adams County Clerk, who dedicated himself to a lifetime of public service.  Prior to his tenure on the Adams County Board and his service as Treasurer, Al worked for 30 years at Gardner-Denver in industrial engineering, retiring from that post in 1989.  Anyone who knows Al is aware of his strong support for the Democratic Party, an unyielding loyalty that ensured he was the first phone call made by any Democratic politician arranging a visit to Adams County. Although at times a fierce partisan, he kept winning elections by appealing to Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. He was a true bridge builder and an effective county and party official.  Mr. President, I have had the honor of working with Al Witte for most of this past decade, including when I represented Adams County and Quincy in the U.S. House of Representatives. I have always been taken by his dedication, loyalty, and commitment to public service. His will be incredibly big shoes to fill.  In closing, Mr. President, I applaud Al for his commitment and his efforts to improve the quality of life in Adams County, Illinois. I send my best wishes to Al for a happy and healthy retirement that allows him to spend a great deal of time with his wife, Mary, his children, and his grandchildren. We'll miss Buck, but will take comfort in the fact that he is only a phone call away.                          ____________________
