Speaker, I know the hour is getting late, and we have had a lot of votes, not only tonight, but earlier nights as well.  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), my friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle in celebration of his 37th anniversary. I would like to note that we are circulating a card, and all Members can sign this to my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) to congratulate him and his wife, Joan. We are glad that he is here tonight, and we hope to get him back soon.
