Res. 41. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. This legislation continues the sanctions that are already in place against the illegitimateruling Burmese regime, the State Peace and Development Council, or SPDC.  Last month, the whole world got a close look at the SPDC's contempt for human life when a devastating cyclone hit Burma. No one can say with certainty what the full toll of death and destruction is from the storm--but we do know the junta greatly compounded matters through inaction and its utter disregard for the Burmese people.  The SPDC severely restricted the entry of relief workers into the country. Four U.S. Navy ships carrying much-needed supplies for the Burmese people were turned away time and again by the regime.  Estimates put as many as 135,000 people dead or missing after the cyclone hit on May 3, and many of those deaths must lie at the feet of the SPDC for its outrageous acts of criminal neglect.  These sanctions, if enacted, would make clear to the SPDC that the United States continues to stand squarely with the long-suffering people of Burma and against the morally bankrupt junta.  This bill is the same legislation the Senate has passed in prior years. If enacted, it would extend import sanctions for another year unless the regime takes a number of tangible steps toward democracy and reconciliation.  I and many others believe these sanctions should be tightened even further, but those efforts will be pursued at a later date in separate legislation.  I am joined, as always, by two colleagues who are both steadfast and longtime advocates for the freedom of the Burmese people: Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator John McCain. I am proud to stand alongside these two friends in support of this important legislation.  Before I close I want to clarify one important point for my colleagues. This bill would in no way hinder or block America's continuing efforts to provide humanitarian aid to the people in Burma in the wake of the cyclone. This bill imposes sanctions on trade, not humanitarian aid.  America is a friend to the people of Burma. That is why we stand against Burma's tyrannical ruling regime. I hope my colleagues will continue to support this bill and continue to send that message to the SPDC.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 41       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress      approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in      section 3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of      2003.                          ____________________
