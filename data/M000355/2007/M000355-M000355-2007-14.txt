 President, with regard to the 2 hours so designated for the AMT debate, I request the opportunity to modify: that Senator Isakson have 5 minutes, Senator Chambliss have 5 minutes, Senator DeMint have 15 minutes, Senator Enzi have 5 minutes, Senator Grassley have 15 minutes, and Senator Cochran have 15 minutes--that is for the final vote, Mr. President, not the AMT vote.
