 I will go ahead, if that is what the Senator wants me to do. I think the statement by the Senator from Idaho, the statement by the Senator from South Carolina indicate that they want to discuss this on the basis of procedure and not on the basis of substance. So if we cannot have a debate on this, then I guess I will take advantage of the time for offering my amendment to express my views in the way of informing my colleagues in this body why I think some of the arguments that have been used in support of these 12 additional Marines are not legitimate arguments. I appreciate the attention of people who are involved in this debate.  There is only one point of procedure that I will take advantage of now before I save some time on the substance of my amendment. That is, remember, this bill that is before us has the appropriations for the personnel accounts of the Department of Defense.  The point being made by my two colleagues on the Armed Services Committee that this is not something legitimately discussed in a bill that provides the money for the salaries of the people in the military, including whether or not we ought to have 12 additional marine generals, just is not legitimate. There is no more legitimate point of discussing appropriations and the number of slots you are going to fund than in the very bill that has the appropriated money for the personnel accounts.  Now, the distinguished Senator from Idaho, who is now in the chair, stated the rationale of the Goldwater-Nichols legislation. I will respond to that because I think that if that is the reason for this, then the rationale behind the Goldwater-Nichols legislation of reducing interservice conflict and the duplication between services for getting to the mission of each service is not being properly met, because the Goldwater-Nichols Act placed special emphasis upon joint operations, joint staff, and joint duty.  Now, we agree on that, I am sure. The present Goldwater-Nichols legislation presently exempts 12 joint general officer billets from statutory service seals. So there is already consideration in Goldwater-Nichols for the needs of joint command, joint operations, joint staff, and all of that. We should not consider Goldwater-Nichols--which, by the way, was passed in 1986--as constituting a license to expand joint and service headquarters when the force structure is shrinking.  Now, I quoted in June quite liberally from Marine Gen. John Sheehan. I am sure the Marine command has gotten to General Sheehan and said to him, ``General Sheehan, call up some Senators and tell them that Grassley might be misquoting you or using your statement out of context.'' Let me assure you, I have studied what General Sheehan has said and what I said in June, and I am going to say that what General Sheehan said is not out of context. It is a voice within the Marines arguing that we not have a lot of waste on overhead and command, so that the Marines can fulfill their responsibility. General Sheehan talks about excess headquarters, but the need for excess headquarters is generated by general officers who occupy those headquarters that General Sheehan is so worried about.  He said this: ``Headquarters in defense agencies should not be growing as the force shrinks. At the end of the day, we need combat capability in the field.'' He is--General Sheehan--is commander and head of the U.S. Atlantic Command.  Headquarters should shrink as the force shrinks. I believe that is what he is saying. The joint headquarters should replace redundant service headquarters. This should happen as the joint headquarters begin to perform the missions previously done by service headquarters. Joint headquarters were not formed to create another redundant layer of bureaucracy. Service headquarters should be reduced or eliminated as joint headquarters take charge. That was the whole idea behind the Goldwater-Nichols reform: to fuse, to integrate, and to consolidate, get rid of wasteful, overlapping commands, headquarters, operations, and equipment.  Marine Corps commands in North Carolina are prime examples of redundancy. There are four layers of command headquarters for the 2d Marine Division and the 2d Marine Air Wing based in North Carolina. Each layer has command headquarters, generals, large staff, buildings, vehicles, airplanes--the whole works. The four layers are as follows: Layer 1 is the 2d Marine Division and the 2d Marine Air Wing; layer 2 is the 2d Marine Expeditionary Force colocated with the division; layer 3 is the Marine Corps Forces Atlantic colocated with the division; and layer 4 is the U.S. Atlantic Command at Norfolk, VA, under Marine Corps General Sheehan.  Mr. President, how many of these layers are really needed? Each layer exists to command and control ground air teams of the 2d Marine Division and the 2d Marine Air Wing. Two layers will get the job done. So, two layers are redundant.  I am not alone in that view. Maj. David A. Anderson--and, of course, I do not know Major Anderson, but he wrote an article called ``Stretched Too Thin,'' raising questions about our shrinking budget and about the challenges before us to do more with less. This is an issue from the U.S. Naval Institute proceedings, July of this year, right now, in fact.  I ask unanimous consent the article of this Marine Corps major be printed in the Record. It is from inside the Marines, another very good document for my colleagues if this thing is going to be considered in conference, that my colleagues ought to take into consideration.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Stretched Too Thin            (By Major David A. Anderson, U.S. Marine Corps)       Realigning to meet the nation's changing needs will require      a painful reorganization--to include standing down the III      Marine Expeditionary Force on Okinawa--but the Marine Corps      that emerges can provide a better capability for the nation      and an improved quality of life for the troops.       The Marine Corps has embarked on a journey into a new era,      filled with much uncertainty. This is not new for us; our      history is filled with such times of challenge and duress      that we as Marines have overcome--a time-honored tradition      that we have come to expect of ourselves and our nation of      us. This time, however, our challenge is made greater by the      environmental turbulence within which we operate; global      political uncertainty, downsizing, shrinking defense budgets,      changing and competing roles and missions, increasing      societal expectations, the ever-increasing pace of      technology, and the upswing in jointness and operations other      than war.       The challenge before us is to do more with less. We have      done this and continue to do so with uncommon vigor and      resourcefulness. In fact, no other organization--military or      otherwise--does a better job of allocating scarce resources      to competing needs and maximizing the benefits than the      Marine Corps. In spite of this, we are approaching our      threshold of effectiveness, because our strategy and      capabilities are not in sync with today's environment.       The Marine Corps is affected by two environments--external      and internal--each of which consists of five broad elements;      political, economic, physical, technological, and societal.      The external factors influence the internal policies and      practices, which in turn influence our values, attitudes, and      behavior.       Political Elements. The Department of Defense is in the      midst of a congressionally mandated reduction in force. But      what we have discovered is that because of the unstable      nature of global politics, U.S. willingness     to intervene, and additional requirements to operate in joint      arenas and conduct operations other than war, operational      tempo has not been reduced in proportion to force reductions.      The Marine Corps' response has been to improve existing      capabilities within the reduced force structure and to      operate smarter, using advanced technology and our inherent      ingenuity.       The nut that has yet to be cracked, however, is the one      that balances operational training, operational deployments,      and the morale and welfare of our Marines within current      personnel and budget restraints. It is well documented that      10-25% of our active-duty force is operationally deployed at      any one time. The Marine Corps currently is at approximately      87% manning from its peak years of the mid-1980s. It has the      longest training pipeline of all the armed services, along      with requisite school requirements, joint billet      requirements, the manning of a joint task force headquarters,      and an inordinately high first-term attrition rate      (approximately 30%). This leaves an effective operating force      of 50-70% of total personnel strength.       In an effort to minimize the impact on the operational      force, we have established personal staffing goals, prorate      distributions of critical military occupational specialties      (MOSs) and ranks, and out-of-hide tables of organization (T/     Os). This has created a phenomenon I call ``peg-holing.''      Let's say there are six people qualified to fill ten billet      requirements. Essentially what happens is that respective      monitors chase these billets through continuous reassignment,      with the squeaky-wheeled command getting the grease, leaving      some other command bone dry. As an extreme example, consider      the shortage of 0402 logistics majors within the 2d Force      Service Support Group. While I was assigned to 2d Landing      Support Battalion--from August 1993 to July 1995--the      battalion's T/O called for six majors; the staffing goal was      two; one was on hand. Another example within the same      battalion is 0481 landing support specialists. The T/O calls      for 312; on hand were 277, of whom 119 were deployed. The      remaining 158 Marines then must support day-to-day II Marine      Expeditionary Force operations, meet annual training      requirements, fill out-of-hide T/O requirements, and maintain      an Air Contingency Force detachment (and also squeeze in      schooling or annual leave).       As additional challenge to our operational force has been      the establishment of such new military occupation      specialities as computer small systems specialists and the      adoption of systems such as the MAGTF Deployment Support      System II, which reflect our incorporation of advanced      technologies. They have come at the expense of other MOSs,      because we have imposed the requirement without increasing      overall force strength or compromising mission capabilities.      The result--once again--is an overextended operational force.       Economic Element. Ever deeper defense cuts have come at      great expense to the Marine Corps, despite our ability to      squeeze more value out of every dollar spent. Those who      entered active service after 1 August 1986, upon retiring at      20 years, will receive 40% of their base pay instead of the      50% received by those who entered prior to this date.      Dependent health care is costing active-duty members more      each year. Collectively, our equipment has exceeded it      service life. The Marine Corps procurement budget is      averaging only 50% of the $1.2 billion it needs annually.      Prepositioned war reserves have been depleted to offset      nonrepairable equipment, and a growing portion of our budget      is being spent to repair aging equipment. The Army is      acquiring additional bigger, faster, more capable ships in      support of its maritime prepositioning force. We are forced      to buy and fix less-capable ships.       Most of our shrinking budget, out of necessity, is being      spent to sustain operational forces. This leaves little money      to maintain or upgrade existing facilities, including base      housing (which is substandard, inadequate, or un-inhabitable      in several locations), or to purchase garrison property. Most      alarming is the backlog of military construction projects the      Marine Corps has accumulated. During a recent visit to the 2d      Force Service Support Group, Major General B. Don Lynch noted      that at current funding levels, it could take another 100      years to fund our current military construction requirements.       Physical Element. Many of the facilities in which we work      and live require extensive renovation or replacement.      Complicating our housing problems is the shortage of base      quarters in high-cost geographical areas such as Washington,      D.C., Southern California, and Hawaii. Often the wait for      quarters is as long as 12-24 months, and the best off-base      housing locations are well beyond the means of most Marine      families. Many Marines must deal with an excessive commute      time because they cannot find affordable off-base housing      close to work. Those who can afford to buy homes often are      reluctant to do so, because they fear having to sell or rent      when they are transferred after their typical three-year      tours. Furthermore, housing allowances often fall short of      the true cost of housing.       Technological Element. In our rapidly changing age of      technology, the accumulation of technology doubles every      seven years--faster in some fields. The Marine Corps is doing      its best to sort through what it can and cannot use or      afford. We are discovering that what we can afford will not      keep us at the forefront in operational readiness. In many      instances, we are able to buy only enough promising      technologies to keep our foot in the door. Often by the time      we can afford and fully implement a technology it has become      obsolete.       We are even having difficulty assessing the value of      technologies because of personnel shortages. A significant      part of adopting new technologies is recognizing the      personnel requirements to operate and maintain them. This has      placed us in the situation of having to create new MOSs at      the expense of others--and thus continue to expand the      mission requirements of our Marines.       Social Element. The word's out on the street that what you      will get from the Marine Corps is demanding work, frequent      deployments, substandard living quarters, little free time,      slow promotions, and fewer reenlistment opportunities. These      impressions, the abolishment of the draft, and eroding      benefits are making it difficult for the service to attract      society's best and brightest young men and women. It is      showing in the Marine Corps' first-term enlistments: one-     third fail to complete their enlistment contracts. This      problem probably is multifaceted: there is a prevailing      societal attitude of ``If it doesn't feel good, don't do      it''; many young people are growing up without healthy role      models; and some become disillusioned with the Marine Corps      when it fails to meet their expectations. But the most      serious contributing factor is that more than 45% of our      first-termers enter under some type of enlistment waiver--and      not just for minor traffic violations. They include admitted      and frequent drug use, serious offenses, juvenile felonies,      and medical (to include psychological) waivers.       I found this figure appalling and unbelievable, so I      decided to put it to the test. I randomly surveyed 125 of my      first-termers. To my surprise, 57--or 45.6%--had entered with      waivers other than for minor traffic violations. As many as      49 of the 57 waivers were given at individual recruiting      stations. We are having to compromise our institutional      standards to meet our enlistment goals. In addition, I found      a direct positive correlation between those enlisting with      waivers and those who were subject to nonjudicial punishment      and first-term attrition.       Societal pressures and expectations add to our challenge.      For example, we must allow for and accommodate marriages of      our junior Marines, further exacerbating our leadership      challenge and our need to stretch a dollar. Many of these      young marriages fail, adding to an already inordinately high      divorce rate among Marines. As these marriages deteriorate,      we spend significant time providing counseling and dealing      with issues such as bad debts and alcohol or spousal and      child abuse.     Reshaping for the Future       This picture leaves much to be desired, but it is not all      gloom and doom. The short answer to our problems is a lot      more money and many more quality young men and women with      moral fiber and a strong work ethic. Unfortunately, the      reality is that our budget most likely will be cut further,      our force will get smaller, and societal values and      expectations will not change anytime soon. What remains for      the Corps to do is to assess more realistic options--those      that meet the needs of our nation, preserve our integrity,      and stay in line with our Commandant's planning guidance--and      choose the one that best meets the challenges of current and      future environmental turbulence and is responsive and quickly      adaptable to both new threats and emerging opportunities.       The first step in the process is to re-identify ourselves.      Who are we, and what is our role/mission? As the Commandant      has stated, ``The Marine Corps is the nation's naval,      combined arms, expeditionary force in readiness. Our reason      for being is what it always has been--warfighting.'' He      further states, ``It is vital that our organization be      designed with one goal in mind: success on the battlefield.''      To this end, the Marine Corps should be measured by the      return on investment it offers the nation. The two key      factors that determine return on investment are competitive      effectiveness and strategic responsiveness.       Competitive effectiveness is a measure of how well we      operate. It can be divided into two submeasures: efficiency      in swiftly and decisively responding to our nation's needs,      and effectiveness in getting the job done. Strategic      responsiveness is a measure of how well we relate to the      environment. It also can be divided into two submeasures:      attractiveness, that is, being the force of choice; and      capability responsiveness, or whether capabilities match      battlefield needs.       I believe that our force can be structured and equipped      better--to meet the changing needs of our nation and our      Commandant's vision for the future, to preserve the integrity      of our institutions, improve quality of life for our Marines,      and maximize return on investment--within current operating      restraints. The proposal is a painful one, but it can      preserve our future as the force of choice. We cannot sustain      today's Marine Corps and meet tomorrow's needs. A leaner,      better-equipped, and more-prepared force should be our      objective.       Our warfighting capabilities should focus on:       One warfighting Marine expeditionary force (MEF) capable of      organizing a Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) in support      of a major regional contingency.       One warfighting MEF capable of organizing a MAGTF in      support of a small-scale regional contingency.       One MEF maintaining a fully capable, expeditionary, joint      task force headquarters.       One MEF capable of executing the full range of operations      other than war.       The capability to employ three forward operating Marine      forces in the form of Marine expeditionary units (special      operations capable) (MEU/SOCs).       The capability to employ forward operating maritime      prepositioning squadrons (MPSs) as part of the Marine Corps      Maritime Prepositioning Force as logistics support to a      contingency MAGTF.       A fully integrated indivisible reserve force.       A force built around this concept could look something like      this:       Commander, Marine Forces Pacific/I MEF, with a colocated      headquarters at Camp Pendleton, California, capable of      organizing a MAGTF in support of one major regional      contingency; employing two forward operating Marine forces in      the form of a MEU(SOC), with one in reserve; and employing      one operating MPS--with current staffing goal force      structure.       I MEF (Forward), located in Guam or Australia and capable      of orchestrating Asian/Pacific Rim contingency operations; a      forward logistics base in support of regional contingencies      and joint training operations; employing one forward      operating MPS.       III MEF would be stood down entirely (personnel and      equipment), with equipment redistributed to I MEF, II MEF,      and prepositioned war reserves; personnel reassigned as      needed to support I MEF (Forward) mission and to fill I MEF      and II MEF shortfalls, as well as joint task force      headquarters, joint, and critical non-FMF billets; remaining      forced reduced through end-of-active-service and retirement      attrition.       Commander, Marine Forces Atlantic/II MEF/Joint Task Force      Headquarters, with co-located headquarters at Camp Lejeune,      North Carolina, and joint headquarters at Norfolk, Virginia,      tasked with employing one warfighting MEF capable of      organizing a MAGTF in support of a small-scale regional      contingency; employing a fully capable, expeditionary, joint      task force headquarters; executing the full range of      operations other than war; employing one forward-operating      Marine force in the form of a MEU(SOC) with one in reserve;      employing one forward-operating MPS. This includes standing      down one infantry-regiment equivalent and proportionate      support personnel/equipment, reassigning personnel and      reducing strength equivalent through end-of-active-service      and retirement attrition and redistributing equipment.       Non-FMF/Support Commands capable of sustaining or improving      current FMF support within the present command structure,      with a reduction of personnel strength in line with FMF force      reduction and an increased number of joint billets, as      required.       This plan reduces our force strength by 17,000-22,000, with      the following advantages:       It complies with the Commandant's planning guidance.       It reduces force strength 10-12 percent without      significantly compromising operational capabilities.       It reduces overseas deployments by 40-60%, thus saving      money and improving force morale.       It allows us to divert dollars previously committed to      support deployments and procurement dollars planned for      replacing aging equipment to other areas historically      neglected because of funding shortages, as well as to      innovative technologies and concepts that will put us at the      cutting edge in expeditionary force readiness.       It makes the Marine Corps more appealing to young men and      women, which eventually will allow for more selective      recruiting.       It increases the nation's return on its investment in the      Marine Corps.       It shrinks the strategy-capability gap.       This is not a panacea for all our ailments, nor does it      completely close our strategy-capability gap. It is, however,      a necessary step in the right direction, when coupled with      initiatives to get more Department of the Navy/Defense      dollars, divest ourselves of unproductive areas, streamline      processes, lengthen tours, shorten promotion time, and      improve reenlistment incentives.
