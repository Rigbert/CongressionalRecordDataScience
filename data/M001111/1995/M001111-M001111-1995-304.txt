 President, I rise today to talk about my deep concern over the House proposal on the child nutrition program and stand before you today to speak about the questions that I have asked and the answers I have looked to to find out whether this is the right road for this body to go down.  [[Page S4560]] I want to relate some of that to you today. The National School Lunch Program, as we all know, began in 1946 in response to concerns that our national security was jeopardized because many of our incoming military personnel suffered from nutrition-related illness.  The Federal Government made a decision that it is in the national security interest of this country to feed and nourish our youth to ensure a strong population and a strong nation.  If we take the time to review this program's record, we will clearly find that it has been successful in boosting health and achievement among our children.  This program touches every family in America. Its elimination will shake the very foundation of the family: health, nutrition, education, and opportunity.  Here is why: Every single school day, more than 25 million children in 93,000 schools across America eat a lunch provided through the National School Lunch Program. More than half of these children receive the meal free or at a reduced price.  I doubt my colleagues know what it is like to sit in a classroom as a small child and try to concentrate on learning when you have not had a meal for several hours.  I doubt that many know what it is like to teach these children.  As a mother and a pre-school teacher, I can assure you that for hungry children, learning is not a priority. It cannot be. Often, the meals they get at school are their only meals for the day.  Often, these lunches are the only nutritious meal they get. I can tell you from first-hand experience that food makes a child--any child--happy and healthy and willing to learn.  Teachers are overburdened as it is. The last thing we need to do is to put more hungry children in our classrooms and then ask our teachers to teach them.  The Women, Infants, and Children Program [WIC], another nutrition program targeted for block granting, is one of the most successful forms of health care cost containment that we have today. It has an outstanding record of reducing the incidence of low-birth-weight babies born to poor women, and saving lives.  This program serves nearly 7 million mothers and children each month at a cost of less than $1.50 a day for each participating child. The Medicaid savings this program produces outweigh the costs by a 3 to 1 ratio.  It is a model program which should not be lost in the welfare reform debate but rather one we can and should learn from.  I think it is important to point out that these programs have rightfully enjoyed bipartisan support in this body. The Senate has affirmed the issue of nutrition as one of health for our children.  It is one of economics too. This Nation will pay so much more later if growing children do not get the nutrition they need now and if women do not get the parental care they need now.  Let me touch on a few other aspects of this legislation. One of the reasons these nutrition programs have been so successful is because of national nutrition standards. Where do you think the campaign for the five basic food groups came from?  The House proposal would eliminate these and ask each State to set their own. So, instead of one proven, workable national program, we will have 50 individual bureaucracies experimenting on our children.  But that is not all. If we look further into the legislation, we realize that despite what the House would have us believe, their proposal will cut nutrition funds to many States.  The claim that the school lunch program will see a 4.5-percent increase cannot be found in this legislation. What you can say is that the school nutrition block grant would provide 2.5-percent more funding in fiscal year 1996 than schools will receive in fiscal year 1995. However, this does not take into account food price inflation or increases in participation.  Under current law, these programs would see a 5-percent increase in order to keep pace with food costs and participation. Because block grants do not take these into account, the bill will actually provide $170 million less in fiscal year 1996 than would be provided under current law.  By fiscal year 2000, the block grant would provide $760 million less than the levels needed to keep pace with inflation and participation. Over a 5-year period, the block grant would provide $2.3 billion less than current law. These are not block grants; they are block cuts.  The House proposal shifts these funds to discretionary spending. Once this happens, 1996 is the only year funds can be guaranteed. Afterward, State nutrition programs would be subject to arbitrary spending caps, across-the-board cuts, and other money savings gimmicks without regard to the impact on children.  The House proposal does not take into account the possibility of a recession. Nor does it compensate for any increases in population or poverty.  It puts our States in a position of setting nutrition standards they may not be able to afford. It caps administrative costs which will limit each State's ability to establish the new State regulations.  What does this mean? When States run out of funds--and believe me, they will--The children will not eat. The end result will be devastating to our children, our schools, our families, our communities, and our economies.  I have talked with many people since the introduction of this proposal. I know that my State of Washington will lose under the current block grant formula.  I know that hard working parents who need WIC or school lunches are afraid of what the future holds for their children. I know that children are worried about their families.  I understand and share their fears and I urge all of my colleagues to get out and talk with those people who participate in these programs.  Talk to parents, to teachers, and to children so that when the Senate takes up this issue you have a clear and deep understanding of just what you will be doing if you support this effort.  Mr. President, one last issue I want to touch on in regard to this whole block grant effort is the issue of welfare and how it has become associated with abuse and irresponsibility.  I share the view that the programs I just discussed are investments in our future.  The overwhelming majority of those people involved are using these programs as a last resort and not because they choose to. They are necessary for survival.  Mr. President, I have several letters from families in the Washington WIC programs which I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       I am very grealfut for the WIC Program, and to the nurses I      have meet. I have learned alot about nutristion.       If I was not recieving WIC, Moniqua my two year old would      not have enough milk.       I have felt very support by the ladies that wort there.       There are a lot of ladies that come to the WIC office to      learn how to take good care of their new babies. Without the      WIC a lot of babies would go hungrey. They givee formula,      baby food and sopport you if the mother would like to Breast      feed their Baby. These nurses help to keep a lot of Babies      healthy.       In school my older girl would not beable eat, because not      all the time, I have enough food to send with her for lunch,      she able to eat and worry about how hungrey she is. she can      concentrate on her school work.       I know what it is like to go to school and be hungrey and      not beable to think very clear.     Katheran Northrop.                                                                    ____       The WIC program has really helped supply my family with the      nutritious foods we need. It has supplemented the food stamps      we receive I always feel that the staff here at WIC is very      dedicated to the welfare of our children.     Susan Bess.                                                                    ____       Dear Senator Murry: I'm hoping that they don't cut the WIC      program because it has really helped me the past 3\1/2\      years. Baby milk is really expensive and when you are on a      fixed income and only recieve a certain amount of Food stamps      it becomes a problem with finance. The WIC program helps us      women and children afford milk for their children and even      help us afford some things we need but if there wasn't the      program we would have alot of under nurished babies. So you      see Sen. Murry we really need the WIC program. * * *                                                      Julie Allen.       [[Page S4561]] Dear Senator Murry: I just want to say that      the WIC program has helped me so much and many others that I      know. Without the WIC program I don't think I could of made      it threw. Formula is very expensive. It would cost about      150.00 dollars more a month if I had to buy it myself then I      would probably have to seek other assistance.

This is my second      Child to have on WIC my first was five years ago, She is a      healthy beautiful little girl. I am expected another baby in      April and thanks to WIC I know this baby will have the      Formula She or he will need to grow strong and healthy. WIC      is wonderful. WIC is a program that really benifits the      Children.           Sincerely,      Diane Aston.                                                                    ____       Dear Senator Murray: Please continue to support the WIC      Program. I'm glad I've join this program because I have learn      a lot for my pregnancy this time. Also, the WIC Program help      my family a lot for all. Such as financially & family      support, etc.       Thank you for your attention.           Sincerely,     Fondy Lee.                                                                    ____       Being a mother of three small children ranging from 7 years      of age to 3 months, I am currently enrolled in a local WIC      Program. I must take this opportunity to tell you how happy      and grateful I am to be provided this opportunity.       I started receiving WIC September of 1994 when my husband      of 3\1/2\ years walked out on me and my children. I was five      months pregnant at the time and worrying about the stress      involved in caring for my family.       The WIC Program was a life saver. Not only was I able to      take care of myself during my pregnancy but it helped to      provide for my other children. I learned more about pregnancy      and infant care than I knew the two previous pregnancies. I      am currently breastfeeding my three month old, and providing      overall better nutrition to myself and my children.       None of these things would have been possible without WIC.       Please do not cut WIC funding.           Sincerely,     Janet L. Pettie.                                                                    ____       Dear Senator Gorton: I'm writing to inform you of the      importance for a WIC Program. Me and my family used WIC for      approximately one year and if it hadn't been for the program      we wouldn't have made it. WIC enabled me and my family to get      on our feet, thus giving us the ability to give back. So      please don't cut this program because it would be creating a      problem rather than solving one.           Sincerely,     Eddie Carter and Family.                                                                    ____       Dear Senator Murray: The WIC Program has made a huge      difference in the life of all four of my children. My last      two pregnancy were monitored by WIC. The nutrition conceling      nurse care and social work were invaluable. My daughter age 4      and son age 2 have been on WIC since before they were born.      Having WIC has ment they would always have formula or milk.      They probably would not have had milk everyday if it wasn't      for WIC. I am a working mom and make just a little too much      to stay on foodstamps. So WIC has bridged a big gap in our      food budget.       Thank you for all the help in the past.       And please don't take it away from the children who really      need it.                                                                    ____       My family uses WIC and w/out their help I don't know what I      would have done. My son used a special formula that was very      expensive and I couldn't afford it on my own. Also, being a      first time parent, they informed me about all the right foods      to feed my child and at what age he should start these foods.      They have helped me out in so many ways.           Sincerely,     Martina Sambrano.                                                                    ____       Dear Senator Murray: Please do not vote to cut the WIC      Program. Without it I would not be able to give my kids milk      once a day and probably not once a week. We are a struggling      family of 7 with a small business. We hope to not need help      soon but there are a lot of people still out there who      wouldn't survive without this program.       Thank you for your time.     Mischel V. Sullivan.                                                                    ____       Senator Patty Murray: My infant daughter and I have greatly      enjoyed the WIC program. The services are excellent. The      staff are profesional and the classes and information are      valuable.       Now that I am home with my daughter, (she is our first      child), motherhood is a completely new and different world.      The WIC program has helped me learn a lot about nutrition.      Our daughter is very physically small and the formula      provided has greatly helped her growth. In addition, the      nutrition program has benefited our entire family.       Please do not reduce the WIC funds. The infants & children      we raise today will be our furture leaders, such as yourself.      (We need as many positive factors towards their development.)       Thank you.     Mary Jane Brogan.                                                                    ____       I am writing to you regarding the WIC program. I was      informed today that for some reason you are trying to erase      WIC from Seattle. Obviously you do not know the importance of      WIC to thousands of pregnant women & their children. Women      must eat, receive proper medical care, good social care, &      correct knowledge & advise to bring healthy babies (like you      once were yourself) into this world. Mothers will do almost      anything to protect & provide for their babies including      theft & illegal ways of making money. With WIC, these women      do not have to submit themselves to the ugly ways of life,      but instead feel that they have a whole building of friends      they can always come to. Nobody wants to rely on anyone else,      but in these days & ages, life is so vastly unfair, that      sometimes your low days do outnumber your high days. So,      until then, when everyone in this world is totally self-     sufficient, programs like WIC are needed & worth every penny      the government puts towards it.

Saeleuon, Koi Fong.                                                                    ____       WIC has been very helpful to me as a single mother--to be      sure that I have the basics. Milk, peanut butter is a real      comfort. I don't know what I would do without the support of      this office, the vouchers and the support in general. WIC is      a great program.       P.S. I'm not on food stamps but I think that program should      be more like WIC where there are specific foods allowed--     people will be healthier, better educated and tax payers less      resentful.     Jennifer Meltzer.                                                                    ____       Please don't cut WIC. It means a lot to our family. It      helps a lot with the children. We need WIC to help like      families like ours. In times of need.       Thanks,     Barbara Wilkens.                                                                    ____       The WIC program is extremely good, the program help my      child so much as he was growing. They had choices of milk for      him. A lot of it is very expensive and with my income God      knows how I would have purchase what he needed. They (WIC)      were very helpful in the right foods he needed and just very      helpful in all my questions. I highly recommend WIC for any      mother and wish the program would stay around for many years      to come.     Phyllis Sanders.                                                                    ____       I support continued funding of the Women, Infants and      Children (WIC) program. I do not believe we should make any      cuts to the funding of this program. This program is      extremely vital to the well being of many of our country's      young children. We need to continue to ensure the well being      of these children by continuing all funding to programs, such      as WIC, that help children begin life with a healthy start.
