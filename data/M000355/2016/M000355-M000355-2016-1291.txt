 President, today I wish to honor the long career in public service of a good friend of mine and a friend to the Commonwealth of Kentucky, circuit court Judge Tom Jensen. After a lifetime of service in both elected office and on the bench, Judge Jensen has announced his retirement from the bench of the 27th Judicial Circuit Court, effective this February 16. Kentucky is going to miss his wisdom, his judgment, and the benefit of his many years of experience.  Judge Jensen has served for 3-plus years on the bench and, prior to that, had a lengthy career in the Kentucky General Assembly. He served in the Kentucky House of Representatives in the 1980s and 1990s. During his tenure there, he was elected as minority floor leader, the highest Republican position in the House of Representatives.  In 1996, Tom chose to not seek reelection to the house and instead was elected chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky. During his leadership, the Kentucky GOP made some significant gains, adding an additional Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives delegation and sending another Republican to the U.S. Senate. Republicans also gained control of the Kentucky State Senate for the first time in history under his watch.  Judge Jensen was next elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 2005, representing the 21st District, which included Estill, Laurel, Powell, Jackson, and Menifee Counties. As a senator, he chaired the senate judiciary committee and the senate budget review subcommittee on justice and judiciary. He also served as the vice chairman of the senate natural resources and energy committee.  Judge Jensen has been honored many times in the Commonwealth for his achievements. He won recognition as Senator of the Year 2011 by the Kentucky Narcotics Officer Association. He received the highest award from the Kentucky Department of Corrections. He received the 2011 Public Advocate Award for advancing justice through criminal justice reforms. His alma mater, the University of the Cumberlands, also presented him an award for his leadership.  After 18 years in the legislature, Judge Jensen has dispensed his wisdom from the bench for the last 3-plus years, where he presides over many cases involving drugs and drug offenses. He has won acclaim for his wisdom and judicial temperament, but even though he has more than 6 years left in his current term, he has chosen to retire and re-enter private law practice. Tom has practiced law in London since 1978, is licensed to practice in all courts of the Commonwealth, and has been admitted to practice before the sixth circuit of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.  It seems advocacy is Judge Jensen's first love, and after a long and successful career, he wants to return to the role of advocacy in the courtroom. While he will certainly be missed on the bench, I know he will be an outstanding attorney and advocate for his clients, who will be very lucky to benefit from his experience.  I know my colleagues join me in extending congratulations and best wishes to Judge Jensen and to his family: his wife, Nannette Curry Jensen; their two daughters, Natalie Jensen and Laura Jensen Hays; his son-in-law, Henry Hays; and grandchildren, Elle and Spencer.  As Judge Jensen begins this new chapter in his career, I want to thank him for his career in public service and contributions to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. We will miss him on the bench or in the general assembly halls, but look forward to still seeing him in the courtroom.  A local area newspaper in Kentucky published an article extoling Judge Jensen's life of service. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Times-Tribune, Feb. 7, 2016]  Tri-County Profiles: Judge, Legislator returns to Private Practice                         After Decades of Service                 (By Christina Bentley, Feature Writer)       ``Life's too short not to do things you enjoy,'' said      Circuit Court Judge Tom Jensen, who recently announced his      retirement from the bench of the 27th Judicial Circuit Court,      effective Feb. 16.       For Jensen, the thing he will be enjoying for the      foreseeable future will be his London private law practice,      although he said he has enjoyed every phase of his career,      from his 18\1/4\ years of service in the Kentucky State      Legislature to his three-plus years on the bench. But his      heart right now is in returning to private practice.       ``I made a commitment that I would go back to my law office      . . . When I left, I said, look, I'm just going to go stay      three years, maybe four years, and then come back and      practice law and finish up that way,' '' he said. ``I may      take off a couple of weeks, but I am going back. My staff      stayed in place, and I always promised them I'd come back, so      I'm going to live up to my promise. And it's time. I've      thought about not going back. I've got six-and-a-half more      years or so in this term, and I considered it. At my age,      maybe that's the smart thing to do. It's not overwhelming      work to me. A lot of people have asked me why I'm going back      to practice law, and the thing about it is I enjoyed that. I      enjoyed that more than anything that I've ever done, I      think.''       Jensen said that while he has also enjoyed serving on the      bench, he just doesn't get the same sort of satisfaction from      it as he does from the process of problem solving with      clients.       ``It just turned out that I would rather advocate for      somebody than be the mediator or make the decision,'' he      said. ``I think I miss the give and take, the camaraderie you      develop by talking to a client, meeting with people, trying      to solve a problem, not deciding the issue or the problem,      but trying to solve it. I don't want to sound corny, but I      think I'm a people person, and I don't think that's the role      of a judge. I don't think I'll ever run for anything again,      and I think I'd like to finish up practicing law.''       Jensen's passion for advocacy is also evident when he      discusses the years that he spent working in the Kentucky      State Legislature, a political career that resulted in his      recognition as Kentucky State Senator of the Year for 2011.       ``I enjoyed (the legislature),'' Jensen said, ``trying to      make a difference. I think it was seeing if you could make      things better. It sounds crazy, but it wasn't the pay.      Actually, it probably cost me money, practicing law, being in      the legislature, being gone those periods of time. But it was      a good feeling if you got something accomplished. It was a      good feeling that you thought you could make things better.      Sometimes we were right, sometimes we weren't. I think, you      know, Kentucky's my home, and I wanted to make it as good as      I possibly could. Of course, I wasn't a dictator, and I      wasn't governor or anything like that, but I did, as Floor      Leader in the House, have some impact on some things. We were      able to put in some legislation that I think has made a      difference in the state. It moved at a snail's pace;      sometimes you'd get frustrated. Sometimes you would argue      that there was a better of doing it and you couldn't get your      way about it, but that's democracy, and the one thing that I      saw in the legislature: for the most part, people were up      there for the right reasons. They were up there to make      Kentucky better.''       Jensen is proud of much of what he accomplished in the      legislature, but he said his signature accomplishment was      House Bill 463, designed to cut down on prison overcrowding      in the state.       ``In about 2009 and 2010, we started looking at it,'' he      said. ``We were actually using private prisons to house state      prisoners, and it was costing the state a considerable amount      of money. It was to the point that we were either going to      have to build a new prison or we had to do something. So      that's when we     came up with (House Bill) 463 to put a lot of people on      probation, more than we had in the past, mainly drug      offenses, and it has done what we said it would do . . . Now      some people might say we're being too easy on them. The thing      about drug addiction, the way I see it, in the courtroom,      your criminal days are just filled up with drug cases. Most      of them are pleading out, a lot of probation, some      diversions. And then about 50 percent of them end up going to      prison or jail anyway because they can't comply with the      terms. But still, if you look at it that way, it's 50      percent, which is not a good rate, but actually there are 50      percent that aren't going back, which is a good rate, and it      has saved us a considerable amount of money.''       Jensen said that while he won't be running for office      again, he enjoyed the political process and may involve      himself in it in other ways, advocating for causes he      believes in, primarily those that help his adopted hometown.       ``This will be the last political position that I have,''      he said. ``I'm not saying I won't help out somebody      politically or maybe get involved in somebody's campaign, but      I don't think I'll ever run for anything again. I think I'm      done running. But I always liked politics . . . I intend to      go back and practice law, but I might even lobby some. I've      still got some real good friends in the legislature, so I      might do that and lobby for some projects, mainly things that      I think would help Laurel County.''       For example, Jensen cites the ongoing efforts of Cumberland      River Comprehensive Care to build a juvenile drug rehab in      Laurel County as a project he would like to have more      involvement in.       ``One of the things that I even worked on as judge was to      try to help Cumberland River Comp Care get the old juvenile      detention facility,'' he said. ``I did help by going to      Frankfort to talk to the governor and some others . . . What      they want to do is have a juvenile rehab center in there, and      I can tell you, looking at my court system, these people that      are adults on drugs in my court, they didn't start when they      became 18. They started at 12, 13. It's actually alarming      when you talk to some of them, the age they began this stuff.      So I felt like that was a really good endeavor to get into.      I'd like to even help them maybe get some more money to fix      up more of that building . . . it's going to take      considerable money to get it up and operating, and Comp Care      has made the commitment to do it, but I thought I'd try to      maybe help them, see if I could get them a little more money      to help the renovation along a little quicker. That's one of      the projects I've developed for myself in retirement.''       Jensen is not a Laurel County native, but he has spent his      entire career here, after following a basketball scholarship      from his hometown of Cincinnati to Sue Bennett Junior College      nearly 50 years ago.       ``My high school coach was a guy named Ralph Rush, and he      was from Bush, and of course I never heard of Bush, growing      up in Cincinnati, but he brought me down here,'' Jensen said.      ``My grades were not real good in school. I was not a      particularly good student. I went to school mainly to play      sports probably . . . But that's what brought me down here,      and I just kind of fell in love with it here in London and      the surrounding area. I think I like the small town more than      I ever did a big city. Even though London's not a      particularly small town anymore, I wouldn't live anywhere      else. This is it. When I left Sue Bennett, I had a lot of      scholarship offers, and I went to Eastern Illinois      University. I went up there and just didn't like it, and I      quit. And this is 1969, I guess, and my dad was furious with      me. Vietnam was going on, and he said, 'Here you are going to      school for free. What are you going to do?' And I said,      'Well, I'll just join the Army.' But my dad threw such a fit      . . . So I came back down to London and talked to Ernie      Wiggins, who was my coach at Sue Bennett . . . and it just so      happened that night they were going to play at Cumberland      College, and he asked me if I wanted to go down . . . I went      to Cumberland and finished up there. I met my wife there. Got      married. Came to London--that's where her family's from--and      decided to go to law school about two years later.''       Jensen married Nannette Curry and the couple have two      daughters, Natalie Jensen and Laura Jensen Hays, who were      growing up during Jensen's time in the legislature.       ``I enjoyed . . . all those years doing that, looking back      on them, other than the time I was away from my family,''      Jensen said. ``You know when you're away from your kids and      then they grow up, and if anything goes wrong, you start      blaming yourself: should have been there more,' but my wife      did a really good job, she covered all the bases. She was a      good mother, she was real involved with the kids.''       These days, Jensen says he's looking forward to having time      to watch his grandchildren swim--they are both on the swim      team at Corbin High School--but he doesn't really have any      other hobbies. He said he wants to keep serving Laurel      County, just in different ways.       ``How many years can you do this? I don't know. I just know      that I want to work until I can't work anymore,'' he said.       He would like to continue to combat the drug problem in the      area, something he has seen first-hand as a judge.       ``The biggest problem I see facing us today is drugs, and      if you come and watch a criminal day, it's nearly all drugs,      everybody that's convicted. Now, they might have a theft with      it, but they were stealing money to buy drugs . . . It's      really sad. I see that as a major problem, not only in      Kentucky but across the nation,'' Jensen said.       All told, though, Jensen said he is proud of his life's      work and feels fortunate to have been able to accomplish what      he has for the people of the region.       ``I'm glad I left Cincinnati to come down here. It's just      been a good life for me here,'' Jensen said. ``I've made a      lot of good friends . . . I've been very fortunate. And the      people of this community . . . have been really, really good      to me. When I was in the Senate, I was representing five      counties: Laurel, Jackson, Estill, Powell and Menifee      counties. They were always good to me. This (Laurel County)      courthouse here, I put the money in the budget for this and      the one in Jackson County, too. Those kind of things, when      you look back on it, things you were able to accomplish, it      kind of makes you feel good about some of it. Some of the      things you couldn't accomplish, you know, it's frustrating      that you thought you knew the right way to go and couldn't      get there, but the things that you have gotten right . . .      that makes you feel good. And I know what I accomplished. I      don't need my name on a building or anything to know what I      did, and I'm pretty proud of the things I did accomplish.      It's up to the next generation now to accomplish even more      and do things even better.''                          ____________________
