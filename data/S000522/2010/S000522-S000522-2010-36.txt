Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 1588, of which I am the original cosponsor.  Madam Speaker, we are all too familiar with the famous quote by the American philosopher George Santayana, who said, ``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'' The truth of this saying is tragically realized in the case of war and genocide.  General Romeo Dallaire, the commander of the former United Nations mission in Rwanda, tried unsuccessfully in 1994 to warn the United Nations that huge massacres were imminent in that country. Even he miscalculated the magnitude of the threat. Within a few months, Rwanda was engulfed in genocide, leading to the deaths of nearly 800,000 people.  Larry Eagleburger, a former ambassador to Yugoslavia who served as Deputy Secretary of State and then Secretary of State, never suspected that the hostilities in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would escalate to the slaughter of more than 8,000 people that took place in Srebrenica in 1995.  Sadly, we have too many indications about what could happen if the two referenda scheduled to take place in Sudan in January do not take place fairly and peacefully. The 20-year war between the north and the south of Sudan that ended in 1995 took the lives of over 2 million people and displaced a further 4 million.                              {time}  1610  Peace in Darfur is inextricably linked to peace throughout the rest of Sudan. And the genocide there in 2003 unleashed the slaughter of over 300,000 women, men, and children. Almost 3 million have been displaced and are still consigned to the misery of camps for internally displaced persons.  Like many of my colleagues, I have visited Sudan. I have been to Mukjar and Kalma camp, and I have actually had a face-to-face meeting with General Bashir, the dictator in Khartoum, pushing for peace, pushing for an end to this slaughter. Unfortunately, he was obsessed only with trying to convince me that the sanctions against his government needed to be lifted. The fact that the sanctions were based on the senseless killing and displacement sponsored by his government was dismissed by him as of no consequence.  This signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement in 2005 marked a potential turning point for the Sudanese people. It calls for elections leading to a referendum in January of 2011 to determine whether the south will remain united to the north or secede as an independent state. The region of Abyei is also to hold a referendum to determine whether it will remain in the north or possibly secede with the south should the south choose that course. Specific conditions were to be met in anticipation of these major events, to ensure that they would be conducted credibly and peacefully.  Madam Speaker, these interim 5 years have yielded signs of hope that the country could settle into a stable, lasting peace. The United States has devoted substantial resources, nearly $9 billion in humanitarian, development, and peacekeeping assistance since 1994 to support the CPA's implementation. But numerous incidents have also exposed the extreme lack of trustworthiness of the Khartoum government and the urgent need for the government of southern Sudan to increase its capacity and accountability.  The Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health, on which I serve as ranking member, and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission have held several hearings over the last 14 months. The testimony we have heard at those hearings sounded a major alarm about the ominous storm clouds gathering over Sudan. In fact, the issues raised at the two hearings in July of 2009 and the proposed solutions to those issues were so compelling that I and several other Members forwarded the expert testimony to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Scott Gration, our Special Envoy, asking them to take this incredibly compelling information into account as the administration engaged in peace efforts in Sudan.  Unfortunately, the administration took little or know account of that advice. Furthermore, it seemed to ignore its own strategy that was publicized in October of last year. Key members of the National Security Council deputies committee, which was supposed to meet quarterly, met only once in January with no noticeable outcome. The administration claimed it was taking the advice of numerous experts to establish specific benchmarks to be met by the respective parties according to a set time frame. The achievement of those benchmarks, created to ensure the timely implementation of the CPA, would be tied to incentives and disincentives to motivate their achievement. There is no evidence that these benchmarks were ever created, much less enforced with discernible consequences.  Madam Speaker, the President and the State Department have taken some action during the past few weeks, apparently recognizing that the time remaining until the North-South referendum is extremely short. One most hope that the adage ``better late than never'' will apply in this case. The challenges to be addressed in the next few weeks, particularly the demarcation of the North-South border and the post-referendum agreement on wealth sharing and citizenship can be met if the United States plays a leadership role in gathering the influence and cooperation of the African Union and other international players. Herculean measures must also be undertaken to ensure that the January 9 referendum is conducted in a manner that ensures the credibility of the outcome as well as the peaceful acceptance of that outcome by the parties.  With H. Res. 1588, I join my colleagues in pressing upon the administration the urgent need to assist the Sudanese people in their long-sought-after quest for peace. The effort will be great, but the price of another even more catastrophic war would be even greater. No one, particularly the Sudanese people, can afford to pay that price.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
