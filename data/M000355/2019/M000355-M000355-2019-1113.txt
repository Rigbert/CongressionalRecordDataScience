  On Thursday, hundreds of millions of proud Americans joined together all across our country in town squares, parks, and backyards to cohost our Nation's 243rd birthday party. As always, the parades and fireworks and picnics commemorated something serious: our proud national legacy of liberty. It began in Philadelphia in 1776, and we continue working to make it manifest to this day.  Celebrating our freedoms also means remembering the great sacrifices that so many have given in order to protect and preserve them. It is fitting that here in our Nation's Capital, the fireworks display lights up our war memorials and the tombs of fallen warriors across the river. And, of course, we remember also all the men and women currently serving today.  We Americans have so much to be proud of. Just yesterday, we were given yet another reason. Instead of taking the weekend off, the U.S. women's national soccer team finished their time in France by winning the World Cup. Earlier last week, the U.S. women commemorated Independence Day early by beating England, and then yesterday, they defeated the Netherlands--two to nothing--to take first place. Through grit, teamwork, and dazzling talent, the American women have now raised the World Cup trophy four times.  A billion viewers around the world tuned in to watch the tournament. All told, they saw the United States outscore our opponents collectively by 26 to 3 and follow our victory in thelast tournament in 2015 with a back-to-back win this time as well.  I know my colleagues join me in offering the Senate's congratulations to the U.S. women's national soccer team for bringing this honor home.                          ____________________
