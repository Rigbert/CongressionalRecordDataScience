 Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding me this time.  Let us talk economics for a moment and what is really going on in America. Let us recognize that in America today the wealthiest 1 percent of the population owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.  The gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider. The middle-class is shrinking. Workers are earning lower wages. That is the economic reality in America. But what does that have to do with the rescission package that we are looking at tonight?  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that if we are going to be honest, we would say let us move forward in a way that is fair that does not hurt those people who are seeing a decline in their standard of living, those people who are experiencing increased poverty.  Interestingly enough, however, when we look at this rescission package, do we notice any cuts, any cuts in the $100 billion a year that the largest corporations in America and that the wealthiest people in America are receiving through corporate welfare? Amazingly, no, we do not.  We see cuts in affordable housing. We see cuts in environmental protection; cuts in the summer job program for low-income kids; cuts in LIHEAP. The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] talked about LIHEAP. In the State of Vermont, it gets mighty cold in the wintertime. We have elderly people trying to survive on $8,000 or $9,000 a year Social Security, but they are cutting that program some $300 million.  Mr. Speaker, I do not know how low-income elderly people will survive with those types of cuts. But when it comes to corporate welfare, my goodness, we just cannot find a nickel.  What about military spending?
