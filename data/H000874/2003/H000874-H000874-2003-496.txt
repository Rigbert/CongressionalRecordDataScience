 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Ways and Means held a markup of the Social Security bill yesterday, and I expect to consider that legislation under a rule in the next week or so.  On the Armed Services Tax Fairness Act, the committee is still reviewing options for potential changes to that bill, but we also expect to consider that legislation in the very near future.
