President, I rise today as a supporter of the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act, but also as one who has concerns over how the derivatives title of the bill will be implemented. I applaud the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee for his work on the underlying bill. At the same time, I am concerned that some of the provisions in the derivatives title will harm U.S. businesses unnecessarily.  I would like to engage the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee in a colloquy that addresses an important issue. The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act will regulate ``swap dealers'' for the first time by subjecting them to new clearing, capital and margin requirements. ``Swap dealers'' are banks and other financial institutions that hold themselves out to the derivatives market and are known as dealers or market makers in swaps. The definition of a swap dealer in the bill includes an entity that ``regularly enters into swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own account.'' It is possible the definition could be read broadly and include end users that execute swaps through an affiliate. I want to make clear that it is not Congress' intention to capture as swap dealers end users that primarily enter into swaps to manage their business risks, including risks among affiliates.  I would ask the distinguished chairman whether he agrees that end users that execute swaps through an affiliate should not be deemed to be ``swap dealers'' under the bill just because they hedge their risks through affiliates.
