Speaker, we all know that welfare reform has become a front-burner topic in this town and throughout the Nation. Last November the American public spoke decisively on wanting change. Welfare reform was a central theme in last fall's election. The House of Representatives has responded to the American public and I believe that real welfare reform can be found in the conference report before the House today.  The changes incorporated in the conference report on H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act, represent real change. I congratulate members of the Committee on Agriculture and all Members who worked diligently on reforming the Food Stamp Program and the present welfare system.  The very first hearing held by me in the committee was on enforcement in the Food Stamp Program. Following that hearing, the chairman of the subcommittee held four hearings on the Food Stamp Program. From the testimony received in these hearings the committee formulated the principles that guided its reform. The conference agreement reflects these principles.  First, keep the Food Stamp Program as a safety net so that food can be provided as a basic need while States are undergoing the transition to State-design welfare programs.  Second, harmonize welfare and the Food Stamp Program for families receiving benefits from both programs.  Third, take the Food Stamp Program off automatic pilot.  Fourth, able-bodies participants without dependents must work in private sector jobs.  Fifth, tighten controls on waste and abuse and curb trafficking with increased penalties.  The Food Stamp Program provides benefits to an average of 27 million people each month at an annual cost of more than $25 billion. For the most part these benefits go to families in need of help and are used to buy food. There is no question in my mind that the Food Stamp Program helps poor people and those who have temporarily fallen on hard times. However, there is also no question in my mind that it is in need of reform.  The conference agreement reflects the principle that the Food Stamp Program should remain a Federal program. States will be undergoing a transition to State-designed welfare programs. During this period the Food Stamp Program will remain the safety net program and able to provide food as a basic need while this transition is taking place. The Food Stamp Program will remain at the Federal level and equal access to food for every American in need is ensured.  Given the hearing record, public support for real reform, and the dollars involved, the conference committee could not continue the program without significant reforms. The five hearings held in the Committee on Agriculture between February 1-14, 1995, dictated the course of the changes needed in the Food Stamp Program.  The agreement in the welfare reform conference adopted these changes. The Food Stamp Program is taken off of automatic pilot, except for annual increases in the cost of food, and control of spending for this program is returned to Congress. The food stamp deductions are kept at the current levels instead of being adjusted automatically for increases in the Consumer Price Index. Food stamp benefits will increase to reflect increase in the cost of food. Food stamp spending will no longer grow out of control. Oversight from the Agriculture Committee is essential so that when reforms are needed, the committee will act.  States are provided the option of harmonizing their new AFDC programs with the Food Stamp Program for those people receiving assistance from both programs. Since 1981, the committee has authorized demonstration projects aimed at simplifying the rules and regulations for those receiving assistance from AFDC and food stamps. States have complained for years about the disparity between AFDC and food stamp rules. This bill provides them the opportunity to reconcile these differences. It is now time to provide all States with this option.  The conference agreement on H.R. 4 contains a strong work program. Abled-bodied persons between the ages of 18 and 50 years, with no dependents, will be able to receive food stamps for 4 months. Eligibility will cease at the end of this period if they are not working at least 20 hours per week in a regular job. This rule will not apply to those who are in employment or training programs, such as those approved by the Governor of a State. A State may request a waiver of these rules if the unemployment rates are high or if there are a lack of jobs in an area. Republicans are not heartless, we just expect able-bodied people between 18 and 50 years, who have no one relying upon them, to work at least half-time if they want to continue to receive food stamps.  It is essential to begin to restore integrity to the Food Stamp Program. Incidences of fraud and abuse and losses to the program are steadily increasing and the public has lost confidence in the program. There are frequent reports in the press and on national television concerning abuses in the Food Stamp Program. Abuse of the program occurs in three ways: fraudulent receipt of benefits by recipients; street trafficking in food stamps by recipients; and trafficking offenses made by retail and wholesale grocers. H.R. 4 doubles the disqualification periods for food stamp participants who intentionally defraud the program. For the first offense the disqualification period is changed to 1 year; for the second offense the disqualification period is changed to 2 years. Food stamp recipients who are convicted for trafficking food stamps with a value over $500 will be permanently disqualified.  Trafficking by unethical wholesale and retail food stores is a serious problem. Benefits Congress appropriates for needy families are going to others who are making money from the program. Therefore the conference agreement limits the authorization period for stores and provides the Secretary of Agriculture with other means to ensure that only those stores abiding by the rules are authorized to accept food stamps. Finally, the conference includes a provision that all property used to traffic in food stamps and the proceeds traceable to any property used to traffic in food stamps will be subject to criminal forfeiture.  The electronic benefit transfer [EBT] systems have proven to be helpful in reducing street trafficking in food stamps and have provided law enforcement officers a trail through which they can find and prosecute traffickers. EBT systems do not end fraudulent activity in the Food Stamp Program; but they are instrumental in curbing the problem. Additionally, EBT is a more efficient method to issue food benefits for participants, States, food stores, and banks. For all of these reasons we include changes in the law to encourage States to go forward with EBT systems they deem most appropriate. Also the bill we are considering today lifts the restriction placed on State EBT systems by the Federal Reserve Board. This restriction is known as regulation E and it has hindered State progress on converting a coupon delivery system to an EBT system.  Mr. Speaker, this bill and the Agriculture Committee's contribution to the bill represent good policy. We have kept the Food Stamp Program as a safety net for families in need of food. We have taken the program off of automatic pilot and placed a ceiling on spending. We save $30 billion over 7 years. Congress is back in control of spending on food stamps. If additional funding is needed Congress will act to reform the program so that it operates within the amount of funding allowed or provide additional funding when necessary. States are provided with an option to harmonize food stamps with their new AFDC programs. We take steps to restore integrity to the Food Stamp Program by giving law enforcement and USDA additional means to curtail fraud and abuse. We encourage and facilitate EBT systems. We begin a strong work program so that able-bodied people with no dependents and who are between 18 and 50 years can receive food stamps for a limited amount of time without working.  This represents good food stamp policy. I hope all Members will agree with me and support the conference agreement on H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act of 1995.                              {time}  1330
