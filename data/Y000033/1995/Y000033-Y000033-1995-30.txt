Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 2243, to extend the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Act of 1984.  This bill, introduced by our distinguished colleague from California, Frank Riggs, will build upon the successes of the past decade and continue the important work of rebuilding valuable fish and wildlife populations in the Trinity River Basin.  Furthermore, the legislation will expand the membership of the Trinity River task force to include representatives from commercial, recreational, and tribal fishing interests. By broadening the membership of the task force, I am confident that the Secretary of the Interior will receive new and valuable advice on innovative ways to improve the Trinity River Basin in the future.  I urge the adoption of H.R. 2243, and I compliment Frank Riggs for his tireless work on behalf of his constituents.
