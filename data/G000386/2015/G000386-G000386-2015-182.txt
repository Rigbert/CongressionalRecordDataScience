 President, on this bill before the Senate, for a few days we will continue to debate legislation to fight crime and restore dignity to its survivors. I thank the majority leader for scheduling floor action on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This important bill is authored by our assistant majority leader, Senator Cornyn of Texas.  Human trafficking is a serious crime that is too often overlooked in its various forms, which include both labor trafficking and sexual servitude. It causes drastic harm to its victims. A form of modern-day slavery, human trafficking includes both adults and children, as well as noncitizens and citizens of our country. Experts tell us it is not limited to big cities or our Nation's coasts but stretches across the whole Nation, even to the rural parts of our country, including my Midwest. Indeed, it happens every day, everywhere in this country.  The Judiciary Committee met 2 weeks ago to hear testimony from a victim advocate, a law enforcement official, and a sex trafficking survivor about the challenges we face in fighting human trafficking. One witness, a criminal investigator from my State of Iowa who works for our Democratic attorney general Tom Miller, told us about a 20-year-old from my State who in December was abducted and forced into sexual servitude.  We have made progress in curbing human trafficking since the passage in 2000 of the Federal Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act--a measure I supported at that time--but there is still much work that remains to be done on this front. This bill before the Senate takes a creative and comprehensive approach to what is a pervasive and very troubling problem. The measure has been endorsed by over 200 groups, and it passed the Senate Judiciary Committee without a dissenting vote.  The centerpiece of this bill is its creation of a new fund called the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund, which will be used to support a host of programs and services for human trafficking and child pornography survivors. The fund will be financed not by taxpayers' dollars but by fines collected from individuals convicted of human trafficking and human smuggling crimes, making it deficit neutral.  If enacted, this bill will also equip law enforcement with new tools to fight trafficking. For example, it would make it easier for State law enforcement officials to wiretap human trafficking suspects without Federal approval. It also would expand the categories of persons who can be prosecuted for human trafficking. In addition, it clarifies that child pornography is a form of human trafficking.  This bill takes an extremely thoughtful and comprehensive approach, tackling not only the supply of human trafficking victims but also the demand for these victims. Tackling the problem on both fronts is something the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service tells us is absolutely necessary if we are to successfully curb human trafficking. If enacted, this bill will ensure that both the trafficker and the buyer will be prosecuted for their crimes.  We had an open and productive markup of this bill. I offered an amendment, which was accepted by voice vote, clarifying that Federal grant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking victims and offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those who serve runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth.  This amendment also updates the reauthorization language for the CyberTipline of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to ensure that child trafficking is specifically mentioned as a form of Internet-related child exploitation.  Finally, this amendment would require the Interagency Task Force to monitor and combat trafficking to identify best practices to prevent human trafficking.  Senator Blumenthal from the State of Connecticut also offered an amendment based on a bill he and Senator Kirk filed earlier this year, which was accepted in committee by a voice vote. Their bill, S. 575, known as the HERO Act, provides authorization for a program at the Department of Homeland Security that trains wounded warriors to assist in the effort to locate missing children.  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill now before if Senate. I commend Senator Cornyn, the lead sponsor of this measure, for his efforts to refine the bill and build such a substantial, very bipartisan coalition supporting it. I hope we will show the same bipartisan cooperation and support on the floor as we consider amendments. I look forward to a vote on this bill as soon as possible.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters in support of S. 178 from various organizations.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 23, 2015.     Senator Chuck Grassley,     Chair, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington,          DC.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator John Cornyn,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Amy Klobuchar,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Grassley, Leahy, Feinstein, Cornyn, and      Klobuchar: We write to you, the leaders of the U.S. Senate      Judiciary Committee, and to three committee Senators who have      been particularly sensitive to our (often ignored)      perspective. We write to you as survivors of sex trafficking      and commercial sexual exploitation. We write as survivors who      know, profoundly and personally, the harm caused by this      crime. And we write to you as survivor leaders of      organizations trying to prevent sex trafficking before it      victimizes others.       We write to express our support for legislation that makes      progress in three essential areas:       1. Identify new funding streams for victim services.      Current public budgets are stressed. Victims of sex      trafficking typically suffer multiple harms, requiring a      range of services from medical and psychological assistance      to treatment for the drug and alcohol addiction that so often      accompanies trafficking (addictions that make people      vulnerable to trafficking; addictions that develop or worsen      as people try to cope with the pain of this intimate form of      abuse). We've been told by law enforcement in numerous      jurisdictions that when services don't exist (mainly because      they are expensive) there's a disincentive to enforcing anti-     trafficking laws and identifying victims.       The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA), S. 178,      is innovative for creating a new fund to finance victim--     services an essential goal. It also achieves a second      principle we stand for: Making sex buyers accountable for the      harm they cause.       2. Prevent sex trafficking by targeting the buyers who      create demand. Logically, trafficking will never end until we      shrink the demand that creates the market. People still in      the life, still being exploited, sometimes avoid this      conclusion because they see no other options but the cycle of      violence in which they are trapped. We are strong witnesses      to the necessity of making the buyers pay, to make the crime      end.       Two bills in particular strength accountability in the sex      trafficking legal regime: S. 178 and Combat Human Trafficking      Act of 2015, S. 140. By clarifying congressional intent that      sex buyers be considered parties to the trafficking crime, by      compelling the Department of Justice to incorporate training      and technical assistance on investigating and prosecuting      buyers in its anti-trafficking programming, and by making the      crime more ``costly,'' we can finally begin to shrink its      incidence.       3. Treat victims as victims, not criminals, and let      survivor voices inform anti-trafficking policy. Two bills in      particular recognize these realities: the Stop Exploitation      Through Trafficking Act, S. 166, which gives states      incentives to approve ``Safe Harbor'' laws as well as job      training options for victims and the Survivors of Human      Trafficking Empowerment Act, which creates a survivors-led      U.S. Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to review federal      policy and programs.       Other proposals may also make valuable contributions, but      these are the three most important principles to incorporate      in new legislative initiatives.       Thank you for your consideration. Please let us know if you      have specific questions or would like more information on our      program activities.

Hon. Chuck Grassley,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: We are a      coalition of organizations from across the United States      dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable women and      children and write to express our support for the Justice for      Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, S. 178 (JVTA). The JVTA      would provide much needed services and support to domestic      victims of trafficking and provide a tool for law      enforcement, courts, and the anti-trafficking task forces      throughout the country to effectively target the demand that      fuels the sex trafficking market.       The JVTA provides unprecedented support to domestic victims      of trafficking, who are too often invisible and underserved,      by creating grants for state and local governments to develop      comprehensive support programs for victims. In addition, the      Act will directly assist domestic victims of trafficking by      finally allowing them access to the same services and support      systems that have been previously available only to foreign      victims of human trafficking in the U.S. The legislation      prioritizes victim assistance by training federal prosecutors      and judges on the importance of requesting and ordering      restitution, and training law enforcement on facilitating      physical and mental health services for trafficking victims      they encounter.       Every day in this country, thousands of women and children      are bought and sold. The unfettered demand for sex, with      underage girls in particular, has caused pimps and exploiters      to resort to more extreme tactics in order to meet the      growing demand. Women and children, especially girls, are      advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease,      anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every      state.       The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked      to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Any effort to      prevent sex trafficking must focus on the sex buyers and      facilitators. Without buyers of commercial sex, sex      trafficking would not exist.       This legislation is vital. The Justice for Victims of      Trafficking Act of 2015 represents an effort to provide the      necessary support services to our domestic victims of      trafficking in the U.S. and to target the culture of impunity      for those who seek to purchase sex, especially with children.      As leaders in the anti-trafficking, anti-violence, child      welfare, civil rights, runaway and homeless youth, and human      rights movements, we urge Congress to pass this critical      piece of legislation.

Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy: As      organizations representing law enforcement leaders, officers,      and state and local prosecutors from across the United      States, we write to express our support for S. 178, the      Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (JVTA). The      JVTA would provide much needed services and support to      domestic victims of trafficking. More importantly, this bill      provides necessary tools for law enforcement, courts, and the      anti-trafficking task forces throughout the country to      effectively target the demand that fuels the sex trafficking      market.       The JVTA provides unprecedented resources to address the      issue of domestic victims of trafficking, who are too often      invisible and underserved, by creating grants for state and      local governments to develop comprehensive systems to address      these crimes and provide services for victims. In addition,      the legislation allows wire-taps obtained through state      courts to be used for child sex trafficking, trains federal      prosecutors and judges on the importance of requesting and      ordering restitution, and trains law enforcement on      facilitating physical and mental health services for      trafficking victims they encounter.       According to the National Center for Missing & Exploited      Children (NCMEC), at least 100,000 American children each      year are the victims of commercial child prostitution and      child trafficking. Women and children, especially girls, are      also advertised online where buyers purchase them with ease,      anonymity, and impunity. This happens in every city, in every      state.       The elimination of sex trafficking is fundamentally linked      to targeting the demand for commercial sex. Without buyers of      commercial sex, sex trafficking would not exist. It is for      this reason and others stated above that we, as      representatives of law enforcement and the courts, support      this bill.       The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015      addresses a critical need by providing the necessary tools      and support services for domestic victims of trafficking in      the U.S. We urge Congress to pass this critical piece of      legislation.
