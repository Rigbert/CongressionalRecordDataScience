President, we just agreed to an amendment that will require 100 percent scanning of high-risk containers and put us on the path to having 100 percent scanning of containers, once it is feasible, once the technology is there.  I am concerned about the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. I don't think it has the kind of thought in it that was in the Coleman amendment. There are two provisions, in particular, that concern me.  One, it requires a plan for scanning containers that are going out of U.S. ports. That is going to slow down trade incredibly and will be a real problem for our farmers who are exporting their crops.  Second, it has a provision requiring consequences to be imposed on foreign ports or U.S. ports that do not meet the benchmarks described in the plan, which may include a loss of access to U.S. ports and fines. This will lead to retaliation by foreign ports.  I urge our colleagues to oppose the amendment.
