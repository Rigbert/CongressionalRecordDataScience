Chairman and Members, this amendment would prohibit funding for what is called the sustainable cities program, which is aimed at deploying U.S. technical expertise to urban energy planning for cities in places like India and China. So the gentleman and I look at this in a little bit of a different way.  Mr. Chairman, this effort is aimed at developing markets for U.S. products in places that are growing, and I think census figures show that India and China are absolutely growing, and their economies are growing.  In fact, in places like China, it is growing so fast that they are actually often stealing our technology and buying our companies out from underneath us, and we lose market edge.  Mr. Chairman, this particular program encompasses a variety of technical assistance activities to actually prime those markets for our clean technologies in places where there is population increase and a need for product and would help potentially to support the export of American clean energy technologies. That means jobs here at home; it means exports out of the United States, rather than imports in here in two major economies.  Working closely with U.S. companies, the Department of Commerce and other governments will focus on product testing and developing minimum standards, certifying that we can actually achieve the installation of these clean energy products. Here at home, obviously, we help our clean energy sector to develop.  Specific examples already underway include facilitating a memorandum of understanding that could lead to the first commercial-scale deployment of concentrated solar power deployment in China--a deal that could be valued at $350 million--with manufacturing of the key intellectual property here in the United States.  Another involves gaining access to the wind energy market in China--which is a growing market--coordination and exchanges between our department and private sector, our U.S. and Chinese cities, has led to increasing sales of U.S. clean energy goods in China already.  It is no secret that China has some challenges--and India has challenges--dealing with the enormity of their populations and the stress on their energy infrastructure.  We need to boost innovation here at home. This is one very modest program, but one, I think, that deserves attention. The last time I looked, we, as a country, had a gigantic trade deficit with China. That means more goods coming in here than our goods going out.  Mr. Chairman, this is one small step forward to try to penetrate those markets using some of the higher tech technologies that we have in the energy field, so I oppose the gentleman's amendment. I think he might look at the program in a different way than I do.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose it, as well, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).  The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Fleming  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Collins of Georgia). It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in House Report 113-486.
