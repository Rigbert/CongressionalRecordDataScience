But I think that the request that the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Nebraska makes is a reasonable one. I saw the thrashing we were going through at the beginning in the effort to work out a number of these amendments on a bipartisan basis. So I am happy to hold off a bit in terms of a vote to work further with the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Alabama.  Let me say, also, that I have noted that what the Senator from North Carolina has indicated he was interested in as well is quite similar to what I have sought to do. If anything, it just corroborates the proposition that we are discussing here today that there is bipartisan interest on both sides of Capitol Hill in this matter with the growth of managed care in our country.  This is an issue that millions of consumers care about that I think, for those of us who believe in managed care, has great potential. It is absolutely critical at this time to lock in these consumer protections and restrict these gag rules. From my previous experience in working with the Senator from Alabama, I know that he will pursue this in good faith. I ask that we have the vote a bit later and have an opportunity to consult further with the Senators from Nebraska and Alabama. I will be happy to yield.
