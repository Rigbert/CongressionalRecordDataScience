 President, I am pleased to introduce the Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act of 1999. This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require that all health plans provide coverage for breast reconstruction surgery after a woman has had a mastectomy for breast cancer.  Breast cancer is a frightening disease for women. It is common: a very high percentage of women who live long enough will eventually develop the disease. It is insidious: it can remain asymptomatic for many years before it is discovered. It is stealthy: it can recur many years after it has been thought to be cured. It is devastating: surgical treatment can be not only physically mutilating but psychologically devastating to a woman's sense of femininity and self-esteem. And it is everywhere: there is hardly anyone in this country who does not have a close friend or loved one who has been through an experience with breast cancer.  Fortunately, there has been tremendous progress in the treatment of breast cancer, and many women can now be cured. However, as these breast cancer survivors attempt to resume their normal lives after their treatment, they can still be impacted by the physical damage that follows mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery after mastectomy is thus a key part of restoring the breast cancer patient back to a satisfying and fulfilling life; it is not simply a cosmetic procedure to satisfy one's vanity.  In recognition of the importance of breast reconstruction after mastectomy, last year the Senate passed the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill. This legislation, which was signed into law by the President, amended the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to require that health plans provide coverage for breast reconstruction after mastectomy. This coverage also includes surgery on the unoperated breast, if necessary, as well as the cost of breast prostheses and repair to physical complications following mastectomy (e.g. lymphedema or arm swelling).  However, if we don't pass further legislation, the enforcement mechanisms available to the Department of Labor to ensure that health plans comply with the breast reconstruction requirement are generally limited to requesting a court to issue an injunction. The Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act will incorporate the breast reconstruction requirement into the Internal Revenue Code in order to enable civil monetary penalties to be imposed on violators of the law. Passage of this bill would continue the precedent established by all previous mandates on health plans (those in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act, and the Mental Health Parity Act), which were incorporated into all three statutes: Public Health Service Act, Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Internal Revenue Code.  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to finish the work that we began last year to ensure that women can be fully restored to health after fighting breast cancer, and I urge them to support the Breast Reconstruction Implementation Act of 1999 that I am introducing today.                                 ______                                       By
