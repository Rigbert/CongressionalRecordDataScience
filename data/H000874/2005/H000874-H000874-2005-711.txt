 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. The House will convene on Tuesday at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules; a final list of these bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of the week.  Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. for legislative business. We likely will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules, as well as S. 256, The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.  In addition, we also plan to consider H.R. 8, the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that we are finished voting for the week. We will not be in session tomorrow to accommodate Members traveling to Rome for the funeral services of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II.
