 President, the week of May 9, 1999 is National Hospital Week, when communities across the country celebrate the people that make hospitals the special places they are. This year's theme sums it up nicely: ``People Care, Miracles Happen.'' It recognizes the health care workers, volunteers and other health professionals who are there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, curing and caring for their neighbors who need them.  An example of this dedication is the Sexual Assault Response of Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California. The program won the American Hospital Association's prestigious Hospital Award for Volunteer Excellence for 1999, which highlights special contributions of hospital volunteers.  The Sexual Assault Response Service is a team of hospital volunteers that offers specialized assistance to sexual assault victims, families, hospital personnel and law enforcement agencies. To meet the program's high standards, volunteers get more than 60 hours of training.  Responding to a call from any area hospital emergency department, they provide support to victims while helping to solicit histories, preparing evidence collection kits, assisting with medical and legal examinations, and overseeing the completion of state forms. Volunteers work with the district attorney's office throughout the court process and offer one-on-one counseling, a referral service, a lending library and community education.  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Antelope Valley Hospital for this award-winning effort and for their generous contributions to their community.                          ____________________
