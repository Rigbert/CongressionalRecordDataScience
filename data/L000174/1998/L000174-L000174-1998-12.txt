President, the House has now passed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998. The premise for this federal law is a workable and protective federal standard. Throughout the legislative process, we have been careful to ensure that the pleading standard rules developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit would continue to govern. The Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress, which have worked together on this legislation, have all agreed on that standard. As the Conference Report and Statement of Managers makes clear, the recklessness standard and Second Circuit pleading rules continue in force. Indeed, the managers reiterated that the 1995 Private Securities Litigation Reform Act reinforced these standards, which continue to govern under the 1998 Act, as well. As a member of the Judiciary Committee and serving now as its ranking member, I am well aware that artificially high pleading standards could create unwanted and unneeded barriers to legitimate cases. That is not the intent of this legislation and should not be its effect.                          ____________________
