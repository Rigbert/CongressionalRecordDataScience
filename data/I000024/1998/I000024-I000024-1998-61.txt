President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10 o'clock. Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the substitute amendment to the product liability bill. Following that vote, a second vote will occur on adoption of the IRS conference report.  Following those two back-to-back votes, it will be the leader's intention to begin the Agriculture Export Relief Act or sanctions legislation. Hopefully, that bill will be considered under a brief time agreement of 2 hours.  Following that legislation, it is expected that the Senate will begin consideration of the higher education bill under the consent agreement of June 25, 1998. Therefore, several votes will occur during today's session of the Senate, with the first two votes occurring back to back at 10 a.m.                          ____________________
