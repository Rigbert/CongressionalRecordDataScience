Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately what the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren) said is not correct. There is a means test that is contained in this bill, but 11 United States Code, section 1307 which permits the conversion of a chapter 13 case to a chapter 7 case is not amended at all in any respect.  I would just like to read 11 U.S.C. 1307(a): ``A debtor may convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter 7 of this title at any time. Any waiver of the right to convert under this subsection is unenforceable.''  So if chapter 13 is such a straight jacket, the way out is through the conversion as provided for in section 1307.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).
