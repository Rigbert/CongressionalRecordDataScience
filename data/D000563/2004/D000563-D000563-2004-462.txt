HARKIN. Yes.  I thank the Senator from Nevada for his questions and for answering one of my questions, too. The Senator is right. There is a part in this budget where essentially the administration points out that with the huge deficits, the Social Security system will be unsustainable in its present form. Talk about code words. There is a code word for privatization. Charge Social Security, turn it over to the private marketplace, and let people take a chance on whatever. I think the Senator from Nevada is absolutely right. I will not say every Republican, because I can't cast the net that far. But I would say there are forces in the Republican Party--the Senator mentioned Senator Dole and Dick Armey. Newt Gingrich said he wanted Medicare to wither on the vine and also led the charge to try to privatize Social Security.  There are forces at work and they are in control of the Republican Party now that do not like Medicare. They do not like Social Security, and they will do whatever they can to get rid of it. I believe this budget is a step in that direction.  I yield to my friend from Illinois for a question.
