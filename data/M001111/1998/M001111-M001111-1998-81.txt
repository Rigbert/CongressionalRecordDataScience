 President. Mr. President, from the very beginning, we have sought to leave the DOD with the flexibility to write the directives on funeral support. No one wants to undermine the basic mission of this Department, especially our various veterans service organizations. They hold the Department of Defense and their service in high esteem.  Already, veterans across the country are seeking to fill the void left by the DOD's inability to provide burial honors for veterans. Veterans service organizations want to be involved in the funerals of their fellow veterans. And we want them to continue to be involved. But the DOD overlooks this important asset. We are simply saying that VSO's and particularly older veterans cannot meet the demand alone.  The DOD wants to study the issue. We know that more than 30,000 World War II vets are dying each month and the veterans death rate is increasingly rapidly. We need to act in the short term or America's heroic World War II veterans will be gone before the DOD decides to act. That's why my amendment gives the DOD 180 days to come up with new directives and legislative recommendations for the Congress. Every day we wait, a bit of our history passes away without recognition and gratitude.  My amendment is very straightforward. It simply calls the DOD's bluff on burial honors for veterans. The DOD will be directed to hold a conference on burial honors by October 31, 1998 in cooperation with the Department of Veterans Affairs and veterans service organizations. Following the enactment of this legislation, the DOD will have 180 days to report back to the Congress detailing new DOD directives on funeral support and burial honors policy and forward to Congress any appropriate legislative recommendations.  This is essentially what the DOD has pledged to the Congress in opposing more expansive legislation on funeral support. My amendment seeks to hold the DOD accountable to its pledges to the Congress and our veterans. This is a real opportunity to make progress on this issue and I encourage the DOD to make the most of this opportunity. Otherwise, I can assure the Department that we will be back with more definitive language defining what the Congress believes are appropriate burial honors.  Many of our services have taken a positive role, and I especially commend the Commandant of the Marine Corps who issued a white paper on funeral support. General Krulak, to his credit, says we can and we will honor current and former marines.  I ask unanimous consent that his white letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        White Letter of 12-02-97     From: Commandant of the Marine Corps.     To: All General Officers, All Commanding Officers, All        Officers in Charge.     Subject: Funeral Support.       1. This past January, I signed ALMAR 003-97 which      emphasized the Marine Corps' commitment to funeral support.      Properly laying a fallen Marine to rest is one of the final      tributes that the Marine Corps can render to our own. This      service provides comfort to grieving families and      demonstrates our wholehearted and enduring commitment to      those who have earned the title ``Marine.'' Unfortunately, I      continue to receive letters and E-mails from family members,      disappointed that the Marine Corps failed to support them      during their hours of need. I am appalled, dismayed, and      outraged that I continue to receive these letters. Failing to      provide funeral support to a Marine, for whatever reason, is      completely contradictory to our ethos and diminishes the      value of our fallen comrades' service.       2. Specific guidance for funeral support is contained in      MCO P3040.4D. The Marine Corps Casualty Procedures Manual,      and reemphasized in ALMAR 003-97, Military Funeral Support.      While I understand that an individual unit may not be able to      support every funeral request, I cannot imagine our precious      Corps ever turning down the request to properly bury a fellow      Marine. If your unit cannot provide a funeral detail, find      one that will.       3. I want my intent and guidance to ring loud and clear      concerning funeral support to families of Marines and former      Marines--it is our duty and we would have it no other way!      Anything less is UNACCEPTABLE. I expect this guidance to be      disseminated to every Marine Corps command, inspector-     instructor staff, recruiting station, and administrative      detachment. Ensure that all units are fully aware of my      feelings on this matter and they uphold the long tradition of      properly honoring a fallen Marine.                                                      C.C. Krulak.
