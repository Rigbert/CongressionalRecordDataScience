Mr. Speaker, next week the United Nations begins another review of the budget needs for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. This tribunal has already faced numerous obstacles to its establishment and considerable bureaucratic and political barriers to its staffing; worse still, it continues to face opposition from those who would rather negotiate with war criminals than see them in jail. In spite of numerous political and procedural roadblocks, the tribunal issued its first indictment in early November, is proceeding with investigations, and is expected to bring cases to trial later this year.  This progress by no means guarantees long-term success, Mr. Speaker. In fact, in an article published in the Washington Post, Tom Warrick, an attorney who assisted the head of the United Nations War Crimes Commission, points out that the results of a relatively obscure U.N. committee may determine ``whether those ultimately responsible for ethnic cleansing are ever to be brought to justice.'' And, as those who oppose this tribunal have learned, what they can't defeat openly through the political process, they may be able to gut in the United Nations closed-door budget negotiations.  Nongovernmental experts have already suggested that the $28 million sought by tribunal officials may be too low, given the costs of gathering testimony from the thousands of victims of the extensive list of deplorable war crimes and in light of the on-site investigations that the effective prosecution of war criminals will require. Nevertheless, it appears that securing even these funds may be an uphill battle with the U.N. bureaucracy.  Accordingly, I have written to the President, along with the Cochairman of the Helsinki Commission, Senator D'Amato, and Representative Steny Hoyer, the former chairman of and now ranking House minority member on the Commission, urging the President to instruct the U.S. delegation to the United Nations to press vigorously at these upcoming budget meetings to ensure adequate funding for the tribunal. The establishment of this body, against so many odds, is a credit to strong U.S. leadership. But, without proper funding, Mr. Speaker, the tribunal will never be able to execute the historic tasks that have been set for it. We have also indicated our support for an additional voluntary contribution to the tribunal by the United States of an amount not less than the $3 million cash contribution provided last year.  Mr. Speaker, as the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, stated at the Helsinki Commission's hearing just 2 weeks ago, war crimes and genocide continue in Bosnia even now, during the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. I cannot overstate my conviction that holding war criminals accountable for the heinous crimes they have committed in this conflict will be an essential element for any long-term resolution of this tragedy. If the United States, at this juncture, inexplicably reduces the level of financial support it has provided to the tribunal, it might send a regrettable signal of weakening U.S. resolve to see war criminals held truly accountable. We must not let that happen.                          ____________________
