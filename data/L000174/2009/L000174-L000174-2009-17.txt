President, last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the media shield bill in a bipartisan vote of 14 to 5. This legislation would establish a qualified privilege for journalists to protect their confidential sources and the public's right toknow. At a time when the Senate is working to recognize the importance of protecting Americans' first amendment rights, I am proud to recognize a Burlington lawyer who was recently recognized by the Vermont Press Association for his lifetime commitment to the first amendment and the public's right to know.  On December 3, 2009, Robert B. Hemley was awarded the Matthew Lyon Award during the Association's annual awards banquet in Montpelier, Vermont. As a fellow Matthew Lyon Award recipient, I share with Robert a passion about the need for each generation to defend the first amendment rights that are so crucial to all Vermonters and to every American. Robert has worked to bring greater transparency and accountability to our government by representing journalists and newspapers in instances in which they were improperly forced to testify in violation of the first amendment, and by helping to create the Vermont Coalition for Open Government.  In each era there will always be much to do to bring greater openness and accountability to government of, by, and for the people. I am pleased to know Robert Hemley will continue to bring his expertise and dedication to this fight.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the St. Albans Messenger.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the St. Albans Messenger, Dec. 1, 2009]  Burlington Lawyer Wins Recognition for Commitment to First Amendment       Montpelier.--Burlington lawyer Robert B. Hemley has been      selected to receive the Matthew Lyon Award for his lifetime      commitment to the First Amendment and public's right to know      the truth in Vermont.       The Vermont Press Association is scheduled to present the      award to Hemley during its annual awards banquet at noon      Thursday (Dec. 3) at the Capitol Plaza in Montpelier.       VPA President Bethany Dunbar, editor of the Chronicle in      Barton, said Hemley has been a First Amendment leader in the      fight against sealed public records, closed courtrooms and      improper attempts to force reporters to testify in violation      of the First Amendment. Hemley also has successfully defended      the media against defamation and invasion-of-privacy lawsuits      and other false claims.       The VPA created the award to honor people who have an      unwavering devotion to the five freedoms within the First      Amendment and to the belief that the public's right to know      the truth is essential in a self-governed democracy.       The First Amendment award is named for the former Vermont      congressman, who was jailed in 1798 under the Alien and      Sedition Act for sending a letter to the editor criticizing      President John Adams.       While Lyon was serving his federal sentence in a Vergennes      jail, Vermonters re-elected him to the U.S. House of      Representatives. Hemley, who is a shareholder in the Gravel      and Shea law firm, has been recruited to the write the      Vermont section of the national guides on libel, privacy, and      access for both the media Libel Resource Center and the      Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press for more than      20 years.       He has shared his expertise and participated in various      training sessions for judges, lawyers, the media and the      public. He helped create the Vermont Coalition for Open      Government and has been invited through the years by the      Vermont Legislature to offer testimony on several First      Amendment issues.       Hemley has represented: St. Albans Messenger, Burlington      Free Press, Rutland Herald, Times Argus, Valley news,      Bennington Banner, the Associated Press, United Press      International, USA Today, New York Times, New York Daily      News, along with WCAX-TV, Vermont Public Radio and several      weekly newspapers, including in Randolph, Stowe, Waitsfield      and Burlington.       Before arriving in Vermont in 1976, Hemley was an assistant      U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and also      worked for a Wall Street law firm. He earned degrees from      Amherst College and New York University Law School and is      listed in the Best Lawyers in America. Hemley has chaired the      District Court Advisory Committee for Vermont since 1993.       He lives in Burlington with his wife, Marcia, and they have      three children: Amanda, an assistant state's attorney for      Dade County, Fla.; Mark, who lives in Boston, and Ian, who      attends school in Atlanta.       Previous Matthew Lyon winners include Patrick J. Leahy for      his work as a state prosecutor and as a U.S. senator; and      Edward J. Cashman for his efforts as Chittenden Superior      Court clerk, a state prosecutor and state judge.                          ____________________
