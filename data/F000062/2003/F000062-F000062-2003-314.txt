 That is why we suspect it. It is hard to prove.  Again, there have been three arrests of Enron traders who devised these schemes. Actually two were plea-bargained. There was a recent arrest last week of this fellow who apparently set these trading schemes up for Enron.  To have a transparent marketplace, I think, gives confidence to the 50 percent of the people who are small investors who would want to participate in the market. You have to show there is oversight. You have to show it is up and up, that it is a legitimate bona fide marketplace with trades that mean something.  In my heart of hearts, I believe that a lot of this kind of activity is what amounted to a 400-percent increase in the cost of power in 1 year in California alone.
