President, on the first day of this millennium, January 1, 2000, the newest Federal judge, and the first of the millennium, was sworn in. Richard Linn became a member of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals at the stroke of midnight, standing in the Federal Circuit's courthouse, with a view of the Washington Monument lit behind him, and the oath being administered by Chief Judge H.R. Mayer.  President Clinton had been told of the hundreds of nominations he would make during his Presidency, one he would never regret would be that of Judge Linn. How true that prediction. Judge Linn has brought dignity, expertise, and judicial excellence that could set the model for all our Federal courts. His calm but brilliant analyses of our most complex intellectual property cases reflect the extensive experience he had before going on the bench. This experience now benefits all Americans.  My wife Marcelle and I and our children have been privileged to have known Dick and Patti Linn for over a generation, as well as their wonderful daughters, Debbie and Sandy, and all their family. This weekend, their children, son-in-law Erik, and grandchildren, Jaret and Dakota, as well as other members of their family, will gather to unveil a portrait of Judge Linn. I hope that as people visit the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals building or are there on business, that they will pause and look. It will give them a chance to see the face of justice and a man I admire greatly.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go back on the matter before us, with the time still being reserved to me.
