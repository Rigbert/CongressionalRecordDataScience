 I thank the Senator for this colloquy. But you asked what it means that ``the Senate should reject any procedural maneuver that''--that is in quotes--and what does that really mean?  Well, it applies only to the Senate procedural motions. By itself it would have no effect on any substantive provision. That is the way it is commonly understood under Senate rules. It means, if adopted, the amendment would not remove any provision that has been identified as a tax increase on middle-class taxpayers, which is precisely what the Senator is trying to do. So basically it means nothing.
