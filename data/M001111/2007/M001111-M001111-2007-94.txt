 President, I agree that we have seen serious disruptions in payments to project-based section 8 facilities in recent months. That has caused real difficulties for many owners. I do believe that HUD needs to have processes in place that will make funding to project owners in as timely manner as possible. We also need to have funding in place where HUD can make its payments. I appreciate the Senators' interest in this area, and we will work to avoid a repeat of what we have seen over the past 3 months.
