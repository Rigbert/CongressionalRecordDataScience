Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.  The gentleman needs to read our bill. It doesn't say that the insurance companies must sell those policies. That may be in the Senate bill, the Landrieu bill. It is not in this bill.  I yield 1 minute to the vice chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).
