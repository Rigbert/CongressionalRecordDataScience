President, the Senator from Idaho is correct. Let me say to all our colleagues, this bill does not change current law. Our purpose in drafting S. 2796 was to make it clear that, in our view, the Second Circuit reached an incorrect decision in its interpretation of the Lanham Act. S. 2796 would simply restate the original intent of Congress when we enacted the Lanham Act, and indicate our support of the view that these marks are to be given equal legal treatment by the courts, not the anomalous reading that the Second Circuit gave to it in the Idaho Potato Commission decision.
