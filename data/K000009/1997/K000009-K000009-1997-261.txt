Speaker, I rise today to honor the passing of an outstanding citizen,optimist, business leader, and family man from Toledo, OH. Virgil Gladieux died on February 27, 1997.  Beginning with a small business selling boxed lunches out of the trunk of his car, Mr. Gladieux developed a food service empire, with operations in 35 States, in airports and on airlines, in schools, colleges, factories, hotels, and turnpike restaurants nationwide. He also founded and developed the Toledo Sports Arena and the Toledo Beach Marina and North Cape Yacht Club. With a keen eye for opportunity, Virgil Gladieux came to symbolize a man of humble beginnings who rose to become a civic-minded entrepreneur.  Ever mindful of his responsibilities to others, Virgil Gladieux was very active in civic affairs and philanthropic efforts. Throughout his lifetime, he served in various capacities on over 70 area boards, committees, and clubs. Extensively honored for his service, his most recent recognition came last fall, when he was given the annual volunteer award from the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, an organization he helped to inspire in 1984 for those who have made significant contributions to the United Way.  Virgil Gladieux, a devoted family man, leaves behind a legacy of dynamism, unparalleled entrepreneurial spirit, and community service. With gratitude and admiration for his efforts, we extend our deepest sympathy to his wife of 67 years, Beatrice, his children, Therese and Timothy, his sister and sister-in-law, his nieces, nephews, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Our entire community shall miss his effervescence and spirited presence that made us all better for knowing him.                          ____________________
