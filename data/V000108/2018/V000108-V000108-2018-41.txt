Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate thirty individuals who will take their oaths of citizenship on May 11, 2018. This memorable occasion will be held at the United States Courthouse and Federal Building in Hammond, Indiana.   America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the world to the United States in search of better lives for their families. Oath ceremonies are a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America.   On May 11, 2018, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oaths of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Kashif Javed, Tetiana Ivanovna Olszewski, Leticia San Pascual Santos, Tariq Javed, Mario Isabel Garcia, Emilija Muvceski, Naiyang Ma, Ahmed Mohamed Abdalla, Sung Gun Wang, Missin Mahu Ruth Hountin, Florencia Stoll, Sheku Abraham Swaray, Bradley Dennis Smith, Aruna Thinakkal, Elizabeth Salceda, Vaibhav Agarwal, Charu Agarwal, Amitava Krishna Dutt, Natalia Yepez Frias, Dima Yasin, Nezira Zigic, Yessica Edely Garcia, Kerwin Otis Sheldon Huggins, Martha Isabel Carlton, Pauline Shelliann Montique, Ricardo Almanza, Hui Min Justina Bernadette Barkley, Hugo Enrique Gonzalez, Pete Nikolovski, and Caleb Ikenna Okoli.   Although each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals who will become citizens of the United States of America on May 11, 2018. They, too, are American citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                            ____________________
