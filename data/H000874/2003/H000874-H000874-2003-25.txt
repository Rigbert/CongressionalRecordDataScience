Leader, the FSC bill, Foreign Sales Corporations Extraterritorial Income legislation, you did not mention that. Can you tell me when or if you expect that bill to come to the floor? I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. We do not intend to consider that, the tax proposal, next week, but would still like for the House to consider it before the end of this session and before the EU has the opportunity to retaliate against American businesses.
