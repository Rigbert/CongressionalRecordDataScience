Speaker, I am pleased to recognize a most auspicious event in the lifeof Salem Lutheran Church in Toledo, Ohio. On Sunday, November 4, 2001, the congregation will celebrate its 160th anniversary. Such an occasion is truly a monument to faith.  Salem is Toledo's first and oldest Lutheran church, having been founded in 1842 in one of Toledo's most historic neighborhoods, the near North End. Originally made up of the German, Greek and Syrian immigrants in the neighborhood at that time, the church's congregation changed through the years and remains reflective of the diversity of its neighborhood yet today. Particularly in its second century of life, Salem Lutheran Church has been a place of constancy in a neighborhood and for a people who welcome many newcomers. Comfort is found within its walls for local people, but also those who are poor and often beaten down by serious struggles of life. The church's building houses not only a place of worship but also provides a place for its neighbors to come together to eat and for other community services and church-based programs benefiting them.  Salem's pastor and parishioners have been active in the Toledo Area Lutheran Coalition, a cluster of churches dedicated to a cooperative relationship. It is a teaching parish, serving as a host site for Synod youth interns and seminary interns several times since 1994. In the words of its current pastor, today ``Salem serves as a model for central city multicultural ministry, offering an ecumenical ministry site . . . to grow in service.'' She describes the congregation's move toward the future noting, ``there is a sense of gratitude we are still here, an awareness of the resurrection power of God, and a renewed sense of mission with the people of our neighborhood.''  Following Christ's admonition, whatsoever you do to the least among us, that you do unto Me, the congregation of Salem Lutheran Church flowered in the neighborhood in which these He described have lived. In its past, its present, and into its future, Salem Lutheran Church will always be a place of faith, hope, and love, and a testament to Christ's Word and the perseverance of His followers. As today's congregation reflects on its past and is inspired by its future, I am pleased to offer my voice to the chorus of congratulations on its 160th anniversary.                          ____________________
