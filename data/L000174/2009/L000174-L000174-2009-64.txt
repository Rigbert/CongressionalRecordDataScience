They had to wait month after month because the Republican side would not allow us to even proceed to them by filibustering or threatening a filibuster. You have de facto de jure filibusters. During President Clinton's time, the Republicans pocket-filibustered 60 of President Clinton's nominees.  I yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Pennsylvania.
