 President, let me echo the remarks of my good friend, the majority leader, about the circuit court judge situation. We are off to a good start. I wish to thank him, and I wish to thank Chairman Leahy for moving the Randy Smith nomination to the Ninth Circuit. As the majority leader has indicated, that vote will be at 10:30. We have had very good conversations, the majority leader and myself, about restoring comity to the Senate on the business of dealing fairly with the President's nominations for circuit court judgeships.
