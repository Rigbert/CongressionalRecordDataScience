President, again, I hope our colleagues will take a hard look at this amendment and will decide it warrants their support to address one of the major problems that has hampered emergency response, decreased the effectiveness of those who are putting their lives on the line, and truly can be a matter of life and death.  Let me end my comments by applauding, nevertheless, the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee for their hard work. Senator Byrd, Senator Murray, and Senator Cochran have done a terrific job on a very difficult issue, but this is an attempt to make their good work even better.  I thank the Chair.
