 President, I am concerned about a $257,000,000 decrease in appropriated funding for the United States Customs Service. Last year, Congress aided this agency through the Omnibus and Emergency SupplementalAppropriations, that devotes a large percentage of its aggregate budget to preventing the smuggling of Narcotics into the United States, with an additional $265,000,000. The Appropriations committee, this year, also recognizing the need of the Customs Service to react to changing smuggling modes and complex money laundering schemes increased the Customs Service total funding by $315,000,000. This is $315,000,000 over the President's budget estimate and Congress needs to maintain this effort. Drug trafficking is a never-ending battle. The demand for illegal drugs in the United States remains strong. The U.S. Customs Service is one of our front line drug enforcement agencies that protects America's borders every day from professional drug traffickers and money launders. Congress needs to fully and adequately fund the salaries and expenses and needed modernization for one of our major first line counter-drug agencies.  I am aware of the hard choices the Committee had to make in coming up with the current funding level for Customs. But I strongly feel that we must do more. Not only has legal trade expanded dramatically but so has illegal drug trafficking and alien smuggling. We have not supported the modernization or expansion of Customs to keep pace. We cannot maintain our commitment to fighting the smuggling of illegal drugs without more and better. professional liability insurance coverage for senior federal employees
