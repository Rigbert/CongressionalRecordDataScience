 President, it is with great privilege that I congratulate COL Anthony Wright, Seattle district engineer for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, on his well-deserved retirement after 30 years with the Army Corps. Colonel Wright has been stationed with the Seattle District for 3 years and my staff and I have had the pleasure of working extensively with him during that time.  Western Washington State has suffered several severe storms in the last few years, resulting in devastating floods, major losses of infrastructure, and millions of dollars of damage to homes and businesses. Under Colonel Wright's leadership, the Army Corps responded quickly and efficiently to minimize the threats of rising floodwaters, and for this we are very grateful. His professionalism and expertise helped our region through disasters and undoubtedly lessened the destruction and prevented the loss of life.  An example of Colonel Wright's leadership ability was his response to a storm that caused serious damage to the Howard Hanson Dam in King County, raising the flood threat for hundreds of thousands of residents in the Green River Valley, which is home to one of the largest manufacturing and distribution bases on the West Coast. Colonel Wright and the Army Corps reacted quickly and decisively to counter this vulnerability, working with local governments and the public to ensure that the region was prepared until the dam could be repaired.  On behalf of all Washingtonians, I thank Colonel Wright for his dedication to the safety and well-being of the people of western Washington. His knowledge, experience, and tireless effort will be sorely missed. I congratulate Colonel Wright and wish he and his family the best of luck in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
