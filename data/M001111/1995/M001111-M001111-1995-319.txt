  I am proud of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act we passed last year. It is a comprehensive approach to solving our Nation's crime problem. It includes: funds for 100,000 new police officers across the Nation; a ban on the manufacture, sale, and future possession of 19 semiautomatic assault weapons; and increased penalties for Federal violent crimes and sex crimes.  However, passing tougher laws and putting more police on our streets will not stop the violence that is ravaging our Nation. These measures, while effective, are only part of the larger solution. We also must focus on preventive measures if we hope to find permanent solutions to the epidemic of violence.  Last year's crime bill does just that. The legislation includes: the Violence Against Women Act, which authorizes funding for rape education and community prevention programs, battered women's shelters, and a national family violence hotline.  The crime bill also authorizes local grants for education, after-school safe haven programs, and other initiatives aimed at reducing gang membership among young people. The bill provides for grants to localities for crime prevention measures, including: police partnerships for children, supervised child visitation centers, and partnerships between senior citizens and police.  In addition, the legislation provides grants to law enforcement to create partnerships with child and family support agencies to fight crimes committed against children.  Madam President, I believe in the value and necessity of these vital programs. As a woman, a mother, and a former teacher I want to make sure we let our children know we care about them, they can trust us to do the right thing, and we will not turn our backs on them.  Although I am pleased that Republican proposals to redirect these important prevention dollars do not target the Violence Against Women Act, I am disturbed about the implications for programs aimed at our Nation's youth.  Our children are afraid, and sadly, they have every reason to be. Every day, 5,703 teenagers are victims of violent crimes. Every 2 hours, a child is murdered. Every 5 seconds of the schoolday, a student drops out of public school.  We, as adults, have a responsibility to care for our children, to teach them to value themselves and their communities, and not to give up on them. It is time for us as adults to address the issue of violence honestly. Violence is a symptom of deeper problems. Lets not restrict our attention to punishing criminals and building more prisons, while ignoring the causes of violence among our children.  I have talked with young people throughout the State of Washington. My overwhelming conclusion is that a lot of the youth on our streets have been victims themselves--victims of abusive adults, victims of our overburdened school system, and victims of a juvenile justice system that cannot respond to their real needs. These disaffected kids invariably have kids of their own, and the cycle of violence begins again. Prevention and education are the keys to breaking this dangerous pattern of violence.  Madam President, the dollars allocated to fund the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 are extremely important. I applaud Senator Byrd's effort to safeguard these crime fighting dollars.                      Unanimous-Consent Agreements
