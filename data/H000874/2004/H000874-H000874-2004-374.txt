Speaker, one week ago today, the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), told the Members of this body and the national television audience watching C-SPAN, and I quote, ``It is responsibility week here in the House.'' ``It is responsibility week here in the House.''  Well, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader was only half right. Last week indeed was responsibility week, but the real responsibility was being exercised not here in this House but on the other side of Capitol Hill.  While we named post office buildings, honored professional sports teams, and passed legislative solutions in search of national problems, the other Chamber adopted a bipartisan pay-as-you-go measure that repudiates the central fiction of the Republican Party's fuzzy math: that we can somehow reign in record budget deficits created by the Bush administration and the Republican-controlled Congress while ignoring the consequences of tax cuts.  Do not take it from me, my Republican friends.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
