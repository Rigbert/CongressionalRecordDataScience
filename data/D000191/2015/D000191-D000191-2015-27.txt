Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Unfortunately, the language of this amendment is so broad that it would basically preempt meal, rest break, and other laws that relate to truck drivers in 21 States. So I think this is an issue of states' rights.  It is an issue of an overly broad attempt to address what is a real contradiction that was created by the ninth circuit, that if you have a truck driver who is operating long haul through a number of States having to comply with new rest or meal break requirements on the Federal clock, which I can barely understand with the new requirements on rest, every time the driver crosses a State line, it is confusing and I think is a potential impediment to interstate commerce.  We offered an amendment that would have specifically addressed that concern. Unfortunately, we weren't able to reach agreement on that. Mr. Larsen of Washington State submitted that amendment to the Committee on Rules. It was not allowed. Unfortunately, we only have this overly broad amendment.  This would not just affect interstate trucking; it would preempt California's wage, hour, and rest break rules for intrastate trucking in the State ofCalifornia and 20 other States. In fact, the case that was before the ninth circuit was intrastate truck drivers who were delivering appliances.  It also would go further. We spent a lot of time when I chaired the subcommittee on the issue of these, basically, pressed labor, who were theoretically purchasing their drayage trucks to haul cargo out of Long Beach and out of Los Angeles, who were really basically being enslaved. They were never going to pay them off. They were never going to own them. In fact, they were hot-seated. Other people were also buying the same truck at different hours of the day. Nobody ever got the trucks.  This would basically preempt any laws in California so that drivers could be paid on a piece rate no matter what the congestion conditions: Sorry. Gee, we paid you for that load. So it took you 8 hours. That is the way it is. So you only earned 49 cents an hour. Sorry. Because wage and hour laws don't apply to you.                              {time}  1545  It is just an overly broad attempt to address what has, at its core, a contradiction under the FAAA Act, the ruling about interstate commerce. So I would have to oppose the amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
