President, as I was saying, we do have a lot of people who want to be heard on this bill. I believe I have said several times this could very well be the most significant vote we will have this year. It is a vote that we actually had last year. Senator Jeffords and I worked for 3 years on this bill, along with Senator Bond and Senator Baucus.
