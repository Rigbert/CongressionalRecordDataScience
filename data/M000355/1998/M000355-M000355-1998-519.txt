 President, I rise today to recognize the employees at the Erlanger, Kentucky, headquarters of Toyota's North American manufacturing operations as well as those at the Georgetown Toyota assembly plant whose dedication and hard work have resulted in the Toyota Camry becoming the number one selling car in the United States for 1997.  By recording its best-ever sales month in December, the Camry edged past traditional favorites--the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus--to become the best selling car in the United States--the first time a Toyota automobile has been so recognized.  Because dealers had a hard time keeping both the Accord and the Camry in stock this year, the primary factor in determining which model sold best was which company could get the most out of its assembly line. I am proud to report that, because of the industriousness of those men and women who work in the Georgetown plant, there were enough Camrys on dealer's lots to outsell both the Accord and the Taurus. And by the way, 80% of all Camrys sold in the U.S. have been assembled in Georgetown.  This past year, the Camry plant in Georgetown increased production by 12% over the previous year, mostly by improving efficiency on the assembly line and pressing suppliers to keep up with their demand for raw materials.  Despite the tremendous growth this year, officials at the Georgetown plant say that they intend to build even more Camrys next year, as they improve the speed of the assembly line and further improve the plant's efficiency.  Mr. President, again, I would like to congratulate all those men and women associated with Toyota Motor Sales, USA, particularly those in Erlanger and Georgetown, whose dedication and hard work made the Camry 1997's top selling car.                          ____________________
