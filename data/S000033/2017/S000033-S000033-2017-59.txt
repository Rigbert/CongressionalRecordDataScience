 President, this amendment says no to the cutting of $1 trillion from Medicaid and forcing 15 million Americans off the health insurance they currently have, while at the same time providing a $1.9 trillion tax break to the top 1 percent. This is not what the American people want; it is what the billionaire class wants. I make the radical suggestion that maybe we listen to ordinary Americans and not just wealthy campaign contributors.
