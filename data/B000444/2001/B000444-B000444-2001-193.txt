 President, I rise today in support of the amendmentbeing offered by my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin. Earlier this week, Senator Kerry and I offered a similar amendment that called for voluntary spending limits and partial public financing. Senator Harkin's amendment differs in some respects to the proposal that we offered, but it still seeks to alleviate the same problem: How can we reduce the obscene amount of special interest money that is being spent in Senate campaigns today? And while I know that Senator Harkin's amendment will not pass, I nevertheless believe that it is truly needed to reform our campaign finance system.  Since 1976, while the general cost of living has tripled, total spending on congressional campaigns has gone up eightfold. For the winning candidates, the average House race went from $87,000 to $816,000 in 2000. And here on the Senate side, winners spent an average of $609,000 in 1976, but last year that average shot up to $7 million.
