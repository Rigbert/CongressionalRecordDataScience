 But the court has made it quite clear that it is constitutionally protected speech. No matter how much we do not like it when people criticize us, these individuals and groups have a constitutional right to engage in these independent expenditures. As a result of the Colorado case, parties do as well.  In looking at the Hollings amendment, it seems to me that Congress would be given the power to completely shut up these groups. They could say, ``No longer can you speak at all.'' That way, we would be able to silence all of these people who do not like what we stand for, totally--totally--under this. If Congress is given the power to control the amount of expenditures that may be made ``by''--I assume that is the candidate--``in support of,'' referring to outside groups, or ``in opposition to,'' referring to outside groups, why, by golly, under this amendment we could shut them up entirely. Our lives would be a lot easier. We could just limit spending in the campaign to about $5,000, eliminate all the speech of these outside groups. Boy, you would never have any turnover here, would you?
