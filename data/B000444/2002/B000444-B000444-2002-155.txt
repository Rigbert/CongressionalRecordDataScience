 In recent days, hundreds of reporters and international relief workers have descended on the camp, and not one has verified these claims.  In fact, the Washington Times today quotes the senior official in Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement in Jenin as saying that the death toll stands at fifty six. Other reports place the number around fifty one.  Even one death is one too many, and there is still considerable excavation work to do in the camp. But it seems apparent that there was no massacre in Jenin.  Let me say that again. It seems apparent that there was no massacre in Jenin.  There are not 500 civilian dead, as the Palestinians initially claimed. What happened in Jenin was an intense battle fought at close quarters in which 23 Israeli soldiers also lost their lives in Jenin. And the leader of Fatah said today, trying to make the case that they ``won'' the battle, that ``although we lost 56, they lost 23.''  The relatively high number of Israeli casualties is in itself an indicator of what went on in the camp. Had the Israelis chosen, they could have easily sat back and pummeled the camp from afar, and starved the terrorists. Instead, they chose to do things the hard way. They went house to house to house, from booby-trapped house to booby-trapped house to booby-trapped house. In doing so to avoid civilian casualties, they inflicted casualties upon themselves. That is why they went house to house--not to inflict civilian casualties.  Were there civilian casualties? Almost certainly there were. But there is a world of difference between the deliberate targeting of civilians and the unintentional and inevitable casualties that were bound to occur in a place such as Jenin where terrorists deliberately hid themselves among civilians.  Remember we got a dose of that ourselves during the gulf war. As you recall, Saddam Hussein hid himself and others in the midst of civilian populations in civilian centers. That is the picture I believe will emerge as the facts are examined in the cold light of day--that there was no massacre, and that, although there were civilians killed, the number was relatively small, more in line with the number of Israelis killed--that is, proportionately. And I think the world should understand that.  There has been considerable discussion in recent days about a United Nations' factfinding panel assembled by Secretary General Kofi Annan. As of a couple of hours ago, the U.N. officially decided not to send the factfinding mission. But the impression we have heard in the world is that the reason the factfinding mission was not sent is because of Israeli intransigence.  U.N. leadership, I believe under Kofi Annan, had the best intentions. But Israel has voiced what I believe to be legitimate concerns about the composition, the procedures, and terms of reference this team was supposed to operate under. Reports indicate that the team is now disbanding.  Unfortunately, in my view, the United Nations should have met the legitimate concerns and proceeded with the mission. It is hard to blame Israel for having doubts about the objectivity of a factfinding team.  Israel has also voiced concerns over the lack of adequate representation onthe U.N. team of counterterrorism and military experts. It argues, in my view, with justification that the events in Jenin must be seen in their proper context.  Israel did not invade Jenin on a whim; it did so to destroy the terrorist infrastructure, and only after the Palestinian Authority--this is an important point--only after the Palestinian Authority, whom the Israelis and the rest of the world equipped with weapons to keep peace and order--only after the Palestinian Authority refused to carry out its obligations to destroy this terrorist infrastructure.  According to the Israeli Government, 23 suicide bombers came from Jenin. These 23 were responsible for the deaths of 57 Israelis, and the injury of 1,000 more.  Is it fair--and I think it is fair--to ask the U.N. what its officials were saying to the Palestinian Authority about the use of a U.N.-run camp as a launching pad for terrorism? To many Israelis, it appears as if the U.N. turned a blind eye to Palestinian terrorism, while it seems intent on smearing Israel for its legitimate response to that terror.  I would suggest a fairer thing to do would be for the U.N. to hold an internal review and ask internally what the U.N. team in Jenin, responsible for Jenin, knew or did not know about the role the Palestinian Authority was playing. What did they know? I am not saying they were complicitous. What did they know?  With such a breakdown, wouldn't we be looking if it occurred here? If there was a group in charge of overseeing a particular dilemma within the United States, and something terrible happened, wouldn't we ask ourselves, What did we know about what was going on?  Nonetheless, not withstanding this, the Israelis have not rejected the U.N. team. Foreign Minister Peres of Israel, in a letter to Secretary of State Powell, has said the team should ``examine the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure and activity in the camp and emanating from it which necessitated Israel's military actions. In doing so, the team will bear in mind the relevant elements of international law, including the right of self-defense and the obligation to prevent terrorism.''  He goes on to say:       [I]n accordance with the fact-finding nature of the team,      its work should be submitted as facts only, and not      observations. This is a vital concern for Israel in order to      avoid abuse and misuse of the work of the Team for political      purposes.  Peres then goes on to add:       Israel understands that requests for interviews with public      servants, past or present, or documents, will be made through      the government of Israel. While Israel will carefully      consider these requests, Israel will have the right to make      final determinations regarding availability to the Team. This      sovereign discretion is mandated by Israeli law.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the letter to Secretary of State Powell be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Deputy Prime Minister,                              and Minister of Foreign Affairs,                                         Jerusalem, 29 April 2002.     Mr. Colin Powell,     Secretary of State, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Secretary: Enclosed are points I raised in a phone      conversation with Secretary General Anman on 28 April 2002.       It will be incumbent upon the Team, in considering ``recent      events in the Jenin refugee camp'' to examine the Palestinian      terrorist infrastructure and activity in the camp and      emanating from it which necessitated Israel's military      actions. In so doing, the Team will bear in mind also the      relevant elements of international law, including the right      of self-defense and the obligation to prevent terrorism.       In accordance with the fact-finding nature of the Team, its      work should be submitted as findings of facts only, and not      observations. This is a vital concern for Israel in order to      avoid abuse and misuse of the work of the Team for political      purposes.       Israel understands that requests for interviews with public      servants, past or present, or documents, will be made through      the Government of Israel. While Israel will carefully      consider these requests, Israel will have the right to make      final determinations regarding availability to the Team. This      sovereign discretion is mandated by Israeli law. Equally, in      the spirit of fairness, and with a view to assuring that      accurate factual information is provided, Israel should have      the opportunity, during the fact-finding work of the Team, to      comment on any statements received by the Team from any other      Israeli individuals or organizations.       I emphasized the sensitive nature of Israel's present      situation, both here in the area and in international fora.      Faced with a relentless battle against terrorism, on the one      hand, and wishing to cooperate with the International      community, on the other, we are obliged to ensure that our      very basic interests, and those of our military and security      servicemen, are fully protected.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Shimon Peres.
