 President, I rise to pay tribute to MG Kevin B. Kuklok, who is about to retire and return to private life after more than 35 years of selfless service to our Nation as a U.S. Marine.  Major General Kuklok graduated from the University of North Dakota, with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering. He also received his master's degree in business administration from the United States International University in San Diego, CA. He enrolled in the Platoon Leaders Class program in March 1965, and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve in August 1968.  He has served with numerous operational commands in billets ranging from staff officer to Commanding General. Some of these units were Marine Medium Lift Helicopter Squadrons 267 and 367; 2d Battalion, 7th Marines; Marine Attack Helicopter Squadron 169; Marine Air Group 46; and Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 766.  He was Commanding Officer Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 41, Det B; Commanding Officer of Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 764. He also served as Director of Readiness and Safety, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, MARRESFOR, New Orleans, LA.  Upon promotion to brigadier general, he assumed command as the commanding general, Reserve Marine Ground Task Force East, Camp Lejeune, NC.  Major General Kuklok is a veteran of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. He also served as the commanding general, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing, Marine Corps Reserve, from September 1997 until August 2000.  In November 2001, General Kuklok was ordered back to active duty to support Operation Enduring Freedom, at which time he assumed his current duties as Assistant Commandant, Plans, Policies and Operations, his last active duty position.  Throughout his career as a U.S. Marine, Major General Kuklok has demonstrated uncompromising character, discerning wisdom, and a sincere, profound sense of duty to his country, his Corps, and especially to his marines and their families.  On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish to recognize Major General Kuklok's accomplishments and his devoted service to the Nation. Congratulations to him, his wife, Diana, and their two children, Nicole and Bryce, on the completion of a long and distinguished career.                          ____________________
