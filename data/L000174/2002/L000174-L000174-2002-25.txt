President, just so all Senators understand where we are, I have been told that the cloture vote that was scheduled for this afternoon has been vitiated. But we will be voting on the Shedd nomination sometime tomorrow morning.  I see the distinguished Senator from Florida on the floor. Could he indicate how long he wishes to speak? I was about to begin the debate on the nomination.
