Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota, the ranking member of the committee, for yielding me time.  According to CBO estimates, this bill will cost $1.3 trillion and includes $750 billion in new taxes and $500 billion in Medicare cuts. It increases premiums, increases taxes, cuts benefits, and leads to health care rationing. The government, rather than patients and doctors, will make many health care decisions. The bill represents a loss of freedom and more government control for the American people.  I support health care reform to help the long-term, low-income uninsured, but it can be achieved without a government takeover of health care. The House Republicans have a better health care bill that lowers premiums for families and small business owners, cuts the deficit by $68 billion, and includes tort reform.
