Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to our distinguished colleague, the gentlewoman from Missouri [Ms. McCarthy].  Ms. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza] for yielding me time.  Mr. Chairman, the Republican welfare bill that we are debating has one clear result, save $69 billion over 5 years by creating block grants to the States with fixed, capped funding.  The proposed legislation does little to assist individuals to become self-sufficient by helping them find work. It has no guarantees that it will reform the welfare system. Instead, this is a package geared toward reducing the deficit and guaranteeing that the affluent receive a capital gains cut, by cutting benefits and resources to our children.  On February 23, the National Governors' Association sent a letter to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee signed by the Governor of my State, Mel Carnahan, and Republican Governors Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler of Michigan. The letter states: ``The Governors view any block grant proposal as an opportunity for Congress and the President to provide needed flexibility for States, not as a primary means to reduce the Federal budget deficit.'' They continue in this four-page letter to list other objections they have with the bill in its current form, including provisions that limit State flexibility or shift Federal costs to States. With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask that the full text of the letter appear in the Record after my remarks.  I understand the need to reform the welfare system. I do not understand, however, why we need to forge ahead with legislation that is so poorly thought out that it simply abdicates our legislative responsibility to the Senate, whom we hope will take the time necessary to craft a bill that truly reforms the welfare system. Those of us who have extensive understanding of State welfare programs feel we have not been given adequate opportunity to help shape the welfare debate going on today.  Because of the way this legislation has been rushed through this body and in light of the fact that the bill does not meet the fundamental principle of moving people from welfare to work, I cannot support H.R. 1214 in its current form.  The letter referred to is as follows:                               National Governors Association,     Washington, DC, February 23, 1995.     Hon. Bill Archer,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our views on      the Personal Responsibility Act, as amended by the      Subcommittee on Human Resources. The Governors appreciate the      willingness of the subcommittee to grant states new      flexibility in designing cash assistance and child welfare      programs. We are concerned about a number of the bill's      provisions, however, that limit state flexibility or shift      federal costs to states.       The Governors believe Congress has at this moment an      enormous opportunity to restructure the federal-state      relationship. The Governors urge Congress to take advantage      of this opportunity both to examine the allocation of      responsibilities among the levels of government and to      maximize state flexibility in areas of shared responsibility.      We believe, however, that children must be protected      throughout the structuring process. In addition, although      federal budget cuts are needed, the Governors are concerned      about the cumulative impact on the states of federal      budgetary decisions. The Governors view any block grant      proposal as an opportunity for Congress and the president to      provide needed flexibility for states, not as a primary means      to reduce the federal budget deficit.       The Governors have not yet reached consensus on whether      cash and other entitlement assistance should remain      available, as federal entitlements to needy families or      whether it should be converted to state entitlement block      grants. We do agree, however, that in either case states      should have the flexibility to enact welfare reforms without      having to request federal waivers.                   federal standards for block grants       If Congress chooses to pursue the block grant approach      proposed by the Human Resources Subcommittee, the block      grants should include a clear statement of purpose, including      mutually agreed-upon goals for the block grant and the      measures that will be used to judge the effectiveness of the      block grant.                      cash assistance block grant       The Governors believe that a cash assistance block grant      for families must recognize the nation's interest in:      Services to children; moving recipients from welfare to work;      and reducing out-of-wedlock births.       Although the Governors recognize the legitimate interest of      the federal government in setting broad program goals in      cooperation with states and territories, they also believe      that states should be free from prescriptive federal      standards.       We appreciate the flexibility given to states in the bill      to design programs, to carry forward program savings, and to      transfer funding between block grants. We must oppose,      however, Title I's prohibitions on transitional cash      assistance to particular families now eligible for help and      ask instead that states be given the authority to make these      eligibility decisions themselves. Some states may want to be      more restrictive than the bill--by conditioning aid on work,      for example, sooner than two years--while other states may      decide it is appropriate to be less restrictive.       The federal interest should be limited to ensuring the      block grant is used to aid low-income children and families.      in the past federal restrictions on eligibility have served      to contain federal costs given the open-ended entitlement      nature of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children      program. Such restrictions have no place, however, in a      capped entitlement block grant where the federal government's      costs are fixed, regardless of the eligibility and benefit      choices made by each state.       Similarly, while Governors agree that there is a national      interest in refocusing the welfare system on the transition      to work, we will object strongly to any efforts to prescribe      narrow federal work standards for the block grant. The      Governors believe that all Americans should be productive      members of their community. There are various ways to achieve      this goal. The preferred means is through private,      unsubsidized work in the business or nonprofit sectors. If      the federal government imposes rigid work standards on state      programs, such standards could prove self-defeating by      foreclosing some possibilities, such as volunteering in the      community, that can be stepping stones to full-time, private      sector jobs. A rigid federal work standard would also      inevitably raise difficult issues about the cost and      feasibility of creating a large number of public jobs, and      the cost of providing child care for parents required to work      a set number of hours a week in a particular type of job.                      child protection block grant       Governors view the child protection block grant as overly      prescriptive and urge Congress to refocus it on achieving      broad goals, such as preserving families, encouraging      adoption and protecting health and safety of children. We      also oppose the mandated creation of local      citizen review panels. We believe that it is inapprorpiate      for the federal government to dictate the mechanism by      which Governors consult the citizens of their state on      state policies.                          block grant funding       We appreciate the subcommittee's willingness to create      block grants whose funding level is guaranteed over five      years rather than being subject to annual appropriations. It      is essential, however, that block grants include appropriate      budget adjustments that recognize agreed-upon national      priorities, inflation, and demand for services. The cash      assistance block grant does not include any such adjustments      for structural growth in the target populations. While some      growth is built into funding for the child protection block      grant, it is not clear whether it will be adequate especially      given that states are likely to be required by the courts to      honor existing adoption assistance contracts. Governors will      continue to protect abused and      [[Page H3392]] neglected children by intervening on their      behalf and we believe that federal funding must continue to      be available for these services.       Governors also ask that any block grants include funding      adjustments to provide for significant changes in the      cyclical economy and for major natural disasters. An      additional amount should be set aside each year for automatic      and timely distribution to states that experience a major      disaster, higher-than-average unemployment, or other      indicators of distress. While the bill does include a federal      rainy day loan fund, we are concerned that this loan fund      will prove to be an inadequate means of addressing sudden      changes in the need for assistance. States experiencing      fiscal problems will not be able to risk taking out federal      loans that they may not be able to repay. Furthermore, one      billion dollars over five years may not be sufficient if many      states experience economic downturns or natural disasters at      the same time, as was the case with the last recession or      with the midwestern floods. Finally, an unemployment rate in      excess of 6.5% may not be a sufficient proxy for identifying      increases in need and should not be the sole trigger for      increased aid.       We also urge the committee to change the funding base year      and formula for the two block grants. We believe that initial      allotments to states for the cash assistance and child      protection block grants should be the higher of a state's      actual funding under the consolidated programs in fiscal 1994      or a state's average funding during fiscal years 1992 through      1994. This change would help protect states with recent      caseload growth from receiving initial allotments far below      actual need.                 accountability in block grant programs       We believe that block grants should include a clear      statement of purpose, including mutually agreed-upon goals      for the block grant and the measures that will be used to      judge the effectiveness of the block grant. We are concerned,      however, that the reporting requirements in both the cash      assistance and child protection block grant go far beyond      what is necessary to monitor whether program goals are being      achieved. We encourage the committee to restrict reporting      requirements to outcome and performance data strictly related      to the goals of the program, and hope that those reporting      requirements can be mutually agreed upon by Congress, the      administration, and ourselves.       We agree that states should be required to use the block      grant funding to provide services for children and their      families. We do have questions, though, about how broadly the      bill's audit provisions would be applied. Would the audit      process be used, for example, to determine whether the block      grant goal of assisting needy children and families was being      achieved? We would also suggest that rather than the federal      government reclaiming audit exception funds, that these funds      remain available to a state for allowable services to      families and children.                             Implementation       Governors also ask Congress to recognize that moving to a      block grant structure raises many implementation issues.      Almost every state is operating at least one welfare waiver      project. We believe that states with waivers currently in      effect should have express permission either to continue      their waiver-based reforms, or to withdraw from the waivers,      and be held harmless for any costs measured by waivers' cost      neutrality provisions. Savings from individual state's      waivers should be included in the state's base. Some states      have negotiated a settlement to retain access, subject to      state match, to an agreed upon dollar amount of waiver      savings. Legislative language converting AFDC to a block      grant should not terminate these agreements and thereby      preclude states from drawing down the balance of these      previously negotiated amounts.       Implementation of block grants would also pose enormous      difficulties for state information systems, and we are      concerned that there may not be sufficient funding or lead      time to allow states to update these systems as necessary to      implement the legislation. While states that are ready should      be able to implement any new block grants as soon as      possible, other states should be allowed at least one year      after enactment to implement the new programs. We also      believe that a consultative process between Governors,      Congress and the administration would be necessary to ensure      that the transition to a block grant system is made in an      orderly way and that children's needs continue to be met      during the transition.    Federal Aid to Legal Noncitizens and Federal Disability Benefits       The Governors oppose the bill's elimination of most federal      services to legal noncitizens. The elimination of federal      benefits does not change any state's legal responsibilities      to make services available to all legal immigrants. Policy      adopted by the Governors clearly states that since the      federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over our      nation's immigration policy, all costs resulting from      immigration policy should be paid by the federal government.      This bill would move the federal government in the opposite      direction, and would shift substantial costs to states.       The Governors also oppose the bill's changes to the      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. We recognize that      the program is growing at an unacceptable rate, and that      serious problems exist regarding the definition and diagnosis      of disabilities. The changes in the bill go far beyond      addressing those problems and represent a substantial and      unacceptable cost shift to states. The Governors believe that      Congress should wait for the report of the Commission on      Childhood Disability before acting to change eligibility for      disability to children. We      also ask that Congress allow last year's amendments      regarding the substance abuse population to be implemented      before enacting new changes in that area. If changes in      SSI are enacted that deny benefits to hundreds of      thousands of families and children, the result may be a      sharp increase in the need for aid from the new cash      assistance block grant at a time when those funds would be      capped.       Thank you for your consideration of our views on the first      four titles of Chairman Shaw's bill. We are also reviewing      the child support provisions and will be forwarding our      comments on them to you separately.           Sincerely,     Gov. Howard Dean,                                                            Chair.     Gov. Tommy G. Thompson,                                                       Vice Chair.     Gov. Tom Carper,                                      Co-Lead Governor on Welfare.     Gov. John Engler,                                      Co-Lead Governor on Welfare.     Gov. Mel Carnahan,                                 Chair, Human Resources Committee.     Gov. Arne H. Carlson,                            Vice Chair, Human Resources Committee.  There is one last point I would like to make. Last week my staff received an invitation to attend an all-expense-paid trip to visit Navy bases in the Pacific. Now Mr. Speaker, I do not know how many staffers are going to take this trip--I know mine isn't--and for all I know the Navy may need to have staff review their operations in the Pacific. However, my question is this: If budgets are so tight that we have to cut school lunch programs for children and energy assistance programs for the elderly, then why do we continue to allow funding for these types of trips, which strike me as completely unnecessary? If we are going to cut the deficit, why don't we look to end these types of trips that are paid for by U.S. taxpayers.  Mr. de la GARZA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from North Carolina [Mrs. Clayton].  (
