Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  I will submit my statement for the Record in opposition to the Goss amendment. I also suggest respectfully there will probably be another amendment offered at a later time that I hope everyone sees the wisdom of voting for.  I have watched this Congress in the light of supposedly protecting, which I support, but also supposedly in making sure that all species are protected, which is well and good.  But we have driven our tuna fleet overseas. When I first came to Congress we had 212 tuna boats. We have three left. They are catching tuna; I do not see any shortage of tuna, but without any regard to what we said had to be done in our waters or with our American fleet.  We are doing the same thing with the shrimp fleet. If, in fact, what the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Goss] and the gentlewoman from Oregon [Ms. Furse] mention is a fact, and I will not dispute what they say, if in fact that is occurring, that should apply to every country that we import those type fishes from, and then let the Americans, like I say, eat bread, otherwise have no shrimp. That is what it boils down to.  I do not think it is fair to pick out just my shrimpers or somebody else's shrimpers. If what they are doing is supposedly biologically wrong, that should apply to India, China, Ecuador, or Mexico, which this whole thing started over the turtle. It always bothered me when I would go to Mexico and see people eating turtle eggs, and eating and drinking turtle oil for certain medicinal purposes, and having turtle boots, and our fishermen are saying no, you have to drag a TED. I do not think that is fair, nor is it equitable or correct environmentally.
