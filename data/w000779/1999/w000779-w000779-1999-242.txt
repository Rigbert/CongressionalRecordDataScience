It has been a great pleasure for me to have a chance to work with him, on a bipartisan basis, for this legislation, and I feel it will be very helpful if he can just take a minute and outline the breadth of support for this legislation. Because, certainly, when we began this discussion, I don't think most Americans could have told you anything about Ed-Flex. We joked most people would think this was the instructor at the Y, the new aerobics instructor.  But the fact is that just a few miles from this Senate Chamber, a school is using Ed-Flex and the existing dollars to cut class size in half. That is going on today using existing dollars. Not spending one penny more of Federal funds, we are seeing a school close to the United States Capitol cut class size in half.  If you listened to this debate--and I happen to be for the hiring of the additional teachers--you would get the impression that the only way you could cut class size in America was to spend more Federal money.  I happen to think we do need to spend some additional dollars, which is why I support the Kennedy and the Murray amendments. I also share theview of the Senator from Tennessee that we can cut class size now, using existing dollars.  I think it would be very helpful, given the fact that we are so close now to the agreement--I really commend the minority leader, Senator Daschle, and the majority leader, Senator Lott, because they have gotten us right to the brink of having an agreement so we can go forward with this legislation--if my friend and colleague could just outline for the Senate the breadth of support for this legislation. I appreciate him yielding to me for this time.
