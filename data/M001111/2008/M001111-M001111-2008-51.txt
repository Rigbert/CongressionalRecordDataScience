 President, tomorrow, after 9:15 a.m., the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the energy speculation bill. If cloture is not invoked, the Senate will immediately proceed to a vote on a motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur with respect to H.R. 3221, the housing reform legislation. Therefore, Senators should expect two rollcall votes beginning at around 9:15 a.m. tomorrow.                          ____________________
