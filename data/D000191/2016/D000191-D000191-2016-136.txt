Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Again, we want to expedite this, but just really, I mean, we should deal with reality on the floor.  Rule text 230.3(S)(2)(iv)(B): ``The following are not `waters of the United States' . . . ''--to go to this--``artificial, constructed lakes and ponds created in dry land such as farm and stock watering ponds . . . ''  There had been language in the original rule which said that they would have to be used exclusively for farm purposes. This rule said they can be used for farm purposes or any other beneficial purposes. So ponds are not regulated.  How many times do we have to say it?  There are questions and interpretations and problems and, again, Congress should act. Congress should have hearings and write legislation to reauthorize the Clean Water Act for the first time in 28 years. Otherwise, we are going to be waiting 2 years for the courts to make a decision and, in the interim, we are stuck with the Bush rule.  I reserve the balance of my time.
