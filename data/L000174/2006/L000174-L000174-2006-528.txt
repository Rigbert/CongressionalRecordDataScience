President, at the end of this month, John Bramley will step down as provost of the University of Vermont. From a day-to-day standpoint, the provost of a university is more important than the president of a university. The provost is the chief of operations who embraces the president's vision and implements ideas into reality. By ensuring that academics, research, and student life are running smoothly, the provost creates an environment that enriches the lives of students, faculty, administrators, and the community.  As provost of the University of Vermont since 2002, John Bramley has not only excelled as provost, but also set a standard that will serve as a benchmark to measure other provosts around the country.  I have known John since he came to the University of Vermont from England in the early 1990s. I believe that John excelled as provost because of his leadership in earlier positions that he held at the university. John is first and foremost an animal science scholar who is known internationally for his groundbreaking research on bovine mastitis. He is also an excellent teacher who genuinely enjoys the interaction between and challenges from students--both undergraduate and graduate. That became evident when he was recognized with the Joseph Carrigan Teaching Award in 1998.  John easily made the transition to administrator. He directed the university's farm programs, cochaired the agricultural extension programs, chaired the Department of Animal Sciences and, perhaps most notably, was chair of the Faculty Senate--a position held by election among his faculty peers.  I jokingly think that his early demonstration of these administrativeskills likely led to his demise as being tapped interim provost and then eventually as provost in 2002. And we are so grateful that John was at his position, as this turned out to be a critical time in the history of the University of Vermont.  It is no secret that during the 1990s UVM suffered from several years of unstable and rocky leadership. Not surprisingly, such a rapid turnover at the helm of a major university led to many problems including budget shortfalls; low morale among faculty, staff and students; and, less than stellar relations with the local Burlington and statewide communities. The work of both interim president Ed Colodny and John guided the university to calmer waters during that difficult time, and helped to build a strong and valuable foundation for the incoming president.  Under President Fogel's administration, the university has been reinvigorated and its prestige restored. I am sure that President Fogel would agree when I say to all my colleagues that we owe much to John Bramley for bringing the university into this new, promising chapter in its history.  John is stepping down as provost, but I am glad that I do not have to end this speech with a farewell. John will be returning to what I think he enjoys most, his teaching and research. I know he will continue to be an important part of the University of Vermont community and I look forward to continuing to see him on campus.                          ____________________[Pages S4613-S4614]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN BRAMLEY
