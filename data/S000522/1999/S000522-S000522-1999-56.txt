Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, just so my colleagues may know, I chair the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights of the Committee on International Relations, and the gentleman from Wisconsin was incorrect. Last Congress, the 105th Congress, we passed and sent to the President, he said when did we last passed one, we had a conference report, it went down to the President, on State Department, it included reform, it included arrearages, $926 million for arrearages with very strong conditions and a very, very compromised Mexico City policy. Regrettably, the President vetoed that bill.  This issue of arrearages would not be before this body except for the appropriations amount that the gentleman from Kentucky, the chairman, has put into his bill. We had all of these conditions, but the President chose to veto that bill. That is unfortunate. Our hope is to take another shot at it.  We are now going to conference soon, it is already staff-to-staff, to try to work out this arrearage language that has been passed by Senator Helms and Senator Biden working together.
