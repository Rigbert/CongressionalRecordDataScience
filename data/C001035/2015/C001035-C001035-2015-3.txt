I want to highlight the Transportation and Housing and Urban Development division of the bill, which is critically important to meeting the housing needs of low-income, disabled, and older Americans, to shelter the homeless, and to boost our economy and create jobs through much needed infrastructure investments in our roads, bridges, railroads, transit systems, and airports.  Let me begin by thanking Chairman Cochran and Vice Chairwoman Mikulski for their leadership in advancing these appropriations bills.  I also want to acknowledge Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the subcommittee, who worked closely with me in our negotiations with the House.  I would be remiss if I did not also acknowledge the tireless efforts staff have put into this bill throughout the entire process. My staff: Heideh Shahmoradi, Ken Altman, Jason Woolwine, Rajat Mathur, Lydia Collins, and Gus Maples have made enormous contributions.  I also want to thank Dabney Hegg, Rachel Milberg, Christina Monroe, and Jordan Stone on Senator Reed's staff.  This bill represents priorities from Members on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers. Through considerable negotiation and compromise, we have crafted a bipartisan bill that targets limited resources to meet our most essential transportation and housing needs while ensuring effective oversight of these important programs.  The bill makes important investments, supporting millions of jobs and economic development. It invests in our Nation's transportation infrastructure by continuing to provide $500 million for the TIGER Program. This highly competitive program creates jobs and supports economic growth in every one of our home States.  The bill provides increased funding for our Nation's highway, transit, and safety programs, consistent with the recently enacted highway authorization bill, the FAST Act. State DOTs are also provided with the flexibility to repurpose approximately $2 billion in old, unused congressionally directed spending and direct it toward infrastructure projects that are of higher priority today within the same geographic location of the original designation.  Turning to air travel, the aviation investments will continue to modernize our nation's air traffic system and help to keep rural communities connected to the transportation network. It will ease future congestion and help reduce delays for travelers in U.S. airspace. The bill provides funding for FAA programs at 99.97 percent of the budget request to ensure FAA's operations and safety workforce are fully funded, which includes 14,500 air traffic controllers and more than 25,000 engineers, maintenance technicians, safety inspectors, and operational support personnel.  In addition to aviation safety, the bill provides $50 million in rail safety grants in response to the devastating rail accidents in recent years. These grants will support infrastructure improvements and safety technology, including positive train control.  There are also several provisions to enhance truck safety on our Nation's highways. For example, the bill requires the Department of Transportation to publish a proposed rule on speed governors, which limits the speed at which these trucks can operate. The Department continues to delay this rulemaking, which was initially petitioned by the industry itself. It is time to get this important safety rule completed and implemented.  The bill also protects critical housing programs by preserving existing rental assistance for vulnerable families and individuals, including our seniors, and strengthens the Federal response to the problem of youth homelessness. Sufficient funding is provided to keep pace with the rising cost of housing vulnerable families, ensuring that more than 4.7 million individuals and families currently receiving assistance will not have to worry about losing their housing. Without this assistance, many of these families might otherwise become homeless.  Youth homelessness is especially troubling and warrants more attention. Reflecting this concern, our bill provides $42.5 million to expand efforts to reduce youth homelessness. These efforts build on our success in reducing veterans homelessness, which has been reduced by 36 percent since 2010. This bill continues that effort by providing an additional 8,000 vouchers for our homeless veterans despite the administration's failure to request funding for this critically important program.  To support local development, we provide $3 billion for the Community Development Block Grants Program. This is an extremely popular program with the States and communities because it allows them to tailor the Federal funds to support local economic and job creation projects.  I appreciate the opportunity to speak about this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support final passage of the omnibus.                       Section 702 in Division O
