President, pursuant to my remarks of October 4 on the management of Federal grant dollars at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, I ask unanimous consent that the document entitled ``Grants Management at the Environmental Protection Agency--A New Culture Required to Cure a History of Problems'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Grants Management at the Environmental Protection Agency          a new culture required to cure a history of problems       On March 3, 2004, the U.S. Senate Environment and Public      Works Committee held an oversight hearing into grants      management at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).      Testimony offered at the hearing referenced the need for a      cultural shift within EPA necessary for new and effective      grants management and oversight within EPA. These remarks are      compiled from testimony from that hearing and information      derived from subsequent oversight conducted by Environment      and Public Works Committee (EPW) Majority Staff following      that hearing.                         epa grants management       Each year, the EPA awards over half of its annual budget,      totaling over $4 billion, in grants. This amounts to between      seven to eight thousand grants or grant actions taken each      year. EPA awards both discretionary and non-discretionary      grants to recipients such as state, local, and tribal      governments, educational institutions, non-profit      organizations, foreign recipients, and individuals among      other types of recipients. The U.S. General Accounting Office      (GAO) completed a comprehensive report on EPA grant      management which it issued in August 2003, compiling ninety-     three GAO and EPA Inspector General reports, 1,232 reviews of      records of awarded grants ending in fiscal year 2002, and      interviews with EPA grant officials. According to the GAO      report, the majority of EPA grant awards are non-     discretionary grants awarded to government entities to fund      infrastructure and the implementation of federal and state      environmental programs. These grant funds are awarded      according to statutory or regulatory formulas to the      receiving governmental entities. The GAO reported that in      fiscal year 2002, the EPA awarded nearly $3.5 billion in non-     discretionary grants. The remaining approximately $700      million in fiscal year 2002 was awarded in discretionary      grants in which EPA officials have the discretion to      determine the grant amounts and recipients. Primarily, EPA      awards discretionary grants to non-profit organizations,      universities, and governmental entities.       EPA grants are awarded and managed both through EPA      headquarters and through the ten regional EPA offices. The      EPA Office of Administration and Resources Management's      Office of Grants and Debarment within agency headquarters      develops agency policy for grants management. Overall the      program offices within EPA headquarters and the regional      offices employ 109 grants specialists responsible for      financial oversight of grant awards and over 1,800 project      officers responsible for providing technical and programmatic      oversight of grant recipients and to monitor the progress of      individual grants.                     epa grants management history       The EPA Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Management      and Budget (OMB), and the GAO have consistently identified      deficiencies in EPA grant management in numerous audits and      reports. The EPA has consistently identified grants      management as either an agency or material weakness in recent      annual Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act reports. As      recently as September 2003, the OIG again recommended that      the EPA again reflect that grants management is a ``material      weakness.''       In its August 2003 comprehensive report on grants      management, the GAO provided a condensed history of grants      management within the EPA. As described in the report, the      OIG first recommended in 1995 and subsequently provided      congressional testimony in July 1996 that EPA demonstrated a      significant weakness in grants management. This resulted in      EPA identifying grants management as a ``material weakness''      in its 1996 Integrity Act report. In response, the EPA      instituted new policies for monitoring grant recipients,      providing grants training for project officers, and reviewing      grants management effectiveness. Although EPA reported in its      1999 Integrity Act report that weaknesses in grants      management had been corrected, the OIG again provided      congressional testimony in November 1999 where it disclosed      that OIG audits revealed management problems persisted      despite new EPA policies. The EPA continued to designate      grants management as an ``agency weakness'' in its 2000      Integrity Act report. In 2002, the OIG and the OMB      recommended that EPA designate grants management as a      ``material weakness'' within the agency. Additionally, in its      August 2003 report, the GAO stated that EPA continues to      encounter the problems in the following areas: (1.) selecting      the most qualified applicants, (2.) effectively overseeing      grantees, (3.) measuring the environmental results of grants,      and (4.) effectively managing grants staff and resources. The      U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure Subcommittee on Water Resources and      Environment held a series of hearings in June 2003, October      2003, and July 2004 concerning the continued deficiencies in      EPA grants management based in large part on the GAO      findings.       In the President's 2004 Budget submission, the OMB      identified four EPA grant programs in which it reported EPA      could not adequately measure the effectiveness of those      programs. Additionally, in the President's 2005 Budget      submission, the OMB evaluated a total of twenty EPA programs      including ten grant-based programs. Again, the OMB reported      that EPA exhibits weakness in measuring the effectiveness of      its grants programs.       On March 3, 2004, the Senate Environment and Pubic Works      Committee held its first oversight hearing into grants      management at the EPA. With such a troubling history in EPA      grants management, the testimony offered at the hearing led      Chairman James Inhofe to characterize the previous 10 years      of grant management at EPA in the following manner:       ``[F]or the last ten years, the story of grants management      is seemingly a revolving door of the EPA IG audits, GAO      reports, Congressional hearings, and new EPA policies in      response. Even with this constant cycle of criticism,      hearings, and new policies, the GAO reported later last year      that the EPA continues to demonstrate the same persistent      problems in grants management. These problems include a      general lack of oversight of the grantees, a lack of      oversight of the Agency personnel, a lack of any measurement      of environmental results, and a lack of competition in      awarding grants. It is imperative that Agency personnel are      accountable for monitoring grants--that measurable      environmental results are clearly demonstrated.''                           new epa responses       In September 2002, the EPA issued a new grant award      competition policy which focused on requiring competition in      grant awards over $75,000 with certain exceptions and created      the position of grant competition advocate to enforce the      policy and recommend changes. Additionally, the GAO reports      that in 1998, 1999, and in February 2002, the EPA has issued      oversight policies designed to increase grant baseline      monitoring, increase in-depth reviews, create annual      monitoring plans, and create a grantee compliance database.       In April 2003, the EPA issued its first five-year grants      management plan. This plan incorporates the new grants      competition and oversight policies establishing the following      principal Objectives and Activities for grants management:       Enhance the skills of EPA personnel involved in grants      management; promote competition in the award of grants;      leverage technology to improve program performance;      strengthen EPA oversight of grants; support identifying and      achieving environmental outcomes.        senate environment and public works committee oversight       At the March 3, 2004, Senate Environment and Public Works      Committee oversight hearing into grants management at the      EPA, Chairman Inhofe stated:       ``I want to announce to all of you today that this      Committee is going to take this oversight responsibility      seriously in regards to grants management. . . . I am going      to make a personal commitment that it is going to change this      time. . . . We are going to have accountability and the      revolving door will stop.''       The Committee heard testimony from the OIG, EPA Office of      Administration and Resources Management, GAO, and a      representative from Taxpayers for Common Sense. GAO and OIG      reiterated the much of the same themes that have      characterized their consistent criticisms of grant management      at     the EPA. The GAO testified to: a lack of oversight of      grantees and EPA personnel, a lack of competition in      discretionary grants, and a lack of measurable environmental      outcomes.       The OIG testified to: no link between funded projects and      EPA mission, no assessment of probability of success, no      determination of the reasonableness of the costs of the      grant, no measurable environmental outcomes, and no      deliverable in grant work-plans.       A representative for Taxpayers for Common Sense echoed      similar criticisms offered by the OIG and GAO and, while      acknowledging EPA's new focus on improving grants management,      testified that EPA needs to improve: EPA personnel commitment      to competition in grants selection, grantee oversight,      ensuring grants are consistent with Agency goals, and EPA      staff accountability.       The EPA focused its testimony on the new grants management      plan and accomplishments under that plan detailing its five      main goals and evidence of its initial success. The EPA      testified to: new certification of grants project officers,      increased competition especially among non-profit grantees,      deployment of a new Intergrated Contracts Management System      automating grants mangement monitoring, and increased minimal      monitoring standards for all grants.       The hearing produced the following general findings: EPA      discretionary grants need a system that requires wide      competition for the available funds and sufficient notice of      the funding opportunities that may be available; EPA      discretionary and non-discretionary grants need to      demonstrate and quantify measurable environmental results;      and EPA administration and project officers need to ensure      that new policies to more closely monitor grants, ensure      measurable environmental results, and ensure wide      solicitation and competition among grants, among other goals,      and accomplished.       In addition, the hearing produced the specific finding that      discretionary grants in particular are often the most      problematic due to limited oversight from the EPA. Testimony      offered by the GAO revealed that oversight through such      safeguards as the Single Audit Act to ensure that      discretionary grantee expenditures are allowable costs are      generally not applicable to discretionary grants given the      grant comparatively low dollar amounts. Responding to      questions from Chairman Inhofe, GAO representative John      Stephenson testified to the following:       ``Senator Inhofe. Would [discretionary grants] be the most      difficult to monitor?       Mr. Stephenson. I would think so. The non-discretionary      grants go by formula to the States based on the need. There      is a little more specificity in place as to how you oversee      that category of grants. So I would agree that the      discretionary grants are probably more problematic.''       The OIG offered corresponding answers to similar questions      from Senator Inhofe testifying to the following:       ``Senator Inhofe. You are testifying that the EPA      mismanagement of only discretionary grants costs the      taxpayers hundred of million of dollars each year?       Ms. Heist. Of predominately discretionary funds, yes.       Senator Inhofe. Why do you focus on discretionary      recipients in particular?       Ms. Heist. In the past we found the most problem was with      discretionary grants. We found problems with, as has been      mentioned here today, competition. We found Agency managers      continued to use the same grantees year-after-year and there      has not been a lot of competition. Predominately, that is      where we found the problems, so we continue to focus in that      area.''       In fact, the OIG supplemented her testimony with a March 1,      2004, audit of a discretionary grant recipient non-profit      organization that received a total of $4,714,638 in five      selected grants from 1996 to 2004. The OIG's audit concluded      with the following findings:       ``Therefore, although EPA funds were awarded to a 501(c)(3)      organization, in actuality, a 501(c)(4) lobbying organization      performed the work and ultimately received the funds. This      arrangement clearly violates the Lobbying Disclosure Act      prohibition on a 501(c)(4) organization which engages in      lobbying from receiving Federal funds.       In summary, the [Consumer Federation of America], a      501(c)(4) organization: (1) performed direct lobbying of      Congress, and (2) received Federal funds contrary to the      Lobbying Disclosure Act. Consequently, all of the costs      claimed and paid under the agreements are statutorily      unallowable.''       The March 1, 2004 OIG audit subsequently concluded among      other findings, ``EPA recover all funds paid to the non-     profit recipient'' and ``EPA suspend work under current      grants or cooperative agreements not covered by the audit and      make no new awards until the recipient can demonstrate that      its financial management practices and controls over Federal      funds comply with all regulatory requirements.''       However, lack of oversight in grants to non-profit      organizations is not entirely new information. The GAO      reported in 2001 that EPA exhibited weaknesses specifically      in non-profit grantee oversight. In its April 2001 report      that GAO specifically evaluated EPA's oversight of non-profit      grantee costs. The GAO concluded, ``EPA's post-award grant      management policy provides minimal assurance that unallowable      costs for non-profit grantees will be identified.'' In its      August 2003 report, the GO again reported it found some of      the largest number of problems in discretionary grants to      non-profit organizations. In fact, the GAO reported that of      the grants it sampled for its report, EPA took some of the      most significant remedial actions to problems within the      individual grants against non-profit organizations.       Testimony received during the hearing also confirmed that      EPA has continued to award discretionary grants to non-profit      and other recipients often without preparing solicitations      and without competition with other potential applicants. In      its August 2003 EPA grants report, the GAO reported the      following:       ``The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977      encourages agencies to use competition in awarding grants. To      encourage competition, EPA issued a grants competition policy      in 1995. However, EPA's policy did not result in meaningful      competition throughout the agency, according to EPA      officials. Furthermore, EPA's own internal management reviews      and a 2001 Inspector General report found that EPA has not      always encouraged competition. Finally, EPA has not always      engaged in widespread solicitation when it could be      beneficial to do so. Widespread solicitation would provide      greater assurance that EPA receives proposals from a variety      of eligible and highly qualified applicants who otherwise may      not have known about grant opportunities. According to a 2001      EPA Inspector General report, program officials indicated      that widespread solicitation was not necessary because `word      gets out' to eligible applicants. Applicants often sent their      proposals directly to these program officials, who funded      them using `uniquely qualified' as the justification for a      noncompetitive award. This procedure created the appearance      of preferential treatment by not offering the same      opportunities to all potential applicants. In addition, the      agency provided incomplete or inconsistent public information      on its grant programs in the Catalog of Federal Domestic      Assistance. Therefore, potential applicants may not have      been adequately informed of funding opportunities.''       In fact, the OIG reported in May 2001 that the lack of      competition and lack of solicitation in discretionary grants      led to the appearance of preferential treatment in awarding      grants and an uncertainty that grants were being awarded to      the most meritorious and cost-effective projects:       ``Without widespread solicitation [of available grants],      EPA is not only limiting potential applicants, but is also      creating the appearance of preferential treatment.      Furthermore, during our discussions with EPA program      officials we found implications of preferential treatment in      the selection of grantees.''       During the hearing, EPA acknowledged neglecting competition      and giving the appearance of favoritism in awarding grants as      EPA responded to the following question asked by Senator      Jeffords:       ``Mr. O'Connor. Senator Jeffords, with respect to the      competition as was noted, for years and years, our project      officers were accustomed to just selecting their grantee      which led to at least the appearance that we had favorites      and that we were not necessarily going out there sure that we      were getting the best value for the Government. That policy,      quite frankly, did not go over very well initially, with our      1,800 project officers because it does require quite a bit of      additional work. This was something that they had to adjust      to. Frankly, we set a goal of competing, I believe it was 30      percent of the covered grants in our first year. I was very      pleased with achieving the 75 percent. But that is one of a      number of major mindsets that we are trying to change, and      will change, over the next couple of years in how we manage      our grants.''       Chairman Inhofe concluded the hearing with a closing      statement acknowledging that all the witnesses could agree      that discretionary grants oversight may be particularly      problematic. Upon the conclusion of the hearing, Chairman      Inhofe began a series of information requests to EPA.      Chairman Inhofe issued the first request at the close of the      March 2004 hearing. The request included a listing of all      discretionary grant recipients in fiscal year 2003, the      amount of the recipient, and the type of recipient for each      grant award. It also requested the amounts in grants those      recipients had received for the two previous fiscal years.                          subsequent oversight       Pursuant to Environment and Public Works Committee      oversight responsibility, Chairman Inhofe has submitted      subsequent information requests which have included      requesting project officer grant files on discretionary grant      recipients and interviews with the EPA project and approving      officers for discretionary grants. In each information      request, EPA has fully responded, making grant files and      personnel available.       Additionally, one of the first accomplishments from the      Committee's oversight has been a change in availability of      information on grants on the EPA Web site. At the March 2004      hearing Chairman Inhofe required, ``What would be wrong with      putting all [grant awards] on a Web site where the public and      anyone interested would have access to them?''       Later in the hearing, Chairman Inhofe reiterated his point      of transparency in grant awarding stating, ``I like the idea      of doing something, of opening the doors, and not just having      a Web site where you show the various competitions coming up,      but also where you show the grants that are issued. . . . I      look forward to that.''       EPA has responded by reorganizing its Web site to provide a      direct link to the EPA grants from its homepage and      reorganized its Office of Grants and Debarment page to      clearly list links concerning EPA grants. However, most      importantly, EPA has created a new site of the most      comprehensive information ever provided on individual grants.      This new page contains information such as the awarding      office, total amount of the grant, purpose of the grant, and      awarding and monitoring personnel at EPA. This new page      allows users to search all awarded grants by description,      type of recipient, and by quarter or fiscal year all within      seven days of the grant award. Additionally, this page is      only an interim site as the EPA plans to develop a ``Grants      Datamart'' of new publicly accessible information through its      Web site by early 2005.       Although more publicly available information on available      grants, new competition for those discretionary grants and      full disclosure of awarded grants are a promising beginning      to reform of EPA grants management, individual EPA program      offices must enforce these new policies with necessary      oversight of EPA personnel and EPA grantees. However, with      comparatively low individual dollar amounts, discretionary      grants to non-profit organizations in particular may receive      the least oversight compared to recipients of larger dollar      amount grants. As referenced in previous GAO reports and      corroborated in the OIG recent audit of a non-profit grant      recipient, discretionary grants to non-profit recipients have      exhibited some of the highest amount of problems and have      required the most significant remedial actions taken by the      EPA.                     big business environmentalism       In spring 2001, the Sacramento Bee began a series of      articles on the operations of the national environmental      groups and the current actions of the modern environmental      movement. Those articles began characterizing the today's      environmental groups in the following manner:       ``[T]oday's groups prosper while the land does not.      Competition for money and members is keen. Litigation is      blood sport. Crisis, real or not, is a commodity. And slogans      and sound bites masquerade as scientific fact.''       The series continued by identifying the twenty      environmental organizations reporting the largest resources,      each an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) registered non-profit      organization, and criticizing today's environmental movement      for its largesse. The series highlighted such issues and      arguments as: the salaries paid to environmental group      executives, the millions of dollars in assets, or billions in      some cases, of environmental groups, the unprecedented focus      on fundraising, the marketing and advertising on agenda-based      science, the increasingly litigious business of today's      environmental groups, and the subsidizing of environmental      groups with federal tax dollars.       Continuing on the theme of environmental groups being      subsidized by federal taxpayers, that same publication      published an additional article in October 2001, specifically      highlighting the issue of federal tax dollars going to      environmental groups regularly engaged in lobbying and      litigating against the federal government, and how that,      according to federal audits, in some cases those tax dollars      have been misused. Interestingly, the article adds,       ``Just how much public money flows to environmental groups      has never been calculated, partly because it springs from so      many sources. . . . But no government agency charts the total      spending, identifies trends, or assesses what taxpayers are      getting for their money.''       The Washington Post published a series of articles      beginning May 2003 focusing on a particular non-profit      environmental group, The Nature Conservancy, branding the      organization ``Big Green'' for its status as the nation's      eighth largest non-profit with assets of $3 billion. The      series criticized The Nature Conservancy, a regular EPA      discretionary grant recipient, for its wide-ranging business      interests including drilling operations, product marketing      activities ranging from beef to neckties to a breakfast      cereal to toilet cleaners, and million-dollar land deals to      organization board members and supporters that has gained The      Nature Conservancy a U.S. Senate Finance Committee      investigation and subsequent audit by the IRS.       Earlier this year, FrontPage Magazine published a similarly      critical article of environmental non-profit groups titled      ``Environmental Activism Is In Fact Big Business,'' reporting      that today's more than 3,000 environmental non-profit      organizations collect more than $8.5 billion annually and      that most individually collect more than $1 million each      year.       Not all environmental organizations regularly receive EPA      grants or receive EPA grants at all. However, some      environmental groups receive millions of dollars in private      contributions each year and receive hundreds of thousands of      dollars in EPA grants each year as well. Additionally, those      same environmental groups are closely linked with affiliate      organizations which are politically involved or are closely      associated with other politically involved environmental      organizations.              selected epa discretion non-profit grantees       The following organizations are IRS registered 503(c)(3)      tax exempt non-profit entities that have regularly received      discretionary grant funding from the EPA. Each organization      has received varying amounts of EPA discretionary grants.      Each organization is also affiliated with an IRS registered      501(c)(4) or 527 political organization or is otherwise      involved in political activities. Unless otherwise specified,      the EPA reports that until it formally adopted its grants      competition policy in 2003, although it encouraged      competition, each grant was likely awarded without      solicitation or competition with other potential applicants.                   Natural Resources Defense Council       The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) states that      its purpose is to ``safeguard the Earth: its people, its      plants and animals and the natural systems on which all life      depends.'' The NRDC is represented by three organizations.      These organizations are the NRDC, Inc., a 501(c)(3)      organization; the NRDC Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization;      and the Environmental Accountability Fund, a section 527      political organization.       The NRDC is consistently critical of the Bush      Administration's environmental record and devotes a portion      of its own Web site to the ``Bush Record'' which it      characterizes in the following manner: ``This administration,      in catering to industries that put America's health and      natural heritage at risk, threatens to do more damage to our      environmental protections than any other in U.S. history.''      In fact, this organization is particularly politically      involved with a history of spending millions of dollars in      previous election cycles. The NRDC is also involved in this      year's Presidential race joining with other organizations      airing television and radio advertisements against President      Bush. The NRDC's section 527 political organization, the      Environmental Accountability Fund, last reports to have      raised nearly $1 million in the 2004 election cycle, at the      time of this report. The NRDC 501(c)(3) organization is also      nationally politically involved joining earlier this year      with Moveon.org, another section 527 political organization,      running advertisements, such as one featured earlier this      year in the New York Times, accusing the Bush Administration      of weakening regulations on drinking water and air quality      while at the same time soliciting contributions for the NRDC      501(c)(3) affiliate.       The NRDC, Inc. organization has reported consistent end of      the year annual net assets of over $70 million for the      previous three years, with over $80 million of end of the      year net assets reports in its tax filing of the year ending      2003. Additionally, the NRDC, Inc. reports receiving      increasing amounts of direct public contributions totaling      from $32.6 million in 1999 to over $55 million in 2003.       The NRDC, Inc. organization also reports spending an      increasing amount on direct grassroots lobbying, from      $264,253 in its filing for the year ending 1999 to $861,524      in its filing for the year ending 2003 with a total of nearly      $1 million in total lobbying expenditures in 2002 alone. NRDC      Lobbying Disclosure Act Reports over the same 1999-2003      period disclose NRDC, Inc. made these expenditures lobbying      Congress and the Administration, including Department of      Energy, the Department of the Interior and the EPA.       The NRDC, Inc. organization reported receiving over half a      million dollars annually in government grants in its IRS      filings for the reporting periods ending 1999 through 2003.      Specifically, the NRDC, Inc. organization reports it received      $850,903 in government grants in the period ending 1999,      $759,596 for 2000, $679,319 for 2001, $630,910 for 2002, and      $608,099 for 2003. The EPA reports that NRDC, Inc.      organization has received nearly $6.5 million in twenty-three      discretionary grants since 1993. EPA also reports that these      individual grants ranged in amounts from $7,500 to nearly $2      million during this period. The EPA acknowledges that likely      all these grants were awarded without competition with any      other applicant. The EPW Majority Staff requested interviews      of EPA approving and project officers for selected grants      over $200,000 each. The purposes for some grants to NRDC,      Inc., were wide ranging. For instance, EPA reported that some      of the stated purposes for grants awarded to NRDC, Inc., have      included development of energy efficient technologies,      strengthening the case for smart growth, a NRDC and Ad      Council clean water campaign, and promoting energy efficiency      in Russian buildings. In some instances, approving officers      and project officers for those grants have since retired from      the EPA. However, EPW Majority Staff interviewed EPA      approving and project officers for one ongoing grant awarded      by the Office of Air and Radiation beginning in January 2002      through December 2004 for a total of $1,198,993.00. The      grant's stated project title and description are as follows:      ``Development or Long-Term Adoption of Energy-Efficient      Products and Services, To work within the energy efficiency      and manufacturing community toward long term market      transformation of energy-efficient technologies and      practices.'' EPA officials stated that the grant was awarded      without solicitation or competition with other applicants,      and EPA awarded the grant pursuant to a proposal NRDC, Inc.      submitted to the EPA. One EPA official reported that although      this particular grant proposal was unsolicited, it was      subject to a peer review. However, upon further questioning      EPW Majority Staff learned that the peer review consisted of      the review of one other EPA official within the Climate      Protection Partnerships Division of the Office of Air and      Radiation. EPA officials reported that this grant received      some form of review     from several levels within the Climate Protection Division      from review of the technical merits of the proposal by the      project officers through approval by the division director.      EPW Majority Staff interviewed the approving officer and two      project officers for this grant, and all reported receiving      EPA grant training and receiving periodic recertification.      Each interviewed personnel has been employed with the EPA for      various tenures from two years to over twenty years. EPA      project officers reported that monitoring for this grant      consists of periodic contact by the project officer and the      requirement of quarterly reports from NRDC, Inc. on its      progress on the grant. All EPA officials interviewed were      aware of NRDC's regular litigation against the federal      government, and some were otherwise aware of NRDC's political      activity and criticisms of the Bush Administration's      environmental policies.                Children's Environmental Health Network       The Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN)      describes itself as a ``national multi-disciplinary      organization whose mission is to protect the fetus and the      child from environmental health hazards and promote a healthy      environment.'' CEHN has been a 501(c)(3) tax exempt      organization since 2001 and reported for the filing period      ending 2000,end of the year net assets of $25,324.00.      However, the CEHN also reports receiving a total of $545,626      in direct contributions in addition to $136,729.00 in      government grants.       Since CEHN's beginnings in 2001, the EPA reports it has      awarded four grants to CEHN in amounts ranging from a $2,600      to an ongoing grant totaling $332,304.00 for the grant term      of August 2002 to July 2005. As of this report, EPA has      awarded nearly $400,000 in grants to the CEHN. All EPA      approving and project officers for each of these grants are      still employed at the EPA, the EPW Majority Staff requested      interviews with each official/EPA officials confirmed that      the agency awarded each grant without solicitation and      without competition with any other potential applicant.       The first of the awards was a $10,000 grant awarded from      EPA Office of International Affairs to CEHN to distribute      information from the Global Forum for Action, a conference      sponsored by CEHN. EPA officials, however, disclosed that the      original proposal from CEHN requested $70,000 to pay for a      large part of the Global Form for Action conference that had      already concluded prior to CEHN's submission of its grant      proposal. EPA, however, agreed to provide $10,000 for      dissemination of information from the conference. The second      of the awards was a $43,615 grant awarded from EPA      headquarters for the purpose of developing a plan for the      expansion of the use of the Internet to increase information      regarding environmental health threats to children. EPA      officials monitored the grant by requiring quarterly progress      reports. The result of the grant was a report CEHN prepared      on its meetings with Internet providers and medical      associations. EPA officials, however, reported that a Web      site disseminating information on children's health has not      been developed subsequent to this report. Interestingly,      however, during this same period and thereafter, the CEHN has      published its own Children's Environmental Health Bush      Administration Report Card for 2001-2004. On April 5, 2004,      CEHN published its most recent report card on its own      Internet site which graded the Bush Administration's      environment record with an ``F'' on protecting children's      health citing sixteen areas where it claims the Bush      Administration is lacking in protecting children's health.       The third grant to CEHN was awarded from EPA Region 3 in      the amount of $2,600 for the purpose of training two      Washington, D.C. highschool students to assist with      environmental education in a local elementary school      classroom. CEHN coordinated the training for these two      highschool students in a there-week course. Representatives      from the Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, the EPA, and      others made presentations to the students about a variety of      topics including ``lead poisoning, asthma, ozone depletion,      global warming, the workings of a power plant, and water      topics.'' Although the students toured a water treatment      facility in conjunction with the presentations, EPA officials      could not confirm that the students actually toured a power      plant. The grant reports CEHN submitted also did not include      a representative from the utility industry as a presenter,      and EPA officials also could not confirm that the students      received any information from industry representatives.       Finally, the fourth grant EPA awarded to CEHN is the      largest. The EPA Office of Prevention of Pesticides and Toxic      Substances awarded the first installment of an ongoing grant      totaling $332,304.00 over the grant period August 2002 to      July 2005. The purpose of this grant is to increase available      scientific information on children's health to CEHN and other      non-governmental organizations. Like all other grants awarded      to CEHN, this grant was awarded through an unsolicited      proposal without competition with any other potential      applicants. Interestingly, the chairperson of the board of      directors for CEHN is the former EPA Assistant Administrator      for the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances during      the Clinton Administration from 1993 to 1999. EPA      officials involved in approving and monitoring this grant      advised EPW Majority Staff that although they personally      did not work closely with the former Assistant      Administrator, they worked for the Office of Pesticides      and Toxic Substances during the same period.                      Environmental Defense, Inc.       Environmental Defense describes itself as ``fighting to      protect human health, restore the oceans and ecosystems, and      curb global warming.'' Environmental Defense is represented      by two organizations: Environmental Defense, Inc., 501(c)(3)      organization, and the Environmental Defense Action fund,      Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization.       Environmental Defense, Inc. reports consistently increasing      amounts of end of the year net assets from approximately $33      million in its tax filing for the period ending 1999 to over      $49 million for 2003. During that same period Environmental      Defense, Inc. has received increasing amounts of direct      public contributions, from $28.4 million in 1999 to nearly      $42 million in 2003. This organization also reports spending      varying amounts in direct and grassroots lobbying      expenditures for the same period, spending $528,804 for 1999,      $410,975 for 2000, $857,542 for 2001, $673,548 for 2002, and      $856,983 for 2003. Environmental Defense, Inc. reports making      those expenditures lobbying Congress and the Administration      agencies including the EPA.       Environmental Defense, Inc. also reports receiving varying      amounts of annual government grants. It reported receiving      $752,645 for 1999, $505,170 for 2000, $575,673 for 2001,      $273,116 for 2002, and $341,338 for 2003. Environmental      Defense, Inc. has also received over $4.6 million from the      EPA in discretionary grants since 1993, many, if not all,      awarded without competition with other potential applicants.                            The Tides Center       The Tides Center describes its organization as ``working      with new and emerging charitable organizations who share our      mission of striving for positive social change.'' This      organization is represented or affiliated with two other      organizations: the Tides Foundation, a 501(c)(3) foundation,      and the Tsunami Fund, a 501(c)(4) organization.       The Tides Center and Tides Foundation regularly grant funds      to what it designates as its projects. To receive funding,      The Tides Center's main requirement for becoming a new      project is that the ``project's work falls within the Tides      Mission of working toward progressive social change.'' Some      of the projects the Tides Center and Tides Foundation have      funded include other environmental organizations such as the      Environmental Working Group, the Natural Resources Defense      Council, and affiliates of the Sierra Club and Greenpeace.       The Tides Center regularly reports annual end of the year      net assets increasing from $21.1 million in its tax filing      for the period ending 1999 to $33.8 million in 2003. During      this same period, the Tides Center reports increasing direct      public contributions from $38.7 million in its 1999 filing to      nearly $60 million in 2003. The Tides Center reports varying      amounts of legally allowable direct and grassroots lobbying      expenditures between $22,505 in its 1999 filing to $601,885      in its 2003 filing with a 2002 filing disclosing expenditures      of nearly $1 million.       The Tides Center also regularly receives several millions      of dollars of government grants in increasing amounts each      year. The Tides Center reported receiving $1,626,906 for      1999, $1,582,370 for 2000, $2,145,499 for 2001, $3,481,484      for 2002, and $5,175,732 for 2003. Although the Tides Center      has received increasing amount of funding in grants, the U.S.      Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Inspector      General audited the Tides Center as recently as September      2002 and recommended that HUD consider suspending grant      funding until the Tides Center and its project organization      partner in the audited grant develop and implement      appropriate management controls to ensure the Tides Center's      compliance with federal rules concerning allowable      expenditures for federal funding. The EPA reports that the      Tides Center and Tides Foundation have received nearly $2      million in federal grants from the EPA alone since 1993. EPW      Majority Staff interviewed EPA approving and project officers      in four grants EPA awarded to the Tides Center. In two of the      selected grants, EPA made the awards without solicitation or      competition with other applicants. In fact, the single      largest grant EPA has made to the Tides Center since 1993 was      awarded for a term of May 2002 to December 2003 for a total      of $477,275. The grant was awarded for the purpose of      encouraging public participation in the cleanup of hazardous      waste at federal facilities. Although the grant was awarded      without solicitation or competition, EPA confirmed the      project officer has made on-site visits to the grantee and      has requested an audit of funds to ensure EPA grant funding      is separated from other funds used by the Tides Center. In      another ongoing grant to the Tides Center totaling $75,000      for the purpose of developing a white paper on the markets      for environmental papers, EPA again confirmed this grant was      awarded subsequent to an unsolicited proposal and without      competition. In fact, in awarding funding to the Tides Center      in other grants based on unsolicited proposals, EPA has      simply recorded that the grantee has ``unique and superior      qualifications to perform the work.'' However, in each of      these previously described grants, EPA project officers      confirmed that prior to this particular grant oversight with      Tides Center, neither had any prior experience with the Tides      Center.       In two of the other two selected grants, EPA made the      awards with competition with one award approved by the      awarding office's     Assistant Administrator. The first of these ongoing grants      was for a total of $125,000 for a grant term of September      2003 to August 2006, for the purpose of ``strengthening the      national network of brownfield environmental justice and      community groups, technical assistance, training, research on      schools sitting on contaminated property, regional workshops,      and history of selected brownfields community efforts.'' The      grant application, however, states that the Tides Center will      ultimately apply for a total of $442,000 for this project.      The Tides Center's submitted proposal for the grant includes      conducting conferences, workshops, and producing fact sheets.      The EPA Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response awarded      this grant following a review throughout the office with      final approval by the office Assistant Administrator. EPA      officials confirmed that the solicitation for this grant was      available for forty-five days on the agency Web site. EPA      received forty-four proposals and awarded twenty-one.      Finally, the fourth Tides Center ongoing grant in which EPW      Majority Staff interviewed EPA officials involved an awarded      amount totaling of $150,000 for a grant term of May 2004 to      May 2004, for the purpose of ``improving meaningful non-     federal stakeholder involvement in decisions concerning clean      up of hazardous waste at federal facilities. In this grant,      EPA reports that it prepared a solicitation that was      available for sixty days on the agency Web site and in the      Federal Register. EPA received a total of twenty-three      proposals and awarded one. Proposals were evaluated by a      panel comprised of EPA personnel and two additional members      from the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of      Energy.                     Consumer Federation of America       The Consumer Federation of America describes its purpose as      to ``work to advance pro-consumer policy on a variety of      issues before Congress, the White House, federal and state      regulatory agencies, state legislatures, and the courts.''      The Consumer Federation of America (CEA) was formerly      represented by two organizations: the Consumer Federation of      America Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, and the      Consumer Federation of America, a 501(c)(4) organization.      According to the CFA, currently both organizations have now      merged into one 501(c)(3) organization following an EPA      Inspector General audit completed March 1, 2004 that was      referenced in testimony on EPA grants management before the      Environment and Public Works Committee on March 3, 2004.       The CFA reported end of the year net assets of $609,745 for      its IRS filing for the period ending 2003. It also reports      receiving $184,110 in direct public contributions during that      same reporting period. CFA has regularly filed Lobbying      Disclosure Act reports disclosing lobbying expenditures      between $80,000 and $200,000 from lobbying Congress and a      variety of federal agencies. In fact, the EPA Inspector      General included in its audit of CFA that CFA had an      estimated total of $940,000 in direct lobbying costs from      1998 through 2002.       The CFA Foundation has also been a regular recipient of      grant dollars from the EPA. Since 1993, the CFA or CFA      Foundation has received over $8 million alone from the EPA.      However, during the EPW Committee grants management oversight      hearing held March 3, 2004, the OIG testified to the      following:       ``We have reported on EPA shortcomings in overseeing      assistance agreements for over ten years. A particularly      relevant example is a recent report in which we questioned      $4.7 million because the work was performed by an ineligible      lobbying organization. EPA awarded the cooperative agreements      to an associated organization but did not have any employees,      space, or overhead expenses. In addition, the ineligible      organization's financial management practices did not comply      with Federal regulations. The recipient did not adequately      identify and separate lobbying expenses in its accounting      records. As a result, lobbying costs may have been charged to      the Federal projects.''       The OIG included its March 1, 2004 audit of the CFA with      its testimony which concluded with the following summary:       ``In summary, the [CFA] Federation, a 501(c)(4)      organization: (1) performed direct lobbying of Congress, and      (2) received Federal funds contrary to the Lobbying      Disclosure Act. Consequently, all the costs claimed and      paid under the agreements are statutorily unallowable.''       EPA has advised EPW Majority Staff that it continues to      work to resolve this issue with CFA and to develop a response      to the OIG audit. EPA has also disclosed that the agency      offices awarding the grants to CFA that were subject to the      audit did not prepare solicitations for the grants nor      subject the grants to competition with other potential      applicants.                          World Wildlife Fund       The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) describes its purpose as the      ``conservation of nature,'' and describes its conservation      work as focusing on three issues: ``saving endangered      species, protecting endangered habitats, and addressing      global threats such as toxic pollution, over-fishing and      climate change.'' The WWF advocates for a wide variety of      issues, such as opposing oil and gas development in the      Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, strengthening the Endangered      Species Act, advocating for global warming legislation, and      arguing that the Bush Administration plans to eliminate      millions of acres of national forests for road building,      logging, and mining interests.       The WWF is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt non-profit organization.      The WWF reports increasing end of the year net assets ranging      from $114 million for its tax filing in the period ending      1998 to $146 million for 2003. During this same period the      WWF reports receiving an increasing amount in direct public      contributions from $66.6 million for 1998 to $79 million for      2003. The WWF also reports lobbying expenditures each year      from 1998 to 2003 in amounts from $121,138 to $400,548. The      WWF reports making these expenditures lobbying Congress and      the Administration, including the Department of Interior,      U.S. Forest Service, and the EPA.       The WWF is also a regular recipient of government grants      and reported receiving over $20 million in government grants      from 1998 to 2001. The WWF reported receiving government      grants of over $18 million in 2002 and over $16 million in      2003 alone. Since 1993, the WWF has received over $1.6      million in EPA discretionary grants including the most recent      ongoing EPA grant to the WWF for $100,000. The EPA Office of      Research and Development (ORD) awarded this grant to the WWF      beginning May 2002 for the purpose of providing technical      assistance to governmental departments of American Samoa to      assess the impacts of climate change on coral reef systems.      EPW Majority Staff interviewed EPA approving and project      officers for this grant. Although this grant was awarded      prior the EPA's discretionary grant competition, the ORD      prepared a solicitation for this grant that was available      from July 2001 to October 2001 on the EPA Web site and in the      Federal Register and Commerce Business Daily. The ORD      received twelve proposals that were evaluated by a panel      consisting of representatives from the EPA, the National      Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Harvard      University. EPA awarded grants to five of the twelve      proposals. The WWF proposal begins with the foundation that      global warming due to anthropogenic effects is causing damage      to coral reefs among other detrimental effects. The EPA      reported that part of the monitoring requirements WWF is to      meet during the term of the grant is to submit periodic      reports. In each grant quarterly reports prepared by WWF, the      WWF reports working with local governmental departments      sampling and conducting studies gathering information on the      damage to coral reefs and associated species to ultimately      recommend means to protect American Samoa's corral reefs. EPA      officials anticipate the grant will conclude in 2005. EPW      Majority Staff also asked EPA officers responsible for      monitoring the grant whether grant management was      sufficiently described in their job description and whether      it is an area in which EPA measures their job performance.      Interestingly, one EPA officer responded that since being      assigned to ORD, both aspects were true. However, the same      EPA officer responded that in previous assignments neither      aspect was true.                          Friends of the Earth       Friends of the Earth states its mission as the following:      ``Friends of the Earth defends the world and champions a      healthy and just world.'' Friends of the Earth is a group      critical of the Bush Administration's environmental record,      suggesting that political contributors have solely determined      the environmental agenda of the Bush Administration.       Friends of the Earth is represented by two organizations:      Friends of the Earth, a 501(c)(3) organization, and Friends      of the Earth Action, Inc., a 501(c)(4) organization.       Friends of the Earth has consistently reported end of year      net assets between $1 million and $3 million in IRS filings      for periods ending in 1998 through 2003. Over the same      period, Friends of the Earth has reported receiving annual      direct public contributions from $3.5 million for 1999 to      $4.4 million for 2003. From 1999 to 2003, Friends of the      Earth also reported lobbying expenditures from $29,433 to      $111,849. Friends of the Earth annual lobbying reports      disclose these expenditures include lobbying Congress and the      Administration, including the EPA.       Since 1999, Friends of the Earth has regularly reported it      has received no government grants; however, it has received      small federal grants from the EPA from 1993 to 1999 totaling      about $200,000. Like many other discretionary grants, EPA      acknowledges that these grants likely were awarded without a      public solicitation and without competition with other      potential applicants.                       World Resources Institute       The World Resources Institute describes itself as an      independent non-profit organization and describes its mission      is to ``move human society to live in way that protect      Earth's environment and its capacity to provide for the needs      and aspirations of current and future generations.'' The      World Resources Institute (WRI) is represented by two      501(c)(3) tax exempt non-profit organization, the WRI and the      World Resources Institute Fund.       The WRI board of directors consists of thirty-two members      including representatives from fellow EPA grantee, the      Natural Resources Defense Council, and the League of      Conversation Voters. WRI describes its work as being,      ``concentrated on achieving progress toward four key goals:      protect Earth's living systems; increase access to      information; create sustainable enterprise and opportunity;      reverse global warming.''       In IRS reporting periods from 1998 to 2003, the WRI      regularly reports end of the year     net assets from $46 million to $57 million. During this same      period the WRI reported receiving varying amounts of annual      direct public contributions, from $8.6 million for 1998,      $14.3 million for 1999, $9.4 million for 2000, $15.7 million      for 2001, $21.7 million for 2002, and $9.3 million for 2003.      WRI has also reported consistently receiving millions of      dollars in government grants each year. WRI reported      receiving $3.2 million for 1998, $2.4 million for 1999, $2.9      for 2000, $2.3 for 2001, $3.4 for 2002, and $2.7 for 2003.      The WRI is also a regular recipient of EPA grants, totaling      around $8,132,060 million awarded since 1993. All except      $575,000 of the total amount of grants awarded to WRI were      awarded prior to the EPA competition policy. Additionally,      all of the $575,000 awarded since 2003 has been awarded in      amounts under the competition policy threshold or were      incremental amounts under already awarded original grants.      Unless the awarding office within EPA for any of the grants      within the $8.1 million instituted its own competition      policy, EPA acknowledges that all $8.1 million was likely      awarded without solicitation and competition with other      potential recipients.                      National Wildlife Federation       The National Wildlife Federation describes itself as ``the      nation's largest and oldest protector of wildlife.'' The      National Wildlife Federation is involved in various      environmental issues and features a ``Take Action'' page on      its Web site advocating for national global warming      legislation and characterizing the Bush Administration as      ``ax[ing] protections for National Forest across the      country.''       The National Wildlife Federation is represented by two      organizations: the National Wildlife Federation, a 501(c)(3)      organization, and the National Wildlife Action, a 501(c)(4)      organization.       The National Wildlife Federation has reported varying      annual end of the year net assets from $33.8 million in its      IRS filings for the period ending 2000 to $6.7 million for      2003. During the same period, the National Wildlife      Federation reports receiving direct public contributions from      $34.7 million for 1999 to $37.9 million for 2003 with public      contributions over $40 million for 2001 and 2002. The      National Wildlife Federation also reports consistent lobbying      expenditures from $140,000 to $371,000 from 2000 through      2003.       The National Wildlife Federation has also reported      regularly receiving government grants each year, with      $265,441 for 2000, $214,811 for 2001, $244,403 for 2002, and      $330,941 for 2003. EPA reports that it has awarded the      National Wildlife Federation approximately $600,000 since      1994 all of which was awarded in grants which individually      amounted to well under the EPA's new discretionary grant      competition policy threshold.                             stappa-alapco       STAPPA-ALAPCO is the combination of the State and      Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators, a 501(c)(3)      organization, and the Association of Local Air Pollution      Control Officials, a 501(c)(6) trade association. STAPPA-     ALAPCO describes itself as the ``two national associations      that represent air pollution control agencies in 54 states      and territories and over 165 major metropolitan areas across      the United States.''       STAPPA-ALAPCO receives no direct public contributions, and      according to the EPA, it receives all of its funding from EPA      through government grants. STAPPA-ALAPCO created a      ``Secretariat'' in 1980 and that has been receiving funding      through Clean Air Act grants from the EPA Office of Air and      Radiation since that time. These grants are exempt from the      EPA competition policy because of an exemption for co-     regulators.       STAPPA-ALAPCO has drawn the past criticism of Chairman      Inhofe for its regular Congressional testimony supporting a      variety of new EPA rulemakings. In his opening statement in      an EPW Committee hearing in July 2002 concerning      environmental regulations affecting military readiness,      Inhofe stated:       ``How many times has STAPPA-ALAPCO testified before      Congress, and how many times were they opposing the      streamlining of procedural paperwork. . . . These groups of      government bureaucrats invariably wind up testifying for      bigger government and opposing smaller government.       ``To add insult to injury, not only are the salaries of      these individual government employees paid with our tax      dollars; quite often the groups themselves receive separate,      additional, appropriated dollars to pay for the groups      themselves and the activities of these groups. As I say,      these activities almost invariably amount to lobbying for      bigger government and more expenditures of our tax dollars      with an emphasis not on better results but rather on more      procedures.''       Pursuant to a resolution of member states, EPA calculates      the individual shares of each member state and sets aside      funds from Clean Air Act grant allocations for a state to      fund STAPPA-ALAPCO. This method of EPA directly funding      STAPPA-ALAPCO has drawn past criticism. For instance,      language in the conference report for the 2001 Department of      Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and      Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill directed EPA to      withhold state and local grant funds at the national level to      pay for activities of programs only if such activities are      efforts that will benefit state and local air agencies, if      the activities are the responsibility of state and local air      agencies and if state and local air agencies have provided      their concurrence. A state is free to withdraw support from      STAPPA-ALAPCO. Additionally, a state is now also free to      support STAPPA-ALAPCO directly. In fact, not all states are      currently members of STAPPA-ALAPCO. In response to an EPW      Majority Staff request for the total amount of EPA grants      awarded to the STAPPA-ALAPCO Secretariat over the period      1988-2003, EPA responded with a list of five grants for a      total of $6,190,830.                               conclusion       The EPA awards over half of its annual budget each year in      grants. The GAO, OMB, and OIG have made various common      criticisms of EPA grants management, including a lack of      measurable environmental results, a lack of a measurable      probability of success from the grants, no evaluation of      reasonable costs in grants, and a general lack of oversight      of EPA personnel and grantees. Although much of EPA's grant      funding is provided in formula-based non-discretionary grants      to state and local governmental entities, several hundred      million dollars each year are awarded to discretionary      recipients. For several years, the GAO, OMB, and OIG have      criticized the management of these discretionary grants, in      particular citing that EPA has often awarded these grants      without widespread solicitation or competition with any other      potential applicants. The GAO has argued that EPA oversight      of discretionary grants has been particularly problematic      especially of non-profit recipients. The OIG has even argued      that this lack of competition in discretionary grants has      given the appearance of years of preferential treatment in      EPA discretionary grant awards. EPA has responded with new      competition and oversight policies and a five-year grants      management plan to cure the years of criticism of its overall      grants program. This preliminary report confirms some of      those criticisms in some individual discretionary grants and      highlights some promising practices within the EPA to better      manage and award discretionary grants.       However, this report also reveals the problem that EPA has      consistently awarded discretionary grants to non-politically      involved groups. These grants have been awarded in large part      without solicitation or competition with other applicants and      may have received the least oversight from EPA. The example      of the OIG audit of the Consumer Federation of America may be      a discrete situation or may simply be one example of non-     profit grant recipients taking advantage of past EPA grant      oversight to potentially use funds for unintended purposes.      In either case, however, EPA needs to be aware that it      regularly subsidizes non-profit organizations with      discretionary grant funding that are partisan or otherwise      politically active. Of all new reforms in EPA grants      management, reforms in discretionary grants can occur      immediately due to the fact they are just that--     discretionary. EPA should include in its new culture of grant      management a careful scrutiny of all the activities of      discretionary grant applicants to absolutely ensure grant      awards are being used for their intended purposes. In      addition, and as important as ensuring allowable costs, the      Administration should ensure that it is not being undermined      by the other activities of its grants recipients and give      equally careful scrutiny to the wide spectrum of political      activity of some of its discretionary grant recipients before      making awards.                          ____________________
