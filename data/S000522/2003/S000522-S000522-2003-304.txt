Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak out for human rights in Burma and to call for continued action against this regime. I commend my good friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. Pitts for his great leadership on this issue and his tremendous efforts on behalf of the Burmese people.  Earlier this year I stood on the floor of this House in support of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. The piece of legislation passed this House overwhelmingly, by a vote of 418-2. In the bill, we called on the State Department, and especially Secretary ofState Colin Powell, to use every opportunity to press for freedom and democracy in Burma.  I want to publicly encourage the Secretary to continue his outspoken call for freedom in Burma, and suggest some changes in the international strategy to bring about democracy and human rights in that country.  It is now clear that United Nations efforts to bring about democracy in Burma have completely failed. Rather than making progress, the efforts have simply bought time for the regime, and allowed it to perpetuate its increasingly brutal stranglehold on power. The United Nations envoy to Burma, rather than serving as a positive voice for change, has repeatedly bailed out the regime just as critical international pressure has begun to make a difference. His defense of the regime's head of military intelligence Khin Nyunt is beyond unacceptable.  It is time to review the personnel and mandate on the United Nations role in Burma, and to give a qualified mediator the tools they need, including access to the United Nations Security Council, to make a difference. The State Department should lead the efforts for these changes at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly.  The process is broken. We need to revamp this system with new actors as soon as possible.                          ____________________
