Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge Number 170, of the Croatian Fraternal Union, on the festive occasion of its Golden Member banquet on Sunday, September 16, 2012.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold its gala at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the celebration entails a formal recognition of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved fifty years of membership. This year's honorees who have attained fifty years of membership include: Judith Louise Aubuchon, Joan Clavin, Jacqueline Ann Donohue, Judith Ann Hanson, Virginia Mae Luketich, Carol Ann Magliola, Henryetta Massack, Mary Ann Matolin-Mancilla, Frank V. Morzlock, Kata V. Mrzljak, James Gabriel Popovich, Steve Prahovich, Mary Sajn, Joyce L. Schenher, Paulette Ann Smith, and Phyllis Stefankiewicz.  In addition to paying tribute to its Golden Members, the Lodge will honor George Rubick and Lou Chelich for their dedication to theCroatian Fraternal Union and for their many years of distinguished service.  This memorable day will begin with a mass at Saint Joseph the Worker Croatian Catholic Church in Gary, Indiana, with the Reverend Father Stephen Loncar officiating. The banquet will begin at 1:00 p.m.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President John Miksich and all members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170 for their loyalty and radiant display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families.                          ____________________
