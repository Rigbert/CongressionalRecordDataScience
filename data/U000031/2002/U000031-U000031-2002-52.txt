Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks tonight. As we look at a host of issues over this last year, a number of the votes that we have cast on other things, we have asked for science and the right equations be used as we cast these yes and no votes. The science is here. We know that this program works, and it would be wrong to deny this as a part of welfare reform as we look to have it reauthorized and continue to work and do what all of us want to have happen, and that is to move people that are currently able-bodied and have the tools to in fact lead productive lives and lead their families out of welfare and into a productive sector of our economy. This is a program that works.  The science shows that it does, and we have to make sure that we not only continue it, but we build upon it, allowing the governors to have the flexibility to match with their dollars to save more lives. That is what it is all about.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes).
