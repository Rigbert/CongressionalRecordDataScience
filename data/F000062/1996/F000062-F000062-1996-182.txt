 President, I want to thank the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, for his leadership on the issue of the resolution which was just passed by a vote of 97 to 0 in this body. I thank him for his cooperative approach to finding a text that all parties could agree on. I also express my thanks and admiration to the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Johnston, and the Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn, for their understanding of this issue and their efforts to craft a responsible resolution.  I would also like to thank Senators Murkowski, Helms, Simon, and Pell, and the distinguished majority leader, and their staffs, for working with all of us in a cooperative spirit on this resolution.  Mr. President, in the last 2 weeks we have watched as China has tested four missiles in close proximity to Taiwan, and the People's Liberation Army has conducted live-ammunition military exercises in the Taiwan Strait.  These tests and exercises are, obviously, aimed at showing in a militant fashion China's depth of feeling about the Taiwan issue and, many believe, to influence the Taiwanese election which will take place in a 2 short days.  It is unfortunate, I believe, that China has chosen to express its displeasure through the use of military threats. It is wrong, and the United States is right to deplore it. The United States has for over 24 years adhered to a One China policy that is based, in part, on the understanding that China will not seek to resolve its differences with Taiwan through other than peaceful means.  Our One China policy, of course, is also based on an understanding that Taiwan will not make any efforts to resolve its differences with China unilaterally or through any effort or move toward independence.  Clearly, a number of Taiwan's actions over the past several months--including President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States, Taiwanese military exercises concurrent with that visit, and an ongoing campaign for a seat at the United Nations--have called into question whether Taiwan is sincere in its statements that it opposes independence.  This resolution, then, sends two messages. It says to the Chinese that their use of military threats against Taiwan is unacceptable and represents a potential threat to United States interests in the western Pacific. President Clinton has deployed the USS Independence and the USS Nimitz to the region to monitor events. China must understand that the use of force against Taiwan would have grave consequences.  In addition, the resolution says to Taiwan that it must avoid provocative actions that cast doubt on its commitment not to pursue independence and, instead, to work for eventual peaceful reunification. Taiwan's security is important to the United States, but the United States will not sanction actions by Taiwan that raise tensions unnecessarily.  The One China policy is the essential element of the United States-China-Taiwan relationship. This policy has been the acknowledged framework that has served all three parties well for some two decades: The United States and China have been able to conduct normal relations befitting two great powers; China has entered into a period of dynamic economic growth; the United States and Taiwan have developed extensive economic and cultural ties; Taiwan has become the single largest investor in China, with over $20 billion in investments on the mainland; and, Taiwan has prospered and moved toward a democracy of which its people can be rightfully proud.  With all of these benefits flowing from the One China policy, and the fact that in a poll a week ago in Taiwan only 8 percent of the people favored independence and the overwhelming majority preferred the status quo, no one should take any precipitous action which would threaten to undermine the One China policy. In the aftermath of the Taiwan election, all three parties must move to restore balance to this relationship by reaffirming the One China policy.  China's concern, as relayed to me from its highest leadership, has been that Taiwan will not say that it endorses a One China policy and speaks with two tongues.  Mr. President, I would like to introduce into the Record a directive from Premier Lien Chan, the number two official of the Republic of China. His directive was made in writing on March 5. It was made public by Patrick Tyler, the Beijing reporter for the New York Times. I called the Taiwan office and received a copy of it. It is on two pages.  The part that I would like to quote is as follows:       I reiterate that the Republic of China government is      adamant in its pursuit of national reunification and strong      opposition to Taiwan independence.  When I called the Chinese Ambassador and made clear that this had been presented in writing, he made the point that it is presented in English but that it has appeared nowhere in Taiwan in Chinese.  I ask unanimous consent to have the directive printed in the Record, if I may, at this point in my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  A Directive From Premier Lien Chan, The Executive Yuan, Republic of                           China, March 5, 1996       It is the responsibility of the government of the Republic      of China to preserve peace and stability in and around the      Taiwan Straits in order to ensure public welfare and the      security of the nation. Since July 1995, the Chinese      communists have conducted several military exercises. Thanks      to the unity of our people and proper measures taken by our      government, the Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Yatsu area has      remained stable.       Early this morning, the mainland authorities announced      plans to launch missiles in waters to the northwest and      southwest of Taiwan between March 8 and March 15, 1996. This      action clearly is aimed at influencing the ROC's ninth      presidential and vice presidential election, destroying the      peace in the Taiwan Straits, and endangering regional peace      and stability. On behalf of the ROC government, I wish to      express the strongest protest, and call upon the mainland      authorities to cancel this provocation. We will hold Peking      responsible for any unfortunate consequences which arise from      this action.       Facing this situation, the Executive Yuan has directed the      concerned agencies to make the following preparation:       (1) The ROC armed forces have been directed by the      government to maintain a state of alert, and are prepared to      meet all possible actions of the Peking regime. They will      continue to monitor military activity on the mainland closely      provide instant reports, and take all necessary measures      immediately, as the need arises.       (2) We have already adopted necessary measures to ensure      the safety of our fishermen and normal air and sea      transportation in the vicinity.       (3) We will continue to maintain law and order, stabilize      the financial sector, and maintain normal economic      activities.       (4) The ROC's ninth presidential and vice presidential      election, a historic event to be held on March 23rd, shall be      carried out as planned.       I reiterate that the ROC government is adamant in its      pursuit of national reunification and strong opposition to      Taiwan independence. This election is being carried out in      accordance with the Constitution of the Republic of China,      and is in line with the will of the ROC people, and with      world trends.       The outcome of this election will not affect our position      on cross-Straits relations; nor will it alter our      government's steadfast pursuit of national reunification.       It has also been, and still is, the long-standing policy of      the ROC government to strengthen cross-Straits exchange and      negotiation while promoting positive interaction. The      difference in political systems and ways of life across the      Taiwan Straits is the main obstacle to reunification.      However, this is not an issue that can be resolved by      military means. An atmosphere that is conducive to      reunification can be created only by relying on patience,      promoting understanding through step-by-step exchange,      dissolving hostility, and pursuing a way of life that is most      beneficial to the Chinese on both sides of the Straits.      Popular will has indicated time and again that it is the      common aspiration of the people on both sides to see the end      of cross-Straits enmity and promote mutual benefits and      prosperity on the basis of peace.       The government of the Republic of China has already decided      that, in the future, it will foster consensus on a concrete      and feasible proposal that will make a historic contribution      to the development of cross-Straits peace and to the security      and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. The mainland      authorities should not unilaterally distort our position and      repeatedly take actions that damage the bonds between the      people on either side of the Taiwan Straits. This only      hampers cross-Straits exchanges and progress toward      reunification.       I hope that the entire body of ROC citizens will remain      calm and rational during this period, and continue to trust      and support their government. The government will take      appropriate and effective measures, and handle the situation      with caution and in a manner that ensures full protection to      the welfare of the people.
