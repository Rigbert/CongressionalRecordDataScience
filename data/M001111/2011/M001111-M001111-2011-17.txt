 President, I would like to pay tribute to a great American Governor, dedicated public servant, and community leader from the State of Washington, Governor Albert D. Rosellini.  Governor Rosellini has the kind of classic American story that so many of us can tell about our parents and grandparents. The son of Italian immigrants, he was born Jan. 21, 1910, in Tacoma, WA. His father, Giovanni, opened a saloon but was forced to close it during Prohibition. The family then moved to Seattle's Rainier Valley.  Rosellini was a graduate of the University of Washington law school in the early 1930s and was hired by King County prosecutor Warren G. Magnuson. He was elected to the State senate in 1938 and served for 18 years, during which time he championed the creation of the medical and dental schools at the University of Washington.  Rosellini was elected Governor of Washington in 1956 and reelected in 1960. His first term has been praised as one of the most effective and progressive in our State's history. In particular, he was credited with improving conditions in State prisons, mental hospitals, and juvenile homes. Rosellini fought for more modern facilities, training of staff members, jobs for inmates, and forestry camps for low-risk offenders. He also helped push for the creation of the SR 520 floating bridge across Lake Washington, from Seattle to Medina, WA, that bears his name today.  Governor Rosellini passed away on October 10, 2011, in Seattle at the age of 101. Rosellini's wife of 64 years, the former Ethel McNeil, passed away in 2002. Survivors include five children and 15 grandchildren. He will be missed dearly.  In addition to his many years serving the people of Washington State, Governor Rosellini also used his time and energy to mentor a new generation that wanted to get involved in government. He was one of the first supporters in my corner when I got into politics, and I know there are countless others across our State who benefitted from his advice and support over the years.  While the legacy Governor Rosellini leaves will be forever engrained in the State he loved so much, it will also be preserved through the men and women he boosted and supported who will continue building on his great work for Washington State families and communities.  I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in paying homage to Governor Albert D. Rosellini. He lived a long and full life and the people of Washington State will always be indebted to him for his role in shaping the future of our State. Our thoughts are with his loved ones at this time of great loss.                          ____________________
