He has correctly laid out the various time periods. Let me say again, the Senator from North Dakota knows both the chairman of the Commerce Committee and I are still wanting to work with those who feel that 5 years is too long a period. We are anxious to try to get an agreement and, hopefully, this can all be resolved as part of a managers' amendment.  I think the concern of certainly myself and others is that 2 years is too short because it is going to take some time to work through a subject as complicated as this, and then there is going to need to be a period where the States have the chance to address it. I think we can come up with a period that is acceptable. Of course, the moratorium, such as it is, applies only to Internet access taxes. It does not apply to other spheres of economic activity. And with respect to other spheres of economic activity, again, Internet will be treated just like anything else. If a State and a locality has other means of raising revenue, we want to make it clear that, with respect to the Internet, the business conducted there will be treated like everything else.  So let me yield back to the Senator from North Dakota at this time, with an assurance that we are going to continue to try to negotiate on this point an acceptable time period for all parties. We have discussed 4 years, and we have discussed a variety of options. We are going to continue to do that. I want it understood that both Senator McCain and I feel that the Senator from North Dakota is trying very hard to be helpful here, and we are going to continue to move forward in working with him to get this resolved.
