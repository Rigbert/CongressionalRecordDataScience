 President, the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment puts me in a difficult position because it combines two separate issues.  On one hand, I have consistently supported efforts to reverse the so-called Mexico City or International Gag Rule policy and therefore support reinserting the Kassebaum language that overturns the Mexico City policy.  On the other hand, I have consistently opposed United States funding for the U.N. Population Fund while the organization continues to operate in China. The amendment before us would strike a restriction on UNFPA funding that I have supported.  Of course, I must vote yes or no on the entire amendment. I cannot vote for part and against part.  Therefore, upon reflection, I will vote in favor of the amendment. International family planning programs provide important services that lead to healthier families and help to prevent high population growth rates, environmental degradation, and the need for abortion.  We can and we should continue to prohibit U.S. tax dollars from being used for abortions. But, I believe that the U.S. Government should not be dictating what nongovernmental organizations do with their own funds in their work to provide family planning services around the globe, as long as they do not use any Federal funds for abortion.  Nevertheless, I would like to make it clear to my colleagues and constituents that my vote today does not represent a change in my position on U.S. funding for the U.N. Population Fund at this time. We must continue to do all that we can to pressure the Government of China to cease any program of forced abortion or sterilization as a means of population control.
