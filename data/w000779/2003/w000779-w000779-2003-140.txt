President, on June 12, 2003, I published a notice in the Congressional Record of my intent to object to moving to H.R. 2350, a bill to extend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or ``TANF,'' our Nation's welfare program. My good friend from Oregon, Senator Smith, joined in this effort because the legislation does not contain a provision critical to Oregon's welfare program: a waiver of certain provisions that gives Oregon flexibility to operate a successful welfare program. Because of its waiver, which expires on June 30, 2003, Oregon has reduced its welfare rolls nearly 60 percent since 1994. It is clear that the waiver has allowed Oregon to meet local needs and craft what has been heralded as one of the best welfare programs in the country.  Since Senator Smith and I announced our public holds, the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, have worked closely with us to find a way so that Oregon can continue to operate under its waiver until TANF is fully reauthorized. They have helped obtain a letter from Department of Health & Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson to Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, myself and Senator Smith assuring us that Oregon can continue to operate without penalty under its waiver. I believe this letter provides Oregon the assurances necessary to continue to operate as if the waiver were still in place, and ask unanimous consent to insert the letter in the Record.
