 President, tomorrow following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the IDEA reauthorization bill. Under the previous agreement, there are up to eight amendments in order, in addition to the managers' amendment. The chairman and ranking member of the HELP Committee will be here tomorrow morning to begin working through these amendments. I would inform all Senators that rollcall votes are expected throughout the day as the Senate works toward passage of that important bill.                          ____________________
