Each year, the Asian-American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens and organizations for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, these honorees are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award each year at this annual banquet.  The Asian-American Medical Association has always been a great asset to northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical service to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and they have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's charity ball, the Asian-American Medical Association will present the Crystal Globe Award to the Indiana University School of Medicine--Northwest. Founded in 1972, the Indiana University School of Medicine--Northwest, which began with only four faculty members, has become the largest regional campus of the Indiana University School of Medicine outside of Bloomington and Indianapolis. Located on the campus of Indiana University--Northwest in Gary, Indiana, the school has received acclaim for its curriculum and innovation on a local, national, and international level. In particular, the Problem Based Learning Curriculum, which uses patient case studies as their primary educational tool, has received numerous accolades for the university since its inception in 1990. Since its founding in 1972 under the leadership of Dr. Panayotis Iatridis, the contributions of the Indiana University School of Medicine--Northwest, both in the education of its students and its commitment to the future, have been a source of pride and hope for the First Congressional District.  While the past 35 years have shown immense advancements in the school's curriculum, the future appears even brighter for the Indiana University School of Medicine--Northwest. Under the leadership of Dr. Patrick Bankston, the school has made plans to expand class size and to add the final two years of medical education to the curriculum. Once this plan becomes a reality, which may occur as early as 2011, northwest Indiana will, for the first time, allow students to complete their medical education within the region.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian-American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, the Indiana University School of Medicine--Northwest, for their outstanding contributions to medicine and to the community. Their members' unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational. For these reasons, they are to be praised, and I am proud to serve as their Representative in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
