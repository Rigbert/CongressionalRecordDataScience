 President, in the early 1950s, at a time when political backrooms were still smoke-filled and the sound of a woman's voice was still a cause for heads to turn, Betty Strong involved herself in politics in her home State of Iowa and did not hesitate to speak her mind. She turned many heads and made folks in Iowa listen in those days and folks have been listening to what she has had to say ever since.  A strong and rare woman, she had a deep and abiding commitment to the rough-and-tumble of the political process and will long stand as an inspiration to all of us, to every American who believes in the great idea of representative democracy, to all those whose values and dreams are represented by a political party and by the process through which we elect our representatives.  She held firm her deep beliefs. She was, first and foremost, a Democrat. In fact, Betty Strong was the grande-dame of Democrats in Iowa. She was an organizer who knew how to bring people together for a cause, a woman who understood the issues, knew the process better than almost anyone, and felt with every fiber of her being that she had not only the right but the duty as a citizen to fight for what she believed was right and fair and just. She fought on behalf of organized Labor and through the Central Labor Council for the basic dignity of the American worker, and for a host of causes in her community, and did not hesitate to make her opinion known, did not waver when it came to bringing about the changes necessary to elect those who agreed with her. But partisanship was not what we should remember when we remember Betty Strong today.  To watch her in action was to understand what America is all about. To see her build a coalition, to rally support, to bring out the best in her community to rise to an issue, to support a candidate, to lay out a platform, to build consensus, was truly a lesson in the best of the American political dynamic. And, every four years without fail, she was in the vanguard of the unique process we have come to understand as the Iowa Caucuses.  I first met her in 1987 when I entered the Iowa Caucuses, and I can say without hesitation or equivocation: I will never forget Betty Strong. She was with me then and her memory will remain with me always. I wrote her a letter in 1988 thanking her for her help and for her lifelong service, and I am honored to know that the letter hung on her living room wall all these years. I will long be beholden to Betty for her commitment, for her support, for her help, for the extraordinary grace she showed me and the dignity with which she lived her life and fought for the causes to which she was so committed.  Iowa has lost a great woman and I would ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the lasting contribution that Betty Strong made to that fundamental Tip O'Neill-notion that all politics is local. Today we mourn her loss and offer to her family and all of her friends in Iowa and across America, the thanks of a grateful Nation.                          ____________________
