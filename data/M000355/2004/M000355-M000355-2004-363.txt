 President, very briefly, I want to make sure people understand the tobacco buyout portion of the amendment upon which we are about to vote. No. 1, to make sure there are no misunderstandings or misconceptions, this amendment will end a tobacco price support program. That will be over. Second, there were several hearings on this proposal, both in the House and a field hearing in North Carolina chaired by Senator Dole.  I also want to make it clear how this amendment would pay for the buyout. It would be paid for by a manufacturer's fee, not by the taxpayers.  It was suggested that 85 percent of the recipients of the buyout are not farmers. In fact, every single quotaholder owns at least part of a farm. They may have leased it out, but they own at least part of a farm. So these do go to farmers.  I hope our colleagues will support the buyout. I think it is a reasonable proposal.  I yield the floor.
