Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, the Davis amendment seeks to turn our military hospitals into abortion mills. With all due respect to my friend and colleague from California, the amendment will result in babies being brutally killed by abortion, and women will be harmed and prolife Americans will be forced to facilitate and subsidize the slaughter of innocent children.  Abortion is violence against children, Mr. Chairman, and it harms women. Some methods including dismembering and ripping apart the fragile bodies of these children. Other methods include chemical poison. RU-486, a baby pesticide that was rushed to approval by the Clinton administration bypassing safety protocals along the way isn't just lethal to babies; it kills women as well. It is poison. Several women have died after taking RU-486.  Mr. Chairman, one of the methods depicted to my left is the D&E method. It is a common later-term method of abortion in which the arms and the legs and the torso of the baby are painfully hacked into pieces.
