President, I am pleased that the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, and also my good friend from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, have said that the majority is prepared to debate and vote on amendments to this bill. I know that a number of my colleagues want to bring amendments that are also important for the health and safety of American families and children.  I have some concerns, as I have expressed to the Senator from Michigan, on the overall bill. But with the assurances that we are going to have debate--I am not talking about dilatory debate, I am talking about real debate and amendments--I am prepared to take Senator Hatch and others at their word and proceed to this bill and work through it.  Having said that, I have some difficulties with aspects of the bill. I note for my colleagues that those difficulties go to particular constitutional and legal issues, not to the underlying concerns the Senator from Michigan has expressed.  The Senator from Michigan has expressed some very real concerns, many of which I share. He has done it in a way that shows a deep, heartfelt concern, a concern of conscience, and I applaud him for that. We will work through these particular things in the same way. As the Senator from Michigan knows, I did not take steps to delay this bill from coming out of committee. This bill deserves to have a vote. We deserve, some of us, and probably both sides, to have a vote on some of the amendments. We will do that.  I will urge my colleagues to vote to move forward with this bill.  I yield the floor.  I see nobody on our side looking for further time. I will yield, if this will help the Senator from Michigan, the remainder of my time to him, with the understanding that if somebody comes up I am sure he will take care of their time.
