President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Hirono. Our amendment would create a deficit-neutral reserve fund to expand access to higher education for some of our neediest students through the Pell grant program.  The amendment would allow for year-round Pell grants so students who want to accelerate their degrees by taking additional courses, including during the summer, can receive an additional Pell grant when they need itand complete their education more quickly without having to wait for the next academic year to begin.  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.
