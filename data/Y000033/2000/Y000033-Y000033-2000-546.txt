Mr. Speaker, I rise today in regards to yesterday's crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261. In all, an estimated 88 people lost their lives off the southern coast of California at 4:36 p.m. Unfortunately, it is too early to know the cause of this devastating crash. Our prayers go out to all the family and friends of those who lost their loved ones in the crash.  Among Alaska Airlines Flight 261 were an estimated five Alaskans. Included were Malcolm Branson and his fiance, Janice Stokes, both of Ketchikan. Also onboard the airplane was Morris Thompson, age 61, his wife Thelma and daughter Sheryl. The Thompson's were returning to Alaska after a family vacation in Mexico.  Morris Thompson, Thelma, Lu and I have been friends for more than 40 years. Thelma, an experienced dog musher and Morris were married a year after Lu and I were married. Morris and I followed each other on similar paths to public office. Oftentimes we spent time together in Juneau, Alaska, when I served in the State Legislature and later in Washington, DC where I served as Congressman and Morris served as commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  After his public service, Morris became president and chief executive officer of Doyon, Ltd., a Native Corporation formed in 1971 as part of the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act. At Doyon, Morris turned an operating loss of $28 million into $70.9 million in revenues and the largest private landowning corporation in America. Morris Thompson retired in January and was considered a great Native leader, businessman, and friend. I had a conversation with Morris just last month and he was describing to me the cabin he planned to build on the Yukon River and his optimism for the future.  Morris Thompson, his wife Thelma and daughter Sheryl spent a great deal of time with me and my family. In fact, we rang in the New Millennium with Sheryl. Sheryl Thompson grew up with our daughters and became so close to our family that we considered her part of the family. Morris is survived by two young daughters named Nicole and Allison and two grandsons Christopher and Warren.  I will always have fond memories of the Thompson family. Such as Morris and I duck hunting on the Yukon River, Thelma mushing her dog's, and Sheryl managing the extreme skiing association in Valdez. God Bless the memories we have.  Morris was a good father, leader and friend, as well as being one of the great leaders among the Native community. Lu, and I are in shock over this tragic loss. Our prayers go out to the Alaska Airlines employees and their families, and the families and relatives of the 88 passengers that were lost.                          ____________________
