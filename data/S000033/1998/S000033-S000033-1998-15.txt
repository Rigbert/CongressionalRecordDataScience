 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and in opposition to giving the President fast track negotiating authority.  Mr. Speaker, we have had 4 years to analyze the results of NAFTA, a trade deal negotiated under fast track, 4 years to watch our trade deficit skyrocket, workers' wages decline, and jobs leave the United States by the hundreds of thousands.  From 1993 to 1997, under NAFTA, a $1.7 billion trade surplus with Mexico has been turned into a $14.5 billion trade deficit. We went from a surplus to a deficit. During the debate over NAFTA, the multinational corporations who told us how great this policy would be predicted that NAFTA would create 200,000 jobs by 1995. Instead, we lost 400,000 jobs by 1997.                              {time}  1500  Further, NAFTA is being used as a corporate tool to threaten workers and to lower wages. According to a study done at Cornell University, 62 percent of corporations in America have used NAFTA or similar agreements to drive down wages and benefits.  This Cornell study also found that U.S. companies used the threat of moving their companies to Mexico more frequently now than before NAFTA was enacted. These are some of the great results of NAFTA.  Mr. Speaker, last year I went to Mexico, along with the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) and the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) to see what was going on there in the wake of the NAFTA agreement. I saw with my own eyes the horrendous pollution caused by the maquiladora companies in the area, pollution which is hurting the Mexicans as well as Americans along the border. Let us vote this agreement down. Let us kill it.
