Today, we see the result in an announcement that the White House and Pentagon carefully leaked to the press last night in an attempt to put a positive spin on what anyone who knows the issue can see is a step backward.  We see that the Bush administration has abandoned any pretext of joining other civilized nations to eliminate these outmoded, indiscriminate weapons.  Before I explain why the administration's policy is so deeply disappointing to those of us who have worked on this issue for years, I want to be clear of my respect for Secretary of State Powell, for Assistant Secretary Lincoln Bloomfield, and others in the State Department who administer our humanitarian demining programs. These programs save lives and limbs, and this administration's plan to increase funding for these programs by $20 million is constructive. It is far too little, especially for the wealthiest Nation on earth, but it is a positive step.  I also want to emphasize that, except for in Korea, the United States no longer uses the type of landmines which pose the gravest risk to innocent people, the way some nations and rebel forces do. Instead, we are helping countries clear their minefields. Just this week, the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, led so courageously by Bobby Muller, signed an agreement with the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense to conduct a countrywide survey of unexploded mines and other bombs, many of which were left by our soldiers, as well as by Vietnamese soldiers, and which continue to maim and kill innocent people. Once that survey is completed, we and other nations can help remove these explosives and end the deadly legacy of that war.  So the issue for the United States is not whether the U.S. is using mines that are causing civilian casualties. In fact, we have not used landmines since 1991 in the first Gulf war, and there is no evidence those mines had any effect whatsoever. In fact there is no evidence the Iraqis even knew they were there. The real issue, which the Pentagon and White House are either incapable of grasping or, more likely, want to ignore, is that as long as the United States, with by far the most powerful Armed Forces ever known in history, continues to insist on its right to use these indiscriminate weapons, other nations with armies far weaker than ours are going to insist on their right to use them also.  The victims are going to be innocent civilians and U.S. soldiers who, even today, are losing their lives and limbs from mines in Iraq.  Mr. President, over 2 years ago, the Bush administration announced it would review U.S. landmine policy. I welcomed that review. I told President Bush, the Secretary of State, and officials in the Pentagon that I wanted to find an approach with broad, bipartisan support, including from the Pentagon. Also, as much as I wanted us to be one of the overwhelming majority of nations that have joined the treaty, I knew the Bush administration was not likely to do that. I felt that working together we could move toward that goal by strengthening our own policy.  Today, over 2 years later, and after refusing to consult with me or other Members of Congress on either side, the White House announced its plans. We now see that we would have been far better off if the administration had not conducted its review in the first place. Except for a few positive aspects, the policy is a disappointing step backward.  What we see is another squandered opportunity for U.S. leadership on a crucial arms control and humanitarian issue. We see the United States saying we will continue to use landmines indefinitely.  Once again, we had the opportunity to join the civilized world in solving a global crisis, as all our NATO allies have. And once again, we have chosen unilateral arrogance over leadership and cooperation.  The administration's press office has done an impressive job portraying this policy as an important advance, but it is not.  They say they will eliminate persistent landmines by 2010. That is constructive. But in fact, except for Korea, the United States has not used these types of mines for decades.  Six years ago, the Clinton administration, including the Pentagon, pledged to ``search aggressively'' for alternatives to self-destructing anti-vehicle mine systems by 2006. The Bush administration abandons this pledge and will allow the use of these mines anywhere, indefinitely.  In 1998, the Clinton administration pledged that it would sign the Ottawa treaty banning anti-personnel mines by 2006, if suitable alternatives to these mines were fielded by then. The Bush administration abandons this pledge.  The Bush administration says it will seek a worldwide ban on the sale or export of persistent mines, but that we will keep our self-destruct mines indefinitely. Let's be honest. We tried that back in 1994, and the reason it failed was, not surprisingly, that other countries said ``if you, the world's strongest military power are unwilling to give up your landmines, why should we give up ours?''  Mr. President, I had hoped that the President would seize this opportunity to show real leadership. We can solve this problem if we set the example. It could be done so easily. Instead, the President has taken us backwards.  I will speak more about this in future weeks. I do appreciate the consideration of my colleagues in giving me this time.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                              The White House,                                         Washington, May 15, 1998.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The President has asked me to confirm      our understanding regarding the one-year statutory moratorium      on the use of anti-personnel landmines (APLs) that is due to      take effect next February. We very much appreciate your      working so closely with us to define an approach that meets      not only our solemn obligation to provide for the protection      and safety of our Armed Forces in battle, but also our mutual      goal of advancing our efforts to rid the world of APLs.       We are very gratified that you will not oppose adding      flexibility to the 1996 moratorium legislation in the form of      a Presidential waiver authority that would be attached to the      pending FY 1999 defense authorization bill when it is      considered by the Senate next week.       In this context, let me reiterate the following commitments      on the part of the Administration:       The United States will destroy by 1999 all of its non-self-     destructing APLs, except those needed for Korea.       The United States will end the use of all APLs outside      Korea by 2003, including those that self-destruct.       The United States will aggressively pursue the objective of      having APL alternatives ready for Korea by 2006, including      those that self-destruct.       The United States will search aggressively for alternatives      to our mixed anti-tank systems by (a) actively exploring the      use of APL alternatives in place of the self-destructing      anti-personnel submunitions currently used in our mixed      systems and (b) exploring the development of other      technologies and/or operational concepts that result in      alternatives that would enable us to eliminate our mixed      systems entirely.       Finally, the United States will sign the Ottawa Convention      by 2006 if we succeed in identifying and fielding suitable      alternatives to our anti-personnel landmines and mixed anti-     tank systems by then.       Again, I thank you for your leadership on this issue.           Sincerely,                                             Samuel R. Berger,                                        Assistant to the President                                    for National Security Affairs.
