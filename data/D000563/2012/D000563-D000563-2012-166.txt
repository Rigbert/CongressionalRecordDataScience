President, 4 years ago our economy was in a free fall. AIG had been bailed out, and Lehman Brothers plunged into bankruptcy. The depth of the recession we fell into is difficult to understate.  With the economy contracting at nearly 9 percent in the last few months of 2008 and nearly 700,000 jobs lost every month, it is not an exaggeration to call the crisis we faced the worst since the Great Depression. Demand dried up as our financial system collapsed, families struggled to pay the bills, and millions lost their homes to foreclosure. Our unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent nationally and 11.4 percent in Illinois.  It has been a hard road back to stable economic ground, but things have turned around. Private sector businesses are hiring again and have been for 30 straight months. Between July 2011 and July 2012, the economy added an average of 153,000 jobs every month--about 1.8 million jobs. Compare that to the average monthly losses of 544,000 between July 2008 and July 2009.  There is a lot of work still to be done. We all would like to see more jobs created, but it is clear our economy is better off and we are better off than we were 4 years ago.  I saw many examples of our economic progress as I have traveled my State. The Nucor steel plant in Bourbonnais, IL, makes rebar and angle iron that is used in construction across the country. What makes Nucor unique is that during the recession when many other companies were shedding employees, Nucor made a commitment to keep all of their full-time employees. It wasn't easy. When demand slowed, the company's idle workers developed new products for customers or they were actually, in many cases, sent out to work in the community on service projects as they waited for their company to get back into business.  During this time the Bourbonnais facility applied for and received the Department of Labor's Voluntary Protection Program star certification, recognizing their extraordinary efforts to improve workplace safety. Nucor made a commitment not just to the bottom line but to its workers and to the communities where they lived. It has paid off. Demand has returned, and the company is now firing on all cylinders, employing roughly 300 workers.  I have visited a lot of different production facilities. There was nothing more jaw-dropping than to stand in that steel mill and watch these three poles go into a caldron of scrap metal, burst and explode into flames, and then watch steel come trickling out of the bottom into these forms to make rebar and angle iron.  Earlier this summer I also met with the CEO of Woodward, an aerospace and energy firm, about its possible expansion of a facility in Loves Park, IL. Woodward was considering two locations for expanding its airline turbine product line. In the end, thank goodness for us, Woodward picked Illinois. The company is investing more than $200 million in the facility, and it is estimated that it will add 600 new jobs over the next 5 years.  There is more to the story. While growing demand led to the expansion decision, it was the infrastructure and skilled workers that sealed the deal for Loves Park. Loves Park and the Rockford area has been the home of aerospace companies for decades. Yet they made a concerted effort to grow and expand the training opportunities to meet modern workforce needs. Through a public-private partnership, the community has created an atmosphere that attracts new business investments and new jobs.  Illinois is about the last place--and southern Illinois certainly the last place--one would expect to find a world-leading firm in oilspill cleanups, but if one goes to Fairfield and Carmi, IL, that is what one will find. The Elastec/American Marine Company specializes in equipment to clean up environmental accidents, specifically oilspills. In two former Wal-Mart buildings in those towns, 140 employees have developed new technologies that have expanded our ability to clean up oilspills around the world. Just last year, the company won a $1 million X PRIZE for recovering more than 2,500 gallons per minute--triple the industry's previous best recovery rate in controlled conditions. This is in southern Illinois. Testing oilspill cleanup in southern Illinois is hard to imagine. Elastec's equipment was used for cleanups during both Exxon Valdez and the more recent gulf spill.  This is American ingenuity at its best, but the business is driven by regulations governing the discharge of oil. Without these ``job-killing'' regulations, the company, its jobs, and the technology it uses to clean up oilspills probably wouldn't exist.  I also visited Akorn--not the ACORN that has been debated at length on the floor of the Senate. Akorn, spelled with a ``k,'' is a pharmaceutical company in Decatur, IL, which manufactures products such as drugstore eye drops and liquid injectables used in surgery. Akorn employs 500 people in Illinois at facilities in Decatur, Lake Forest, Skokie, and Gurnee.  Since 2009 the company has been one of Chicago's and Illinois' fastest growing public companies. In 2011, Akorn launched a multimillion-dollar expansion at its two Decatur facilities. They have doubled production and added 100 jobs. They are looking to hire another 20 to 25 people with backgrounds in finance, production, chemistry, microbiology, engineering, and business. These are highly technical, good-paying jobs right in central Illinois.  One of my last stops in August was at the Chrysler plant in Belvidere. What a great story. Only 3 years ago there was a serious concern that this plant was going away. At the time Chrysler was facing bankruptcy and the plant was building a now defunct model, the Dodge Caliber, and different models of the Jeep. Plant production had slowed to a single shift, and employment had dropped to as low as 200 people.  The Federal Government offered a bridge loan and helped to facilitate a merger with Fiat. With government assistance, Chrysler has emerged from bankruptcy and is profitable. In October 2010, Chrysler announced a nearly $700 million investment at the Belvidere plant to retool for the production of a new Dodge Dart. The plant reached full production in July of this year, now employing 4,698 workers. If the auto industry had been allowed to collapse, between 1.1 million and 3.3 million jobs would have been lost between 2009 and 2011.  These are stories of businesses in my home State. I asked my staff to find businesses that survived the recession or are expanding and hiring people. I want to hear their stories and listen to the stories of all kinds of different businesses, large and small, expanding today--businesses that weathered the recession and are now successful. Business is picking up. These businesses are hiring people back, in some cases expanding.  Their stories aren't unique. Across America, 30 consecutive months of private sector job growth tells us we are moving in the right direction. In that time 4.6 million private sector jobs have been created. In Illinois alone 140,400 private sector jobs have been added since January 2010. Manufacturing employment has rapidly grown, adding 44,600 or 37 percent of 140,400 jobs.  During the last quarter of 2008, the economy was shrinking at a rate of nearly 9 percent. It was in free fall. During the most recent quarter the economy is growing on the positive side--1.7 percent. In March of 2009 the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen to 6,547. Since then it has nearly doubled to almost 13,000 today.  New home sales were up 3.6 percent in July. That is 25 percent over last year. U.S. goods and services exports increased .9 percent from May 2012 to June 2012 and have increased by 5.9 percent from the same time period last year.  The American people see these facts and figures. They also feel the improvement in their communities, with new businesses opening, and on their blocks, with the housing market recovering as well. We are much better off than we were 4 years ago. Now is not the time to go back to policies that brought us into this recession but to move forward, creating even more jobs and expanding more businesses.
