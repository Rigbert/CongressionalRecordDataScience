Clarence Seavers of Sandusky, OH, who will be presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Erie County Democratic Party on February 23, 2007. Our formercolleague and Ohio Governor Ted Strickland will present Clarence with the inaugural award. I know of no finer person to receive this distinguished recognition in its first year than my friend, Clarence Seavers.  Wherever one goes in Erie County OH, there will be Clarence Seavers. Well into his eighth decade of life, Mr. Seavers remains an active community participant. Not one to seek the glory of leadership, he is nonetheless a community leader in the truest sense, leading us by example to be good citizens.  A lifelong resident of Sandusky, Mr. Seavers is a WorId War II veteran, and was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame for his service with the 811th Aviation Engineering Battalion. He served the whole of U.S. involvement, 1941-1945, building airfields in the Pacific Theatre. Following military service, Mr. Seavers joined the ranks of the civil service, working as a clerk for the U.S. Postal Service for 30 years until his 1978 retirement.  In addition to his presence at many community events, Mr. Seavers has also formally given of his time in numerous ways. He has served on the boards of the YMCA, Goodwill Industries, Providence Hospital, Firelands Regional Medical Center, Erie County Board of Elections, Erie County Health Department, Chamber of Commerce, Boy Scouts and Erie Huron Community Action Commission. He is a lifetime member of the NAACP and a member of St. Stephen's AME Church. He volunteers as a baseball umpire and at the Ohio Veterans Home. His community calls him ``one of Erie County's heroes and treasures,'' a sentiment I echo. Yet, true to the man, Clarence Seavers says of his involvement, ``I just tried to give something back. As long as you're able, you can never give back too much.''  Clarence Seavers has never been one to hide his light beneath a bushel. Instead, he has let his light shine forth in guidance. Quiet, humble, with graceful dignity, he is a fine example of the best that is in us. He has been a wise counsel to me, and countless others, and we dearly value his friendship. Clarence Seavers has spent his lifetime in achievement, and I am so honored to share with my colleagues a glimpse at the embodiment of a true American patriot as I congratulate Clarence Seavers on his receipt of this distinguished recognition.                          ____________________
