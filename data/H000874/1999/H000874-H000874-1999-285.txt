Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I have great respect and very close personal friendship with the previous speaker. I have great respect for his intellect and for his knowledge with respect to the defense posture of the United States. He is one of our leaders on the Committee on Armed Services, and he has a view which is based upon a very thoughtful analysis of the situation.  Having said that, he and I disagree on this issue.  Now the specific issue, as I understand it, that confronts us is the amendment of the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Fowler), who is also my friend and for whom I have a great deal of respect, and that specific amendment, as I understand it, limits the Gejdenson amendment which tries to define the limits of participation of the United States in an action by NATO in Kosovo to ensure that the killing and the displacement of persons will stop and that an environment will be created conducive to the possibility of peace for the people of Kosovo, the people of Serbia and indeed the people of the region.                              {time}  2045  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), however, spoke to the overall issue, not to the amendment, the overall issue as to whether or not we ought to support the President.  I am hopeful that this Congress does, in fact, support the President. The previous speaker, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett), spoke of the Constitution. That issue, I would suggest, is not relevant at this point in time, because in fact the Congress is considering whether or not to authorize the President to participate with troops, with American force, in the implementation of a peace agreement.  Very frankly, Mr. Chairman, I doubt that there is a Member on this floor who does not know and does not have a conviction that if America does not participate, there will not be an agreement, period. If there is not an agreement, the butcher of Belgrade, call it a civil war if you want, will continue to commit atrocities. We call them war crimes, genocides, the elimination of a people because of their ethnic or national origin. It occurred in Bosnia and we stood for too long silent.  My friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) had a chart. He talked about 40 years prior to the end of the Cold War that we had 8 deployments. Do my colleagues remember what two of those deployments were in those 40 years? Korea, Vietnam; between them, approximately 100,000 plus loss of life.  In the deployments that have occurred since 1990, we have been very fortunate. No one would have predicted so few losses of lives in the Persian Gulf.  I have stood on this floor with some of my colleagues, and in many of the deployments the predictions of disaster were frequent and impassioned. That was the case in Haiti. That was the case in Bosnia, and that has been the case in other instances of deployment.  Yes, the United States has a unique role and the world, frankly, is better off because we on this floor and the President of the United States and the American people are prepared to accept a responsibility that we would prefer not to have, but it is ours because of our might; it is ours because of our position in the world as the leader; it is ours because we are a moral nation that acts upon its moral precepts.  Are we always perfect? Of course not, but all of us on this floor and every American can be proud of the fact thatit is America usually, not always but usually, that raises the issue of humanitarian concerns, not solely economic or strategic concerns.
