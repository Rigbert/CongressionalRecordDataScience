President, I truly appreciate that from the Presiding Officer.                40th Anniversary of American Agri-Women  Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the American Agri-Women who are celebrating their 40th anniversary this year. The American Agri-Women officially began in November of 1971, with the Kansas Agri-Women one of the earliest State groups. Forty years later, the American Agri-Women have grown to represent tens of thousands of women involved in all aspects of agriculture in all 50 States.  It is rather amazing that membership includes women of all ages from many different professions within the agriculture industry. These talented women are farmers, ranchers, and consumers; they are students, accountants, educators, marketers, managers, researchers, and even elected officials, among many others.  It is impossible to list all of the accomplishments these hard-working women have achieved for the agriculture industry over the last four decades, but perhaps their biggest success has been initiating the national Agriculture in the Classroom Initiative--a program that continues to be widely implemented in schools all over the country to educate children on modern agriculture.  Throughout the year, the Agri-Women have been engaging in their ``Drive across America'' tour--a road trip across the country to spread the word of the vital role women play in agriculture. Their drive ended last week in Maine, where they hold their annual convention.  During this tour, they also educated consumers on all the challenges that farmers and ranchers face and highlighted the role the United States plays in the global food system.  I have had the opportunity to meet with many of these women and discuss the work of the agriculture committee during their stop in their trip to Washington. They met with many members of the committee and many others interested in agriculture. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in celebrating the last 40 years of American Agri-Women and the hard work of all of the women in our agriculture community, without whom the United States would be unable to provide the highest quality food, fuel, and fiber domestically and around a very troubled and hungry world.  I yield the floor.
