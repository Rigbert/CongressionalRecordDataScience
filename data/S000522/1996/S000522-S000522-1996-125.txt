Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out to my friend, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Chrysler], who just spoke, that the reason we have the record level 21 percent of all legal immigrants on welfare is because we do admit over 80 percent without any regard to skills or education.  The problem with this amendment is that it will continue the status quo. The bill tries to increase the percentage of individuals who are admitted on the basis of skills and education. This amendment would leave us right where we are, and over 80 percent would be admitted without any regard to that.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to cite some studies that have been done on the question of how legal immigrants, competition with legal immigrants, depresses wages and costs jobs, and I just do not see how the proponents of this amendment can ignore these studies when we know we are dealing with real lives and real hardship.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, immigration was responsible for 50 percent of the decline in real wages for America's lowest scale workers, those who did not complete high school. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute says that in the high-immigration States of Arizona, California, Florida, New York, and Texas, that men's wages were 2.6 percent and women's wages 3.1 percent below the average for other States that were not high-immigration States.  Dr. Frank Morris, the immediate past president of the Council of Historically Black Graduate Schools, said there can be no doubt that our current practice of permitting more than 1 million legal and illegal immigrants per year into the United States, into our already difficult low-skilled labor markets, clearly leads to both wage depression and the de facto displacement of African-American workers with low skills.  The Urban Institute says this. The immigration reduces the weekly earnings of less-skilled African-American men and women and also that group most clearly and severely disadvantaged by newly arrived immigrants is other recent immigrants. A 10-percent increase in the number of immigrants reduces other immigrants' wages by 9 to 10 percent.  Finally, in a book by Julian Simon, the patrol saint of the open-borders proponents, he says this: ``There is no doubt that workers in some industries suffer immediate injury from the addition of immigrant workers in these same categories.''  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                         parliamentary inquiry
