Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to a group of individuals--heroes--who are receiving the recognition and honor they deserve for their service to our country. Operation Recognition is operated by the Riverside County Office of Education with assistance from the Riverside County Department of Veterans' Services. The program awards high school diplomas to veterans who missed completing high school due to military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or for those who were interned in WWII Japanese-American relocation camps.  A recognition ceremony will be held on November 12, 2013, for the following individuals who received their high school diplomas through Operation Recognition:  Austin Elmer Lee Acord; David M. Barnes; Kenneth James Becker; Raymond Frederick Carter; Robert Dale Cloyd; Michael William Divel; Alan F. Gonsalves; Larry James Lyon; Cruz Martinez; Frank Ramirez Rodriguez; Frank Sandwell; Samson Charles Trevino; and Ruben David Zamora.  Our country owes a debt of gratitude to all the above recipients for their service and sacrifice. I salute all of these individuals and congratulate them on receiving their high school diploma.                          ____________________
