Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from New York for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, just let me ask my friend, is there any point in the pregnancy, any point in the 9 months, thenormal gestational period, at which time the gentleman believes that child is sufficiently formed, sufficiently mature, that all the body systems are working, as we all know with ultrasound, is there any point where the child deserves protection?
