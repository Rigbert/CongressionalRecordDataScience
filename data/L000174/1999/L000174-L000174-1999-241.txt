I hope everybody reads the letter dated June 18, 1999, because it says:       . . . we support legislation to establish dairy compacts      and amend the federal order system if those provisions are      coupled with the legislation to establish the dairy support      price of $12.50 per hundredweight.  Even though my distinguished colleagues from Wisconsin quote from the National Farmers Union as somebody we should be listening to, my colleagues specifically oppose what the National Farmers Union says they want. I would vote for that NFU proposal in a minisecond; I had hoped that since the NFU proposal benefits all dairy farmers that we could have worked together on this. But the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin opposes it.  There are a lot of quotes going around here. The National Grange strongly supports the Northeast Dairy Compact. They represent 300,000 members nationwide, and they say that ``regional dairy compacts offer the best opportunity to preserve family dairy farms.''  If we are going to quote some of these organizations, let us be honest in what they say. They support the dairy compacts. These farm organizations strongly support it. A few processors and the Senators from Wisconsin do not.
