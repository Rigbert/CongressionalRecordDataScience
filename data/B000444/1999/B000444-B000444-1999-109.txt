 Robinson, Dr. Tarter, Dr. Tarter again, Dr. Browne, Dr. Robinson, Mr. Levin, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Tarter, Dr. Tarter and Dr. Browne; it is an exchange.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Lab Directors' Written Testimony--Key Quotes on Stockpile Stewardship,            October 7, 1999, Armed Services Committee Hearing       Dr. Robinson, Page 5:       I believed then, as I do now, that it may be possible to      develop the Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship approach as a      substitute for nuclear testing for keeping previously tested      nuclear weapons designs safe and reliable.       Dr. Tarter, Page 1:       The bottom line remains the same as it has been in my      previous testimonies before this Committee. Namely, that a      strongly supported, sustained Stockpile Stewardship Program      has an excellent chance of ensuring that this nation can      maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the      stockpile without nuclear testing.       Dr. Tarter, Page 4:       In December 1998, we completed the third annual      certification of the stockpile for the President and were      able to conclude that nuclear tests were not required at this      time to assure the safety and reliability of the nation's      nuclear weapons.       Dr. Brown, Page 1:       I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program      will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear      deterrent without nuclear testing.       Senator Levin. . . . what you are telling us is that if      this safeguard and the other safeguards are part of this      process that you can rely on . . ., Dr. Robinson, you are on      board in terms of this treaty; is that correct?       Dr. Robinson. I am on board that science-based stockpile      stewardship has a much higher chance of success and I will      accept it as the substitute.       Senator Levin. For what?       Dr. Robinson. I still had other reservations about the      treaty--       Senator Levin. As a substitute for what?       Dr. Robinson. As a substitute for requiring yield tests for      certification.       Senator Levin. Dr. Tarter?       Senator Tarter. A simple statement again: It is an      excellent bet, but it is not a sure thing.       Senator Levin. My question is are you on board, given these      safeguards?       Senator Tarter. I can only testify to the ability of      stockpile stewardship to do the job. It is your job about the      treaty.       Senator Levin. Are you able to say that, providing you can      rely on safeguard F and at some point decide that you cannot      certify it, that you are willing under that condition to rely      on this stewardship program as a substitute for actual      testing?       Senator Tarter. Yes.       Senator Levin. Dr. Browne?       Senator Browne. Senator Levin, if the government provides      us with the sustained resources, the answer is yes, and if      safeguard F is there, yes.
