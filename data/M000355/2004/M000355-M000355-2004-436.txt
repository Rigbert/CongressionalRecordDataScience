Res. 39. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003; to the Committee on Finance.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, along with 52 of my colleagues I am reintroducing a resolution to renew the import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. This resolution is identical to the language in S.J. Res. 36, introduced by myself and others on April 29, 2004, except that the preamble has been stricken. I am pleased that Secretary of State Colin Powell has written in support of this legislation.  I again urge the Senate Finance Committee to expedite consideration of this legislation, which enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate.                          ____________________
