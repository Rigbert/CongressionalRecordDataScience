 President, I am told the majority leader will be out shortly. Let me just mention that the vote is likely to be moved from 5:45 to 5:55, for the information of all Senators. We have a structured order for debate for the balance of the morning and afternoon that has already been agreed to.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
