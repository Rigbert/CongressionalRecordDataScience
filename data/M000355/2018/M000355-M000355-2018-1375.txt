  During Police Week, thousands of officers from across the Nation and the world travel here to Washington to remember their fallen comrades and rededicate themselves to protecting our communities. I welcome them, particularly the peace officers from the State of Kentucky. I look forward to visiting later today with members of the Louisville Metro Police Department. We owe them and the departments across the Commonwealth our heartfelt thanks for keeping the Bluegrass State safe and secure.  I also wish to pay tribute today to members of Kentucky's law enforcement community who made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.  Since Police Week last year, three of the Commonwealth's finest have fallen in the line of duty. Officer Scotty Hamilton, a 12-year veteran of the Pikeville Police Department, was fatally shot while on duty.
