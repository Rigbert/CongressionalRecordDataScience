Chairman, earlier today I attended a ceremony in Annapolis, Maryland, at which Governor Parris Glendening signed into law a bill creating the ``Judith P. Hoyer Early Child Care and Education Enhancement Program.'' Because of my attendance at that ceremony, I was unable to vote on two amendments to H.R. 4205, the Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001. Had I had been present, I would have voted ``no'' on the amendment numbered 2 offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) (Roll No. 194). I would have voted ``aye'' on the amendment numbered 3 offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) (Roll No. 195).                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Luther  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Burr of North Carolina). The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote on Amendment No. 4 offered by the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Luther) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the noes prevailed by voice vote.  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. Luther:  4. An Amendment To Be Offered by Representative Luther of Minnesota       At the end of subtitle C of title I (page 27, after line      24), insert the following new section:     SEC. __. DISCONTINUATION OF PRODUCTION OF TRIDENT II (D-5)                    MISSILES       (a) Production Termination.--Funds appropriated for the      Department of Defense for fiscal years after fiscal year 2001      may not be obligated or expended to commence production of      additional Trident II (D-5) missiles.       (b) Authorized Scope of Trident II (D-5) Program.--Amounts      appropriated for the Department of Defense may be expended      for the Trident II (D-5) missile program only for the      completion of production of those Trident II (D-5) missiles      which were commenced with funds appropriated for a fiscal      year 2002.       (c) Funding Reduction.--The amount provided in section 102      for weapons procurement for the Navy is hereby reduced by      $472,900,000.                             Recorded Vote  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. A recorded vote has been demanded.  A recorded vote was ordered.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. This will be a 5-minute vote.
