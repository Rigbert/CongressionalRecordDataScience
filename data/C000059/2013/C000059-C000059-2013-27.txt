Speaker, I rise today to honor the 100th anniversary of the Corona Road Race. On September 14, 2013, the race will celebrate its centennial. The Corona Road Race has a rich and colorful past, which has contributed to the diversity and history of our county and to auto racing at-large.  Designed by civil engineer H. Clay Kellogg, Grand Boulevard, the road set as the centerpiece in the city of Corona, provided the perfect circular shape and venue for the first Corona Road Race. Spanning three miles, the track was set up for a variety of races including the 102 mile ``Light Car Race,'' the 251 mile ``Heavy Car Race,'' and the 301 mile ``Free-For-All Race.'' With the right setting and prizes totaling over $10,000, racing legends including Earl Cooper, Teddy Tetzlaff, Barney Oldfield, Eddie Rickenbacker, and Bob Burman flocked to Corona for a chance to make history. On September 9, 1913, the first ever Corona Road Race was held, hosting thousands of fans and drivers from throughout the world.  With stiff competition and an impressive lineup, the ``Free for All'' proved the most exciting race, with $5,000 up for grabs, and a chance at an additional $1,000 should the winner break the world record. Amidst cheering fans, Earl Cooper sped to victory and claimed the title as first winner of the Corona Road Race.  Due to the success of the 1913 Road Race, organizers quickly began planning for a second race to take place the following year. Bigger than ever, the Race returned on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1914. With new safety measures, an even bigger pot of $12,000, and a five foot fence, which gave the track its distinguishable look, the Corona Road Race took new form. News and wire services covered the day from start to finish, broadcasting to cities all over the United States, making the race an event for the whole family and nation. Once again hosting the best in international auto racing and loyal fans, the Corona Road Race was met with more success than ever. Crowds roared as Eddie Pullen took his last lap and finished first.  Due to a shift in race season, from fall to spring, the third annual Corona Road Race was delayed until 1916. On the day of the race, April 8, the city of Corona experienced record-breaking heat waves. While twelve cars entered the race, only five completed it. With numerous overheating vehicles and several tire blowouts, disaster was imminent. As racer Bob Burman rounded the 97th lap, his car plunged into onlooking spectators, killing him and two members of his crew. Though a beloved event rich with history, the tragic incident of the 1916 Corona Road Race, lack of financial success, and complaints from neighbors led to the end of the race and a tradition the city of Corona and the nation had grown to love.  Today, a monument indicating the start and finish line of the Road Race remains at the cross of Grand Boulevard and Washburn in Corona, a constant reminder of the glory days of the Corona Road Race. Though tragic events led to its demise, the Corona Road Race was an important element in launching Corona to national recognition, and furthering the sport of auto racing. I am honored to represent Corona and its rich history in the U.S. House of Representatives.                          ____________________
