President, let me say it is clear now this is not about moving judges forward because I have offered an opportunity for the Republican majority to move a circuit judge in Utah forward on a bipartisan basis, as most of President Bush's nominees have been moved forward. It is about the fact that President Bush has not had every single nominee he sent to Congress approved. More than 95 percent have been approved.
