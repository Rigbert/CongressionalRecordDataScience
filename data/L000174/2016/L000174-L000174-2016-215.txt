President, Senator McCain and I are introducing bipartisan, bicameral legislation to make reports published by the Congressional Research Service, CRS, available to the American public online. This legislation will open up an invaluable, taxpayer-funded resource for use by schools, universities, researchers, libraries, and individuals across the country.  The CRS was founded more than 100 years ago to provide comprehensive, non-partisan information on vital issues affecting national policy. In 2015, CRS issued over 1200 new reports and updated almost 2500 existing products, on matters ranging from the structure of government agencies, to summaries of legislative proposals, foreign policy primers, and everything in between. These reports are posted on an internal website for use by Members of Congress and their staff, but they are not distributed directly to the public. In an informal arrangement that is all too familiar in Washington, this unnecessary restriction has created a cottage industry of services that make copies of the reports available to lobbyists for a subscription fee. Schools and the general public cannot access them, nor do readers know whether the scattering of CRS reports they can find online through third-party websites are authentic, complete, or up-to-date. That's not very `public' and does nothing for the average citizen in Vermont or the rest of the country who does not have easy access to Washington.  Our bipartisan, bicameral legislation stops this unequal access by providing for CRS Reports to be published online in a comprehensive free, and searchable database on the website of the Government Publishing Office, GPO. This straightforward but important step has long been called for by libraries, educators, and public interest groups across the country. It is also supported by retired and former CRS employees, who note that ``CRS reports are widely available on Capitol Hill to staff and lobbyists alike, are released with no expectation of confidentiality, and could be of immense value to the general public.''  The century-old CRS was founded on the principles of nonpartisanship and respect for accurate, thoughtful information to inform the policy conversations of the day. It is a testament to the best ideals of Congress, and all Americans should benefit from the work and resources it provides. When I think of my grandchildren working on research reports for school, I want them to have access to this resource. I also want the American people to know what information their Members of Congress are receiving on leading policy issues of the day.  The legislation includes several important measures--responsive to concerns from CRS--to ensure that only appropriate materials are shared online. It makes clear that the GPO website will include only final, non-confidential CRS Reports and similar written, non-confidential CRS products that are intended for general Congressional distribution. It firmly excludes from publication any memoranda or other custom materials that CRS provides in response to a research request from an individual Member of Congress. The bill allows for identifying information for individual CRS researchers to be redacted so that CRS, not individual staffers, is the named author of a work. It also requires the inclusion of a written notification in all CRS Reports to explain that the materials were prepared by CRS for use by Congress, and should not be relied upon for purposes other than public understanding of information that has been provided by CRS to Members of Congress in connection with CRS's institutional role.  This is an exciting time for the Library of Congress and its divisions such as CRS. For the first time since 1987, the President has nominated, and I hope the Senate Rules Committee will soon consider, a new Librarian of Congress to lead one of the largest libraries in the world. As we move further into the digital age, now is an important moment to consider the promise of this great American institution and the resources it provides.  I thank Senator McCain for his long partnership with me on this effort, as well as Representatives Lance and Quigley who today are introducing bipartisan companion legislation in the House. I hope members will join us in supporting this straightforward, but important, step to make CRS reports available to the public so that all Americans may enjoy this invaluable resource equally.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 October 22, 2015.       Dear Chairman Blunt, Chairman Capito, Chairman Miller,      Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Schumer, Ranking Member      Schatz, Ranking Member Brady, Ranking Member Wasserman      Schultz, and Vice Chairman Harper: We are former employees of      the Congressional Research Service (CRS), with more than a      collective five hundred years with the agency. We write in      strong support of timely, comprehensive free public access to      CRS reports. In doing so, we distinguish between CRS reports,      which are non-confidential, and other CRS products, such as      memoranda, which are confidential.       CRS plays a vital role in our legislative process by      informing lawmakers and staff about important policy issues.      To that end, nothing should impair CRS's ability to provide      confidential support to members of Congress, such as through      briefings and confidential memoranda. Nor should Congress      take any steps to weaken the Constitutionally-protected      status of CRS's work product. In contrast, CRS reports are      widely available on Capitol Hill to staff and lobbyists      alike, are released with no expectation of confidentiality,      and could be of immense value to the general public.       Longstanding congressional policy allows Members and      committees to distribute CRS products to the public, which      they do in a variety of ways. In addition, CRS provides      reports upon request to the judicial branch, to journalists,      and to the executive branch, which often publishes them on      agency websites. Insiders with relationships to congressional      staff can easily obtain the reports, and well-resourced      groups pay for access from third-party subscription services.      Members of the public, however, can freely access only a      subset of CRS reports, usually via third parties.       It is difficult for the public to know the scope of CRS      products they could obtain from Congress. A Google search      returned over 27,000 products including 4,260 hosted on .gov      domains, but there is no way to know if those documents are      up to date, whether the search is comprehensive, or when the      documents might disappear from view.       We believe Congress should provide a central online source      for timely public access to CRS reports. That would place all      members of the public on an equal footing to one another with      respect to access. It would resolve concerns around public      and congressional use of the most up-to-date version.      Additionally, it would ensure the public can verify it is      using an authentic version. And it would diminish requests to      analysts to provide a copy of the most recent report. Other      legislative support agencies, i.e., the Congressional Budget      Office and the Government Accountability Office, publish non-     confidential reports on their websites as a matter of course.      Doing so does not appear to harm their ability to perform      their mission for Congress.       We thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts on      implementing full public access to non-confidential CRS      reports.

With best regards,         Henry Cohen, George Costello, Heather Durkin, Gregg            Esenwein, Louis Fisher, Peggy Garvin, Bernie Gelb,            Jeffrey C. Griffith, Pamela Hairston, Glennon J.            Harrison, Kevin Holland, Thomas Hungerford, W. Jackson,            Kevin Kosar, Jon Medalia, Elizabeth Palmer, Harold            Relyea, Morton Rosenberg, Daniel Schuman, Christine            Scott, Sherry Shapiro, Nye Stevens.                                  ____                                                November 12, 2015.       Dear Chairman Blunt, Chairman Miller, Ranking Member      Schumer, Ranking Member Brady, and Vice Chairman Harper: We      write in support of expanded public access to Congressional      Research Service (CRS) reports. Longstanding congressional      policy allows Members and committees to use their websites to      disseminate CRS products to the public, although CRS itself      may not engage in direct public dissemination. This results      in a disheartening inequity. Insiders with Capitol Hill      connections can easily obtain CRS reports from any of the      20,000 congressional staffers and well-resourced groups can      pay for access from subscription services. However, members      of the public can access only a small subset of CRS reports      that are posted on an assortment of not-for-profit websites      on an intermittent basis. Now is the time for a systematic      solution that provides timely, comprehensive free public      access to and preservation of non-confidential reports while      protecting confidential communications between CRS and      Members and committees of Congress.       CRS reports--not to be confused with confidential CRS      memoranda and other products--play a critical role in our      legislative process by informing lawmakers and staff about      the important issues of the day. The public should have the      same access to information. In 2014 CRS completed over 1,000      new reports and updated over 2,500 existing products. (CRS      also produced nearly 3,000 confidential memoranda.)       Our interest in free public access to non-confidential CRS      reports illustrates the esteem in which the agency is held.      CRS reports are regularly requested by members of the public      and are frequently cited by the courts and the media. For      example, over the last decade CRS reports were cited in 190      federal court opinions, including 64 at the appellate level.      Over the same time period, CRS reports were cited 67 times in      the Washington Post and 45 times the New York Times. CRS      reports often are published in the record of legislative      proceedings.       Taxpayers provide more than $100 million annually in      support of CRS, and yet members of the public often must look      to private companies for consistent access. Some citizens are      priced out of these services, resulting in inequitable access      to information about government activity that is produced at      public expense.       In fact, while CRS generates a list of all the reports it      has issued over the previous year, it silently redacts that      information from the public-facing version of its annual      report, making it difficult for the public to even know the      scope of CRS products they could obtain from Congress. A      Google search returned over 27,000 reports including 4,260      hosted on .gov domains, but there is no way to know if those      documents are up to date, what might be missing, or when they      might disappear from view.       Comprehensive free public access to non-confidential CRS      reports would place the reports in line with publications by      other legislative support agencies in the United States and      around the globe. The Government Accountability Office, the      Congressional Budget Office, the Law Library of Congress, and      85% of G-20 countries whose parliaments have subject matter      experts routinely make reports available to the public.       We hasten to emphasize that we are not calling for public      access to CRS products that should be kept confidential or      are distributed only to a small network on Capitol Hill.      Memoranda produced at the request of a Member or committee      and provided to an office in direct response to a request      should remain confidential unless the office itself chooses      to release the report. By comparison, we believe no such      protection should attach to reports typically published on      CRS' internal website or otherwise widely disseminated.       We value the work of CRS and in no way wish to impede its      ability to serve Congress. CRS reports already undergo      multiple levels of administrative review to ensure they are      accurate, non-partisan, balanced, and well-written. Authors      of every CRS product are aware of the likelihood that reports      will become publicly available.       We do not make a specific recommendation on who should      comprehensively publish non-confidential CRS reports online,      although the approaches outlined in H. Res. 34 (114th      Congress) and S. Res. 118 (111th Congress) are reasonable.      The Clerk of the House, the Secretary of the Senate, the      Government Publishing Office (GPO), the Library of Congress      and libraries in the Federal Depository Library Program      (FDLP) are all reasonable places for the public to gain      access to these documents. Even bulk publication on GPO's      website would be a major step forward.       We ask only that all non-confidential reports be published      as they are released, updated, or withdrawn; that they be      published in their full, final form; that they are freely      downloadable individually and in bulk; and that they be      accompanied by an index or metadata that includes the report      ID, the date issued/updated, the report name, a hyperlink to      the report, the division that produced the report, and      possibly the report author(s) as well.       In the attached appendix we briefly address concerns often      raised by CRS regarding public access to reports. In doing      so, we note that many committees, including the Senate Rules      Committee, have published CRS reports on their websites.      Also, that many CRS reports are available through third      parties. We urge you to give great weight to the significant      public benefit that would result from comprehensive, timely      access.       We welcome the opportunity to further discuss implementing      systematic public access to non-confidential CRS reports.

Dear Chairman Miller, Chairman Blunt, and Vice Chairman      Harper: As a coalition of 12 conservative, free market      organizations we urge you to expand public access to      Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports.       Each year CRS receives $100 million in taxpayer funding to      produce and update thousands of nonpartisan reports      describing government agencies, explaining public policy, and      tallying government spending. They are an invaluable resource      to Congress in its efforts to oversee our massive federal      government and hold it accountable.       Members of Congress and their staff have easy access to CRS      reports. So too do lobbyists and other Beltway insiders, who      often pay for the reports through expensive subscription      services. But taxpayers cannot easily get copies of CRS      reports.       This policy is unfair and outdated. It also stands in stark      contrast to other legislative branch agencies: both the      Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability      Office release their reports to the public.       Making CRS reports easily accessible by the public will      increase transparency in government, and allow everyday      citizens access to important information that will better      educate them on the issues before Congress. The bottom line      is taxpayers pay for these reports. It is only fair that they      have easy access to them.
