Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I would like to thank the chairman for his comments, not only about my work, but on behalf of the minority staff regarding the role that they have played in this.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 84, and I urge my Democratic colleagues to support it, as the chairman of the committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), has urged his colleagues to support it. The process through which this resolution was developed, and the concern demonstrated by the majority leadership to meeting the minority's legitimate needs, was in my opinion, a very positive process.  House Resolution 84 goes a long way, Mr. Speaker, toward achieving the minority's longtime goal of controlling one-third of each committee's total resources and staff slots. While it does not reach this goal in every single case, the ranking minority members of the 19 committees covered by the provisions of this resolution agree that substantial progress has been made over the levels of the 106th Congress. They have expressed to me their confidence that additional accommodations will occur over the course of the 107th Congress to deal with any remaining issues. Even the handful of committees that had been most visibly deficient in the past, in meeting the minority's legitimate needs, have come a long way, and most have met their target.  In the past, we have had representations which have appeared to hit the targets, but which have not. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and the Speaker have been diligent in trying to make sure that those devices are no longer used, and I thank them both for their leadership.  Mr. Speaker, we have approximately a $1.8 trillion budget that the elected representatives of this House, and the elected representatives of the other body, are charged with overseeing. We are given the responsibility to ensure that the funds are spent as they are intended to be spent, and are spent effectively on behalf of the American people, whose funds they are. That is a weighty responsibility. The budget for this body to carry out that task represents approximately one ten-thousandth of the dollars spent for the activities which we have the responsibility of overseeing. So it is a relatively small amount.  Mr. Speaker, I think that the amount authorized by this resolution, which is substantially less than the amount requested by the committees, is nevertheless an amount that will responsibly enable our committees, both the majority and the minority, to effectively carry out their responsibilities to the American people.                              {time}  1615  It is not easy to oversee budgets in the billions of dollars. It requires staff who are talented, diligent, and conscientious. To hire and retain such staff requires sufficient sums to compete in the marketplace. This budget allows the committees to do that, so I am very pleased to support this budget.  I also want to say that the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) has done yeoman's service on behalf of this institution--not just his party, and not just the minority--but on behalf of the whole institution, in creating an atmosphere in which we can come together, look at a problem, discuss it rationally, reasonably, and fairly, and come to a conclusion that I think all of us can support.  I think the leadership of the gentleman from Ohio (Chairman Ney) will redound, both now and in the future, to the benefit of this institution, and I thank him for his consideration and his courage in confronting some who perhaps did not want to move quite as far toward the target that had been set.  I also want to thank the Speaker, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert). He made it very clear that he was committed to the target of one-third of the slots and one-third of the resources for the minority. The gentleman fromOhio (Chairman Ney) and the Speaker, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert), through their fairness and leadership helped accomplish this objective, and have set a powerful example.  Seven years ago, Mr. Speaker, when the majority was in the minority, a former Member of this body, Pat Roberts, now a member of the other body, promised, and I quote, ``If lightning strikes and the sun comes up in the West and Republicans take over Congress, we are going to do that for you. You will at least get one-third.''  Mr. Speaker, with the adoption of House Resolution 84, it would seem that something very unusual indeed has occurred in this body: Lightning has struck, and the sun has come up in the West.  It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that this body continues to experience such wonders of nature.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
