President, I have long believed that Congress must work to enact policies that promote the deployment of broadband in rural America. There is no doubt that rural areas lag behind the rest of the country when it comes to access to affordable, quality, high-speed Internet. As the Internet rapidly evolves beyond what the slow speeds offered by dial up service can handle, broadband service is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. Today, I voted against an amendment that, while well intentioned, may have the unintended consequence of making it harder for the Rural Utilities Service to incentivize broadband expansion and competition in rural areas like Vermont.  I support the provisions in the underlying farm bill that seek to provide additional forms of assistance to broadband projects in rural areas, and I had hoped that the Senate would not significantly alter these provisions. It is important to ensure that the Rural Utilities Service has the flexibility it needs to provide assistance to rural areas--both those that have no service at all and those that have inadequate service.  Senator Warner's amendment does contain elements that I support, including provisions that will help to improve transparency and accountability within the Rural Utilities Service Program. Unfortunately, it may go too far in refocusing the scope of the program at the expense of rural communities in Vermont.  I look forward to continuing my work in the Senate to expand broadband service and competition in rural America.
