Mr. Speaker, only in Washington can someone charge $14.3 trillion in debt, ask for a higher credit limit, and not propose a single solution about how to control their seemingly unrestrained spending. That is just what the current Administration has asked Congress to do and it is something which I joined 317 of my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, in saying ``no!''  As every Alaskan family knows, there is no magic wand that will just waive debt away. Rather, debt must be managed, luxuries must be given up, and budgets must be made and adhered to. H.R. 2560, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act of 2011 employs what should be a common-sense approach to controlling and paying down our bloated debt. By cutting today's spending and capping and indexing tomorrow's spending to our growth, we can begin to pay down the $46,000 that each and every American owes.   To ensure that future generations do not make the same spending mistakes, H.R. 2560 will also encourage Congress to propose a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. With this amendment we can begin to restrain growth of Washington bureaucrats whose sole job is to prevent resource development and make everyone's life more complicated and more difficult. By forcing future Congress to spend only what they take in revenue, we can finally create a government which lives within its means.  In the 112th Congress, I am a proud and original cosponsor of a balanced budget amendment and in previous Congresses I have voted for a balanced budget amendment five separate times. Since my first vote in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment in 1982, I have supported the idea that Congress, like every American family, must make and stick to a budget. Alaskan families seem to understand this concept, it is time that Washington learned from their example.
