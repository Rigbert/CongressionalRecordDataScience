 President, as we all know, the President will be making an announcement this morning on the Supreme Court. I will have more to say about that later this morning.  As for the legislation currently before the Senate, the Senate will resume its consideration of bipartisan legislation aimed at protecting middle-class families from unfair higher food prices. It is a commonsense solution founded on science-based standards. Let's advance it together. If colleagues have other ideas on the issue, I would again encourage them to work with the bill managers to process any alternative solutions they may have.                          ____________________
