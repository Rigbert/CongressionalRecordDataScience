Mariia Butina, Cr. No. 18-218, currently pending in the      United States District Court for the District of Columbia,      have requested copies of a transcript of an interview of the      defendant conducted by the Select Committee on Intelligence;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      can, by administrative or judicial process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;       Whereas, when it appears that documents, papers, and      records under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will      take such action as will promote the ends of justice      consistent with the privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate      Select Committee on Intelligence, acting jointly, are      authorized to provide to the parties in United States v.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution on documentary production by the Select Committee on Intelligence, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence has received requests from the Department of Justice and from the defendant in a pending criminal case for copies of a transcript of an interview that the Committee staff conducted of the defendant in April 2018 for use in preparation for trial.  This resolution would authorize the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, acting jointly, to provide copies of the interview transcript, under appropriate security procedures, to both parties in response to this request.                          ____________________
