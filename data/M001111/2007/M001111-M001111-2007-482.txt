 Senator Thomas was a strong advocate for his State and its interests. He fought hard for his priorities, and I especially admired his tireless advocacy for our Nation's beautiful parks and wilderness. He also worked hard for the priorities of rural Wyoming and indeed all of rural America, fighting hard to improve health care infrastructure.  Senator Thomas dedicated his life to serving his country and his State. After graduating from the University of Wyoming, he joined the Marines and began his long career of service. Even when faced with his final battle with cancer, he continued to fight on for Wyoming and serve with distinction.  But the Senate lost not only an outstanding advocate but a wonderful person. More than anything, I will remember Senator Thomas as a man who carried himself with dignity and who treated all of his colleagues with respect, despite party differences. More than any debate, committee hearing or piece of legislation, it is his warm smile that I will remember most. I know he did a fantastic job representing the State of Wyoming, and I am honored to have known and worked with him.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time.
