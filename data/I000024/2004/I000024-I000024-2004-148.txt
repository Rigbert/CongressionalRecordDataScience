We have had witnesses who have documented that we have two primary causes. One is all of these unreasonable environmental regulations these refiners are exposed to, and it directly relates to the cost of energy in this case. And the other is the Energy bill.  I say to the Senator, as you point out, we had a good energy bill. The House has a good energy bill. In that energy bill we had the ability to drill for oil in places where we cannot right now that would open up ANWR. If you look at the production in States, such as my State of Oklahoma and your State of New Mexico, the marginal wells--those are wells that produce 15 barrels a day or less--the statistic has never been refuted that if we had all of the marginal wells that have been plugged in the last 10 years flowing today, that would equal more than we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia.  So we have a solution to the problem. With all those people crying about the high prices, those are the major reasons we have high prices. I say to the Senator, you are right, we are going to have to have an energy bill to correct this situation. Do you agree?
