 D'AMATO. However, we are linking the two together. By suggesting that in order to get this straightforward bill, this legislation that says no more drive-by mastectomies and that women will be guaranteed the right to have reconstructive surgery where there is a radical mastectomy, it is linking the two together. I think that is unfortunate. I might be willing to come and join my colleagues and battle for a date certain or to fight for hearings at least. I don't know whether we have had hearings. I don't think we have. I see Senator Kennedy here.  But the point of the matter is that we are linking the two. We are saying we are not going to consider whether women should have that right. Where I don't believe there is one Senator here who feels they should not have, not one, why should we link the two, with one bill 109 pages, which 90 percent of the Members have not read, have not studied, have not gone through. Again, it is linkage, and therefore I am compelled to say that notwithstanding the good intents of my friend, it is linkage.
