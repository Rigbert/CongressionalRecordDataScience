 President, from the very beginning of this discussion on the trafficking bill and the underlying issue, Members on both sides of the aisle agreed that we need to get this bill back on track as the bipartisan effort it should be, because, without question, survivors of trafficking deserve our support.  Senator Klobuchar has done an amazing job in getting us to this point to get this bill done. I am pleased that we were able to reach a deal that now gets this done in a way that does not expand restrictions on women's health to nontaxpayer dollars or to new programs and provides survivors with real, dedicated funds for the support and services they need.  No compromise is perfect. I am sure that Senator Cornyn would say the same thing. I believe there is more we can and must do when it comes to strengthening women's access to quality health care. But I am very pleased that Senator Cornyn and I, along with a number of other Senators on our side, including Senator Klobuchar, were able to work together in a bipartisan way to get this done.  I want to thank him and all his colleagues for their work to get us to this point. I hope we can now get this legislation passed very quickly for survivors and move on to continue working together on the many challenges our country faces.  I yield the floor.
