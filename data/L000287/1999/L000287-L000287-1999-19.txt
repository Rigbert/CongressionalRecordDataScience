Mr. Speaker, the Republican tax deal is a step in the wrong direction. We must use this historic opportunity to save Social Security and Medicare and to pay down on our national debt. We should not be wasting it on huge tax breaks for America's wealthiest people.  The Republican tax bill does nothing to save Social Security, nothing to strengthen Medicare, nothing to reduce our national debt. A huge windfall for the rich, pocket change; pocket change for working Americans.                              {time}  1015  Yes, it is pocket change for working families. It is a mistake. It is irresponsible. It is not the right thing to do. It is not the right direction to go.                          ____________________
