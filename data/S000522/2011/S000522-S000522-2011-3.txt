Madam Speaker, abortion not only dismembers and chemically poisons unborn children to death, and my friend from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) used to know that. He used to be very pro-life, as some other Members who have reversed themselves.  But it also hurts women's health and puts future children subsequently born to women who aborted at significant risk. At least 102 studies show significant psychological harm, major depression, and elevated suicide risk in women who abort.  Published just last month in the British Journal of Psychiatry, a meta-analysis comprised of 22 studies and over 887,000 participants, the largest quantitative estimate of mental health risk associated with abortion in world literature ever, revealed that women who have undergone an abortion experience an 81 percent increased risk of mental health problems. You never hear that from the abortion side.  The Times of London has also found the clear link that women had twice the level of psychological problems and three times the level of depression, and subsequent risk to children born to women who have had a previous abortion.  This is all about no taxpayer funding for abortion.  Nothing less than a comprehensive prohibition on public funding, promotion and facilitation of elective abortion in any federal health program, satisfies the demands of social justice.  The Protect Life Act, authored by Chairman Joe Pitts and Dan Lipinski, ensures that all the elements of the Hyde amendment applies to all the programs that are both authorized and appropriated in Obamacare.  By now, I trust that all members fully understand that because programs in Obamacare are both authorized and appropriated in the law, the actual Hyde Amendment has no legal affect whatsoever. Hyde only affects Labor HHS programs not this massive expansion of government funded health care.  Thus Obamacare when phased in fully in 2014 will open up the floodgates of public funding for abortion in a myriad of programs resulting in more dead babies and wounded moms than would otherwise have been the case.  Because abortion methods dismember, decapitate, crush, poison, starve to death and induce premature labor, pro-life Members of Congress, and according to every reputable poll, significant majorities of Americans want no complicity whatsoever in this evil. Obamacare forces us to be complicit.  Despite breathtaking advances in recent years in respecting and treating the unborn child as a patient--in need of diagnosis and treatment for any number of diseases or conditions, just like any other patient--far too many people dismiss the baby in the womb as persona non grata.  I respectfully but firmly asked how violence against children by abortion--dismemberment, chemical poisoning, lethal pills euphemistically marketed as medical abortion--can be construed as benign or compassionate or caring.  The dangerous myth of ``safe abortion'' must be exposed.  So-called ``safe abortion'' is the ultimate oxymoron, an Orwellian manipulation of language, designed to convey bogus respectability to a lethal act. Abortion is never safe for the child and is antithetical to UN Development Goal 4--which rallies the world to reduce child mortality. Abortion is, by any reasonable definition, child mortality. It sole purpose is to kill a baby.  Arrogant and presumptuous talk that brands any child as an ``unwanted child'' reduces that child to a mere object, bereft of inherent dignity or value.  Abortion, not only dismembers and chemically poisons unborn children to death, but hurts women's health and puts future children subsequently born to women who, aborted at significant risk. At least 102 studies show significant psychological harm, major depression and elevated suicide risk in women who abort.  Published last month in the British Journal of Psychiatry, a meta analysis, comprised of 22 studies and 887,181 participants, the largest quantitative estimate of mental health risks associated with abortion in world literature revealed ``women who had undergone an abortion experienced an 81% increased risk of mental health problems.''  Recently, the Times of London reported ``that women who have had abortions have twice the level of psychological problems and three times the level of depression as women who have given birth or who have never been pregnant . . .''  Similarly, the risk of subsequent children being born with low birth weight increases by 35 percent after one and 72 percent after two or more abortions. Another study shows the risk increases 9 times after a woman has had three abortions.  What does this mean for her children? Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the industrialized world after congenital anomalies. Preterm infants have a greater risk of suffering from chronic lung disease, sensory deficits, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairments and behavior problems. Low birth weight is similarly associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity.  Obamacare authorizes health care plans and policies funded with tax credits to pay for abortion, so long as the issuer of the federally subsided plan collects a new congressionally mandated fee from every enrollee in that plan to pay for other peoples abortions. Requiring the segregation of funds into allocation accounts--a mere bookkeeping exercise touted by some as an improvement to the new pro-abortion funding scheme--does absolutely nothing to protect any victims--baby or mother--from publically funded abortion.  Also billions for new Community Health Centers are outside the scope of the Hyde amendment as well.  Obamacare also contains a little known provision that creates a devastating loophole for conscience rights. Section 1303(d) allows any state or federal law involving emergency services to override any conscience protections added to PPACA. Contrary to the claims of H.R. 358 opponents, Section 1303(d) is NOT uniquely about the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA). The section references EMTALA but the operative language is much broader, giving authority to override conscience laws to any federal or state law that employs the term emergency services.  The ``Nondiscrimination on Abortion'' (new subsection 1303 (g)) portion of H.R. 358, the Protect Life Act applies to Obamacare the language of the Hyde/Weldon amendment, which has been in the annual Labor/HHS appropriations bills every year since 2004 without any effort to change or remove it. This subsection is needed because Obamacare creates many new funding streams that bypass the Labor/HHS appropriations act, and therefore bypass the protections of the Hyde/Weldon amendment in that act.  Also, Obamacare creates a huge new program administered by OPM that would manage two or more new multi-state or national health plans. The new law stipulates that at least one plan not pay for abortion. Which only begs to question: what about the other new multi-state plans administered by OPM? Why can those federally administered plans include funding abortion on demand? This represents a radical departure from current policy.  Additionally, other appropriated funds under Obamacare that have no Hyde-type protections include billions for a temporary high risk health insurance pools and billions in grants and loans for health care co-ops.  In testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee on February, 9, 2011, Douglas Johnson, Federal Legislative Director for the National Right to Life Committee said:       The first major component of the PPACA to be implemented,      the Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) program, a      100% federally funded program, provided a graphic      demonstration of the problem: The Department of Health and      Human Services approved plans from multiple states that would      have covered elective abortions. NRLC documented this and      blew the whistle in July, 2010, which produced a public      outcry, after which DHHS announced a discretionary decision      that the PCIP plans would not cover elective abortions.      Commentators on all sides of the issue were in agreement      about one thing: Coverage of elective abortions within this      new, 100% federally funded program was not impeded by any      provision of the PPACA, and was not even addressed in      Executive Order 13535.       On the same day that DHHS issued its decision to exclude      abortion from this program--July 29, 2010--the head of the      White House Office of Health Reform, Nancy-Ann DeParle,      issued a statement on the White House blog explaining that      the discretionary decision to exclude abortion from the PCIP      ``is not a precedent for other programs or policies [under      the PPACA] given the unique, temporary nature of the program      . . .'' Laura Murphy, director of the Washington Legislative      Office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said, ``The      White House has decided to voluntarily impose the ban for all      women in the newly-created high risk insurance pools. . . .      What is disappointing is that there is nothing in the law      that requires the Obama Administration to impose this broad      and highly restrictive abortion ban.'' (''ACLU steps into      healthcare reform fray over abortion,'' The Hill, July 17,      2010.)''  Then there's the Mikulski Amendment, Sec. 2713, which empowers the HHS Secretarywith broad new authority to force private health care plans in America to cover ``preventable'' services. When Senator Ben Nelson suggested that abortion not be included in the so-called preventative services mandate, Ms. Mikulski said no--raising a serious red flag that abortion is being postured as ``preventable abortion service in the future''--after all, abortion prevents a live birth, by exterminating the child.  Killing unborn children and calling it preventative health care isn't new.  And as far back as 1976, Dr. Willard Cates, Jr. and Dr. David Grimes then with CDC presented a paper to a Planned Parenthood meeting, entitled: Abortion as a Treatment for Unintended Pregnancy: The Number Two Sexually Transmitted ``Disease''. To designate pregnancy a sexually transmitted disease; and call abortion a treatment or a means of prevention for this ``disease'' is barbaric.  Abortion isn't health care--preventative or otherwise.  Madam Speaker, we live in an age of ultrasound imaging--the ultimate window to the womb and it's occupant. We are in the midst of a fetal health care revolution, an explosion of benign innovative interventions designed to diagnose, treat and cure disease or illness any unborn child may be suffering.  Unborn children are society's youngest and most vulnerable patients. Obamacare should do them no harm. Tragically, it does the worst harm of all. It kills them.                              {time}  1830
