President, earlier today, I spoke of a worldwide scourge of landmines and the use of antipersonnel landmines. I noted that there have been few times in history when the nations of the world joined together to outlaw the use of a weapon of war.  It was done with chemical and biological weapons, because it was understood that once they were unleashed, they could not be controlled. They maim or kill whoever comes in contact with them, and they do that whether it is civilians or combatants. In fact, if they are in the hands of terrorists, they could wreak havoc on whole societies. We had a terrifying glimpse of that in Japan a few months ago.  Now, while chemical weapons are relatively easy to produce, the political cost of using them is enormous. There is worldwide revulsion if they are used, and any perpetrator is branded a war criminal, a pariah, and ostracized by the entire world community. And so we ban them.  We did the same with dum dum bullets, which expand on contact with the human body and cause horrific injuries. They have been outlawed for a century.  I mention this because every weapon may have some military utility, as do chemical weapons and dum dum bullets. Some have been repudiated as inhumane and a violation of the laws of war.  That is what Civil War General Sherman that about landmines over a century ago. Sherman was no humanitarian, but he condemned landmines as ``a violation of civilized warfare.'' It was in the Civil War that landmines--actually live artillery shells, were first concealed beneath the surface of roads, in houses, even concealed in flour barrels, where they maimed and killed soldiers and civilians alike. But even though Sherman and others condemned them, they have been used ever since in steadily increasing numbers.  Today, vast areas of many countries have become deathtraps from millions of unexploded landmines. The State Department estimates that there are 80 to 110 million of these tiny explosives in 62 countries, each one waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep.  To give you an idea, Mr. President, this is a landmine in my hand. I am sure my colleagues know it is a deactivated landmine, but this is a landmine. It is tiny and costs $3 or $4 to produce. It is all rubber or plastic except for one tiny piece of metal about the size of a thumbtack. So it is nearly undetectable. If this had been real, in just touching it like this, my arm would be gone and most of my face would be gone. If you step on it, your leg is gone. If you are a child, you are probably killed. Children are killed daily on these. In fact, every day, it is estimated that 70 people are maimed or killed by landmines. That is one person every 22 minutes. That is 26,000 people every year. Most of them are not combatants. They are civilians going about their daily lives--bringing their animals to a field, collecting wood, or they are getting water, or going to market, or they are going to business. They are like Ken Rutherford, a humanitarian worker from Colorado, working with others in Africa.  He hit a landmine. As he described it in his very painful and very graphic testimony before the Senate, he sat there holding his foot in his hand, trying to figure out how he could put it back on. Of course, he never did. And there was surgery after surgery. We watched him walk painfully to the table where he testified before the Senate.  These pictures, Mr. President, behind me, tell a gruesome story. But, in a way, these are the lucky ones--lucky because they survived, but unlucky that they are in a country where they will face a lifetime of hardship.  There are tens of thousands of people like them. Many others die, just from a lack of blood or from shock, before they can reach a hospital. In many of these countries the hospitals are overwhelmed.  I do not have the slightest doubt, Mr. President, that any Member of the Senate, Republican or Democrat, could not see what I have seen without feeling as passionately as I do. Young children with their legs blown off at the knees, mothers with an arm or leg missing, hospital rows filled with rows of amputees. I have visited these hospitals.  My wife, a registered nurse, has visited these hospitals. We know what they are like. Tim Rieser, from my staff, has traveled to all parts of the world to see what landmines have done.  Senators Johnston and Specter, Senators Simpson and Nickles saw firsthand what mines can do when they visited a center for amputees in Vietnam. Most people have not been to Vietnam, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Bosnia, Angola, or Mozambique where mines have been a fact of daily life and, in most places, still are. There you see, over and over, the terrible human tragedy these insidious weapons cause.  Civilians are not the only victims of landmines. They have become the scourge of the U.N. peacekeepers. An article in this week's issue of Defense Week is titled, ``If U.S. Troops Get the Call in Bosnia, Mines Will Pose Serious Threat.'' It says American troops sent to former Yugoslavia would have to combat an estimated 1.7 million mines in Bosnia alone. It says that mines have been used by all sides in that war to intimidate U.N. peacekeepers.  We are called in there as the most powerful nation history has ever known. But we will be facing $3 and $4 and $5 and $8 landmines and be brought to the level of just about any other country, powerful or otherwise.  Landmines have become a cheap, popular weapon in Third World countries, the same countries where American troops are likely to be sent in the future. The $2 or $3 antipersonnel mine hidden under a layer of sand or dust can blow the leg off the best-trained, best-equipped American soldier, even though he or she represents the most powerful nation on earth.  Two years ago, almost no one was paying attention to this global crisis. Then the U.S. Senate passed my amendment for a moratorium on the export of antipersonnel landmines. Republicans and Democrats together joined to pass that.  The amendment had one goal: To challenge other countries to join with us to stop the spread of these hidden killers. As I spoke to the leaders of the other countries, I could tell them this was something--and probably the only thing during that same Congress--that united Senators as nothing else had, no matter what their party or political philosophy.  With the public pressure that grew out of that and the efforts of people around this world, 26 countries have now halted all or most of their exports of antipersonnel landmines in just 2 years, starting with what we were able to do here. Mr. President, 26 countries have halted all or most of their exports of antipersonnel landmines.  If, in my 21 years, I had to point to what I was most proud of, I could not think of anything I could be more proud of or have more pride in than knowing men and women both in this body and in parliamentary bodies around the world who have joined with the Senate.  Last September, in a historic speech to the U.N. General Assembly, President Clinton announced the goal of eventually eliminating antipersonnel landmines. On December 15, the 184 members of the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution calling for further steps toward the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines.  This is the first time since the banning of chemical weapons that the nations of the world have singled out a type of weapon for total elimination. It reflects a growing worldwide consensus that these weapons are unacceptable because they are indiscriminate.  They are so cheap, so easy to mass produce, so easy to conceal and transport and scatter by the thousands. They cannot be controlled. They are used routinely to terrorize civilian populations.  In March of this year, Belgium passed a law prohibiting production, export, and use of antipersonnel mines. Belgium had been a major producer. Now they have outlawed them. Norway did the same just last week. Half a dozen other countries have declared support for a global ban on these weapons.  U.N. Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali, Pope John Paul II, former President Jimmy Carter, American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, these are but a few of the world leaders who have called for an end to the use of antipersonnel mines.  But despite this progress, the use of landmines continues unabated. Millions of new mines are being produced each year, and today the Russians are dropping them by the thousands, out of airplanes, over Chechnya.  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that builds on the steps we have taken. It would impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel mines, to take effect 3 years from the date of enactment.  It would permit the use of these mines along international borders, for example between North and South Korea, in minefields that are monitored to keep out civilians. It also permits the use of Claymore mines, which are used to guard a perimeter, and antitank mines.  The purpose of the legislation is simple: Like the landmine export moratorium and the nuclear testing moratorium, it aims, by setting an example, to challenge other countries to join to bring an end to the mass destruction in slow motion caused by landmines.  As a step toward that goal, it would temporarily halt the scattering of antipersonnel mines that cause such a massive number of civilian casualties. One person who has worked on this in Cambodia said, sitting in my office in Burlington, VT, ``Yes, we clear landmines in Cambodia. We clear them an arm and a leg at a time.''  In addition, my legislation would provide for sanctions against countries that continue to export antipersonnel mines.  Mr. President, this is a global crisis. Even with all of our power, the United States cannot solve it alone. But neither will it be solved without strong U.S. leadership.  That is what the legislation does. It sets an example. It says, ``For 1 year, we will take time out.'' We will challenge other countries to live up to what they said at the United Nations last December when they agreed to work to rid the world of these weapons.  Every ambassador from other countries I have talked to, every leader, every foreign minister, has told me in words the same thing: If the United States, the most powerful nation history has ever known, if the United States cannot set the moral leadership, this will not be done. But if the United States sets the example, then it can be done.  Our people will be safer. The people in 180 other countries ultimately will be safer, certainly the people of the 60 or more countries that are littered with mines can now begin to get rid of them. With 500 new landmine casualties each week, resolutions are not enough. We have to jolt the world out of complacency. Only the United States can do that.  I have two minds about this legislation. I believe it could be the spark that leads to international cooperation to stop this senseless slaughter, because what we do is being watched around the globe, and there is great support.  It will take a determined effort over the next few years, but if our leadership gets other governments to join, and I believe it will, Americans who are sent into harm's way in the future will have far more to gain from what we do here. Whether we send our men and women in uniform, whether we send our people on humanitarian missions, whatever else, to the other parts of the world, they will be safer because of what we can do here.  At the same time, it is only a 1-year moratorium and does not take effect for 3 years. Between now and then, 82,000 people will die or be horribly maimed by landmines.  Frankly, Mr. President, this legislation is the least we can do as the world's only superpower with by far the most powerful military. It is the least we can do to stigmatize these weapons, because they are indiscriminate and inhumane, whether they are the simple $2 or $3 type or the more complex self-destructive type.  What is our alternative? To accept that large areas of the world will be forever littered with hidden deadly explosives? I cannot accept that. Or that every 22 minutes of every day of every year someone, often a child, usually a civilian, will lose a leg or an arm, or life, as the result of a landmine? I and the 40 other Senators of both parties sponsoring this legislation cannot accept that. It is a global catastrophe. Landmines are causing more unnecessary suffering than any other weapon of war, and people everywhere are calling for the end of this.  Today, if armies leave the field they take their weapons with them. They take away their guns, their tanks, and their cannons. But they leave behind landmines that continue to kill long after anybody even remembers what the armies were fighting about. Long after their leaders, their generals, their politicians are dead and gone, the landmines stay there. It is the weapon that keeps on killing.  There are some weapons that are so inhumane they do not belong on this Earth. Antipersonnel landmines are in that category. This is not a weapon we need for our national security. It is a terrorist weapon used most often against the defenseless, like these children here who are no threat to anybody. They are the victims. It is, above all, a moral issue.  I want to close with a quote from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, because he has spoken eloquently about the 20 million landmines in Africa that have already destroyed so many innocent lives. Archbishop Tutu said:       Anti-personnel landmines are not just a crime perpetrated      against people, they are a sin. Why has the world been so      silent about these obscenities? It is because most of the      victims of landmines are neither heard nor seen.  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today shows that we do hear, that we do see, and we are going to stop this.                                 ______      By
