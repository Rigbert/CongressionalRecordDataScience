President, I rise today to discuss medical research aimed at preserving blood products, human organs, and other wound-repairing tissues. As the chairman may recall, last year I discussed with Chairman Levin the fact that this research could dramatically impact our abilityto overcome current medical challenges involved in blood and tissue preservation.  Recent U.S. military actions have resulted in stationing troops in harsh climates and conditions, such as those experience in Afghanistan. Current locations and missions require new capabilities in combat casualty care, and these capabilities would include stable blood products, organs, and wound repairing tissues that will enhance human survivability under conditions of trauma, shock, anoxia, and other extreme conditions, including extreme environment. The Department of Defense needs to develop tissues with a long shelf life to support combat casualty care. Research in this area could develop stress-tolerant biosystems or tissues that selectively control critical metabolic processes by exploiting an enhanced understanding of differential gene expression in bio-organisms and systems exposed to extreme environments.
