 President, it is no secret that Congress isn't winning any popularity contest these days. Americans are fed up with lawmakers who are either focused on the wrong thing or determined to block any serious reforms that would actually get at the root of the problems we face. That is why Republicans have been focused not only on legislation which we think has a good chance of jump-starting private sector job creation in this country but which also has a good shot at actually becoming law. Put another way, since taking back the majority this year, Republicans in the House of Representatives have focused not only on legislation which avoids the economic missteps of the previous 2\1/2\ years of Democratic control but legislation which also has a good shot of making it through a Democratic-led Senate.  You would never know it from listening to the President, but there has actually been a significant amount of bipartisan work that has been going on on Capitol Hill these days. House Republicans have passed bill after bill--many of them with solid bipartisan support--that would help spur private sector job creation and would help get this economy moving again, but the Democrats who have run the Senate for the past 5 years have ignored virtually all of it. Senate Democrats have decided it isn't in the interest of their party for Congress to get anything done right now.
