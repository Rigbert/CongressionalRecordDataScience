 President, I rise today to introduce the Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act with my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Durbin, Tillis, and Ernst.  Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a nonpsychoactive component of marijuana. In many instances parents, after exhausting other treatment options, have turned to CBD to as a last resort to treat their children who have intractable epilepsy. Anecdotally, CBD has produced positive results.  However, due to existing barriers and the fact that marijuana is a schedule I drug, rigorous research that is needed to better understand the long-termsafety and efficacy of CBD as a medicine, as well as the correct dosing and potential interaction with other medications, is lacking.  The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act seeks to both reduce these barriers and spur additional research to ensure that CBD and other marijuana-derived medications are based on the most up to date scientific evidence. It also provides a pathway for the manufacture and distribution of FDA-approved drugs that are based on this research.  It does this while maintaining safeguards to protect against illegal diversion.  First, the bill directs the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to complete a scientific and medical evaluation of CBD within 1 year. Based on this evaluation, the legislation directs the Department of Justice to make a scheduling recommendation for CBD that is independent of marijuana. This may include transferring the schedule of CBD to another schedule, or removing it from the list of controlled substances altogether. A scheduling recommendation for CBD that is independent of marijuana has never been done before.  Second, without sacrificing appropriate oversight, it streamlines the regulatory process for marijuana research. In particular, it improves regulations dealing with changes to approved quantities of marijuana needed for research and approved research protocols. It also expedites the Drug Enforcement Administration registration process for researching CBD and marijuana.  Third, this legislation seeks to increase medical research on CBD, while simultaneously reducing the stigma associated with conducting research on a schedule I drug. It does so by explicitly authorizing medical and osteopathic schools, research universities, practitioners and pharmaceutical companies to use a schedule II Drug Enforcement Administration registration to conduct authorized medical research on CBD.  Fourth, the bill allows medical schools, research institutions, practitioners, and pharmaceutical companies to produce the marijuana they need for authorized medical research. This will ensure that researchers have access to the material they need to develop proven, effective medicines. Once the FDA approves these medications, the bill allows pharmaceutical companies to manufacture and distribute them.  Fifth, the bill allows parents who have children with intractable epilepsy, as well as adults with intractable epilepsy, to possess and transport CBD or other nonpsychoactive components of marijuana used to treat this disease while research is ongoing. To do so, parents and adults must provide documentation that they or their child have been treated by a board-certified neurologist for at least 6 months. They must also have documentation that the neurologist has attested that other treatment options have been exhausted and that the potential benefits outweigh the harms of using these nonpsychoactive components of marijuana. The neurologist must also agree to monitor the patient for potential adverse reactions.  Finally, because existing Federal research is severely lacking, the bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to expand, intensify, and coordinate research to determine the potential medical benefits of CBD or other marijuana-derived medications on serious medical conditions.  The 2016 National Academy of Sciences report, titled ``The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research'' underscored the need to reduce research barriers, increase the supply of CBD and marijuana for research purposes, and address existing research gaps.  The Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act seeks to do just this.  This bill is critical to helping families across the country as they seek safe, effective medicines for serious illnesses. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
