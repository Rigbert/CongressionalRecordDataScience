Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major James ``Chocks'' Ewald of the Michigan Air National Guard for the valiant decisions he made when his aircraft was struck by a surface-to-air missile while flying over Baghdad. On April 8, 2003 Major Ewald was leaving the Baghdad area after collecting vital intelligence about Iraqi ambush positions when he was suddenly struck by a surface-to-air missile that left his aircraft only marginally flyable. Major Ewald flew a wounded-bird for 12 minutes, while also completing several battle damage checklists, identifying critical aircraft system operations, making tentative plans for aircraft recovery, gathering important information about threats affecting future Close Air Support operations, and hastily preparing for an injury-free ejection. The quick-thinking Major then evaded potential capture and was soon rescued by fellow U.S. Army forces.  While serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom he flew over 30 combat sorties. Major James Ewald entered active duty with the Air Force in January 1989 and served active duty until July 1998 when he joined the Michigan Air National Guard. During his active duty career, he flew in support of contingency operations over Bosnia, Operation Deny Flight, in support of United Nations Forces in the Republic of Korea, and over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch.  Major Ewald and so many like him have unselfishly pledged to protect the United States. No matter the time, place, or circumstance, the men and women of the United States Armed Forces have always answered the call to duty. ``Chocks'' represents the best of theUnited States Armed Forces. My fellow Members of Congress, please join me in recognizing Major Ewald and all of the Armed Service members for their continued service to the American people!                          ____________________
