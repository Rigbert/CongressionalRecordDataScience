 I do not think there is a parent in America whose heart does not stop when they see another television show about another shooting and they worry about their own child.  The fact is, when kids are in smaller class sizes in the first, second, and third grades, their tendency toward discipline problems is reduced dramatically. It does make a difference.  More important is what a policeman told me not long ago. He said: I watch these families today, and a lot of kids are home alone essentially in the evening. The parents may even be there, but they are essentially home alone. They walk to school in the morning in a neighborhood where the blinds are closed and the doors are closed and not one adult looks out to see if they are OK. They walk to school without anyone paying attention. They get to school, where it is overcrowded, where the only adult in that classroom never has time to look them in the eye or see that they are OK.  This policeman said to me: These kids feel anonymous in today's world. It is no surprise they act out violently in order for someone to notice them.
