 President, later today Members of Congress will join President Obama and the Lincoln Bicentennial Commission to honor the bicentennial of President Lincoln's birth. My good friend Senator Bunning has my gratitude for his work on the Commission.  The people of my State are rightly proud of the fact that Abraham Lincoln was born 3 miles south of Hodgenville, KY. And there are events across our State and others honoring this great man. And the ceremony later today will be an opportunity for us all to remember his life and service.                          ____________________
