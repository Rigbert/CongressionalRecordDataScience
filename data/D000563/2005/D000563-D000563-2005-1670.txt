 The theme of the conference is ``St. Madeleine Sophie's vision of service--living our legacy,'' and a panel discussion will be hosted by Barat College. St. Madeleine Sophie Barat was the foundress of the Society of the Sacred Heart, and she still is a true inspiration to all who seek to follow the call of service.  The late Senator Paul Simon was my mentor when I began my political career in downstate Illinois. His wife, Jean Hurley Simon, graduated from Barat College in 1944. Since I first met Jean, I have had a special admiration for those educated in the Sacred Heart tradition.  The Associated Alumnae and Alumni of the Sacred Heart includes over 51,000 women and men educated in the Sacred Heart schools. Recently, Sacred Heart alumni have led efforts to provide relief for people in Indonesia effected by the devastating tsunami. Funds raised by Sacred Heart alumni have allowed for much-needed health and education programs in the region, including interfaith projects to house and lead activities for orphaned children.  Like Senator Simon before me, I have strongly supported higher education initiatives and access to professional development training for our elementary and secondary teachers. After all, teachers have the ability to influence, impact, and shape the citizens of tomorrow.  I know that my fellow Senators will join me in commending the SacredHeart alumni for their legacy of service. I am confident that this proud history and tradition will continue in the spirit of St. Madeleine Sophie for years to come.                          ____________________[Pages S3645-S3646]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]       NATIONAL ASSOCIATED ALUMNAE AND ALUMNI OF THE SACRED HEART
