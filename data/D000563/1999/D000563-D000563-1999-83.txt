President.  Let me join a chorus thanking Senator Byrd and Senator Daschle for their leadership. Illinois has a history of being a great coal-producing State. Environmental standards have changed, and I hope we can find ways to develop technology so that this almost infinite energy resource can be tapped that now sits in the ground. Many unemployed coal miners drive over it every day asking policy leaders in Washington what they are doing. The legislation Senator Byrd is proposing is a step in the direction of finding new technology to use this domestic energy resource to create jobs inAmerica, to be responsible to the environment, and to lessen our dependence on foreign fuel.  As always, I salute Senator Byrd for his leadership on this.
