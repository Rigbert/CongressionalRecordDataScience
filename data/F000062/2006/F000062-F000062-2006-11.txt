 President, I appreciate the Senator's commitment and hard work on this issue. With the assurances from Ambassador Schwab and Assistant Secretary Spooner, I will support legislation granting permanent normal trade relations status to Vietnam. Would the Senator from Oregon agree that we will continue to follow this process closely to ensure that USTR and Commerce live up to their commitments and implement this program in a manner that is fully consistent with U.S. law and our WTO obligations?
