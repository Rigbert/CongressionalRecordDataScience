Speaker: It is with great pleasure that I commend the alumni of Froebel High School on the celebration of the 12th anniversary of their first reunion family picnic. This picnic was held on Saturday, August 10, 1996, on the grounds of what used to be Froebel High School in Gary, IN.  An originator of the event and current chairman of the Froebel class of 1962, the honorable Vernon Smith, State representative for Indiana's fourteenth district, stated that this picnic was originated in 1984 to maintain the inner city spirit and rivalry between the alumni of the Froebel Blue Devils and the Gary Roosevelt Panthers. Initially, the graduating classes of 1962 from both high schools combined efforts to create a nostalgia reunion. Thisbegan with a basketball game between the two alumni groups and was followed by a dance. Recently, however, the Roosevelt class of 1972 has taken over responsibility from its class of 1962 and the two schools have separated a few of their events. The current chairman of Roosevelt's class of 1972 is Dwight E. Pointer.  Representative Smith stated that Roosevelt and Froebel were the most competitive schools in this area. Therefore, they created this event to recapture the great memories and allow the generations of graduates to continue the tradition. In fact, many people return to Gary to attend this celebratory event.  This event, which usually attracts over 3,000 people, was again held in conjunction with the week-long nostalgia event. On August 7, a casino night was held at the Genesis Center followed by the picnic and nostalgia dance on August 10. On August 11, a church service and block party were held in Gary.  Froebel, which was also known as the immigrant school, is presently being surveyed for landmark status. The Pony Express and stage coaches changed horses at a way station located on the Froebel property en route to Chicago. Friedrich Froebel, who believed toddlers could be educated, instituted the first kindergartens and invented the alphabetical/numerical building blocks that are used worldwide by preschoolers. On September 9, 1907, actual class work began at the 14th street school as it was called before Froebel opened. In 1910, the city of Gary authorized a 10-acre site for the construction of Froebel. It was completed and opened in September 1912. William A. Wirt, a student of Froebel's philosophies, made it mandatory that the Gary schools implement kindergarten through 12th grade at this school. All of the high tech concepts of the era were realized in the Froebel curriculum and soon this Gary plan gained prominence and was adopted by many school districts nationwide. Froebel High School was converted into a middle school in 1969 and the last class that was held in that building was in 1977. Since that time, Froebel School has remained closed.  Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled that the residents of Gary took the time to celebrate and appreciate their city's history. May the alumni of Froebel and Roosevelt High Schools continue to honor their schools and exude the pride that has persevered to unite everyone in Gary.                          ____________________
