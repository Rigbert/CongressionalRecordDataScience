 President, I wish to share a few lines from an opinion piece Speaker Boehner wrote last week. It began:       In November, the American people decided to entrust      Republicans with control of the U.S. Senate, where common-     sense jobs bills too often went to die in recent years. Now,      since the start of this year, the Republican majority of the      U.S. House finally has a willing partner in our work on      behalf of the American people. It is an opportunity we      haven't let go to waste.  The Speaker is hardly the only one who feels good about a new Senate that is back to work for the American people. The State work period was a good reminder of just that. Over the past week, Kentuckians repeated similar sentiments at events I attended across the Commonwealth.  It is no surprise our constituents feel this way because the American people see more signs of more open debate in the new Senate. They see more opportunities for Senators in both parties to take a stake in the legislative process. They see us passing bills. They see committees working again. Quite a bit of bipartisan reform legislation has emerged from committees already, often with strong support from both parties.                          ____________________
