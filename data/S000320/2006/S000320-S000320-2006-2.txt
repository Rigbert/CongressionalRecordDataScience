 President, I ask unanimous consent that the following testimony given by Mr. Mallory Factor before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on September 29, 2004, and before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on June 15, 2004, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Written Testimony of Mallory Factor Before the Committee on Banking,   Housing, and Urban Affairs, United States Senate, September 29, 2004       Chairman Shelby, Senator Sarbanes, and Distinguished      Members of this Committee, thank you for inviting me to      testify today about my views on the critical issue of curbing      terror financing.       Chairman Shelby, I would like to commend you in particular      for your unwavering commitment to addressing the financing of      terror. The work that this Committee is undertaking is      extremely important to the United     States and the world. Thank you for your leadership.       My testimony will focus on terror financing emanating from      within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Clearly, there are      numerous other states that allow terror financing to continue      and that should be examined also. I have chosen to focus on      Saudi Arabia because of the enormous resources that are      funneled from within Saudi Arabia to terrorist groups around      the world.       My recommendations are contained in a report of an      Independent Task Force on Terrorist Financing, sponsored by      the Council on Foreign Relations, on which I served as Vice-     Chair. Since the report, along with its various appendices,      is almost 300 pages in length, I will only be able to      highlight core points and ask that the full report and its      appendices be placed into the record.       I would like to thank the Task Force Chairman, Maurice R.      Greenberg, who has been a leader in bringing this issue to      the nation's attention. I would also like to thank Council      President Richard Haass for his commitment to this topic and      to the Task Force's mission. I am testifying in my personal      capacity, as is customary, and not on behalf of the Task      Force or the Council on Foreign Relations.       Among the core findings of the first Terrorist Financing      Task Force report, released in October 2002, was that ``For      years, individuals and charities based in Saudi Arabia have      been the most important source of funds for al-Qaeda; and for      years, Saudi officials have turned a blind eye to this      problem.''       It should be noted that the Task Force found no evidence      that the Saudi government--as an institution--participated in      the financing of terror directly. However, the Saudi      government has clearly allowed individual and institutional      financiers of terror to operate and prosper within Saudi      borders.       The Bush administration has accomplished a great deal since      9/11. Some of the Administration's achievements in this area      have been integrating terrorist financing into the U.S.      government's overall counterterrorism effort, securing      unprecedented international support for UN sanctions against      al-Qaeda, strengthening international standards for financial      supervision through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF),      issuing significant and meaningful regulations under the      Patriot Act and implementing a wide-ranging strategy to      engage Saudi Arabia on the subject of financial and      ideological support of extremists. Still, there is much work      to be done.       I would like to set forth the following framework of      constructive, forward looking recommendations for improving      U.S. efforts against terrorism financing.       First, U.S. policymakers must build a new framework for      U.S.-Saudi relations. The terror financing issue is situated      in the complex and important bilateral relationship between      the United States and Saudi Arabia. For decades, U.S.-Saudi      Arabia relations have been built upon a consistent framework      understood by both sides: Saudi Arabia would be a      constructive actor with regard to the world's oil markets and      regional security issues, and the United States would help      provide for the defense of Saudi Arabia, work to address the      Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not raise any significant      questions about Saudi Arabian domestic issues, either      publicly or privately.       More recently however, this framework has come under strain      because al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization rooted in issues      central to Saudi Arabian domestic affairs, has murdered      thousands of Americans. Al-Qaeda and similar organizations      continue to conspire to kill even more Americans and to      threaten our way of life.       Changed circumstances require a new policy framework for      U.S.-Saudi relations. When domestic Saudi issues threaten      Americans at home and abroad, the U.S. must pay attention to      those Saudi ``domestic'' issues that impact U.S. security      such as terrorist financing and the global export of Islamic      extremism. These issues can no longer be ``off the table'';      they must be front and center in our bilateral relationship.       This transition is already well underway, as evidenced by      turbulence in the bilateral relationship since 9/11. Some      Bush administration officials have privately characterized      the current state of affairs in Saudi Arabia as a ``civil      war'' and suggested that the appropriate objective for U.S.      policy in this context is to help the current regime prevail.      I agree, but believe the domestic Saudi problem will not be      solved by dispersing al-Qaeda cells and members in Saudi      Arabia alone. Rather, the ``civil war'' will be won only when      the regime confronts directly and unequivocally addresses the      ideological, religious, social, and cultural realities that      fuel al-Qaeda, its imitators, and its financiers all over the      world.       Second, Saudi Arabia must fully implement its new laws and      regulations and take additional steps to further improve its      efforts to combat terrorist financing. In addition to      implementing its recently enacted laws and regulations in      this area, Saudi Arabia should also deter the financing of      terrorism by publicly punishing those Saudi individuals and      organizations that have funded terrorist organizations.      Although a recent report by FATF noted several prosecutions      in Saudi Arabia under the terror financing laws, arrests and      punitive steps against financiers of terror have only taken      place in the ``shadows''. I am not aware of any publicly      announced arrests, trials or incarcerations in Saudi Arabia      relating to the financing of terrorism. Saudi Arabia must      also increase the financial transparency and programmatic      verification of its global charities and publicly release      audit reports of those charities. Saudi Arabia should ratify      and implement treaties that create binding international      legal obligations relating to combating money laundering and      terrorist financing.       Third, multilateral initiatives need to be better      coordinated, appropriately funded, and invested with clear      punitive authorities. The need for a new international      organization specializing in terrorist financing issues, as      recommended by the Task Force's initial report, has      diminished as a result of significant efforts being      undertaken by a variety of international actors. The need for      proper coordination and clearer mandates has increased for      the same reason. It is now time to minimize duplicative      efforts and reallocate resources to the most effective and      appropriate lead organization.       Fourth, the executive branch should formalize its efforts      to centralize the coordination of U.S. measures to combat      terrorist financing. My understanding is that, in practice,      responsibilities for the coordination of terrorist financing      issues have shifted from the Treasury Department to the White      House. I commend the Bush Administration for this action.      However, setting up a formal allocation of responsibilities      is crucial to maintain continuity and focus as the specific      individuals involved in these efforts turn over. Therefore,      allocation of responsibility to the White House needs to be      formalized through a National Security Presidential Directive      (NSPD) or otherwise.       Fifth, Congress should enact a Treasury-led certification      regime specifically on terrorist financing. Many governments      are working on shutting down terror financing from within      their borders, but many are not. Congress should adopt a      certification regime under which the Treasury Department      provides a written certification on an annual basis      (classified if necessary) detailing the steps that foreign      nations have taken to cooperate in U.S. and international      efforts to combat terror financing. In the absence of a      presidential national security waiver, jurisdictions that do      not receive this certification would be subject to sanctions      provided by section 311 of the Patriot Act--including denial      of U.S. foreign assistance monies and limitations on access      to the U.S. financial system.       The Administration has used the powers granted to it by      section 311 of the Patriot Act but only once in the terror      financing context. Section 311 allows Treasury to require      domestic financial institutions and agencies to take      ``special measures'' against certain parties, including both      institutions and jurisdictions, believed by the Treasury to      be engaged in money laundering/terror financing. These      special measures can include placing prohibitions or      conditions on ``correspondent'' or ``payable through''      accounts involving the parties engaged in the money      laundering/terror financing.       Of course, foreign financial institutions and jurisdictions      that do not have significant financial relations with the      United States would not be meaningfully impacted by Section      311 sanctions imposed by the United States. However, a      similar sanction imposed in the money laundering context      resulted in the targeted jurisdiction promulgating desired      legislative and regulatory changes.       A certification regime for terror financing would ensure      that these special measures are used appropriately and      thoughtfully against ``rogue'' jurisdictions. A separate      certification regime for terror financing--distinct from any      other reporting requirements on the promulgation of terror      itself or money laundering--ensures that stringent      requirements are maintained specifically with respect to each      jurisdiction's practices on terror financing without      consideration of other issues.       I commend Congresswoman Sue Kelly and others who have      introduced legislation in the House, as H.R. 5124, that would      require a terror financing certification regime.       Sixth, the UN Security Council should broaden the scope of      the UN's al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee. The UN      Security Council should specifically impose international      sanctions on other groups and individuals that have been      designated as terrorists, as Hamas has been by the United      States and E.U. I understand that these UN committees      continue to discuss various actions but have not taken any      affirmative action as yet. Furthermore, the UN should      require, as a matter of international law, that member states      take enforcement action against groups, persons and entities      designated by the Sanctions Committee. The enabling      resolution for these expanded authorities should explicitly      reject the notion that acts of terror may be legitimized by      the charitable activities or political motivations of the      perpetrator. The UN should make it clear that no cause,      however legitimate, justifies the use of terror.       Seventh, the U.S. government should increase sharing of      information with the financial services sector as permitted      by Section 314(a) of the PATRIOT Act so that this sector can      cooperate more effectively with the U.S. government in      identifying financiers of terror. Helping private sector      financial institutions become effective partners in      identifying financiers of terror should be a top priority.      The procedures set forth in Section 314(a) of the PATRIOT      Act, which promote     information sharing between the U.S. government and financial      institutions to increase detection of terror financing, are      not working as well as they should. The U.S. government is      still not providing financial institutions with adequate      information to enable the institutions to detect terror      financing and identify unknown perpetrators. The government      is still using financial institutions primarily to assist in      investigating known or suspected terror financiers, not in      identifying unknown ones. In addition, our government does      not currently have the appropriate resources to process and      make full use of information that is flowing to it from      financial institutions.       I recognize that the information that would enable      financial institutions to become effective partners with the      U.S. government in identifying terror financing may be highly      protected intelligence information. In other industries such      as defense and transportation, however, persons can be      designated by the U.S. government to receive access to      certain high value information as necessary. A similar      approach could be used to facilitate information sharing and      cooperation between the U.S. government and private financial      institutions.       Eighth, the National Security Council (NSC) and the White      House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should conduct a      cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all U.S. government      agencies as they relate to terrorist financing. Monitoring      the financial and human resources that are actually devoted      to the various tasks involved in combating terrorist      financing will facilitate fully informed, strategic decisions      about whether resource allocations are optimal or functions      are duplicative. For this reason, the NSC and OMB should      conduct a cross-cutting analysis of all agencies' budgets in      this area, to gain clarity about who is doing what, how well,      and with what resources. With such a cross-cut in hand, the      Administration and Congress can begin to assess the      efficiency of existing efforts and the adequacy of      appropriations relative to the threat.       Ninth, the U.S. government and private foundations,      universities, and think tanks should increase efforts to      understand the strategic threat posed to the United States by      radical Islamic militancy, including specifically the methods      and modalities of its financing and global propagation. At      the dawn of the Cold War, the U.S. government and U.S.      nongovernmental organizations committed substantial public      and philanthropic resources to endow Soviet studies programs      across the United States. The purpose of these efforts was to      increase the level of understanding in this country of the      profound strategic threat posed to the United States by      Soviet Communism. A similar undertaking is now needed to      understand adequately the threat posed to the United States      by radical Islamic militancy, along with its causes, which we      believe constitutes the greatest strategic threat to the      United States at the dawn of this new century. To be      commensurate with the threat, much more will need to be done      by private U.S. foundations, universities, and think tanks in      a sustained, deliberate, and well-financed manner.       I look forward to your questions.                                  ____Statement of Mallory Factor, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs,   ``An Assessment of Current Efforts To Combat Terrorism Financing,''                              June 15, 2004       Madame Chairman, Senator Lieberman and Distinguished      Members of the Committee:       I am honored to testify here today to report to you on the      recommendations of the Independent Task Force of the Council      on Foreign Relations on Terrorist Financing, of which I have      served as Vice-Chair.       Madame Chairman and Senator Lieberman, I would like to      commend you for your unwavering commitment to these issues.      The work this Committee is undertaking is of critical      importance to the United States and the world. Thank you for      your important leadership.       Until relatively recently, too little was done to curb the      flow of funds to terrorists and extremists. That is why the      Council on Foreign Relations sponsored this Task Force in      2002 and renewed its mandate more recently. I would like to      thank Council President Richard Haass for all that he has      done to make this Task Force a success.       Our distinguished bi-partisan Task Force is chaired by      Maurice R. Greenberg and directed by William F. Wechsler and      Lee S. Wolosky. They led this Task Force in the interest of      serving our nation. I believe they have succeeded.       I would particularly like to commend Lee Wolosky, without      whose leadership, judgment, diplomacy, draftsmanship and      dedicated efforts this task force would not have been a      success. Lee worked tirelessly to reach consensus among task      force members on the report and its recommendations.       The Bush administration has accomplished a great deal since      9/11. Some of the administration's achievements in this area      have been integrating terrorist financing into the U.S.      government's overall counterterrorism effort, securing      unprecedented international support for UN sanctions against      al-Qaeda, strengthening international standards for financial      supervision through FATF, issuing significant and meaningful      regulations under the PATRIOT Act and implementing a wide-     ranging strategy to engage Saudi Arabia on the subject of      financial and ideological support of extremists. Still, there      is much work to be done and I believe that the Task Force      report sets forth a framework of constructive, forward      looking recommendations for improving U.S. efforts against      terrorism financing.       Our report focuses on terror financing from within the      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia because of the enormous resources      emanating from that state that fund terrorist activities.      Clearly, there are numerous other states that finance terror      and that should be examined also.       The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has accomplished a great deal      since May 2003. Most notably, Saudi Arabia has enacted      extensive laws and regulations which, if fully implemented,      would significantly reduce the flow of funds from within      Saudi Arabia to terrorists. However, we have not found Saudi      Arabia to be effectively enforcing these laws and regulations      as Lee Wolosky has discussed. Many issues still need to be      addressed before Saudi Arabia will have an acceptable regime      in place to combat terror financing.       Our task force report generally reaffirms the      recommendations made in the Task Force's first report and      makes nine new recommendations. I will discuss them in      varying levels of detail and would welcome the opportunity to      discuss any of them in greater length in response to your      questions.       First, we urge U.S. policymakers to build a new framework      for U.S.-Saudi relations. We recognize the broader context of      the complex and important bilateral relationship in which the      terrorist financing issue is situated. For decades, U.S.-     Saudi Arabia relations have been built upon a consistent      framework understood by both sides: Saudi Arabia would be a      constructive actor with regard to the world's oil markets and      regional security issues, and the United States would help      provide for the defense of Saudi Arabia, work to address the      Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and not raise any significant      questions about Saudi Arabian domestic issues, either      publicly or privately.       More recently however, this framework has come under strain      because al-Qaeda, a terrorist organization rooted in issues      central to Saudi Arabian domestic affairs, has murdered      thousands of Americans. Al-Qaeda and similar organizations      continue to conspire to kill even more Americans and to      threaten our way of life.       Changed circumstances require a new policy framework for      U.S.-Saudi relations. When domestic Saudi problems threaten      Americans at home and abroad, the U.S. must pay attention to      those Saudi ``domestic'' issues that impact U.S. security      such as terrorist financing and the global export of Islamic      extremism. These issues can no longer be ``off the table'';      they must be front and center in our bilateral relationship.       We acknowledge that this transition is already well      underway, as evidenced by the turbulence in the bilateral      relationship since 9/11. We note that some Bush      administration officials have privately characterized the      current state of affairs in Saudi Arabia as a ``civil war''      and suggested that the appropriate objective for U.S. policy      in this context is to help the current regime prevail. We      agree, but we believe the domestic Saudi problem will not be      solved by dispersing al-Qaeda cells and members in Saudi      Arabia alone. Rather, the ``civil war'' will be won only when      the regime confronts directly and unequivocally addresses the      ideological, religious, social, and cultural realities that      fuel al-Qaeda, its imitators, and its financiers all over the      world.       Second, we recommend that Saudi Arabia fully implement its      new laws and regulations and take additional steps to further      improve its efforts to combat terrorist financing. In      addition to implementing its recently enacted laws and      regulations in this area, Saudi Arabia should also deter the      financing of terrorism by publicly punishing those Saudi      individuals and organizations that have funded terrorist      organizations. It should increase the financial transparency      and programmatic verification of its global charities and      publicly release audit reports of those charities. Saudi      Arabia should also ratify and implement treaties that create      binding international legal obligations relating to combating      money laundering and terrorist financing.       Third, we suggest that multilateral initiatives be better      coordinated, appropriately funded, and invested with clear      punitive authorities. The need for a new international      organization specializing in terrorist financing issues, as      recommended by our initial report, has diminished as a result      of significant efforts being undertaken by a variety of      international actors. The need for proper coordination and      clearer mandates has increased for the same reason. It is now      time to minimize duplicative efforts and reallocate resources      to the most effective and appropriate lead organization.       Fourth, we believe that the executive branch should      formalize its efforts to centralize the coordination of U.S.      measures to combat terrorist financing. Our understanding is      that, in practice, responsibilities for the coordination of      terrorist financing issues have shifted from the Treasury      Department to the White House, as we recommended in our      original Task Force report. I commend the Bush Administration      for this action. However, we believe that this allocation of      responsibility to the White House needs to be formalized      through a National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) or      otherwise.       Fifth, we recommend that Congress enact a Treasury-led      certification regime specifically on terrorist financing. The      financial support for terrorism is the life-blood of global      terrorism and requires its own certification regime. A      separate certification process will ensure that stringent      requirements are maintained specifically with respect to a      nation's policies and practices on terrorist financing      without consideration of other issues.       I believe that the Saudi Arabia Accountability Act of 2003,      S. 1888, sponsored by Senator Arlen Specter and co-sponsored      by Chairman Collins and others would provide a good starting      point for a terrorist financing certification regime if it      were narrowed to focus solely on the financing of terrorism      and expanded to apply to other nations.       We understand that certification regimes are generally      disfavored by the executive branch (which must implement      them) and favored by the legislative branch (which they      empower). Although controversial, they also have the ability      to galvanize quickly action consistent with U.S. interests.      Moreover, they require official findings of fact that have      the effect of promoting transparency and compelling sustained      U.S. attention to important topics that, on occasion, U.S.      officials find it more expedient to avoid.       For these reasons, we believe that Congress should pass and      the President should sign legislation requiring the executive      branch to submit to Congress on an annual basis a written      certification (classified if necessary) detailing the steps      that foreign nations have taken to cooperate in U.S. and      international efforts to combat terrorist financing. We      suggest that in the absence of a presidential national      security waiver, states that do not receive this      certification would be subject to sanctions--including denial      of U.S. foreign assistance monies and limitations on access      to the U.S. financial system.       Sixth, we urge the U.N. Security Council to broaden the      scope of the U.N.'s al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee.      The UN Security Council should specifically impose      international sanctions on other groups and individuals that      have been designated as terrorists, as Hamas has been by the      United States and E.U. Furthermore, it should require, as a      matter of international law, that member states take      enforcement action against groups, persons and entities      designated by the Sanctions Committee. The enabling      resolution for these expanded authorities should explicitly      reject the notion that acts of terror may be legitimized by      the charitable activities or political motivations of the      perpetrator. No cause, however legitimate, justifies the use      of terror; indeed, the use of terror delegitimizes even the      most worthy causes.       Seventh, we suggest that the U.S. government increase      sharing of information with the financial services sector as      permitted by Section 314 of the USA PATRIOT ACT so that this      sector can cooperate more effectively with the U.S.      government in identifying incidences of terror financing.      International financial institutions subject to U.S.      jurisdiction are among our best sources of raw financial      intelligence to identify terror financing, but these      institutions need to be given appropriate information from      the U.S. government on what to look for. Currently, the      procedures required by Section 314 of the Patriot Act which      are designed to promote cooperation with financial      institutions in identifying terror financing are not working      as effectively as they might. We suggest greater information      sharing between the U.S. government and the financial      institutions within the framework of the Patriot Act in order      to allow these institutions to cooperate more effectively      with the U.S. government in identifying incidences of terror      financing.       Eighth, we recommend that the National Security Council      (NSC) and the White House Office of Management and Budget      (OMB) conduct a cross-cutting analysis of the budgets of all      U.S. government agencies as they relate to terrorist      financing. We understand this recommendation is difficult to      implement; however, we think that monitoring the financial      and human resources that are actually devoted to the various      tasks involved in combating terrorist financing will      facilitate fully informed, strategic decisions about whether      resource allocations are optimal or functions are      duplicative. For this reason, the NSC and OMB should conduct      a cross-cutting analysis of all agencies' budgets in this      area, to gain clarity about who is doing what, how well, and      with what resources. Only with such a cross-cut in hand can      we begin to make assessments regarding the efficiency of our      existing efforts and the adequacy of appropriations relative      to the threat. We commend Jody Myers, the former NSC staffer,      for suggesting a similar cross-cutting analysis in his Senate      testimony given last month.       Ninth, we urge the U.S. government and private foundations,      universities, and think tanks to increase efforts to      understand the strategic threat posed to the United States by      radical Islamic militancy, including specifically the methods      and modalities of its financing and global propagation. At      the dawn of the Cold War, the U.S. government and U.S.      nongovernmental organizations committed substantial public      and philanthropic resources to endow Soviet studies programs      across the United States. The purpose of these efforts was to      increase the level of understanding in this country of the      profound strategic threat posed to the United States by      Soviet Communism. A similar undertaking is now needed to      understand adequately the threat posed to the United States      by radical Islamic militancy, along with its causes, which we      believe constitutes the greatest strategic threat to the      United States at the dawn of this new century. To be      commensurate with the threat, much more will need to be done,      not only in Washington, but also by private U.S. foundations,      universities, and think tanks, in a more sustained,      deliberate, and well-financed manner than that afforded      through ad hoc initiatives such as our Task Force.       I look forward to your questions.                          ____________________[Pages S11175-S11178]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      TESTIMONY OF MALLORY FACTOR
