Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, during the last 2 days, the eulogies that have been given on behalf of Mrs. King hit the nail on the head. This was a woman who became a widow when her husband was tragically assassinated and had very young children, and she could have withdrawn from society and spent all of her time and all of her efforts raising those kids to become grown men and grown women.  She did more than that. She knew that it was her destiny to carry on her assassinated husband's legacy, and that is why we have heard such eloquent speeches on both sides of the aisle on behalf of this resolution which I was honored to introduce.  May God have mercy on the soul of Coretta Scott King, and may she join the angels and saints in paradise.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this resolution.
