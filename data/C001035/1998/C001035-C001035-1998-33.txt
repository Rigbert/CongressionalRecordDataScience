President, today I introduce the Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act of 1998, which is intended to address some of the problems that small family practice residency programs in Maine and elsewhere are experiencing as a result of provisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that were intended to control the growth in Medicare graduate medical education spending.  Of specific concern are the provisions in the BBA that cap the total number of residents in a program at the level included in the 1996 Medicare cost reports. Congress' goal in reforming Medicare's graduate medical education program was to slow down our nation's overall production of physicians, while still protecting the training of physicians who are in short supply and needed to meet local and national health care demands. While it is true that the BBA's provisions will curb growth in the overall physician supply, they do so indiscriminately and are thwarting efforts in Maine and elsewhere to increase the supply of primary care physicians in underserved rural areas.  Because Maine has only one medical school--the University of New England, which trains osteopathic physicians--we depend on a number of small family practice residency programs to introduce physicians to the practice opportunities in the state. Most of the graduates of these residency programs go on to establish practices in Maine, many in rural and underserved areas of the state.
