 President, last night, when everybody was rushing around in the well during the last vote and wishing each other a Merry Christmas, I was reminded of something Senator Lott said yesterday morning. He told us not to forget that we all have normal lives and families to get home to and the same basic concerns in life as everybody else; and that if we forget that, then this body is in serious trouble.  It is in that spirit that I would like to wrap up the year in pretty much the same way I tried to open it, by urging a little more cooperation and civility. About a year ago now, I called on my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to take advantage of the rare opportunity divided government gave us to tackle big issues on a bipartisan basis. Beyond that, I said Republicans had a few basic priorities: keeping Americans safe and secure, protecting their basic freedoms, protecting their wallets, and spending their money wisely. I said we would not hesitate to ensure these priorities by shaping worthy legislation or by blocking legislation that would undermine them.  Looking back on the year, I think we have been pretty successful at it.  Early on, Democrats presented us with a minimum wage bill that undermined small businesses, and it did not pass. When they agreed to include a tax break, it sailed through by a vote of 94-3. We shaped that one.  A little later, Democrats gave us an energy conservation bill that would have led to higher taxes, and it did not pass. When they agreed to remove the tax hikes 6 months later, it passed easily, 86-13. We shaped that one.
