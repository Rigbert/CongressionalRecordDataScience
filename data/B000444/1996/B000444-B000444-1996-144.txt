 President, I rise today to call attention to the single greatest security threat to Americans in the post-cold war ERA--the possibility that weapons of mass destruction could be acquired by rogue states, criminal organizations, or terrorists, and used against American targets.  In the coming weeks, I hope that this body will have the opportunity to act on the Chemical Weapons Convention and reduce one portion of this threat.  Today, however, as President Clinton prepares to join President Yeltsin and the G-7 leaders in Moscow for a nuclear safety and security summit over the next 2 days, I would like to focus my remarks on the nuclear threat.  President Clinton has placed nuclear nonproliferation at the top of the U.S. national security agenda--he is clearly committed and willing to lead on this issue. Vice President Gore's regular meetings with Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin also have advanced nuclear security. Indeed, in the last 3 years we have seen important agreements and cooperative projects between U.S. officials and their counterparts in Russia and other Republics of the former Soviet Union.  Despite these positive steps, however, the threat before us remains immense, and the path to nuclear security remains long and difficult. We need to understand the potential magnitude ofthe threat, and muster the resolve and resources to address it effectively.                        the nature of the threat  Mr. President, Soviet nuclear missiles no longer point at American cities. With the START process, we have also seen and hopefully will continue to see significant reductions in strategic nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union. But these arms control successes should not give us a false sense of security.  Over 100,000 weapons or weapons equivalent material remain strewn--literally strewn--about Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. The centralized system that prevented the possible theft or diversion of this immense quantity of fissile material during the cold war no longer exists.  I should also note that each year as more nuclear warheads are dismantled, additional tons of weapons-grade material move from relatively more secure military facilities to less secure nuclear storage facilities. The 3,000 warheads that are dismantled each year yield 15 tons of plutonium and 45 tons of highly-enriched uranium.  Of this veritable cornucopia of dangerous fissile material spread across the territory of the former Soviet Union, only a small fraction would be required to wreak unspeakable damage.  It takes only 25 kilograms of highly enriched uranium or 8 kilograms of plutonium to create a weapon capable of massive destruction. We are talking about an amount of uranium the size of a softball--or a baseball in the case of plutonium. That small amount of material could be easily concealed and transported in a sturdy briefcase or a backpack.  As my colleagues know, the greatest barrier to overcome in manufacturing a nuclear weapon is acquiring the appropriate grade and quantity of fissile material. After that, it just takes a little time, money, and technical know-how.  A determined terrorist or rogue state does not even need to build a perfectly designed atomic bomb with the highest grade fissile material to create unimaginable terror. A weapon built of crude, low-grade nuclear material such as a nuclear radiological device would be sufficient to generate widespread panic.  This is not just doomsday rhetoric. Does anyone actually deny that there exists a great demand today for nuclear material? Those who are not yet convinced need only consider the chilling incidents that have occurred over the last few years. As my colleagues are well aware, gram and kilogram quantities of weapons-grade uranium--almost surely leaked from the former Soviet Union--have been seized in Moscow, Munich, and Prague. In addition, dismantled parts of Soviet nuclear missiles have made their way to Iraq.  We know that the demand exists. We also know that the supply exists. Elementary economics tells us that without intervention, a supply curve and a demand curve will intersect--and you will have a transaction. It is incumbent upon us to intervene and prevent even one of these potentially deadly transactions from occurring.  These are the key challenges we face in doing so:  How do we develop a comprehensive accounting system for all nuclear material in the former Soviet Union?  How do we gather and physically protect nuclear material in a limited number of secure sites?  How do we safely dispose of excess nuclear material?  How do we prevent the theft and smuggling of nuclear material?  And, how do we prevent former Soviet nuclear experts from selling their knowhow to rogue states or terrorists?  The answers to these questions are not exclusively of concern to the United States. They are vitally important to Western Europe, Japan, and even to Russia.                the situation in the former soviet union  Perhaps it would be useful if I briefly walked through what we know about the situation in Russia today to demonstrate the difficulties we face in meeting these challenges.  First, the collapse of the Soviet command and control security system has been replaced by chaos and the absence of many controls at sites where nuclear materials are stored. In the context of Russia's current tumultuous social and economic conditions, we are talking about an environment conducive to theft and extortion.  Second, the Soviet Union had no comprehensive accounting system for nuclear weapons and fissile material--certainly no computerized inventory. In other words, we--including the Russians--do not even know exactly where all of the Soviet Nuclear material is stored or how much of it exists. We think most nuclear material is located in 80 to 100 sites. But there may be another 40 sites. We think the Soviet Union produced some 1,200 metric tons of highly enriched uranium and some 200 metric tons of plutonium. Needless to say, it would be difficult to determine if a few kilograms of this material were misplaced here and there.  Third, the lack of physical protection of nuclear material in the former Soviet Union is shocking. Nuclear material is stored in containers without seals to prevent tampering. Many of the labs, research centers, and power plants with nuclear material do not have perimeter fences, electronic sensors, or monitoring cameras to deter and detect intruders. Instead, U.S. officials have seen nuclear rods stored in metal lockers secured with padlocks. According to the Russian Government, 80 percent of its nuclear facilities--80 percent--do not have radiation detectors to prevent those on the inside from walking out the door with nuclear material.  Fourth, there are nuclear technicians and guards at these facilities who have not been paid in months. I have heard that the senior staff of one nuclear facility abandon their posts a few hours a day to tend to their potato gardens, so that they will have food to eat. It seems to me that these conditions are so ripe for corruption that the threat of an inside job is much greater than the threat of an outside thief entering a nuclear facility--as easy as that may be.  Fifth, current border controls throughout the former Soviet Union are notoriously weak. If smuggled nuclear material passes through Europe, we have some chance that intelligence officials and law enforcement can interdict it. However, trafficking routes through the Caucasus or Central Asia are another story--the chances of successful interdiction are slim to none.  Finally, we have the problem of the thousands of nuclear scientists and technicians in the former Soviet Union with knowledge about nuclear weapons who are looking for ways to make a living in the new world order. Their expertise would certainly be welcome in some aspiring nuclear states that immediately come to mind.                            the u.s response  After a slow start 4 years ago, many of these problems are now being addressed by our Departments of Defense and Energy. The Energy Department, for example, has equipped a number of nuclear facilities in the former Soviet Union with fences, monitors, and sensors. The United States Enrichment Corporation has arranged for the purchase of 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium to be converted into commercial reactor fuel. Newly created international research institutes have employed hundreds of Russian nuclear scientists. Such cooperative efforts need to be evaluated and duplicated on a much larger scale.  I commend my distinguished colleagues Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar for bringing attention to global proliferation threats through Senator Nunn's recent hearings of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and Senator Lugar's hearings last august on the issue of Loose Nukes. I might add that Senator Lugar's hearings are the only hearings that have been held on this critical issue in the Foreign Relations Committee in the 104th Congress.  Mr. President, I think that it is worth asking: are we directing America's limited resources proportionately to meet a clear and present threat which I and many of my colleagues regard as our greatest national security challenge?  In 1991, my colleagues Senators Nunn and Lugar had the foresight to devise the cooperative threat reduction program to assist the states of the former Soviet Union in dismantling nuclear warheads and protecting nuclear materials. Over the last 5 years funding for the Nunn-Lugar program has totaled $1.5 billion--an average of $300 millionper year, or about one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual defense budget. In addition, this year's funding level was cut 25 percent from last year's level.  In contrast, consider how much time, money, and energy we have spent on the proposed missile defense system to meet the improbable long-range ballistic missile threat, which we are told is at least 15 years away. We have spent some $35 billion over the years on missile defenses. I find it hard to believe that this disparity in spending corresponds to the threats we face.  As I have repeatedly stated on this floor, a long-range ballistic missile will not be the most likely means of delivery of a weapon of mass destruction to the United States. No. A much more likely scenario is that a terrorist group will smuggle material and parts for a nuclear, chemical, or biological device onto our shores--perhaps by any of the many routes used by narcotics traffickers--and then reconstruct a weapon of mass destruction, put it in a van, and detonate it in near an important American landmark.  That is the more likely threat, and that is where we should be focusing the bulk of our energies, not on reviving star wars.                           the nuclear summit  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues recognize that we are engaged in a race against time. Either we will help secure this material and provide our citizens with the safety to which they are entitled, or rogue elements will procure this material and use it to blackmail civilization.  The danger of uncontrolled nuclear material is a first level national security threat to the United States of America and a first level national security threat to our friends and allies. We cannot simply ignore the problem and leave if for Russia to solve on her own. Likewise, Russia cannot simply downplay the potential threat and delay implementing concrete measures. Indeed, Russia itself is a target--just last November Chechen separatists placed radioactive material in a Moscow park.  To be successful, the nuclear safety and security summit must build a global consensus on the nature of the threat before us and generate wider cooperation for swift action.  The critical first step must be to improve the physical protection of nuclear material at the source--secure the material at a limited number of sites and institute a comprehensive accounting system. That, in my opinion, is the most important agenda item for the leaders of the G-7 and Russia at the nuclear summit.  World leaders at the summit will also discuss ways to improve cooperation in countering nuclear material smuggling. Given the limited success we have had in interdicting narcotics traffickers, I am not optimistic about the prospects of interdiction alone to prevent the proliferation of nuclear material. Nonetheless, much more can and should be done to improve border controls and intelligence cooperation.  Mr. President, it is my hope that the nuclear safety and security summit in Moscow this week will help propel the world's leaders to take immediate preventative and rational steps toward nuclear security. The alternative is to delay action until after our first nuclear terrorist incident--whether in a Moscow park, a Tokyo subway, or a New York office building.  Mr. President, no other nation can match the expertise and resources of the United States. We must be the leader in promoting cooperative efforts to reduce the nuclear threat. Investments we make in this area today will reap a future return in the form of enhanced security for all Americans.                          ____________________
