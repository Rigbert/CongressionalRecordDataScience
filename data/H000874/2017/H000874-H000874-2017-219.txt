Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  Mr. Leader, if the Rules Committee meets, say, at 9 a.m., and you said the earliest vote at 10 a.m., obviously, a lot of our Members are focused on what time they have to be here to make sure they make a vote, and you said the earliest would be 10, but if you have the Rules Committee reporting out, would it be perhaps closer to 10:30?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I anticipate the Rules Committee meeting earlier than 9 a.m. tomorrow.
