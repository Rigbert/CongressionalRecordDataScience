 President, I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message to accompany S. 1790.  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:       Resolved, That the House insist upon its amendment to the      bill (S. 1790), entitled ``An Act to authorize appropriations      for fiscal year 2020 for military activities of the      Department of Defense, for military construction, and for      defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe      military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for      other purposes,'' and ask for a conference with the Senate on      the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon.                            Compound Motion  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move that the Senate disagree to the House amendment, agree to the request of the House for conference, and authorize the Chair to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.                               Cloture Motion  Mr. McCONNELL. I send a cloture motion to the desk.
