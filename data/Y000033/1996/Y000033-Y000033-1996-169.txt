The gentleman knows how these people live, and he wants them to go get a lawyer, and draw up this plan and we have got the big Federal Government, the Fish and Wildlife, telling you what to do, that ``if you don't do it you're going to jail and you're going to get fined.'' That is our Government today. We wonder why we have got the Freemen or the militants. We wonder why, in fact, we have got unrest in this country.                              {time}  1545  Mr. Chairman, it is because our Government, in fact, has got out of hand and out of line with the Endangered Species Act, and I am glad to hear the gentleman supports the Endangered Species Act, 35,000 people were put out of work in his area. In California and Oregon alone, 181 mills closed down. For what? For a species not endangered--because the Fish and Wildlife Service says it is endangered.  I write a bill that says it must have biological substantial evidence it is endangered, and I am criticized for that.  Do you know how to get a specie on the endangered list today? Any one of you can file a petition, as they did in Alaska. That is all you have to do. Then the agency says, we must study it. It the meantime, by the way, you are going to lose your job. This is just how ridiculous the Endangered Species Act is today.  Mr. Chairman, I think it is ridiculous that this amendment is even proposed when this gentleman has families to protect, and he talks about one person. What about the families? I do not care if it is one family or one acre. When this Government is wrong, it is wrong.  What happened to the gentleman's liberalism? What happened to his protecting the masses? What happened to ``We have to think about the people''? All he thinks about now is the Government and how right they are. I am telling you they are wrong in this case, dead wrong.  Mr. Chairman, this is a bad amendment, and I support the gentleman from California.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs].
