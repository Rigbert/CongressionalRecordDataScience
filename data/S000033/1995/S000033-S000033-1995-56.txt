 Chairman, my friend from Wisconsin makes the point about it being illegal to try to impede the creation of a union. But that gentleman's party has supported, as I understand it, a 30-percent cut in the funding of the National Labor Relations Board, the one Board in this country that exists to try to protect workers. So it is very clear where our friends on the other side are coming from.
