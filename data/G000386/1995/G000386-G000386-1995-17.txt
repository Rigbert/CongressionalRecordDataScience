 But you castigated me for what I was saying about the level of expenditures, it seemed to me. My point is they are very, very tied together. It seems to me that before we put more money into the pot, we ought to be able to prove what we are buying, and have a system of accounting that makes sure that every dollar that we put into defense gets us a dollar's worth of defense.  The second thing, and more appropriate to what the Senator from Alaska was saying about the level of expenditure--I think I said this on the floor in the debate originally--but I was told by leaders on military issues in the House of Representatives when we were on the budget--and I am the second senior person on the Budget Committee; so I was involved in those discussions--confidentially they said to me, ``Chuck, you know we have to have about $6 or $7 billion more than what the President wants because we have to take care of our Members. We have to take care of our Members.''
