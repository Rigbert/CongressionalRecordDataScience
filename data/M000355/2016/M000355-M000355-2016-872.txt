 President, we will return to the consideration of the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill today. As we do so, I wish to remind colleagues of the importance of returning to regular order and working through the appropriations process.  A return to regular order means empowering Senators from both sides to make more responsible judgments as to how taxpayer dollars are spent. It means allowing Senators to better represent the voices of their constituents throughout the legislative process. Beginning the process early means giving Senators from both sides more opportunity to debate and offer ideas they think might make these bills even better.  This is the way the appropriations process is supposed to work, and with a little cooperation, we can keep it moving forward this week.  The bill before us will support energy innovation and waterway infrastructure. It will promote commerce and public safety. It will help maintain our nuclear deterrence posture.  These are priorities that should be important to all of us. So let's continue to work today and move this bill forward.                          ____________________
