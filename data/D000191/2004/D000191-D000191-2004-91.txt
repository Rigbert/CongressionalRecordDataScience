  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, reasonably priced gasoline has become a distant memory for most Americans, yet gasoline can still be had for 5 cents a gallon. Where? Well, in Baghdad. How? Because the American taxpayers are subsidizing gasoline for the Iraqis at the cost of $167 million a month. Even at that we are being ripped off by Halliburton, we are told. We are paying too much for it.  So while Americans are curtailing their summer vacations because they cannot afford to fill their tanks, they are backing up the trucks in Baghdad and filling up 20 to 30 gallon tanks for $1 to $1.50. That is a lot less than the price of a gallon here.  Yet the Republicans would tell us that their lame energy bill would do something about this. Well, we passed their lame energy bill two or three times before on the floor of the House. We are voting on all the same provisions again. The $18 billion subsidy to the oil and gas industry, yes, that will really help. That is going to help Americans get more affordable gasoline and help make this country more energy independent and efficient.  They actually do not want us to be more energy independent and efficient. They want us to be addicted to the high price oil, to continue to shovel money into these multinational oil companies.                          ____________________
