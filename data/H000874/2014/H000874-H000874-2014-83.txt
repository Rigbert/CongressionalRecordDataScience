That is good news. Hopefully, we will be able to move on this next week because it is very important that we get this done as soon as possible because the crisis is posing immediate demands on our resources.  I would say to the gentleman, can he illuminate at all whether or not that supplemental will be limited to the resources necessary to confront the crisis?  I have heard some comments that there may be changes in the underlying law with respect to how individuals at the border are treated depending upon where they come from. While I think that both the administration and others have indicated that that matter ought to be considered, there is no doubt that it will be more controversial than, I think, the supplemental will be.  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not he expects the supplemental to include attempts to amend existing immigration law, or whether or not we can consider changes to immigration law in a more either comprehensive form or in an individual bill form and, perhaps, in conjunction with the border security bill that has passed out of the Homeland Security Committee in this House, as I understand it, on voice vote? I don't know whether it was unanimous, but I don't think there was opposition to it.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Again, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, there has been ongoing consideration of this.  As the gentleman knows, from this side of the aisle, many of our Members, including on your side of the aisle, have been to the border to see this crisis, and it is the intent that we solve this problem and solve it for the long term. So, as I did mention in the schedule announcement for next week, Members should still be prepared for the possible consideration of the legislation to address the ongoing border crisis, and we will keep you posted.
