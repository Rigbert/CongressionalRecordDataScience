President, everyone should have one--a Poot, that is. And maybe everyone does have one. The important thing is I do.  We all have our causes. It's just that some of us are more assertive than others. In my business we're all assertive. So I engage in combat every day with my adversaries who, although I love each and every one of the misguided souls, would sell our country and everything we hold dear for one more social program.  Mr. President, they look the other way as we strip our Nation of its vital defenses, leaving us vulnerable to both conventional and missile attacks--and hope desperately the people don't find out the truth. They load up our system with unbearable burdens of overregulation and wonder why we are not globally competitive. They bleed the very lifeblood from our veins in the form of taxes until we are too weak and disheartened to produce--and then come after that last drop--all to support their insatiable appetite to render their control of our lives absolute. They give dancing lessons to hardened criminals--punishment, heaven forbid--and then turn them lose to plunder again.  And so I do combat every day with every fiber of my being, leaving no doubt in my mind that the fate and the very essence of Western civilization is absolute in its dependence upon my actions, wisdom and performance.  That is, until--until I see Poot. And I realize that while she is tolerant of my priorities, hers are not the same. Not even close. She wants the same thing I want but she doesn't worry about it because she assumes I'll do it. And that lets her keep close to the ones she loves, which is everybody, and stay in touch with them to the extent that she knows every birthday, wedding date, draft status and social security number. She, along with her diary, is a data bank with the chip capacity of the Congressional Record--that's her priority.  And in addition she is the control center for compassion. For her family, yes, but also anyone else who stumbles along. No matter who is in trouble or in need, she is their counselor and companion--that's her priority.  But all the while her capacity for enjoyment will never be challenged. There's not a Broadway show she hasn't both seen and memorized--that's her priority.  So, Mr. President, you should be so lucky to have a Poot like I do. Just when you begin to believe that you are so important, you have no one to put you back in perspective. I do. And when you forget the street address where you lived when you were 6 years old, you don't have anyone to call. I do. And when you cast a vote that makes everyone hate you, you don't have anyone who understands. I do--in fact she even agrees with me.  So Mr. President, I've got the No. 1 70-year-old Poot in the Nation, a beautiful and compassionate consolidation of the pioneer woman, mother Teresa, and hello Dolly. So maybe, Mr. President, she's right and we're wrong. Anyway, you should be so lucky. Amen.                          ____________________
