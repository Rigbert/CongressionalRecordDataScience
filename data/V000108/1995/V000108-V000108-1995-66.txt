Speaker, it is my great honor to rise and call attention to St. George Hellenic Orthodox Church in Schererville, IN. On October 29, 1995, the congregation of St. George will hold a consecration celebration of their church. This celebration will begin with a vespers service on Saturday night, followed by a dedication, banquet, and ball on Sunday.  Citizens of Hellenic origin began settling in the Indiana Harbor community of East Chicago in 1903. In 1929, a very small group of industrious and young individuals coordinated plans to erect a church. Through their conscientious efforts, construction on the church was completed in 1938. The first parish priest was Reverend Demetriades. The church, named after a Roman soldier who was martyred for his faith, moved from East Chicago to Schererville in March, 1992. Today, St. George, which is currently under the leadership of the Reverend Constantine Aliferakis, proudly boasts a membership of over 300 families.  The consecration celebration is similar to the baptism of a child in that it symbolizes the setting apart of the church as a temple of God and its dedication to Him. This ceremony dates back to the fourth century, when St. Constantine dedicated the church after the Christian persecution ended. This once-in-a-lifetime ceremony for any church, will be conducted by Bishop Iakovos of the Greek Orthodox Diocese of Chicago. At the ceremony, the Bishop will dedicate the new furniture and painted wall hangings of six saints and martyrs.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in a heartfelt message of congratulations to the Reverend Aliferakis and the congregation of St. George Hellenic Orthodox Church on this wonderful day of celebration. The members of St. George should be proud of their efforts to successfully preserve their Greek heritage.                          ____________________
