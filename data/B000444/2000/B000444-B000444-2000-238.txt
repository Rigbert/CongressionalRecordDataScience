 President, today, I introduce a bill which will re-authorize the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for an additional five years.  I firmly believe that re-authorization of the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund for another five years is the single most significant thing that we can do to continue the war on crime.  In 1994 when we introduced the Biden Crime Bill, which eventually became the crime bill of 1994, some people disagreed with certain aspects of the bill. But, we all agreed that crime control is a place where the federal government can and should play a key role.  We can all argue about how much we should be involved in education or welfare, but no one can argue about the requirement of the government to make our streets safe. That is the starting point for all ordered society.  So, I, along with the Senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and the Senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, worked to set up a Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. The way we did that was not to raise taxes--it was to cut the size of the federal government and use the money to fight crime. And so we agreed to let 250,000 Federal employees go. Then we took the paycheck that would have been used to pay John Jones and Sue Smith and we put it into a trust fund to do nothing but deal with violent crime in America. And guess what--it worked.  Since the Fund was established in the Biden Crime Bill, The Office of Management and Budget tells us that Congress had appropriated $16,648,000,000 from the fund through 1998, and $10,300,000,000 was estimated for 1999 and 2000 combined.  What has this money done you ask? Just look at the numbers: To date, the money has funded more than 103,000 police officers under the COPS program to make our streets safer.  As of 1999, over 17,000 new prison, jail or alternative beds had been added under the Violent Offender Incarceration/Truth-in-Sentencing Grants Program.  Under the drug court program nationwide, more than 140,000 offenders have participated in drug courts, receiving the supervision and treatment they need to stop abusing drugs and committing crimes.  Under the National Criminal History Improvement Program, enhancements to the FBI's National Criminal History Background Check System have helped block more than 400,000 gun sales to ineligible persons. And, program improvements now allow 35 states and the District of Columbia to submit data to the FBI's National Sex Offender Registry, which became operational in July 1999.  The fund has provided money to states and localities to help offset the costs of incarcerating criminal illegal aliens under the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.  Under the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment for State Prisoners program, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five territories, have implemented drug testing and treatment programs that address 80 percent of offenders who have drug or alcohol problems.  Through the largest Violence Against Women Act program, funding for the STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grants Program is changing the way communities work together to respond to domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  And there are other Violence Against Women Act grant programs which have had an impact on many communities. The Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies program encourages jurisdictions to implement mandatory or pro-arrest policies in domestic violence cases. The Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program has recognized the special needs of victims in rural locations. The Civil Legal Assistance Grant Program is designed to strengthen civil legal assistance for domestic abuse victims through innovative, collaborative programs that increase victim access to services. And, the Grants to Combat Violent Crimes Against Women on Campuses Program was first funded in FY 1999 to promote comprehensive, coordinated responses to violent crimes against women on campuses.  The results of these efforts have taken hold. Crime is down--way down. And we didn't add 1 cent to the deficit.  The significance of the Trust Fund, why it was so important, is because it funds the initiatives contained in the Biden Crime Bill. The money has to be used for new cops and crime prevention. It can't be spent on anything else but crime reduction. It is the one place that no one can compete. it is setaside. It is a savings account to fight crime.  This fund works. It ensures that the crime reduction programs that we pass be funded. It ensures that the crime rate will continue to go down instead of up. It ensures that our kids will have a place to go after school instead of hanging out on the street corners. It ensures that violent crimes against women get the individualized attention that they need and deserve. It gives states money to hire more cops and get better technology.  Today our challenge is to keep our focus and to stay vigilant against violent crime. This is one modest step toward meeting that challenge.  This Act shares bipartisan support. No one wants crime and no one wants to raise taxes. Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike--this should be an easy one for all of us. In July of last year, during debate on the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, my friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, declared his commitment to get the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund re-authorized. Senator Gramm has always stepped up to the plate on this issue as well, and I commend them for their commitment to this program. As Senator Byrd aptly stated back in 1994 when we were first debating this, ``the war on crime is of such an overriding concern that, as in the past, the Committee on Appropriations must take extraordinary actions to confront the issue.'' That still rings true today. Although crime is down, we can not become complacent. We must continue the fight. We need this Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund more than any other single piece of legislation.  Every member of the Senate is against violent crime--we all say it in speech after speech. Now, I urge all my colleagues to back up their words and follow through on their commitments to defeat violent crime. Pass this bill. Continue the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund. Take serious action against violent crime. Show the criminals that we are serious about fighting crime. Show the American people that their safety is of the highest priority for us and that we are taking action.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2049       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
