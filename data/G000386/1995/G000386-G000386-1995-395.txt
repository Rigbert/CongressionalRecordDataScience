 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reform America's Federal Civil Justice System. The purpose of this bill, the Civil Justice Reform Act of 1995, is to [[Page S1208]] improve deserving parties' access to the Federal courts by reducing the volume of frivolous cases, to reduce the costs of Federal civil litigation, and to encourage the settlement of disputes. It is similar to the bill introduced by Senator DeConcini and myself in March 1993.  This bill introduces some modest reforms that will reduce the economic and social costs our society has borne due to the litigation explosion. Our society spends billions of dollars every year on civil lawsuits. More than $1 billion goes just to pay for the Federal district courts, which handle hundreds of thousands of civil cases annually. It has become clear to most Americans that our system of dispute resolution through adversarial lawsuits has gotten out of hand, and reason needs to be restored to it. More litigation does not necessarily translate into more justice.  Many of the elements of this bill are based on the 1992 Access to Justice Act. For example, my bill reintroduces a modified English rule on attorney's fees that will award prevailing parties in Federal diversity cases reasonable attorney's fees, with adequate safeguards to protect against possible injustice. This provision is hardly the radical proposition some will paint it as being. In fact, for those of my colleagues who are always fond of pointing out that the United States is the only industrialized country that fails to provide some benefit or another, I would point out that this so-called English rule is followed by most industrialized countries, with the United States being the most notable exception. So I think it is worth trying in the United States in a limited class of cases--diversity suits--in order to see if it is effective in discouraging frivolous lawsuits.  By limiting the rule to diversity cases, the bill ensures that no one will be denied a forum for their dispute, since all such cases can be filed in State court. If the defendant removes the case to Federal court, then the loser pays rule will not apply. This limited English rule will expire in 5 years unless Congress chooses to continue it, after a fourth-year report by the administrative office of the courts on the effectiveness of the rule.  The bill also includes a number of safeguards to avoid any unintended consequences. The amount the loser must pay is limited to the amount of his or her own fees. Moreover, the court is given broad discretion to limit the amount the loser must pay if it finds such payment to be unjust under the circumstances of the case before it.  The bill also requires 30 days advance notice of intent to sue--something most responsible lawyers already do. It also requires prisoners with civil rights cases--which currently constitute of around 10 percent of the Federal civil docket--to first exhaust their administrative remedies before filing suit in Federal court.  To promote early settlement of cases and reduce litigation costs, the bill contains a statutory offer of judgment rule. It is similar to a proposal by Judge William Schwartzer, former director of the Federal Judicial Center. This rule will allow either party to a lawsuit to offer a settlement to the other party at any point in the litigation. If the settlement is declining and the party rejecting the offer ultimately gets a judgment less favorable than the settlement offer, he or she is then responsible for the offeror's attorneys fees from the time the offer was made. This will give parties a strong incentive to offer and accept reasonable settlements.  Another provision of my bill will begin to curtail some of the excesses of the expert witness battles that dominate too many Federal trials. Following the example of several States, particularly Arizona, my bill will limit parties to one expert witness on a given issue.  The Civil Justice Reform Act of 1990 has had a positive effect on the Federal courts in reforming pretrial, processes to reduce costs and delay. This bill takes the next step by making some limited fee shifting proposals and a few other modest reforms for reducing litigation costs. I look forward to the hearings I intend to hold in the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and Courts, and to discussing these proposals with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, as well as the full Senate.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 243       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Justice Reform Act of      1995''.     SEC. 2.

(a) Award of Fees.--Section 1332 of title 28, United States      Code, is amended by inserting after subsection (e) the      following new subsection:       ``(f)(1) The prevailing party in an action under this      section shall be entitled to attorneys' fees only to the      extent that such party prevails on any position or claim      advanced during the action. Attorneys' fees under this      paragraph shall be paid by the nonprevailing party but shall      not exceed the amount of the attorneys' fees of the      nonprevailing party with regard to such position or claim. If      the nonprevailing party receives services under a contingent      fee agreement, the amount of attorneys' fees under this      paragraph shall not exceed the reasonable value of those      services.       ``(2) In order to receive attorneys' fees under paragraph      (1), counsel of record in any actions under this section      shall maintain accurate, complete records of hours worked on      the matter regardless of the fee arrangement with his or her      client.       ``(3) The court may, in its discretion, limit the fees      recovered under paragraph (1) to the extent that the court      finds special circumstances that make payment of such fees      unjust.       ``(4) This subsection shall not apply to any action removed      from a State court under section 1441 of this title, or to      any action in which the United States, any State, or any      agency, officer, or employee of the United States or any      State is a party.       ``(5) As used in this subsection, the term `prevailing      party' means a party to an action who obtains a favorable      final judgment (other than by settlement), exclusive of      interest, on all or a portion of the claims asserted in the      action.''.       (b) Study and Report.--(1) The Director of the      Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall      conduct a study regarding the effect of the requirements of      subsection (f) of section 1332 of title 28, United States      Code, as added by subsection (a) of this section, on the      caseload of actions brought under such section, which study      shall include--       (A) data on the number of actions, within each judicial      district, in which the nonprevailing party was required to      pay the attorneys' fees of the prevailing party; and       (B) an assessment of the deterrent effect of the      requirements on frivolous or meritless actions.       (2) No later than 4 years after the date of enactment of      this Act, the Director of the Administrative Office of the      United States Courts shall submit a report to the appropriate      committees of Congress containing--       (A) the results of the study described in paragraph (1);      and       (B) recommendations regarding whether the requirements      should be continued or applied with respect to additional      actions.       (c) Repeal.--No later than 5 years after the date of      enactment of this Act, this section and the amendment made by      this section shall be repealed.     SEC. 3. OFFER OF JUDGMENT.
