Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a recent achievement of two people who, in celebrating their 50th year of marriage, have provided an inspiring example to all Americans. On June 5, 1954 at Holy Family Church, South Buffalo, New York sweethearts Gordon Elwell married Mary Mattimore. With not much more at the beginning to call their own except their marriage, their faith and vast opportunities afforded by this great country, Gordon and Mary have come a long way in the 50 years of marriage.  Gordon became a respected house builder in the Buffalo, New York area. Mary ran the household and tirelessly provided a loving and nurturing home environment for her husband and eight children. Throughout their incredible life together, Gordon and Mary have dedicated their lives to each other, their and children and grandchildren. To date they have been blessed with twelve grandchildren to spoil as only grandparents can.  In a society with one of the highest divorce rates in the world, Gordon and Mary have provided their children and grandchildren with a shining example of a successful marriage. It is all about hard work, a sense of humor and yes, a love that will not quit. Gordon and Mary have been truly blessed by the first 50 years of this magical marriage, and here's hoping that the best is yet to come. On behalf of my colleagues, let me join the many friends and admirers in wishing Gordon and Mary, and their family, all good fortune during the next 50 years.                          ____________________
