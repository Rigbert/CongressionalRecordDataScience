 Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 406       Whereas, in the case of United States v. Ahmed      Alahmedalabdaloklah, No. CR-12-01263-001-PHX-ROS, pending in      the United States District Court for the District of Arizona,      the defendant has issued a subpoena for testimony and      documents to Senator Lindsey Graham;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)      and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to      represent Members of the Senate with respect to any subpoena,      order, or request for testimony or documents relating to      their official responsibilities;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;      and       Whereas, by Rule VI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      Senator shall absent himself from the service of the Senate      without leave: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent Senator Lindsey Graham in this matter.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena from the defendant in a criminal case pending in Arizona Federal court. The defendant is charged with various crimes alleging his assistance to an Iraqi insurgent group by supplying parts for use in improvised explosive devices. The defendant issued a trial subpoena to Senator Graham for testimony and documents arising out of his Senate duties. As any information Senator Graham would have in this matter would have been acquired as part of his legislative duties, the information sought would be privileged under the Speech or Debate Clause. This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Graham and move to quash the subpoena.                          ____________________
