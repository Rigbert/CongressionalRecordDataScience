Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I do so reluctantly, although my good friend, the gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Romero-Barcelo), and I have been working very close.  But I thought about this after the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) testified before the committee, and I tried to put myself in place of a young man or young woman who had to, either for economical reasons or other reasons, had to go to the United States, because they are citizens now by statute, had to go to the United States to get employment and to work.                              {time}  1730  This is a very serious system where we may set forth here an independent nation. I would like to know, I would like to participate, because I am still a citizen of Puerto Rico although I have gone to the United States. I would like to know if it becomes a State then everything is equal, or it remains the original commonwealth that it is now.  But more than that we have to understand, these persons have a role to play because they were born on the island. They were born on the island. Keep that in mind. They had not left the island other than for economic reasons or for family, but they were born on the island.  I will not support grandchildren, aunts, uncles and all the rest of them because they are citizens of the United States, because they were born here, in the United States. But I think it is imperative that we allow that individual who for some reason had to leave the island, as beautiful as it is, and now he is being asked to not make a decision, not participate in a decision that will affect his or her life.  After many hours of debate and discussion with myself, and that sometimes gets awful boring, I decided in favor of the Serrano amendment. I want to compliment him for offering it. I am going to urge the gentleman from Puerto Rico who has been the horse in this whole program to be very careful in what he offers, and if he offers something, to please not ask for a vote on it. Because what will happen in the long run, people are going to be tired, and we never know what might happen.  Let us say we do what is correct for the Puerto Rican people today. Although we can voice our opinion, let us keep this to the minimum of mechanical efforts to make sure this bill comes to fruition and a vote tonight.
