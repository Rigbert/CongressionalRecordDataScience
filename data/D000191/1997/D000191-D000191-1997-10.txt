  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the defeat of fast track trade authority earlier this week could perhaps mark a turning point for new trade policy in this country, a trade policy finally in the favor of the vast majority of Americans as opposed to a few multinational corporations, and foreign interests have been doing so well with our failed trade policy. As my colleagues know, our trade policy has not changed one bit since World War II, not one bit.  Despite 50 years of dramatic changes in the world economy, we have gone from being the world's greatest creditor nation to the world's greatest debtor nation in international trade. We have seen our standard of living erode, we have lost our industrial base, and the defenders of the so-called free trade policy say, well, it is working exactly as we intended. Well, what do we intend; $160 billion trade deficit this year? Is that what we intend? Is that a success? No.  Fast track was the last gasp for the apologists for a failed and archaic trade policy. It is time for a new trade policy that brings prosperity to this country, projects our values in terms of the environment, projects our values in terms of worker safety and standard of living.  Once again, America should stand tall and lead the world to a prosperity for all of us, not just a select few.                          ____________________
