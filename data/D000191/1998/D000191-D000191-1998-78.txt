Chairman, I reclaim my time and thank the gentleman. There are a plethora of ways that this could be fixed. The simplest way is by the insertion of the word ``operations'' which the chairman objected to. I am going to propose changing a number. That is one change in one number. That would fix the problem or any potential problem. If the chairman objects there, it could still be fixed in conference or with a technical correction later. That is correct. So clearly the revote, if it occurs, will be on whether or not the Members want to provide a $10 million subsidy to western cattle and ranching interests which I believe a clear majority stated yesterday they do not. That will be the vote that will be rated.   Request for Modification to Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. DeFazio  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the language of the original amendment be changed on line 2 to not more than $28,097,000.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The Clerk will report the modification.  The Clerk read as follows:  In the matter inserted in the Bass amendment providing for ``Limitation on Use of Funds'' strike ``$18,800,000'' and insert ``$28,000,000''.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Oregon?
