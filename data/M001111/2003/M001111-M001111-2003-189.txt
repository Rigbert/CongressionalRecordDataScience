 President, the Senate has just taken a step in the right direction to address the economic crisis that is facing many of our States and communities by adopting the Collins-Rockefeller amendment. But I think all of us know our States are facing a very severe crisis; in fact, the most severe economic crisis since the Second World War. Many of our State legislatures are facing cuts in health care, education, and even law enforcement.  Our States are facing deficits as high as $80 billion total, and we are very concerned because they are threatening to eliminate the health care coverage of more than 1.7 million Americans.  Today when health care is one of the most difficult decisions our State legislatures have to make, we need to take the next step so we do not lose more doctors, more hospitals; that patients do not see continuing increased costs to their health insurance; and we have Medicaid patients who are losing coverage.  My amendment takes the next critical step by providing $40 billion for the relief package. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
