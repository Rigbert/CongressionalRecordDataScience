Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  I want to tell the gentleman I am of two minds on the fact that we have removed from floor consideration the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act. Of two minds because I think all of us agree that the underlying bill was a bill that we should have passed today, indeed yesterday or the day before yesterday. It is an Act that tells our service people that we are sending into harm's way that we want to make sure that we can limit the financial consequences of that service to country, as much as we possibly can.  So I lament the fact that we have had that removed from the schedule. However, I say I am of two minds because I am pleased that it was removed because we added to that bill extraneous pieces of legislation, which in and of themselves individually may have been subject to worthy debate. There was some in there that I thought were not, but having said that, I would hope that when this bill is reported back that it can be presented in a form that all 435 of us can vote for, because 435 of us, in my opinion, are for it.  So, as I say, I am of two minds. I am sorry that it is delayed, but I am sure that it will come back, hopefully soon, and that we can pass it in the form that all of us support it, and I would ask the gentleman, in that vein, does the gentleman know if this bill will be coming back next week?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
