President, later today we are going to vote on the confirmation of David Barron, who has been nominated for a vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.  Yesterday, we were able to overcome the unjustified Republican filibuster of this extraordinary nominee. Now, I have had the privilege of serving longer in this body than any other Senator here. I have never seen so many filibusters of judicial nominees by any President, Republican or Democratic. In fact, Republicans filibustered the very first judge President Obama sent to this body, a judge who was strongly supported by the Senators from his State, one of whom was the most senior Republican in this body, the other a moderate Democrat. Fortunately, enough Senators joined together to overcome that filibuster.  David Barron is currently a professor at Harvard Law School. He is a nationally recognized expert in constitutional law and the separation of powers, administrative law, and federalism. He clerked on the U.S. Supreme Court for Justice John Paul Stevens. In fact, I recall that Justice Stevens had so much regard for him that he attended Mr. Barron's nomination hearing.  I am in full support of Mr. Barron's nomination. It is almost as if he was sent to central casting for who should be a court of appeals judge. I have not seen any judicial nominee with better qualifications by either a Republican or Democratic President.  Let me respond to some of the criticisms levied against him with respect to the so-called drone memos as well as allegations that he would not be an independent judge who adheres to the rule of law. I reject both of those criticisms.  Over the last few weeks, I have spoken extensively about the issue of the drone materials and would refer specifically to my statement of May 14 of this year. While Senators may disagree with the administration's policies regarding the use of drones for lethal counterterrorism operations--and I have raised concerns about some of those operations--it is important not to conflate the confirmation of David Barron with the disclosure of Justice Department memoranda over which he had no control. He wrote an analysis of the law. Others make the decision of what they will do.  Yesterday the Justice Department made the right decision by agreeing to publicly release the redacted version of the legal justification for the government's potential use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in counterterrorism operations. I welcome the administration's additional step toward greater transparency.  Incidentally, these materials have been available to all Senators in recent weeks. We have had them in the unredacted form in a secure room here in the Capitol. We did that so that nobody could claim: Well, if only I knew what was in those memos, I could make up my mind. Every single Senator has had an opportunity to read them before today's vote.  We have heard some Senators argue that the Justice Department legal analysis provides the government with a blank check to use lethal force against Americans in places such as Germany or Canada. Oh my God, talk about grasping at straws. We are dealing with reality here, not Alice in Wonderland. Such a claim is simply inaccurate, inconsistent with the understanding anybody would have reading these materials.  In any event, the Attorney General has confirmed that Anwar al-Awlaki is the only American who was specifically targeted and killed since 2009. Awlaki was a senior operational leader of all of Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, located in Yemen. He directed the failed attempt to blow up an airliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. He was continuing to plot attacks against the United States when he was killed, according to the Attorney General.  I am glad a number of Senators share my deep regard for the constitutional rights of Americans and have spoken about that on the floor. I hope that after Mr. Barron is confirmed, they will show they really believe what they have been saying by joining me and 21 other Senators in cosponsoring the USA FREEDOM Act to help restore America's constitutional and privacy rights.  Finally, both Mr. Barron and a long list of bipartisan supporters have forcefully refuted any indication that he views the role of a judge as that of a policymaker. In a response to a question from Senator Grassley, Mr. Barron stated the following under oath:       The judicial obligation is to set aside whatever personal      views one may have and to decide the particular case at      issue. A judge must base the decision in any case solely on      the facts and the law, while respectfully considering the      arguments of the litigants. I would take that obligation to      be an inexorable one, just as I felt obliged to set aside any      personal views I may have had in providing legal advice      within the executive branch while serving as the Acting      Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel      and as a career lawyer in that Office. I believe the best way      to ensure one honors that obligation is to immerse oneself      fully in the particular facts of the case and the law      relevant to it and then to apply the law faithfully to those      facts.  Mr. Barron's respect for the rule of law was recently reaffirmed by Stanford Law Professor Michael McConnell, a well-respected conservative scholar and former George W. Bush appointee to the Tenth Circuit. In a letter dated May 7, 2014 in support of Mr. Barron's nomination, Professor McConnell stated:       I suspect that on particular controversial issues, Barron      and I disagree more often than not. But I have read much of      his academic work, and followed his performance as acting      head of the Office of Legal Counsel. In my opinion, his      writings and opinions have demonstrated not only intelligence      (even where we disagree) but respect for the rule of law. In      the Office of Legal Counsel, whose functions closely resemble      those of a judge, Barron's publicly released opinions      indicated that he was consistently a force for legal      regularity and respect for the constitution and laws of the      United States. That is an important and precious thing.  I ask unanimous consent that Professor McConnell's letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  It should be clear from Mr. Barron's testimony and Professor McConnell's letter that David Barron would faithfully discharge his duty as a judge in a manner consistent with the Constitution. Senator Grassley cited yesterday to some statements made by Mr. Barron in his academic writings, but as Professor McConnell noted in his letter:       It is important to bear in mind that academic legal writing      in constitutional law is often exploratory and provocative.      No one should assume that an academic would take the same      approach toward deciding cases that he does in writing about      cases.  Professor McConnell should know, as he is a prolific academic who was similarly able to discharge his duty as a judge faithfully and consistently with the Constitution when he served on the bench. As a reminder to Republicans who are currently opposing Mr. Barron's nomination on these grounds, I will note that the Senate unanimously confirmed Professor McConnell's nomination to the Tenth Circuit by voice vote in 2002 during the George W. Bush administration.  Mr. Barron is truly an outstanding nominee. So outstanding, in fact, that Professor McConnell called him ``one of President Obama's two or three best nominations to the appellate courts.'' I would urge all Senators to vote to confirm Mr. Barron to the First Circuit.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Stanford Law School,                                                      May 7, 2014.     Hon. Senator Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Senator Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Senator Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Re Letter of support for David Barron.       Dear Senators Reid, McConnell, Leahy, and Grassley: I do      not often interject myself into the politics of judicial      confirmations, but in the case of David Barron I make an      exception. In my opinion, David Barron is one of President      Obama's two or three best nominations to the appellate      courts. Based on his scholarship and record of public      service, he has the potential to be one of this nation's      outstanding jurists.       It should be obvious that my assessment does not stem from      political agreement. Barron has described himself as an      advocate of ``progressive constitutionalism''; I believe the      Constitution should be interpreted without a partisan lens,      in terms of the principles reflected in its text and history.      I suspect that on particular controversial issues, Barron and      I disagree more often than not. But I have read much of his      academic work, and followed his performance as acting head of      the Office of Legal Counsel. In my opinion, his writings and      opinions have demonstrated not only intelligence (even where      we disagree) but respect for the rule of law. In the Office      of Legal Counsel, whose functions closely resemble those of a      judge, Barron's publicly released opinions indicated that he      was consistently a force for legal regularity and respect for      the constitution and laws of the United States. That is an      important and precious thing.       Some groups have been described Barron as ``an unabashed      proponent of judicial activism.'' That characterization,      frankly, demonstrates a lack of familiarity with the tone of      much academic debate over constitutional issues. Within that      framework, Barron stands out as an advocate of lawyerly      restraint. It is important to bear in mind that academic      legal writing in constitutional law is often exploratory and      provocative. No one should assume that an academic would take      the same approach toward deciding cases that he does in      writing about cases.       In ordinary times, Barron's legal ability and professional      integrity would suffice to ensure his confirmation. But      unfortunately, in recent decades, and especially during      President George W. Bush's presidency, the opposition party      has taken a more ideological and adversarial posture toward      judicial nominations than the framers of our Constitution      intended. It is understandable that Republicans today would      apply the same adversarial standards to President Obama's      nominations as the Democrats applied to exemplary nominees of      his predecessor. It is my hope that eventually, this process      of mutually assured destruction will pass, for nominees of      both parties. That cannot be expected to occur without mutual      accommodation and confidence that the same standards apply to      nominees from both sides.       Nonetheless, David Barron's nomination should be supported      by Senators of both parties. Perhaps the most significant      constitutional questions of our time arise from the      unilateral use of executive power in both the domestic and      international arenas. David Barron has written powerfully on      this subject, demonstrating a balance between the need for an      energetic executive and the centrality of law and the      legislative branch. He has supported efforts to adopt laws to      enable judicial review of executive actions that might      otherwise escape judicial review because of lack of standing,      and has written powerfully about the need for constitutional      limits on executive excesses.       Some may wonder whether Barron's defense of separation of      powers against executive unilateralism, which he articulated      in the context of the Bush presidency, will survive intact in      a presidency he supports. That is a legitimate question. No      one knows the answer. But speaking as a fellow legal academic      and sometime nominee, I believe that David Barron is a      straight shooter and will not trim the sails of his deep-felt      constitutional convictions on account of the different      direction of political winds. One of this nation's proudest      claims is that the limitations of constitutionalism hold firm      without regard to which party is in power. I believe David      Barron will carry on that tradition.       Beyond generalizations about judicial philosophy, this      nomination has encountered resistance because of Barron's      authorship of opinions in the Office of Legal Counsel      justifying drone attacks by American forces on specified      individuals abroad. The Administration's public legal defense      of these strikes, especially by Attorney General Eric Holder,      have been less than convincing as a legal matter. It is      important for Congress to consider the legality of these      strikes, but I strongly urge that Barron's nomination to the      First Circuit not be collateral damage to this debate.       The pertinent question for this nomination cannot be      whether any Senator agrees or disagrees with the practice of      drone strikes. Barron was not Commander in Chief and he did      not order the strikes. He has not been nominated to a      position with authority over drone strikes, so his view of      those strikes is relevant only to the more general question      of his suitability to be an appellate judge on a court of      broad jurisdiction. His job as acting head of the Office of      Legal Counsel was to advise the President based on the      traditional legal authorities of text, history, and      precedent. He must be evaluated in light of that role.       Of course, neither I nor anyone else can evaluate the legal      arguments made in Barron's OLC opinions until they are      released. But whatever their content, it is difficult to      imagine that they would place Barron outside the mainstream      of professional legal judgment. The question of drone strikes      is novel and much debated, and the authoritative legal      sources are scant. It is far from clear that the Due Process      Clause even applies to military attacks on targets in places      abroad where American law does not run. If it does, it is      equally unclear what kind of process is required when split-     second decisions are made that could save countless innocent      lives. These are discussions that should occur in the proper      place, but a judicial nomination is not the forum for their      resolution.       Ultimately, this confirmation requires a judgment about      judicial character. The most important characteristic of a      great judge is not brainpower or empathy, but the willingness      to apply rules of law dispassionately and unflinchingly to      all cases, regardless of the political context. My sense from      long conversations with David Barron, and review of his      writings and legal opinions, is that he is such a person. I      urge members of the Senate to give their advice and consent.           Best regards,                                             Michael W. McConnell.
