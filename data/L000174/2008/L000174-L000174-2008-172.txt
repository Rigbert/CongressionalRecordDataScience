President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, Wednesday, June 18; that following the prayer and the pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 6049, the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. I further ask that at 2:30 p.m., there be 2 hours for morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders, or their designees, with the majority controlling the first hour and the Republicans controlling the next hour.
