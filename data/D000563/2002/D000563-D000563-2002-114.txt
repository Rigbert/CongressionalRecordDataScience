 This chart, which I have brought to the floor, talks about the lost private sector jobs in the last 50 years. Look at what has occurred under President Eisenhower through George W. Bush. Look at the only period that shows red ink, the net loss of jobs; and it turns out to be under President Bush.  The people of Illinois talk about Iraq because it is in the headlines. That is all the media talks about. But when it comes to the issues they worry about, this is what they are concerned about. There are not enough jobs, not enough good-paying jobs.  Unfortunately, under this administration, the economy is not even a major issue. They are ignoring it. I asked last week--and I will renew my request to the President--can you give us 1 hour a week on America's economy, 1 hour to talk about income and job security? That is a valid issue.  Take a look at long-term unemployment. It has more than doubled under President Bush. In January 2001, when he came to office, there were 648,000 under long-term unemployment, people unemployed for half a year. That number has more than doubled in this period of time. The President may rally America to stand behind him, as he should, on the war on terrorism and foreign policy. But he ought to rally America to work, give people opportunities so they can be employed, so they have some opportunity to enjoy the benefits of this country.  We are facing now the weakest economic growth in 50 years. This chart shows economic growth, the average rate of growth over the last 2 years. Under President George W. Bush, it has been 1.0 percent. The next worst President, since Eisenhower, was his father. Then you have to go back to Gerald Ford to find another bad period of time.                          ____________________
