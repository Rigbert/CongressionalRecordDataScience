Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mr. Leon Lynch on his retirement from the position as United Steel Workers of America Vice President of Human Affairs. Leon has spent nearly 40 years dedicating his life to the interests of the USWA and many social and political organizations throughout the country. His career at the USWA has allowed him the opportunity to touch the lives of numerous people. In honor of his gracious service to the USWA, there will be a celebration of his accomplishments on Friday, October 28, 2005, at the Genesis Convention Center in Gary, IN.  Leon Lynch has accomplished many visionary goals throughout his career. Leon joined USWA Local 1011 in 1956 at the Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company Mill in East Chicago, Indiana. He has served on many local committees and was President of the YS&T Federal Credit Union. In 1968 Leon was named a staff representative and an International Representative in 1973. In 1994, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation. In 1995, Leon was elected to the AFL-CIO Executive Council, and in December of 2000, President Clinton appointed Leon to the Air Traffic Service Board of the Federal Aviation Administration.  Not only has Leon had many positive accomplishments throughout his career at the USWA, he has also actively contributed to his community through participation in various programs aimed at improving opportunities for people. Leon is a member of the executive committee of the Democratic National Committee, Chairman of the A. Philip Randolph Institute, President of the Workers Defense League, a board member of the National Endowment for Democracy, and a member of the Labor Roundtable of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators.  Leon has served six terms as the USWA's International Vice President for Human Affairs. He was appointed to that post when it was created by the USWA's 18th Constitutional Convention in 1976. As Vice President, he oversees the USWA's civil rights and human rights efforts. He chairs the Container Industry Conference and handles the negotiations for Rexam, Crown Cork & Seal, and Silgan Containers. He also chairs the Public Employees Conference, International Constitution Committee, and the Steelworkers Health and Welfare Fund.  Leon's family and friends should be proud of his efforts, as his leadership has served as a beacon of hope throughout the country. Leon's longstanding commitment to improving the quality of life for Steelworkers is truly inspirational and should be commended. Our community has certainly been rewarded by the true service, uncompromising dedication and loyalty displayed by Leon Lynch.  Mr. Speaker, Leon Lynch has given his time and efforts selflessly to the members of the USWA throughout his years of service. He has taught every member of the USWA the true meaning of service. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. Leon Lynch for his outstanding contributions. I am proud to commend him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2179]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                   CONGRATULATIONS TO MR.
