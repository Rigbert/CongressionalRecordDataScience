 I want to make it clear to my colleagues, I am more than willing to accommodate on the remainder of the time. As I understand it, there are about 42 minutes left on this amendment. I do not need all that time. I am more than happy to reduce it equally on both sides and allocate the remaining time on this amendment, any time left before the Senate, among the Members. And I hope that there is no objection to that. But if there is such an objection, I have no other recourse but to proceed on this amendment. And I now have the floor.  I yield for the purpose of a question to the Senator from Oklahoma.
