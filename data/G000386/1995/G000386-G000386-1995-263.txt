 President, there are two starkly different budgets before us that would move this country in opposite directions. First, there is the Republican budget now before this body. That budget offers a vision for the future. Under that plan the deficit would slowly decline until it would disappear in 2002. It is the only budget with a vision and a future. It would balance present-day needs with long-term needs for seniors, for children, for the needy, and for the taxpayer.  There is another budget before us, Mr. President. It is the President's budget. And his budget moves in the opposite direction. Under his vision of the future, deficits would rise as far as the eye can see. His direction would be devastating to our children and grandchildren, and to America's future. It would saddle future generations with an additional $1.7 trillion in debt over the next 5 years.  I have not seen a more irresponsible budget proposed by a President since the Rose Garden budget proposed by President Reagan in 1984. That budget did nothing to attack the deficit. This one does even less.  The President's budget submission represents an abdication of leadership by the President. At a time when he could have carried fiscal responsibility across the goal line, he punted. He took a walk. He decided to play Pontius Pilate and wash his hands of the matter.  Mr. President, I hope this budget is soundly defeated. This body has to send the message that the direction taken by this President in his budget is unacceptable. It represents abdication, retreat, and failed leadership. It represents the triumph of business-as-usual over vision. I urge its defeat.
