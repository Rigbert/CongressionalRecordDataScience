Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution does one thing, and that is it tells a suburb of Paris to butt out in terms of making a statement relative to how the criminal justice system processed the case of the murder of Officer Faulkner.  This is not an issue of whether or not the Federal Government or any of the States should have the death penalty, and I come from a noncapital punishment State. Whether or not a State has the death penalty is a decision that is to be made by their elected representatives. The elected representatives of my State since 1853 have chosen not to impose capital punishment.  But in this case the death sentence was reversed in 2001, so that is a settled issue. Mumia Abu-Jamal is not going to be put to death.  Now 5 years after this happens, the city of St. Denis decides to name a street after a convicted cop killer. I would like to know what the French would think if we started naming streets anywhere in the United States for people who had been convicted of murdering their police officers. I think they would tell us it is none of our business, and they would be right.  What this resolution says is that the city of St. Denis should not decide to honor and glorify somebody that a jury of 12 unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt said murdered Officer Faulkner. That is all the resolution says. I think that in terms of saying that we Americans can solve our problems within our own constitutional system, we ought to be allowed to do so without some foreign country glorifying a person who has been convicted not only of first degree murder, but first degree murder against a public safety officer whose sworn duty it was to protect the citizens of our country. This resolution should be approved. I ask for a ``yes'' vote.
