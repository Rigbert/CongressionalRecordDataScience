 Hatch, Ms. Baldwin, and Mr. Enzi) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 632       Whereas investment in the education, training, and career      advancement of the workforce in the United States, known as      ``workforce development'', is crucial to the ability of the      United States to compete in the global economy;       Whereas collaboration among Governors, local governments,      State and local education, workforce, and human services      agencies, community colleges, local businesses, employment      service providers, community-based organizations, and      workforce development boards provides for long-term,      sustainable, and successful workforce development across      traditional sectors and emerging industries;       Whereas middle-skill jobs, which require more than a high      school diploma but not a 4-year degree, comprise 53 percent      of the labor market, but only 43 percent of workers in the      United States are trained at that level, creating a      discrepancy that may limit growth in changing industries such      as health care, manufacturing, and information technology;       Whereas, in 2014, Congress reauthorized the Workforce      Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) with      overwhelming bipartisan support in recognition of the need to      strengthen the focus of the United States on the skills      necessary to fill jobs in local and regional industries;       Whereas the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29      U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) supports employment, training, and      support services for individuals with barriers to employment,      including--       (1) individuals who are low-income;       (2) individuals who are out of work;       (3) individuals displaced by outsourcing;       (4) individuals looking to learn new skills; and       (5) individuals with disabilities;       Whereas the more than 550 workforce development boards and      2,500 American Job Centers are a driving force behind growing      regional economies by providing training, resources, and      assistance to workers who aim to compete in the 21st century      economy;       Whereas ongoing State and local implementation of the      Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et      seq.) provides unprecedented opportunities to develop the      skills of workers in the United States through access to      effective workforce education and training, including the      development and delivery of proven strategies such as sector      partnerships, career pathways, integrated education and      training, work-based learning models, and paid internships;       Whereas, in 2016, programs authorized under the Workforce      Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.)--       (1) served more than 7,000,000 young people and adults;       (2) exceeded employment targets across all programs; and       (3) helped more than 1,300,000 individuals, including      English language learners, gain skills and credentials to      help the individuals succeed in the labor market;       Whereas State programs established under the Wagner-Peyser      Act (29 U.S.C. 49 et seq.)--       (1) ensured that more than 5,400,000 unemployed workers,      including more than 800,000 veterans, had access to career      services through American Job Centers in 2016; and       (2) are a foundational part of the workforce development      system;       Whereas workforce development programs will play a critical      role in addressing the expected 2,000,000 unfilled      manufacturing jobs over the next decade;       Whereas community colleges and other workforce development      training providers across the United States are well-     situated--       (1) to train the next generation of workers in the United      States; and       (2) to address the educational challenges created by      emerging industries and technological advancements;       Whereas participation in a career and technical education      (referred to in this preamble as ``CTE'') program decreases      the risk of students dropping out of high school, and all 50      States and the District of Columbia report higher graduation      rates for CTE students, as compared to other students;       Whereas community and technical colleges operate as open      access institutions serving millions of students annually at      a comparatively low cost;       Whereas the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education      Act of 2006 (20 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.) supports the development      and implementation of high-quality CTE programs that--       (1) combine rigorous academic content with occupational      skills; and       (2) served approximately 11,000,000 high school and college      students from 2016 to 2017;       Whereas there are more than 500,000 registered apprentices      in the United States, and there is growing and bipartisan      support for expanding earn-and-learn strategies to help      current and future workers gain skills and work experience;       Whereas the federally supported workforce system and      partner programs--       (1) have helped rebuild the economy of the United States      and provide increased economic opportunities; and       (2) provide a pathway into jobs that support families while      ensuring that businesses in the United States find the      skilled workforce needed to compete in the global economy;      and       Whereas workforce development is crucial to sustaining      economic security for workers in the United States: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates September 2018 as ``National Workforce      Development Month'';       (2) supports Federal initiatives to promote workforce      development; and       (3) acknowledges that workforce development plays a crucial      role in supporting workers and growing the economy.
