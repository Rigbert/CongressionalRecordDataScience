 For 36 years, the citizens of the City of Bowie, Prince George's County, and the State of Maryland have benefited from John's skill as an editor, insight as a writer, and dedication to the community that he has served for so long.  Many in Bowie recognize John by his long association with the Editor's View column he writes for the paper. Through this column and other writings, John has earned distinction for his thoughtful, objective style of journalism that has helped drive the Bowie Blade-News to significant acclaim.  After serving in the Air Force during the Vietnam era, John joined the Bowie News as editor in 1971 and became the editor and general manager of the new Bowie-Blade News in 1978 when the Bowie News merged with the Bowie Blade.  Madam Speaker, under John's leadership, the Bowie-Blade News has earned numerous recognitions, among them the Newspaper of the Year award in 1999 from the SEQ Chapter of the Maryland-Delaware-District of Columbia Press Association. The paper has also won the Best in Show award for several investigative pieces over the years as well as awards for newspaper design.  John has earned several accolades of his own for his individual achievements in the news industry, including first place awards for his Editor's View column. He has been a longtime member of the Society of Professional Journalists (Sigma Delta Chi). John is also a lifetime member of both the Disabled American Veterans and the American Legion.  During John's 36 years in Bowie, he has remained resolute in his commitment to truth and fairness as guiding journalistic principles. John has served as an effective watchdog of the public interest in his community, and for that alone, he should be lauded.  Among John's most admirable qualities is his keen sense of humor. Although sometimes the target of that humor, I recognize that John is an equal opportunity satirist who adeptly uses the power of the writer's pen to make sound and insightful observations. And while John and I have sometimes fallen on different sides of a debate, we have grown to be friends over the years, and hold each other in high mutual respect and esteem.  After all, Madam Speaker, we have both witnessed the City of Bowie's evolution into the vibrant and diverse community that John is proud to call home, and I am proud to represent in Congress. All the while, John has maintained an innate ability to keep his finger firmly pressed on the pulse of the community, knowing better than most what makes Bowie such a great place to work and live.  As a resident of Bowie, John has served with countless community organizations and played a pivotal role in the formation of the Bowie YMCA. For his work in the community, John has been honored by a number of civic groups, including the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Committee of Bowie, the Bowie Civic Affairs Committee, and the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission.  Madam Speaker, John's career is significant not only in years and accomplishments, but also for the impact he has had in the City of Bowie. For three and a half decades, he has dedicated himself to working for the interests of his fellow Bowie residents and the good of the community. In recognition of his retirement as editor of the Bowie Blade-News and a public life filled with distinction, I ask my colleagues to join with me in offering him ourcongratulations and wishing him the very best in his retirement.                          ____________________
