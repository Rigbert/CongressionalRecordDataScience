 President, I rise today to make a few remarks about the distinguished service of United States veterans. As Veterans Day approaches, we look forward to honoring the men and women who have served this country with bravery, honor, and valor. I am submitting, for my colleagues, a May 28, 1998 article from the Los Angeles Times written by Patty Andrews, one of the Andrews Sisters. The Andrews Sisters spent much of World War II entertaining the young men who fought so courageously in Europe, the Pacific, Africa, and other parts of the world. In this stirring piece, Ms. Andrews details the service and sacrifices of all of those who contributed to the war effort, and describes how she and her sisters helped to build morale and comforted the wounded.  The article follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 25, 1998]           Bugle Boys of Company B Died To Keep America Free                           (By Patty Andrews)       My sisters and I probably met face to face with more      soldiers in World War II than any general or field marshal.      The Andrews Sisters entertained tens of thousands of GIs at      bases here and abroad throughout the war and I can still see      so many of their smiling American faces. I sometimes wonder      how many of those faces made it home safely and how many are      now just faint memories. I'll carry their memory for as long      as I live. But then what? With nothing to publicly      commemorate those GIs, their deeds will be forgotten.       The faces of the survivors are now creased and seasoned by      the years--but they still smile when they see me. And I see      them all the time, in airports and shopping malls. The      veterans of global war are living their autumn years happily,      oblivious to the fact that they are walking history.       We have a common bond. We were all soldiers in the greatest      war ever. And we share a knowing wink--if you weren't there      you'd never understand the terror of total war or      exhilaration of saving the world from evil incarnate. I guess      I remind the veterans that it all really happened, that it      wasn't some hazy memory, that they answered the call and      succeeded beyond all expectation. They won a victory so      complete that we hardly remember a time when America wasn't a      superpower or the most prosperous nation on Earth or one of      the few remaining democracies standing against a global gang      of dictators. Today we take it all for granted.       Those who died to make it possible for us to forget that      brutal era would no doubt be satisfied that their sacrifice      was worth it. But they were so young. The soldiers who were      in their late teens and early 20s. So young that the shows      had the flavor of a huge high school football game or a Boy      Scout jamboree. Nearly half a million of these brave kids      would never know if we won or lost the war or how 50 years of      peace and prosperity would transform their country. Their      faces will always be innocent and brave, but unknowing.       My sisters and I were innocent too, but not for long. We      cheered the boys as they left for war but we also welcomed      back the wounded and shattered. Those are some of the faces I      will never forget. In one San Francisco hospital ward we were      briefed about what we were about to see, and we were told not      to show too much emotion. Behind the doors of that dire ward      were young faces contorted with pain or frozen and mute. The      sight of these boys--no different than the thousands of      others we entertained except that they had been chewed up and      spat out by the maw of war--brought home to me the absolute      horror of war and the enormity of our debt to them.       In that frightful infirmary we talked, sang and tried to do      something--anything--to bring a moment of pleasure, maybe a      smile or a look of hope that life will somehow be better. I      tried but could not begin to match their contribution. None      of us can ever fully repay those boys who sacrificed their      youth so we could forget such horror existed. But we need to      try.       Today, before the memories fade and before the last veteran      dies, we need to enshrine their courage. We need a permanent      place to honor the generation that gave so much so long ago.      We need a memorial that matches their monumental sacrifice      and their towering devotion to freedom. In short, we need an      official World War II Memorial on the National Mall in      Washington. The site has already been selected--all we need      now is the will to build it.       Helping to build morale and comfort the wounded through our      music changed and fulfilled my life, as it did the lives of      my sisters, Laverne and Maxene. We were privileged to know so      many courageous men and women willing to give their lives for      freedom. It's ironic that because of their sacrifice, we can      use words like ``freedom'' and ``democracy'' today without      having to measure their cost. We must honor those brave young      people who paid the price.                          ____________________
