President, after decades of committed service to the important cause of providing public housing for those in need, Paul Dettman is retiring this month as executive director of the Burlington Housing Authority.  Throughout Paul's career, he has worked tirelessly in the field of public service. Public housing has not been a fashionable cause for many years, and our communities have certainly seen the effects of this sometimes forgotten priority. Paul Dettman was never deterred by these attitudes, however, and has been dedicated to finding creative solutions to provide for our most vulnerable friends and neighbors.  Paul's leadership has resulted in a series of public-private partnerships and innovative initiatives have helped revitalize communities across the Green Mountain State. Before joining the Burlington Housing Authority as its executive director in November 1995, Paul served for many years with the Vermont State Housing Authority. It was here that Paul created the State's first lead hazard reduction program, which now stands as a model for providing families of all incomes with safe housing.  Since the beginning of Paul's tenure at Burlington Housing Authority 20 years ago, Vermont's oldest and largest municipally based housing authority, the organization has grown vastly in size and scope. The Burlington Housing Authority has taken on new development projects, improved homebuyer education, and negotiated critical agreements to prevent homelessness in recent years. Under Paul's direction, the Burlington Housing Authority has upheld a strong mission to support all residents, including refugees, those in transition, or in need of long-term supportive services.  Paul's commitment also resulted in a critical partnership with another local organization, Women Helping Battered Women, to create Sophie's Place. Together, these two organizations devised a plan to provide victims of domestic violence easier access to public housing subsidies so that they could move directly from violent homes into safe transitional housing. This solution simultaneously eased suffering, streamlined services, and saved money. This program now functions as a key component of the local economic justice and housing plans and serves as a model for valuable partnerships in my home State. This program is only one of many that I could provide as reference to Paul's great work in Burlington and beyond.  Like his many colleagues and friends, I know that the Burlington Housing Authority and the greater housing community will miss Paul's expertise, spirit, and compassion. Marcelle and I extend our best wishes as Paul begins his retirement after a long and distinguished career. I surely hope that Paul will take time to enjoy one of his greatest hobbies in the years ahead--sugarmaking among the sweet sugarbush.  Paul Dettman's standard of distinction should be an inspiration to others, just as it has been to the city of Burlington and the State of Vermont.  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
