A lifelong Michigan resident, Ron has dedicated himself to serving the people of southwest Michigan and improving the quality of life for all Michiganders.  After receiving his degrees from Michigan State University and Western Michigan University, Ron began his career as an educator in the River Valley School District, where he taught for three decades.  In 1996, Ron was first elected to the Michigan House of Representatives where he was popularly reelected to two additional terms. Ron was then elected to the Michigan State Senate in 2002. Throughout his 14 distinguished years in public office, Ron has been a leading champion of public education and Michigan agriculture.  Beyond the duties of elected office, Ron has proven himself to be a natural community servant. He serves as a member of the Berrien County Farm Bureau, the Three Oaks Free Methodist Church, the Michigan Coalition of Responsible Gun Owners, and the River Valley Engine Club. He also was a co-founder, officer, and volunteer for the Three Oaks Ambulance Service, and involved in Future Farmers of America, 4-H, and Girl Scouts.  Ron's leadership, knowledge, and compassion have made him an indispensible asset to the citizens of Berrien County and the State of Michigan. As Senator Ron Jelinek prepares for his retirement, he leaves both an example for future public servants and a legacy that will benefit southwest Michigan for years to come. I am truly honored to call Ron a colleague and friend.                          ____________________
