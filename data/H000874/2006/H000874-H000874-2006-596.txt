Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the outstanding 2005 National Championship Women's Field Hockey team at the University of Maryland. On Sunday, November 20 in Louisville, Kentucky, the Terrapins defeated Duke University 1-0 to capture the 2005 National Collegiate Athletic Association Championship crown. This year marks the Terrapins' fourth NCAA title overall and their first NCAA title in 6 years.  The University of Maryland Women's Field Hockey Program has achieved several significant honors this year. The Terps earned a No. 1 final ranking by the National Field Hockey Coaches Association. Five Terrapins were named All-Americans, while three were also named All-ACC. Nine team members were named to the Mid-Atlantic All-Region team. The Terrapin defense was ranked second in the Nation and the offense was among the top 15. Finally, the University of Maryland ended the season with a 23-2 record, the most wins since 1999, and recorded its fifth 20-win season in program history.  The coaches who have led the Field Hockey team to victory are Head Coach Missy Meharg, Assistant Coach Tjerk (T.J) van Herwaarden, Assistant Coach Marybeth Freeman, Assistant Coach Clemens Arnold, Trainer Sandy Worth, Assistant Trainer Joey Sierzega, and Strength & Conditioning Coach Barry Kagan. Also deserving recognition are Jim Knight with Equipment, Natalia Ciccone with Media, and Supervisor Troy Tucker.  These talented young athletes include the following University of Maryland students: Emily Beach, Kendall Beveridge, Jackie Ciconte, Kristina Edmonds, Megan Fox, Alica Grater, Paula Infante, Linzi Jones, Danielle Keeley, Meredith Long, Tiffany Marsh, Kathryn Masson, Katie Mockus, Ellen Ott, Louisa Powell, Lauren Powley, Christina Restivo, Susie Rowe, Sarah Scholl, Emily Trycinski, Janneke van Leeuwen, and Kim Ziegler. University of Maryland Athletics Director Debbie Yow was also essential to their success.  Mr. Speaker, collegiate athletics promote camaraderie, leadership, responsibility, and good health. They are a vibrant and essential component of American culture. I commend the University of Maryland's 2005 Field Hockey team and wish each of its members great success.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E2]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND WOMEN'S FIELD HOCKEY TEAM ON                    WINNING THE 2005 NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP                                 ______                                                           HON.
