 President, yesterday the House passed the 21st Century Cures bill with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I hope to see the same in the Senate. The medical innovation bill is one that can have a substantial impact for families across our country. It supports medical research, including promoting regenerative medicine. It provides real funding to help combat the prescription opioid epidemic that swept our Nation, particularly in places such as my home State of Kentucky. It improves mental health programs, among other bipartisan priorities.  I thank Senator Alexander, chairman of the HELP Committee, for his tireless work in driving this critical legislation forward. We should also thank Senator Hatch, who worked with our Finance colleagues on a significant number of Medicare provisions in the package to protect care for America's seniors. I would like to note the great work by Senator Cornyn and Senator Cassidy to incorporate key mental health reforms into the Cures legislation.  Let's work together to send it to the President's desk as soon as possible.                          ____________________
