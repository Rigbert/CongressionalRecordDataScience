 REID. In 1 second, I will.  Unless the two managers have some objection, I would hope we could have people offer amendments tonight. If their amendments requires votes, we will set those for as early in the morning as we can. It would be wonderful if we could finish this bill tomorrow. As I said early on, I don't want to file cloture on this bill. I don't want to. This is the first appropriations bill. We have to set an example of trying to move forward.  I have just been notified that I am asked to go to the White House with the Speaker on Wednesday to talk about appropriations bills. This would be something really important to talk to him about on Wednesday, and we may be able to get one of them done.  Unless somebody has an objection to my suggestion, I think we will have no more votes tonight.
