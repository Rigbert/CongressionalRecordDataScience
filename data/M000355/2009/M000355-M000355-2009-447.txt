 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dedicated philanthropist from my home State of Kentucky, Jerrilyn Dyer. Mrs. Dyer is well known in her community for her bright smile and comforting personality.  Mrs. Dyer has contributed countless hours to Kentucky through her volunteer work, including helping at the Pattie A. Clay Hospital Gift Shop and with the Home Meals Delivery service, helping to better the lives of so many over the years. In addition to her work in Kentucky, she was also well known for her volunteer work in Indiana particularly in Madison County.  Along with all her volunteer work, Jerrilyn is a dedicated wife, mother, and grandmother and finds time to travel with her husband of 49 years, Jack, and enjoys spending time with her two children and four grandchildren.  Recently, the Richmond Register in Richmond, Kentucky, published an article detailing Mrs. Dyer's service and accomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Congressional Record.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jerrilyn Dyer and her service to the Commonwealth.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Richmond Register, Mar. 28, 2009]               Jerrilyn Dyer: A Non-Stop Volunteer Force                          (By Ronica Shannon)       Jerrilyn Dyer, 67, and her husband Jack moved to Madison      County from central Indiana in 1967 when Jack accepted a      teaching position at the Eastern Kentucky University.       She has been an active part of the community in several      areas ever since. Jack began his doctoral studies and the      couple moved to Lexington in 1969, only to return to Richmond      in the fall of 1989.       The two graduated from high school in Spencer, Ind.      Jerrilyn graduated from Kentucky Christian College with a      teaching degree in 1989.       She refers to herself as `a late bloomer.' Jerrilyn is      involved with several volunteer organizations in the      community including Home Meals Delivery, which delivers      midday meals to homebound residents and hosts the annual      ``Empty Bowls Friday.''       She also is a member of the Madison County Republican      Women's Club, which is affiliated with the National      Federation of Republican Women. The organization supports the      Republican Party and Republican candidates.       ``I have served in many capacities for the party and worked      as a poll officer,'' she said. ``I feel strongly about voting      and each citizen's duty to do so. It's not only a      responsibility, but a privilege to participate in our      government. There's great satisfaction in helping make our      community environment a better place in which to live.       ``We need to continually support competent people in our      community leadership,'' she said.       No matter the circumstances, Jerrilyn always seems to have      a smile on her face and laughter in her voice. How does she      do it? Simple. She thrives at what she does.       ``I love volunteering time and effort to several causes,''      she said. ``It always blesses me more than what I give. Home      Meals Delivery, for instance, is a program started in 1980      when there was a need. It's not the federally funded program      started by the government, but is a locally endowed program      relying on volunteers. I have been involved with it for about      15 years since I first heard of it at a club meeting. I am      currently serving on the board.''       Jerrilyn also is a volunteer at the Pattie A. Clay Hospital      Gift Shop and has seen the expansion of the shop over the      years.       ``It's a lot of fun selling gift items and talking with all      the customers who many times just need a friendly listener,''      she said.       Proceeds from the shop benefit the hospital needs.       ``Just recently we were able to donate several thousand      dollars for the new East Wing Project,'' she said. ``I've      been a member of the Richmond Woman's Club for several years      and have participated with the ladies on several community      projects including Habitat for Humanity, New Opportunity      School for Women, The Salvation Army and (local) veterans      (organizations).''       Aside from volunteering, Jerrilyn also has worked as a      secretary for several businesses and organizations,      including: Westinghouse in Bloomington, Ind.; Indiana State      University and 8th Avenue Baptist Church and at Christian      Student Fellowship on the University of Kentucky Campus.       ``I've also done substitute teaching and been a teacher's      aide, and a merchandiser for Gibson Greetings,'' she said.       Jerrilyn and her husband will celebrate 49 years of      marriage this year. The two have a son who is a high school      basketball coach (honored as coach of the year in his      conference this year) and he teaches in Bristol, Tenn. Their      daughter has taught special education for years and is a      teacher consultant for six counties, including Shelby County,      where she is a resident.       ``We have four adorable grandchildren--two girls and two      boys,'' she said ``It is truly great being grandparents.''       She and her husband enjoy traveling and have made it all      over the United States.       Throughout the years, she and her husband have visited all      50 states, all the presidential libraries, all 30 Major      League Baseball parks and all the Kentucky state resort      parks.       They also spend a lot of time shopping for their      grandchildren and playing cards with friends, she said.       The church also plays a large role in the Dyers' life.       She and her husband have been active members of Gardenside      Christian Church in Lexington, where their children grew up.       ``Over the years we've been Sunday School teachers, youth      sponsors, Bible School leaders, etc.'' Jerrilyn said.      ``Currently, we're on the Missions and Benevolence Committees      and members of a Sunday School Class. I've served in a      Women's Circle and Jack is on the board as an elder and      deacon.''       So why is volunteering in her community so important to      Jerrilyn? ``There is much to be said for volunteering in a      community,'' she said. ``It can promote so much good will      among the citizens and can give a special spirit of unity and      pride. Volunteers can get so many projects done that      otherwise wouldn't be possible using only its paid staff.      And, of course, the volunteer probably gets back more than he      or she gives.''                          ____________________
