When human tragedy falls at your knees, do you look away, or do you stoop to pick up the pieces and ask why? Why?  May God bless America. May the campaigns of 2012 be conducted in a manner that brings credit to our Nation's highest aspirations, mindful of the suffering that has occurred. And may God give America and her leaders and her people great wisdom in the days ahead.
