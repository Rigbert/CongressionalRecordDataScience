Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to follow on the comments on Freedom to Farm of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Boyd), my good colleague from the subcommittee, and just set the record straight here. We are now spending more money to prop up rural America in this country than we ever did prior to Freedom to Farm. It is into the multibillions. In the year of 1999, in the regular appropriation and the supplemental, over $7 billion.
