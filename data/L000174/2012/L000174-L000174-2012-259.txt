President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator Grassley, in introducing legislation that will permanently authorize four expiring immigration programs. I thank Senator Grassley for working with me on this needed legislation.  The bill we introduce will permanently authorize the EB 5 Regional Center Program, the voluntary E-Verify electronic work authorization program, the State 30 J 1 Visa program that Senator Conrad champions and the Special Immigrant Nonminister Religious Worker Program that is so important to Senator Hatch. All of these programs have been in temporary status for many years, and the time has come for Congress to make them permanent so that the proponents of these programs can get to work building upon the benefits these programs bring to communities across the country. Permanency for these programs will strengthen our economy, create jobs, and enhance the security of American workers. Permanency will help medically underserved areas obtain talented physicians and religious institutions welcome individuals from around the world to participate in good works. These programs serve diverse and important interests in America, and should become permanent fixtures in our immigration law.  I am particularly pleased that the EB 5 Regional Center Program is a part of this package. With permanency, I believe this program can become an even greater economic driver than it has been in communities across the United States. Making the program permanent will also create a solid foundation for me and others interested in its success to begin in earnest to make improvements and reforms that will make it more business friendly, more predictable and stable for investors, and will provide U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services with the tools it needs to ensure that the program meets the highest standards of quality and integrity. There is little reason that this program should not continue to improve as a deficit-neutral source of capital investment and job creation across America.  I hope our introduction of this legislation today is the beginning of a strong bipartisan effort to make these programs permanent. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and others to accomplish this goal.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3245       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
