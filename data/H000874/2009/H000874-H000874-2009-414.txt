 On Monday, the House is not in session. Monday is the Federal holiday to celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. I might observe, as I am sure all the Members know, that today is in fact Martin Luther King's birthday, January 15. Extraordinary life. His bust is in the Rotunda. It is a real honor to be able to honor his birth and his message and his vision on Monday.  This is a particularly auspicious recognition of the life of Martin Luther King, Jr. How proud he would be to know that the day after we recognize his birth and his message and his contribution to our country, we will inaugurate the 44th President of the United States of America, an African American; a statement that the dream, although not clearly still fully recognized, nevertheless is a dream shared by all of America.  On Wednesday, Madam Speaker, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for legislative business with votes no earlier than 3 p.m. Let me reiterate that. We will be meeting on Wednesday at 12 p.m., with votes not expected before 3 p.m. Obviously, with the inaugural day, we don't want to have people have to come in too early, not necessarily because of anything they may be doing the night before, but because of scheduling they may or may not be here the night before.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for legislative business. On Friday, no votes are expected.  We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. A complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of business tomorrow.  In addition, Madam Speaker, we will complete consideration of H.R. 384, the bill we were just considering, the TARP Reform and Accountability Act, we expect to complete. We also expect to consider a privileged resolution relating to the disapproval of the obligations under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
