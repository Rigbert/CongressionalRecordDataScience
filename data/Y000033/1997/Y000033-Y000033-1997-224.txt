Reclaiming my time, we cannot say there will never be another flood, I will not say that, but it is ridiculous to allow a flood because we were supposedly protecting the habitat of the elderberry beatle, which they have never seen, by the way. This is the greatest thing in the world. They were protecting the habitat, the elderberry bush, when the levee went out. Guess what, this took the elderberry bush. So what have we accomplished, besides losing 3 lives and millions of dollars? Why cannot we take those few dollars we have left in the Treasury and address that problem?  Mr. Chairman, I am just suggesting what we have to do is vote down the Boehlert amendment. Very frankly, itis ill-conceived. It is an attempt to gut the bill. I understand where the gentleman is coming from. But the bill as written by the gentlemen from California, Mr. Wally Herger and Mr. Pombo, as it came out of the committee is a bill that will solve the problem.
