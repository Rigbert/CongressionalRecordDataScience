President, last week I listened to the comments of my friend, the senior Senator from Missouri, regarding the devastating impact of the tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia, which caused so much loss of life and destruction of property. Senator Bond paid tribute to the contributions of American relief agencies that have done so much to alleviate the suffering there, and I want to echo those comments.  He also expressed concern about what he called ``unintended consequences'' of restrictions on our assistance to the Indonesian military, otherwise known as the TNI. Specifically, he referred to the International Military Education and Training Program, and spare parts for C-130 aircraft.  I want to respond to that portion of Senator Bond's remarks, to be sure there is no misunderstanding about what our law says.  To begin with, I want to disabuse those who might be misled by some Indonesian officials who often mistakenly refer to a U.S. military ``embargo'' against Indonesia. I ask unanimous consent that a Defense Department document from our Embassy in Jakarta, which describes the many programs and other contacts we currently have with the TNI, be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
