President, there are few jobs on Earth more demanding, or where the stakes are greater, than the Secretary of State of the United States. The daily business of most heads of state around the world pales in comparison.  The President has made an outstanding nomination. Madeleine Albright brings to this job a lifetime of experience. She has proven her toughness and her fairness many times over. She has been an unwavering champion of the fundamental ideals our Nation stands for.  She has been a strong voice for international human rights and the dignity of all people. She is going to be looked at by millions of people all over the world--in democracies and countries that are not democratic--as our voice in foreign affairs.  My wife Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Madeleine Albright for over 20 years. We have traveled with her and we have worked with her. I also had the privilege to be appointed as a congressional delegate to the United Nations, when I joined with her in introducing resolutions on landmines. I have always found her to be a person of the highest integrity, the greatest ability, wide-ranging knowledge, and one real tough ambassador when she has to be, to protect the interests of the United States.  On an issue dear to my heart, the abolition of antipersonnel landmines, we could not ask for a more forceful or passionate advocate for an international ban. Her trip to Angola last year and her poignant descriptions of what she saw there gave a great boost to the effort to ban landmines not only in this country, but worldwide.  The recent United Nations vote, with 156 nations in favor and none opposed, for a U.S. resolution calling for urgent negotiations on a treaty to ban antipersonnel mines, was made possible in no small part because of Madeleine Albright's active role.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter she wrote to the editor of the Christian Science Monitor about her Angola trip.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 11, 1996]                      Albright View of Land Mines       The author of ``A Sower of Land Mines Pleads to End Them,''      Oct. 2, eloquently describes the horrific impact of land      mines around the world. Ending the devastation of what I have      called ``weapons of mass destruction in slow motion'' is a      high priority. As President Clinton told the United Nations      General Assembly just a few days ago, ``our children deserve      to walk this earth in safety.''       This is why the United States is at the forefront of      efforts to end the use of land mines and their stockpiling,      production, and transfer. In the last few months, dozens of      countries have joined a moratorium on these activities and in      a few weeks, at the direction of President Clinton, I will      introduce a resolution in the UN that will commit the world      community to negotiating and concluding an international      agreement designed to end the scourge of these dreadful      weapons forever.       At the same time, as the author discusses, tens of millions      of land mines are already in the ground and they go on      killing and maiming long after the conflict has ended. Along      with other countries, we have contributed more than $90      million to demining efforts, and we are working hard to      develop new technology to lower the costs of clearance and to      reduce the danger to those heroes involved in this perilous      work.       Finally, we are helping prevent greater suffering by      alerting and educating on the hazards those millions of      civilians, particularly children, whose lives are not only      under threat everyday but whose ability to rebuild their      communities is circumscribed by the hidden danger under      roads, beneath playgrounds, or in unsown fields.       Whether in Cambodia, Angola, Bosnia, or in many other      places, I have seen first hand the heartbreaking devastation      of land mines and the continuing tragedy that they inflict.      At the UN and around the world, as well as at the just-     concluded Ottawa Conference, we will continue doing all we      can to end this horror and make our earth safe once again.
