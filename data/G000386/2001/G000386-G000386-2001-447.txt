  Just think what these families can do with those dollars if we let them keep their hard-earned money instead of taking it away to squander in Washington. For example, I know the cost-of-living in California is high, but $15,800 in the pockets of the average household in that State would buy quite a bit. If they decide to pay down early on their 30-year mortgage, the interest saved would save them a tremendous number of house payments. It can buy kids clothes, family vacations. Let the family decide how to spend it.
