Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes to rebut my good friend from California.  Mr. Chairman, effective oversight is a function of effective congressional leadership and not as a result of legislative sunsets. If we restricted oversight to legislative sunsets, only about 5 percent of the laws that we pass are sunset, and most of those are appropriations bills.  Now, the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) is the chairman of an oversight subcommittee on the Committee on International Relations. I do not see any sunsets coming on bills coming out of the Committee on International Relations because I have faith in the gentleman from California's (Mr. Rohrabacher) being able to do effective oversight.  The Committee on the Judiciary has done a huge amount of oversight. We have had extensive hearings. There has been more process and more hearings and more witnesses on more sides of the issue on the PATRIOT Act than practically any other piece of legislation that I have faced in my 26-plus years as a Member of Congress.  Thirty-five witnesses, 12 hearings, oversight letters, responses, inspectors general reports. I wish I had brought all of the paper that has come about as a result of the Committee on the Judiciary's oversight, because it would stack this high off the table here in the House Chamber.  Mr. Chairman, the following is a listing of the oversight activities so that the American public and everybody can see that this committee has done its job. It has done its job effectively, and it has made sure that the civil liberties of the people of this country have not been infringed upon.Hearing Chronology: House Judiciary Committee Consideration of the USA                     Patriot Act, As of June 21, 2005                      full committee consideration       June 10, 2005: Full Committee--Oversight Hearing on the      Reauthorization of the USA PATRIOT Act: Carlina Tapia-Ruano,      First Vice-President of the American Immigration Lawyers      Association (Minority witness); Dr. James J.

OVERSIGHT: House Judiciary Committee Oversight of the USA Patriot Act         OVERSIGHT THROUGH LETTERS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE       House Judiciary Committee sent the Attorney General, John      Ashcroft, a letter on June 13, 2002, with 50 detailed      questions on the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act. The      questions were a result of extensive consultation between the      majority and minority Committee counsel. Assistant Attorney      General, Daniel Bryant, responded to Chairman Sensenbrenner      and Ranking Member Mr. Conyers on July 26, 2002, providing      lengthy responses to 28 out of the 50 questions submitted. On      August 26, 2002, Mr. Bryant sent the responses to the      remaining questions, after sending responses to six of the      questions to the House Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence. Then, on September 20, 2002, Mr. Bryant sent      the minority additional information regarding the Department      of Justice's responses to these questions.       On April 1, 2003, Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member      Mr. Conyers sent a second letter to the Department of Justice      with additional questions regarding the use of pre-existing      authorities and the new authorities conferred by the USA      PATRIOT Act. Once again, the questions were the product of      bipartisan coordination by Committee counsel. Acting      Assistant Attorney General, Jamie E. Brown, responded with a      May 13, 2003 letter that answered the questions she deemed      relevant to the Department of Justice and forwarded the      remaining questions to the appropriate officials at the      Department of Homeland Security. On June 13, 2003,     the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs at the      Department of Homeland Security, Pamela J. Turner, sent      responses to the forwarded questions.       On November 20, 2003, Chairman Sensenbrenner and      Congressman Hostettler, Chairman of the Subcommittee on      Immigration, Border Security, and Claims, sent a letter to      the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability      Office (GAO) requesting a GAO study of the implementation of      the USA PATRIOT Act anti-money laundering provisions. This      report was released on June 6, 2005.                       OVERSIGHT THROUGH HEARINGS       On May 20, 2003, the Committee's Subcommittee on the      Constitution held an oversight hearing entitled, ``Anti-     Terrorism Investigations and the Fourth Amendment After      September 11th: Where and When Can Government Go to Prevent      Terrorist Attacks.''       On June 5, 2003, the Attorney General testified before the      full Committee on the Judiciary at an oversight hearing on      the United States Department of Justice. Both the hearing on      May 20 and the hearing on June 5 discussed oversight aspects      of the USA PATRIOT Act.                      OVERSIGHT THROUGH BRIEFINGS       The Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security      of this Committee requested that officials from the      Department of Justice appear and answer questions regarding      the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act. In response to our      request, the Department of Justice gave two separate      briefings to Members, counsel, and staff:       During the briefing held on August 7, 2003, Department      officials covered the long-standing authority for law      enforcement to conduct delayed searches and collect business      records, as well as the effect of the USA PATRIOT Act on      those authorities.       During the second briefing, held on February 3, 2004, the      Department of Justice discussed its views of S. 1709, the      ``Security and Freedom Ensured (SAFE) Act of 2003'' and H.R.      3352, the House companion bill, as both bills proposed      changes to the USA PATRIOT Act.       The Department of Justice has also provided three      classified briefings on the use of the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act (FISA) under the USA PATRIOT Act for Members      of the Judiciary Committee:       On June 10, 2003, October 29, 2003, and June 7, 2005 the      Justice Department provided these briefings.       The Department also provided a law enforcement sensitive      briefing on FISA to the House Judiciary Committee Members and      staff on March 22, 2005.
