 President, I am placing a ``hold'' on three nominees to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Robert Clarke Brown, John Paul Hammerschmidt, and Norman Y. Mineta. I am concerned about the lack of additional landing and take-off slots at Reagan National Airport. Additional slots are vital to the economic interests of Iowa. They are also necessary to treat Iowa air travelers more fairly.                          ____________________
