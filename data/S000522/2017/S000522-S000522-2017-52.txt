Mr. Speaker, November has been dedicated as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. As such, I would like to help acknowledge all those affected by this type of cancer and to bring more awareness to the medical research needed to help fight this disease.  In June 2017, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network reported that pancreatic cancer is ranked the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer among women and the 11th among men, and is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.  In fact, I have been contacted by several constituents who have lost loved ones to pancreatic cancer.  According to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, pancreatic cancer is often found in its advanced stages and is both difficult to detect and to treat. Unfortunately, major symptoms of pancreatic cancer, which include nausea, diabetes, abdominal or back pain, and loss of appetite, among others, are often overlooked as symptomatic of more common health conditions. The organization stated that about 71 percent of individuals will not live past the first year of diagnosis and the disease is projected to move from the third leading cause of cancer-related death to the second by 2020.  Tragically, the five-year survival rate for those with pancreatic cancer is nine percent--the lowest survival rate among major forms of cancer. We must utilize all federal resources available to meet this devastating disease head on and ensure better outcomes for patients and their families. That is why I have consistently advocated for an increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to ensure that projects--including those which seek to find cures, improve treatments and gain a better understanding of the complex causes of cancers that affect millions of Americans--are well funded. This fall, I supported an increase in funding for NIH in the FY 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act, which includes $5.5 billion for the National Cancer Institute.  I also urged the House Appropriations Committee to include pancreatic cancer as an eligible research category in the Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program (PRCRP)--and the House bill, which passed on June 16th, maintained this eligibility. The Department of Defense conducts high-impact innovative research through the PRCRP that has been used to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer, to better understand the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients, and to improve the well-being of individuals with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis.  While these resources for pancreatic cancer are an important investment, we know that so often laudable initiatives and innovative research projects sit idle because of funding limitations. Therefore, we must continue to work to ensure that these research projects receive sufficient resources.  Those suffering from pancreatic cancer, as well as their loved ones and caregivers, need vocal advocates on Capitol Hill to ensure access to quality care and treatments. We have a duty to see that programs which research detection and treatment are supported appropriately at a federal level. It is my hope that, by recognizing Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month, we can raise awareness of the risks of pancreatic cancer and the urgency to treat it.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress and with advocates across the nation as we move forward in this fight against cancer                          ____________________
