Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the men and women of the NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD, and congratulate them on their continued success as one of our Nation's premier space flight centers. In December, Goddard led a successful mission to service the Hubble space telescope and launched the Terra spacecraft, the first of an exciting line of satellites based at Goddard.  During the 1999 holiday season, the Hubble was given new navigation equipment and an improved vision of the universe. During an 8-day mission, beginning on December 19, the crew of the space shuttle Discovery captured, serviced, and redeployed the Hubble space telescope. On Christmas day it was released back into orbit, returning it to full operation with a new and improved view of the universe.  Through these improvements, Hubble scientists, for the first time in its 10-year history, have identified and impelemented a value measurement for how fast the universe is expanding. This rate of expansion--the Hubble constant--is essential in determining the age and size of the universe.  In addition to the great accomplishments with the Hubble, on December 18, the first Earth-observing system satellite was successfully launched. This system, known as Terra is operating as expected and will enable new research into the ways Earth's land mass, oceans, air, ice, and life interact as a whole climate.  Since 1993, NASA has cut the cost of missions by two-thirds and has cut the time it takes to develop spacecraft by 40 percent. NASA is also launching an average of four times as many science missions per year.  The great successes of Goddard Space Flight Center would not be possible without the outstanding support that has been provided by the contracting and business community of this region. Their efforts, in partnership with NASA, have been critical in placing Goddard in the forefront of space technology and giving the United States the recognition of being number one in space exploration and know-how.  In closing, Mr. Speaker, as we enter the new millennium, let us continue to support the men and women leading us onto the new frontier of space exploration. These men and women of the Goddard Space Flight Center are furthering our knowledge of the planet and the universe by which we are surrounded. I thank the astronomers, scientists, and the entire space exploration community for a job well done.                          ____________________
