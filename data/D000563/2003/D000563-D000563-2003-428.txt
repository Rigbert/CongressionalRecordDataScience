I ask the Senator from New Mexico--he has made the point it is still up to the administration to decide which names and identities will remain classified and not publicly disclosed. If there is any concern about national security and the threat of terrorism, as I understand this amendment, the Senator makes a clear exception so the administration has the last word in terms of this disclosure; is that not true?
