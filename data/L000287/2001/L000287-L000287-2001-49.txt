Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), my friend and brother, thank you for all your good work and for being so supportive of Faith and Politics and making those trips to Alabama.  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps).
