 We asked over 12 questions, over a dozen questions; the first one: Who are the creditors that Mexico was paying off, seeing as how they were going to be borrowing the money from us to do it. We wanted to know specifically. We did not want to know some sort of general answer.  We have received no reply from the Department of Treasury to our questions.  Mr. DeFAZIO. So, if the gentlewoman would yield further, it is not exactly like we are sandbagging them with this resolution of inquiry. We have been waiting 3 weeks on issues of national concern involving tens of billions of taxpayers dollars, and we have had no response to a group of Members of Congress who have asked these questions.
