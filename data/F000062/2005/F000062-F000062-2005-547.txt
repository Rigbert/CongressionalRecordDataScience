 President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment sent to the floor by Senator Kyl, Senator Hutchison, Senator Bingaman, Senator Akaka, Senator Cornyn, Senator Schumer, Senator Feingold, and Senator Clinton. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to urge this Congress to reauthorize the SCAAP Program, the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program.  On every desk there is a chart that shows how much each State received for this program. What does this program do? What this program does is reimburse the State for the cost of the incarceration of an illegal alien. In other words, when someone comes to our country, commits a crime, is convicted of that crime, is in jail or is in State prison, the Federal Government--it is their responsibility for all matters pertaining to immigration--has reimbursed the State. The program reimburses the State for less than 20 percent of the actual cost to the State. The authorization is due to expire. We are asking in the sense of the Senate that it be considered for reauthorization.  Before I speak further, my main author, Senator Kyl, wanted to make a few comments and then Senator Cornyn, if I might.  I yield briefly to Senator Kyl.
