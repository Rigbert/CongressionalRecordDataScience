President, thanks to my colleagues who are on the floor, especially Senator Alexander. Senator Enzi and I owe the Senator a great debt of gratitude for his work on this bill, in helping us craft the bill and bring the support together.  I ask unanimous consent that the following four editorials be printed in the Record, from the New York Times, the Idaho State Journal, the Green Bay Press Gazette, and the Northwest Herald of Illinois.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2013]                        Fairness on Sales Taxes                           (Editorial Board)       Twenty-one years is a long time to wait. But that is how      long local retailers have waited for Congress to undo a 1992      Supreme Court decision that exempted many online retailers,      like Amazon.com, from collecting most state sales taxes. The      exemption has given online sellers a 5 percent to 10 percent      price advantage over Main Street stores.       The wait, however, may soon be over. Next week, the Senate      is expected to pass the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, a      bipartisan bill that would authorize states to require out-     of-state sellers with more than $1 million in sales to      collect sales taxes. The states, in turn, must simplify their      sales-tax codes and give retailers free software to calculate      the taxes--steps already taken by most states. An identical      bill in the House also has bipartisan support.       Lawmakers have raised the issue for years, to no avail,      and, in the meantime, many brick-and-mortar stores have gone      out of business. The willingness to act now is driven in part      by the fact that Amazon, which fought hard to preserve the      exemption, recently gave up the fight. That's not because the      company suddenly developed a belief in sales taxes. Its      business model--especially its emphasis on same-day      delivery--is changing in ways that would soon cause it to      lose the exemption anyway.       Main Street needs a level playing field to compete with the      exploding online industry. So do large retailers, like Best      Buy, that have cut jobs as shoppers have increasingly tested      electronics at local stores and then gone home to buy them      online without paying sales tax. Equally important, states      need the revenue to help recover from the recession.      Noncollection of sales tax on online purchases costs states      an estimated $11 billion a year. Another $11 billion goes      uncollected on mail-order catalog sales, which would also be      covered under pending bills.       In the past, most bills that deal with revenue, no matter      how justified, have fallen victim to the knee-jerk refusal      among many Republicans to even talk about taxes, urged on by      anti-tax groups like Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax      Reform. But, as reported in the Times on Monday, lawmakers      from both parties have come to see that the argument for      sales-tax collection is airtight.       Sales taxes for any state are already legally due on online      purchases that would be taxable if the items were bought in a      local store. If the retailer does not collect the taxes, the      buyer is supposed to send them to the state voluntarily. As a      practical matter, however, if the taxes are not collected by      retailers, they are virtually never paid.       The proposed law would close that loophole, not impose new      taxes. It's a matter of efficiency and fairness, of necessity      and competitiveness. If those really are bipartisan values,      the Senate will act without further delay to pass the      Marketplace Fairness Act, and the House will follow suit.                                  ____              [From the Idaho State Journal, May 6, 2013]      There's a reason This Is Called the Marketplace Fairness Act                           (Editorial Board)       The Marketplace Fairness Act making its way through      Congress is well-named. It would allow state governments to      force Internet retailers to collect sales taxes from their      customers and remit the proceeds to state and local      governments--like, you know--brick-and-mortar retailers are      required to do.       The shoppers who buy merchandise off the Internet are      supposed to calculate sales taxes on their income tax forms,      but the fact is most people don't do that. So it might be      said that Idahoans pay an extra 6 percent when they buy from      stores at home. That's money that pays to operate schools and      other public services, and it's estimated that Idaho would      collect about $35 million if Internet sales were taxed.       Because some states, like Idaho, have refused to authorize      collection of sales taxes on online purchases, Congress is      acting on behalf of hometown merchants with a federal law.      The legislation cleared its first procedural hurdle Thursday      on a bipartisan Senate vote, 63 to 30. Final Senate passage      is scheduled for Monday and that tally is likely to be even      more strongly in favor, according to The New York Times.      Earlier test votes won as many as 75 yeses, and House action,      once seemingly unthinkable, may be unstoppable.       Tax opponents like Grover Norquist and the Heritage      Foundation have long opposed any legislation that would      require collection of levies on Internet purchases, calling      it a tax increase. But Congress is hearing from their      hometown constituents, and the tide has turned. Even public      officials who signed Norquist's antitax pledge now are      changing their minds. Typical is Rep. Scott Rigell,      Republican of Virginia, who calls the struggling retailers      back home ``the hardworking men and women who have mortgaged      their homes to buy or rent a little brick-and-mortar shop.''      Six percent may actually amount to their profit margin.       ``I have some concern about the legislation,'' concedes      Rep. Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, chairman of the House      Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction on the issue,      ``but we also recognize the fairness issue--certain items      being taxed in certain circumstances, other items being not--     is a problem, so we're going to try to solve that.'' It can      be done.       Norquist should not complain, though he characterizes the      bill as a ``money grab by cash-poor state and local      governments that would get the power to tax consumers who do      not have the power to vote them out of office.'' After all,      consumers are already supposed to pay sales taxes even if an      Internet merchant does not collect them.       The new law would rectify that, and that's why it is called      the Fairness Act.                                  ____            [From the Green Bay Press Gazette, May 5, 2013]       Congress Must Level Playing Field on Internet Sales Taxes                           (Editorial Board)       How many of you have entered a dollar amount on Line 36 of      the Wisconsin income tax Form 1?       That's the line where you self-report ``sales and use tax      due on Internet, mail order, or other out-of-state      purchases.'' In other words, if you've ever purchased      something from Amazon, for example, you should have entered a      dollar amount here when you filed your taxes.       But very few people do. About one of every 100 state      taxpayers did when they filed their 2010 income taxes,      according to a 2012 story by Steven Walters of WisconsinEye,      a nonprofit public affairs channel.       Currently, all retailers in Wisconsin collect sales tax on      purchases and pay that money to the state. If you buy      something, the state and county sales taxes are part of what      you pay.       If you purchase something online from a business that has a      physical presence in Wisconsin, you pay sales tax. But if      that business doesn't have a store or warehouse in Wisconsin,      it doesn't charge a sales tax.       For example, if you went online and purchased a shirt from      Lands' End, based in Wisconsin, you'd pay sales tax. If you      purchased a similar shirt from L.L. Bean, based in Maine, you      would not.       The loophole is courtesy of a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court      decision that exempts companies from collecting sales tax      from purchasers who live in a state where the business has no      physical presence.       A bill that the Senate is expected to vote on Monday would      change that. The Marketplace Fairness Act give states the      ability to require online and mail order retailers to collect      state and local sales tax based on the address of the      purchaser.       Wisconsin retailers say this would level the playing field.      In a meeting with Press-Gazette Media, area retailers said      they don't have a problem competing against other businesses,      as long as all play by the same rules and all charge a state      sales tax.       Without that level playing field, area businesses find      themselves answering a consumer's questions and concerns only      to have that consumer order the same item online and not have      to pay a sales tax. It reduces local businesses to showrooms.      They do all the work; the online retailer collects the money.       What's at stake is millions of dollars as well as the      fiscal health of the local community.       The state Department of Revenue estimates that Wisconsin      lost $157 million in revenue because taxes were not collected      on mail order and other remote sales in 2012--$78 million of      that from e-commerce sales.       Also, the health of area businesses is important. They pay      taxes, provide jobs and donate to local charitable      organizations yet lose sales and money when tax-free      purchases are made. The out-of-state online-only retailers      aren't invested in your community.       The bill before the Senate sets a threshold of $1 million      in online sales so small businesses will not be hurt and      calls for the state to provide free software so businesses      can comply.       One aspect of the bill calls for the state to ``establish a      uniform sales tax base for use throughout the state.'' That      concerns us because many counties, like Brown, have a 0.5      percent county sales tax. We wouldn't want to lose out on      that money because the state must charge a uniform sales tax.      And it's hard to believe that the software will not be able      to determine the correct state and local sales taxes. The      technology that has given us the ease of online shopping      should also be able to clear that hurdle.       So far, the bill has bipartisan support in the Senate, but      faces a much more unclear fate in the House.       However, Congress needs to pass this bill. Local businesses      are willing to compete as     long as it's a fair fight. Also, the bill is not asking for a      new tax; it's asking that the existing tax is applied fairly      and uniformly and doesn't put the burden on the consumer to      reimburse the state. That's not too much to ask.                                  ____                [From the Northwest Herald, May 2, 2013]                        What's Fair For Business                           (Editorial Board)       The scenario described by Play It Again Sports' owner Bob      Ruer happens all too often in local businesses.       A customer comes into his Crystal Lake store, looks around,      maybe tries out the wares, and then heads home to buy the      same product online. Why? Because Internet retailers aren't      required to collect sales tax at the buyer's local rate.       U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., is pushing to end that with      the Marketplace Fairness Act. We support Durbin's effort and      encourage lawmakers in Washington to pass the act.       The legislation would put the initial costs on the states      to provide retailers with the appropriate software to collect      taxes. Internet retailers with less than $1 million in annual      sales would be granted an exemption.       Opponents of the bill, including large online retailers      such as eBay and Overstock.com, have taken issue with the $1      million exemption and suggested it should be bumped higher.       The bill has the support of big-box stores such as Walmart,      Best Buy and Target and online giant Amazon.       Beyond the unlevel playing field for businesses, the      situation causes the state of Illinois to lose out on a great      deal of revenue.       Now, Illinois taxpayers are on an honor system when it      comes to paying state sales tax for online purchases.      Residents are supposed to note the sales tax they owe from      Internet purchases on their state income-tax return. Durbin      estimates that only 5 percent of Illinois taxpayers do so.      Gov. Pat Quinn said the state stands to collect an additional      $200 million annually in sales-tax revenue if the bill      passed.       This is not a tax increase. It's not a new tax. These sales      taxes and tax rates are already in place.       This is a needed law to level the playing field for local      businesses who've been good corporate citizens, hired local      employees and paid property taxes that support local schools      and other taxing districts.
