Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his statement. The chairman of the conference committee from the Senate was very strongly in favor of the gentleman's provision. Very frankly, I was in favor of the gentleman's provision. I agree with the premise the gentleman has stated, but the President indicated he would veto the bill if the gentleman's provision was kept in. It proved to be an insurmountable obstacle to us in doing that, but I think the gentleman's comments are well taken.  I will tell the gentleman that I believe next year, assuming that provision is in this bill, I do not know whether the Senate can get the same provision in, it is a little difficult for the Senate to accede to the House's provision, but they want to do that if the House does not hold to its position. I thank the gentleman for his comments.
