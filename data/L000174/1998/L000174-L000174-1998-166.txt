President, this amendment expresses the sense of Congress that information relevant to the murders of four American churchwomen in El Salvador be made public to the fullest extent possible. My understanding is that it is acceptable to both sides.  It was 18 years ago, but the 1980 brutal murders of four American churchwomen by members of the Salvadoran National Guard is seared in our memory. Since that time the victims' families have sought answers to questions about the nuns' untimely deaths. Some have been answered, many have not. It is unfortunate that after so many years, it is still necessary to offer an amendment to urge the administration to release any information that would shed light on what happened in this case. It should have been done years ago.  To its credit, the State Department did promptly respond to Congressional requests and fully release information about these horrific crimes. Other agencies have not. Far too often in this case and others like it, the response to requests for information has come grudgingly, and then only in the form of heavily redacted documents with a few lines of practically meaningless text.  I appreciate the need to protect intelligence sources and methods, but these American citizens were murdered almost two decades ago.  For years there have been allegations and evidence to indicate that the National Guardsmen convicted of these crimes acted after receiving orders from their superiors.  In March 1998, after 14 years of silence, four of the convicted men confessed that this was the case. Recently, it has become known that even though U.S. officials had reason to believe these crimes were ordered and covered up by higher authorities, at least one of those Salvadoran officers was granted permanent residence and is reportedly living in Florida.  In addition to calling for the release of information, this amendment also directs the Attorney General to review the circumstances under which individuals connected with these crimes obtained residence in the United States. It is a tragic irony that with so many people legitimately seeking asylum upon our shores, we may have opened our doors to individuals who belong behind bars.                           amendment no. 3515    (Purpose: To require a consolidated report on all U.S. military             training provided to foreign military personnel)       At the appropriate place in the bill add the following new      section:       Sec.   . (a) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of      State shall jointly provide to the Congress by January 31,      1999, a report on all overseas military training provided to      foreign military personnel under programs administered by the      Department of Defense and the Department of State during      fiscal years 1998 and 1999, including those proposed for      fiscal year 1999. This report shall include, for each such      military training activity, the foreign policy justification      and purpose for the training activity, the cost of the      training activity, the number of foreign students trained and      their units of operation, and the location of the training.      In addition, this report shall also include, with respect to      United States personnel, the operational benefits to United      States forces derived from each such training activity and      the United States military units involved in each such      training activity. This report may include a classified annex      if deemed necessary and appropriate.       (b) For purposes of this section a report to Congress shall      be deemed to mean a report to the Appropriations and Foreign      Relations Committees of the Senate and the Appropriations and      International Relations Committees of the House.
