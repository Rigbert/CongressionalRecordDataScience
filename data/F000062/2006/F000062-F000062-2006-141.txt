 President, today along with Senator Inhofe, I am pleased to introduce the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act. This legislation is crucial to respond to the expanded scope of terrorist activity that has threatened to impede important medical research and scientific innovation.  The legislation we introduce today would: clarify that it is a crime to damage or interfere with an ``animal enterprise''--which includes legitimate companies and non-profit organizations that use animals for education, research or testing; expand Federal law to also make it illegal to harm or cause property loss to anyone connected with an animal enterprise;  Criminalize threats, harassment, and other illegal activity that uses interstate commerce to intentionally cause fear of death or injury to anyone connected with an animal enterprise;  Establish graded penalties of up to 20 years depending on the financial damage or level of bodily injury caused by such illegal conduct, and up to life imprisonment if death results; establish that a convicted animal enterprise terrorist can also be ordered as restitution to pay the animal enterprise's cost of repeating experiments and other losses resulting from the criminal conduct; and clarify that all legitimate protest activities protected by the First Amendment are exempted out from any prosecution under the bill.  The need for this bill is obvious.  On June 30 of this year, extremist activists, acting in the name of animal rights, attempted to firebomb a Los Angeles home thought to belong to a prominent UCLA primate researcher.  The home actually belonged to a 70-year-old woman, and thankfully, the device did not ignite. But the desired impact was nonetheless achieved.  Just weeks later, a colleague of the targeted researcher announced that he will discontinue his important research at UCLA. He had two words for the terrorists who orchestrated the failed bombing: ``You win.''  While I recognize that reasonable people might disagree about animal research, and believe in the right to legitimate protest, it is outrageous that violent acts, threats and extortion have ended a legitimate medical research career.  Unfortunately, similar incidents have occurred throughout the State of California for several years, including the two bombs placed at the Emeryville offices of Chiron Corporation, a pharmaceutical company in the Bay area, that employs 4400 employees as our Nation's 2nd largest manufacturer of flu vaccines.  Agents believe the second bomb was timed to go off as first-responders arrived.  Yet extremist organizations, such as the Animal Liberation Front, defend these actions around the country as morally justifiable, and shamelessly take credit for these heinous acts.  Their tactics have evolved in the face of our current laws, and consequently, the scope of their terror is widening.  In recent years, animal rights extremists have expanded their campaigns to include secondary and tertiary targets, such that businesses and associates who maintain even highly-attenuated relationships with animal research facilities have found themselves the targets of terror and harassment.  These targets include banks, insurance companies, stockbrokers, customers, construction services, food services, Internet service providers, telecom companies, and even janitorial services.  No matter how remote the relationship, anyone who does business with an organization engaged in animal research is at risk.  But these indirect attacks are outside the scope of our current laws, and threaten to slow the progress of one of our Nation's largest and most valuable industries.  We must recognize that scientific research is not only a legitimate career, but also an invaluable facet of medical advancement, conducted by respectable professionals deserving of our support.  The deplorable actions of these terrorists threaten to impede important medical progress toward lifesaving cures and medical innovation.  They threaten to dishearten noble researchers, and to discourage promising young scientists and graduate students from ever entering these important fields of research.  It is in light of these dangerous threats that Senator Inhofe and I today introduce the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act.  This legislation addresses the changing tactics of these terrorists, and provides law enforcement officials with the tools necessary to protect our Nation's researchers more effectively.  This new legislation will expressly outlaw the targeting of secondary and tertiary targets, by including within the scope of prosecution terrorists who act against any ``person or entity having a connection to, relationship with, or transactions with an animal enterprise.''  This is an important step toward combating the modern tactics of animal rights extremists and eco-terrorists, and toward protecting vital business relationships that foster and support the research industry.  At the same time, however, this legislation confronts these terrorist threats in manner that gives due protections under the First Amendment.  I fully recognize that peaceful picketing and public demonstrations against animal testing should be recognized as part of our valuable and sacred right to free expression.  For this reason, all conduct protected by the First Amendment is expressly excluded from the scope of this legislation. This law effectively protects the actions of the law-abiding protestor while carefully distinguishing the criminal activity of extremists.  The bill is also mindful and respectful of State efforts to address these problems. For this reason, the bill makes clear that it does not preempt State or local laws that address such conduct.  We are keenly aware of our responsibility to protect legitimate businesses and educational institutions from the damaging effects of this new breed of domestic terrorism. It is with this goal in mind that we introduce this bill today.  Biomedical research is a multi-billion dollar industry, but more importantly, it is a lifesaving industry. With the passage of this legislation, we can help to ensure both the productivity of this important field, and the protection of our scientists and their associates.  I would like to express my thanks to Senator Inhofe for his hard work and support on this important issue. I would also like to thank Senator Hatch for his early initiative and continued support for this goal.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                          ____________________[Pages S9254-S9255]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS      By
