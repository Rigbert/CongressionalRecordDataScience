President, today I rise to recognize a group of people who are often overlooked--the unborn. Recently, the House has passed legislation that would protect this defenseless group from violent attacks. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2001 would make it a crime to assault or murder an unborn child.  Recently, I have come across several compelling stories that show the importance of this legislation. One such story is of Tracy Marcinlak of Wisconsin. On February 8, 1992, Tracy was pregnant with her son, Zachariah, who was due to be born in four days. That night, Tracy's husband, Glendale Black, brutally beat her and refused to let her get help. Eventually relenting, her husband let her call an ambulance and Tracy was rushed to the hospital. Little Zachariah was delivered by an emergency Caesarean section. It was too late. He had bled to death from blunt-force trauma.  Unfortunately, in 1992, Wisconsin did not have an unborn victims law and state prosecutors were unable to convict Tracy's husband under a law that required them to prove that he intended to kill Zachariah. He was only convicted of assaulting Tracy. GlendaleBlack, who murdered his own son, is already eligible for parole.  In response to violent acts such as this, the Wisconsin legislature passed one of the nation's strongest unborn victims laws in 1998. However, even today, there is no federal law to prosecute criminals who kill unborn children. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2001 would correct this injustice. Under this law, people like Glendale Black, who kill their unborn children, will be prosecuted in the same manner as if they had murdered someone who is already born.  I applaud my colleagues in the House for passing this important legislation as it will give unborn children a fundamental right--the right to live. Many of our forefathers fought and died to make this a basic right for all Americans. Today, the fight continues. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in this fight and vote yes to the Unborn Victims of Violence Act of 2001.                          ____________________
