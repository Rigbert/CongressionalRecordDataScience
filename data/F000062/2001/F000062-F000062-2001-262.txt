 President, I rise to thank Senators Murkowski and Bingaman for opposing this amendment and also to join them in saying that I believe this is a very dangerous amendment. It creates two classes of creditors. The first is a protected class; namely, certain Federal entities.  Yesterday, I introduced into the Record a series of letters from virtually all of the electricity and natural gas providers. Those letters had one common theme, and that theme was that to do this is not only unprecedented, but it will probably force an involuntary bankruptcy because once the dam is broken, other creditors will then seek to protect their rights under bankruptcy law. Hence, it is a very dangerous amendment.  The State of California is currently seeking to purchase the transmission lines of the utilities to be able to inject $7 billion and solve the problem. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.  Is all time expired?
