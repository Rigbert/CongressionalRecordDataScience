Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished majority whip.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I was sitting here watching the debate. It was almost identical to debates of old, when we were fighting for freedom in the Soviet Union, when we were fighting for freedom in El Salvador, when we were fighting for freedom in Nicaragua. History proved us right and proved you wrong.  Allowing travel to Cuba is a terrible mistake. The benefits of free trade cannot flow to people who are ruthlessly oppressed by a rigidly controlling totalitarian regime. Supporters claim that American tourists will help average Cubans. But letting Americans travel to Cuba will strengthen Castro and do nothing to improve the lot of average Cubans. Freedom cannot penetrate Castro's Communist cadre because it operates more like an organized crime syndicate than a legitimate government.  But surely, we are told, joint ventures with foreign investors will change all that. All joint ventures in Cuba remain under Castro's thumb. Those businesses cannot even hire a Cuban worker without Castro's blessing. All the property in Cuba belongs to Castro. All the income that comes from these Americans will go to Castro.  We are also told that if we support trade in China, we ought to support it in Cuba as well. But China and Cuba, I think, is a poor comparison. In China, the government is allowing the rudiments of a market economy to form. Trade with China does benefit average people. Cuba is a monolithic island under the heel of Castro's regime. Under this dictatorship, the only entrepreneur is Castro. Castro's thugs cannot meet the basic needs of their people. This tyrant is teetering on the brink of an abyss. Why in the world would we reach out now to draw his evil, abusive regime back to safety?  Let it fall. Let it fall and liberate the Cuban people.
