Speaker, I would say, too, I believe it was over the Fourth of July week break that ``Dateline'' had the big expose; and I know our office was flooded with calls and letters, as I was home in Michigan. There were a good number of parents and others that expressed their concern about some of these different online services that were there; and if we can close the loophole on schools and libraries, I think that it is a good thing.  I think that, because of that, I would hope that most Members, when we vote on this later this afternoon, in all likelihood would vote ``yes'' on the bill. Again, it is bipartisan, and that is why it is here before us this afternoon
