Speaker, I rise today to place in the Record the Memorial Day address offered by a rising star in our district in Ohio. Ashley Szatala, a student at Sandusky St. Mary's High School, presented her remarks during the Memorial Day 2011 opening ceremony in Sandusky. The following is Ashley's Memorial Day 2011 speech and the ceremony program.       Over the last few weeks, hundreds of volunteers have placed      flags at the graves of our Nation's soldiers. Many local      communities lined their streets with flags in honor of      Memorial Day. Hundreds of you this morning gathered at the      roadside waving a small American Flag as parade participants      passed by. The flag goes wherever our leaders go. It has gone      before soldiers in battles and is draped atop the casket of      fallen heroes. For over 200 years the American flag has been      the symbol of our Nation's strength and our unity. The Stars      and Stripes--as we affectionately refer to it--stands for the      ideals we hold true--liberty, equality, and freedom. Its      history tells the story of perseverance by our Nation's      veterans as they fought in defense of our liberty.       The most poignant moment in our Nation's history was made      on January 1, 1776. Before laying siege against the British      army, General of the Continental Army, George Washington,      commanded that the Grand Union Flag be raised. Since that      historic raising of our Nation's flag it has been a constant      companion to our troops in times of war and peace. On June      14, 1777, the U.S. Congress proposed the ``Flag Act,'' which      introduced the American Flag as a prominent symbol of our      nation. The original flag was decorated with 13 red and white      stripes, and adorned with 13 stars amidst a blue background      at the top left corner of our flag. The number 13 represented      the 13 original colonies. After a series of changes from      1777-1960 to the original design, the final look of the      American flag consisted of 13 alternating red and white      stripes, and 50 white stars surrounded by a blue background.      The 50 stars represented the 50 United States.       Since its inception, the American flag inspired Francis      Scott Key to compose our Nation's anthem, The Star Spangled      Banner. Like many other American citizens of the day, Key      worried that the American flag would not be flying over Fort      McHenry during a battle in the war of 1812. Overcome with joy      to see the flag of new America, he wrote the song that we      hold dear to our hearts today. Since then, the American Flag      has journeyed to foreign lands during the World Wars, Korea,      Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars. It has stood as a beacon      of light as our brave men and women fought against oppression      and tyranny. Today, the American Flag is one of the most      revered and respected symbols in America. However, it is not      just a piece of cloth, but a symbol of liberty and freedom.      In fact, its colors of red, white, and blue have rich      symbolism.       A review of that rich symbolism will help you understand      why it is only fitting that an American flag stands beside      each grave of our fallen heroes. The color red stands for the      hardiness and valor. Our servicemen and women are hardy. They      are strong in the face of danger. Their collective strength      is not measured by how much muscle they have, but by how      strong and resilient their heart is. They demonstrate valor      as they defend liberty, justice, and freedom against the      enemy. They demonstrate personal bravery and courage far      beyond what the rest of us will ever be called upon to      exhibit.       White in the American flag refers to purity. Our great      country remains pure in its ideals. Those ideals of liberty,      justice, equality, and freedom have held strong through the      years and never wavered. Our veterans and active servicemen      and women have rallied around these ideals and have fought      and     sacrificed everything for the sake of these ideals. These      ideals continue to be gifted to every American citizen. Their      sacrifice gave us all these gifts so today we owe them our      sincere gratitude for such.       Last, the color blue symbolizes vigilance, perseverance,      and justice. Vigilance is an enduring quality of our military      men and women, and our veterans. Throughout the world, they      have remained vigilant in their service of protecting the      liberty and freedom of American citizens. Perseverance means      one never gives up. How true of our service men and women.      Despite the terrible conditions of war, they never gave up on      the ideals for which they were fighting for. They fought to      keep America free and safe for generations of American      citizens. Without their vigilance and perseverance, America      would not be the great country it is today. Each day, school      children recite the words, ``With liberty and justice for      all,'' when they say the Pledge of Allegiance. What this      means is that America upholds the ideals of pursuit of life,      liberty, and happiness. Anything that threatens these ideals      is perceived as a threat to justice. It's not us, the average      citizen, who eliminates the threat, but our country's service      men, women, and veterans who stand up and fight for justice      for all.       So hold high the flag and its colors. Her story is one of      freedom. Through the years, our military has rallied around      her and fought and sacrificed so much. They have fought to      keep us free. The flag unites us all under her majestic      colors.       So, as we are gathered here today, take a look around you.      The flowers that decorate the grave sites will one day wither      and die. The engraving on the headstones will eventually      fade. The sound of Taps will linger silently through these      trees. But the one thing that will forever remain, year after      year, is the American flag, waving valiantly over the graves      of our fallen heroes. Thank you.
