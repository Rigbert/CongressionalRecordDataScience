 President, I was going to ask unanimous consent to that extent. I guess you have already announced that it is in place; is that right? I am going to add something to what the Acting President pro tempore just said, so let me start over again.  I ask unanimous consent that the time until 10:45 a.m. be equally divided between Senator Feinstein or her designee and myself or my designee and that the time from 10:45 a.m. to 11 o'clock be reserved for Senator Schumer's leader remarks.
