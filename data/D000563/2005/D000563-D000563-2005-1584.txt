President, I am pleased to support the introduction today, along with my colleagues Senators Clinton and Kennedy, of Senator Murray's bill to improve America's high schools.  We have all heard a lot of talk these days about the need to improve America's high schools. Bill Gates makes the point that the academic caliber of our high school graduates is one of the greatest factors in our country's ability to innovate and to compete internationally in technological advancements. The CEO of Intel, Craig Barrett, tells the story of the how U.S. students are eclipsed in the international science competition his firm sponsors. University presidents I meet with talk about the strain that remedial education for incoming freshmen places on the school's faculty and budgets.  The President's budget this year includes his high school initiative, which proposes to redirect money to high schools. There's a big catch, though. The President says that to fund his high school initiative we need to eliminate one of our most effective education programs for high schools, technical schools and colleges--Perkins Vocational and Technical Education grants.  There is a better way. The Pathways for All Students to Success (PASS) Act provides the resources schools need to sharpen the focus on literacy and math--skills critical to success in the workforce or in post-secondary studies. High schools can employ literacy and math coaches to help support and supplement the teachers in traditional classrooms. The legislation also allows for additional academic counseling, to provide that targeted, individualized assistance that many students need to achieve proficiency in key academic areas.  The PASS Act also provides funding that allows schools not meeting national standards to implement proven, comprehensive school reform to help students learn. Finally, current data on high school graduation rates is incomplete, inconsistent and often inaccurate. That makes it harder for schools to know which populations of students are most in need of additional attention. This legislation provides funding for school systems to collect, disaggregate and report accurate graduation rates.  Now is the time to strengthen our high schools. Expectations in the workplace and on post-secondary campuses are higher than ever for high school graduates. The PASS Act supports students working toward high school graduation, enhancing their pathway to success.                                 ______                                       By
