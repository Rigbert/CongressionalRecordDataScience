 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Dr. Sam Robinson on the occasion of his retirement as president of the Lincoln Foundation in Louisville, Kentucky.  Sam has been a tireless advocate for the Lincoln Foundation in his 26 years as president, making a difference in the lives of countless young Kentuckians. Sam has worked toward a worthy mission at the Foundation: to help underprivileged children get an education so that they can have a better chance at succeeding in professional life. I applaud your commitment to this cause, Sam, and offer sincere thanks for the good work you have done.  One of the projects Sam has been most passionate about during his time at the Lincoln Foundation is the Whitney M. Young Scholars Program. Sam's ingenuity got the ball rolling for this project, which is a four-year college scholarship program. Since the program's inception, Whitney M. Young scholarships have enabled hundreds of bright young people to attend college who could not have otherwise afforded the expense of an education.  Sam's legacy of service extends far beyond the Lincoln Foundation. His philanthropic and civic actions have resulted in his being honored with the Humanitarian Award from the Louisville Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and being named ``Man of the Year'' by Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. Sam also has served on the boards of Bellarmine University, PNC Bank and the Kentucky State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education.  Dr. Sam Robinson's service to the Lincoln Foundation and the thousands of young people he has helped over the years will long be remembered and admired. His genuine compassion for underprivileged students will encourage and inspire Kentuckians for generations to come. Today, I say to Sam: best wishes for many more years of service, and know that your efforts to better the lives of others in Louisville and throughout Kentucky are recognized and appreciated. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.                          ____________________
