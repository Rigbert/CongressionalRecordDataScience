President, I am delighted to commend the Solon Elementary School of Solon, ME, on being named a 2012 National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence. This prestigious recognition of high accomplishment was bestowed by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools award is considered the highest honor an American school can obtain. Schools singled out for this national recognition reflect the goals of our Nation's education reforms for high standards and accountability. Specifically, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program is designed to honor public and private schools that are either academically superior in their States or that demonstrate dramatic gains in student achievement.  This award recognizes that Solon Elementary students achieve at the highest level academically. Solon Elementary School is a top-performing school on State-required assessments, and staff at the school use assessments throughout the academic year as a tool for improving and customizing instruction. The school works closely with families to forge a strong school community where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests.  I applaud not only the students, but also the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Solon Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate momentum for learning. They are making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as independent, responsible learners and engaged citizens.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected Solon Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I congratulate the entire community for this outstanding achievement.                          ____________________
