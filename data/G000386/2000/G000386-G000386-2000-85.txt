 President, for the majority leader, I wish to announce today's program.  The Senate will be in a period of morning business until 6 p.m. with Senators Lott, Reid, and Wellstone in control of the time. Today the Senate will agree by unanimous consent to the continuing resolution that funds the Government until tomorrow.  As a reminder, cloture was filed on the bankruptcy bill yesterday, and that vote will occur tomorrow morning possibly around 9:30 a.m. A vote on a continuing resolution will also take place during Wednesday's session. The President has vetoed the important legislative branch and Treasury-Postal appropriations bills. However, negotiations will continue to try to come to a consensus to fund all Government programs throughout the year.  I thank my colleagues for their attention.
