Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, my bill, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act, will empower tribes and tribal organizations to offer workforce development issues that uplift Native communities throughout the country. This bipartisan legislation will make the tribal 477 program permanent and make improvements to its administration.  The 477 program was established in 1992--by the way, I was the sponsor of that legislation at that time, also--as a demonstration program. It allows tribes to combine employment, child care, and job training funding from a variety of Federal sources to conduct consolidated, comprehensive reporting. This has enabled tribes to run innovative programs and saved both the tribes and the Federal Government money and resources.  I would suggest respectfully that this is a great piece of legislation. The 477 program embodies tribal self-determination by allowing tribes to provide opportunities tailored to the unique needs of their communities. Significant education and training needs exist in Indian country, and the 477 program has a proven track record of success. This is particularly true in Alaska, where the Cook Inlet Tribal Council has pioneered a smart model that provides holistic services, all under one roof, for individuals and families.  My bill improves accounting procedures and reporting mechanisms to uphold the original intent of the program, ensures that agencies treat tribes fairly, and sets a foundation for participants' continued success.  I especially, at this time, would like to thank the members of the 477 tribal work group who, over the past 4 years, have been dedicated to developing and advancing this legislation. Without the work group's tireless advocacy, this bill would not have been possible.  I would also like to thank Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva and their staffs for their work on the bill and commitment to advancing it through the process. I would specifically like to recognize Ken Degenfelder on Chairman Bishop's staff and Alex Ortiz on my staff.  Finally, I would like to offer my thanks to Chairman Brady, Chairman Kline, and Chairman Goodlatte and their staffs for working together on the committee on which I serve to improve this bill.  I would like to thank them for agreeing to help expedite consideration of this bill today, and I urge adoption of H.R. 329.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.         House of Representatives, Committee on Education and the            Workforce,                                 Washington, DC, December 5, 2106.     Hon. Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to H.R. 329, the Indian      Employment, Training and Related Services Consolidation Act      of 2015. Thank you for consulting with the Committee on      Education and the Workforce with regard to H.R. 329 on those      matters within my committee's jurisdiction and making      improvements to the legislation to address concerns.       In the interest of expediting the House's consideration of      H.R. 329, the Committee on Education and the Workforce will      forgo further consideration of this bill. However, I do so      only with the understanding this procedural route will not be      construed to prejudice my committee's jurisdictional interest      and prerogatives on this bill or any other similar      legislation and will not be considered as precedent for      consideration of matters of jurisdictional interest to my      committee in the future.       I respectfully request your support for the appointment of      outside conferees from the Committee on Education and the      Workforce should this bill or a similar bill be considered in      a conference with the Senate. I also request you include our      exchange of letters on this matter in the Committee Report on      H.R. 329 and in the Congressional Record during consideration      of this bill on the House Floor. Thank you for your attention      to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       John Kline,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Natural Resources,                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2016.     Hon. Kevin Brady,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On November 16, 2016, the Committee on      Natural Resources favorably reported as amended H.R. 329, the      Indian Employment, Training and Related Services      Consolidation Act of 2016. The bill was sequentially referred      to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on      Education and the Workforce until December 8, 2016.       I understand our staffs have been able to negotiate out      text that is agreeable to you. Therefore, I ask that you      allow the Committee on Ways and Means to be discharged     from further consideration of the bill before December 8,      2016, so that this revised text for H.R. 329 may be scheduled      by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no way affects your      jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, and it will      not serve as precedent for future referrals. In addition,      should a conference on the bill be necessary, I would support      your request to have the Committee on Ways and Means      represented on the conference committee. Finally, I would be      pleased to submit this letter and any response to the      Congressional Record.       Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the      extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over      matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further      opportunities to work with you next Congress.           Sincerely,                                                       Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Ways and Means,                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2016.     Hon. Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Bishop: I write with respect to H.R. 329, the      ``Indian Employment, Training and Related Services      Consolidation Act of 2015,'' on which the Committee on Ways      and Means received a sequential referral.       I appreciate your willingness to work with my Committee on      this legislation. In order to allow H.R. 329 to move      expeditiously to the House floor, I agree to forgo a markup      of this bill. The Committee on Ways and Means takes this      action with our mutual understanding that by forgoing      consideration of H.R. 329 at this time, we do not waive any      jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar      legislation, and that our Committee will be appropriately      consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation      moves forward. Our Committee also reserves the right to seek      appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any      House-Senate conference involving this or similar      legislation, and asks that you support any such request.       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming      this understanding, and would request that you include a copy      of this letter and your response in the Congressional Record      during the floor consideration of this bill. Thank you in      advance for your cooperation.           Sincerely,                                                      Kevin Brady,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Natural Resources,                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2016.     Hon. Kevin Brady,     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On November 16, 2016, the Committee on      Natural Resources favorably reported as amended H.R. 329, the      Indian Employment, Training and Related Services      Consolidation Act of 2016.

Sincerely,                                                       Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Natural Resources,                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2016.     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On March 16, 2016, the Committee on      Natural Resources favorably reported as amended H.R. 329, the      Indian Employment, Training and Related Services      Consolidation Act of 2016, by unanimous consent. My staff has      shared the reported text of the bill with your staff.       The reported bill contains provisions regarding judicial      review, a matter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on      the Judiciary. Specifically, section 9 of the bill amends      section 8(d) of the Indian Employment, Training and Related      Services Act of 1992 to provide for judicial review of the      Secretary of the Interior's denial of a plan. I understand      that you have concerns regarding this provision. Based on my      agreement to drop this text from the bill when it is      considered by the House of Representatives, I ask that the      Committee on the Judiciary not seek a sequential referral of      the bill so that it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader      before the House adjourns for the election. This concession      in no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter      of the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future      referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be      necessary and the issues raised by the omitted text are      within the scope of the conference, I would support your      request to have the Committee on the Judiciary represented on      the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to      include this letter and any response in the Congressional      Record to document this agreement.       Thank you for your consideration of my request, and I look      forward to further opportunities to work with you this      Congress.           Sincerely,                                                       Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                               Washington, DC, September 22, 2016.     Hon. Rob Bishop,     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Bishop: Thank you for your letter regarding      H.R. 329, the ``Indian Employment, Training and Related      Services Consolidation Act.'' I appreciate your willingness      to work with me on this issue.       As you note in your letter, the reported bill contains      provisions regarding judicial review that fall within the      Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary.      Specifically, section 9 of the bill amends section 8(d) of      the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Act of      1992 to provide for judicial review of the Secretary of the      Interior's denial of a plan. The Judiciary Committee has      concerns with this provision. However, based on your      agreement to drop this text from the bill or similar      legislation when it is considered by the House, the Judiciary      Committee will not seek a sequential referral of the bill.      The Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding      that by forgoing a sequential referral of H.R. 329 at this      time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject matter      contained in this or similar legislation and that our      committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as      this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may      address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our      committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an      appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate      conference involving this or similar legislation and asks      that you support any such request.       I would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this      matter be included in your committee report and in the      Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 329.           Sincerely,                                                    Bob Goodlatte,                                                         Chairman.
