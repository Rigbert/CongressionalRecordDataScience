 President, this amendment would expand the flexibility available to OPM in providing services to CSRS and FERS annuitants in such functions as processing health benefits enrollment changes, changes of address and responding to annuitant inquiries. All of these postadjudication matters would be funded in the same way, and therefore fully integrated with the postretirement COLA adjustments, Federal and State tax withholding and allotments from annuity payments.  It is my understanding it has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.
