President, we have had an early unanimous consent order, so following that, I ask unanimous consent that the sequence of votes outlined under the previous order now start at 11:30 a.m., and the additional 30 minutes of debate be equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that following the disposition of the Coburn amendment No. 15, the Senate recess for the weekly caucus meetings; further, that at 2:15 p.m., the Senate resume the sequence of votes under the previous order; and finally, all other provisions of the previous order remain in effect.
