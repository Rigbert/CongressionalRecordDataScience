Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2888, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill providing essential funds for recovery from and response to the terrorist attacks on New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania.  I want to thank our distinguished Chairman, Mr. Young of Florida, and our ranking member, Mr. Obey, for their hard work in negotiating this essential package with the leadership of both bodies and the President. The mettle of a nation is tested at trying times, and the response before us today demonstrates that America, her people, and her leaders, are ready for this test.  Today we provide $40 billion to start beginning to pay for the damage caused by the attack, to assist the victims who were impacted by it, to upgrade our security, and to begin the military preparations necessary for an appropriate response. $10 billion is available immediately for the President to use as he sees fit. Another $10 billion is available after the President specifies how he wishes to use the funding provided that the Congress concurs within fifteen days of that plan. Congress as part of our work on regular appropriations bills will expend the final $20 billion based upon a submission of a budget request by the President and further action in the weeks ahead.  Mr. Speaker, there have been so many times when America has committed her resources to the causes of peace and in support of freedom. There can be no more appropriate time than when our homeland has been attacked and our citizens killed.  I am one who believes that we should celebrate the victory that we had in the thousands of people who survived, and in the outpouring of the American spirit in support of the victims of the attack.  No one will forget the devotion of the firefighters, police, and emergency medical technicians who braved the danger presented by the destruction.  No one can ignore the determination of the iron, steel and construction workers who felt an obligation to donate their professional skills to the rescue effort.  No one can doubt the conviction of the men and women of America's military who moved swiftly to safeguard our nation, or the thousands of Americans on reserve duty who stood ready for the call to action.  The entire world is in awe of the outpouring of support of people, from the youngest children to our senior citizens who looked for things or money to  But that is what America is. America is resilient. America is resourceful. America is at her very best when challenged and when angered. Others around the world often misunderstand America's resolve. Now the execution of that resolve will leave no questions.  In this Capitol, we celebrate what makes our nation special. We revere the times when we can pursue those policies that we believe to be in the best interest of the United States. We have heated and principled debates in which we highlight, not hide, our differences of opinion. We cherish those moments because that is what freedom brings to us--the ability to advance those causes that are important to us, while openly disagreeing with those we dislike without the fear of retribution.  And now, in a moment of historical significance, we also celebrate another matter that makes our nation special--the ability to come together as one when our precious freedom is attacked by those who either misunderstand or are fearful of freedom's power.  In the days and weeks to come, this Congress will work together on behalf of our nation. We will have disagreements, and at the end of the day our nation and we will be better for it.  Those who thought that they could infect our nation with ill will should remember the words of a great man who served in this very building, Hubert Humphrey: ``Freedom is the most contagious virus known to man.'' Let us use this challenge to create an opportunity for America to once again celebrate freedom, and to help spread it to others who for too long have been under the scourge of terror.                          ____________________
