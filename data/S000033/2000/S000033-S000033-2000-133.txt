 Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I submit the following statements into the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                Brian Lindstam Regarding Homeless Teens       Brian Lindstam: My subject is on homeless teens. Over 500      Vermont teens become homeless every year in Vermont. That is      about two teens a day, and 300 of those teens of that 500 are      from Burlington. Why do teens become homeless? Here are      several reasons: Abuse, negligence, and one-parent households      where the teen is not getting the support because the parent      is consumed in his or her own life. Sex abuse and drug and      alcohol addiction can be a problem.       Spectrum is a teen shelter in Burlington where troubled      teens can get support, counseling and get back into some kind      of schooling. Burlington Youth Build is a nine-month program      where they get paid $250 every two weeks and got their GED at      the end of program. They run this program as if it was a job.      If you miss a day, you get no pay. If you have a drug or      alcohol addiction there is a program, it is a three-month      program at a rehabilitation clinic called Mountain View in      Huntington. This is where Spectrum sends you if you have an      addiction or if you need help.       I have an idea for--I have an idea that if you get a job at      a food facility, it is a two-day orientation to get you ready      for your job. If you have a job at IBM, it is an eight-day      orientation to get ready for your job. So I said to myself,      two to eight days can get you ready for a job; then why      cannot three months of schooling get a student ready for his      or her job? Nine months of schooling or four years of      schooling will burn out a frustrated mind, so if you have a      teen pick one class to excel in for three months and get a      $300 to $500 bonus at graduation, fee or bonus to help pay      for utensils or a wardrobe to get them going in their job. I      feel that this problem will help teens that do not like      school and it will open new doors to them for a better life.                                  ____                                             Matt Kozlowski Regarding Auto Insurance for Teens       Matt Kozlowski: Congressman Sanders, I have reached the      point in my life where I am a young adult and I have many      obstacles to overcome, one of them being car insurance. I      will be turning 17 in a month and I am going to get my      license. Recently I moved from Toronto, Ontario, Canada where      I had gotten around the whole city with buses, subway,      streetcars and trains to get to mandatory destinations like      school and work.       Now that I am living in Vermont, all my destinations are      far apart and cannot be reached by buses, subways, et cetera.      Therefore, I need to make a new investment, that being a car.       Purchasing a car is not a problem for working teens. You      can save up a couple thousand dollars to purchase it, but      what is very expensive and hard to do is maintaining it on      the road by paying extremely high car insurance rates. A      single male age 16 to 18 pays on average $2,567.97 annually      for car insurance, compared to a single 23- or 24-year-old      male who only pays $994.63 annually.       Just because we fall under the dangerous young drivers      category of the insurance companies, I do not feel that we      all belong there. I am aware that these insurance rates are      based on statistics, but not all young drivers should have to      pay high rates due to others' mistakes. The younger we are,      the more time we want for sports, school and our social life.      We do not want to have to work the majority of each week      having to pay a monthly insurance bill of over $200 to get      from one destination to another.       One of the solutions that I would like to propose is giving      young drivers a regular 23- to 24-year-old single male      insurance rate of approximately $1,000 annually. If one were      to get a speeding ticket, have an accident or be cited for      violation or along those lines, then they should fall into      the dangerous young driver category. I feel that we all      deserve at least one chance before we fall into such a      category because we all are not dangerous drivers.       I think that my proposal would be successful in making      teens have more time for sports in school as well as      resulting in insurance companies having to pay fewer claims.      If I knew that I had one chance before my insurance rate went      up from $1000 to $2500, I would definitely be a very much      more cautious driver. I also think that car insurance      companies make enough money as it is and shouldn't be taking      great amounts of money from minors, most of whom just make      enough to keep their cars on the road.       Thank you much for your time and consideration.                                  ____                                                   Matt Cyr Regarding Emancipated Minors       Matt Cyr: Sir, I am here to tell you about the lack of      knowledge people have on emancipation, and if you all do not      know what emancipation is, it is when a minor under the age      of 18 is able to move out of the house with your parents      consent legally and you get a legal document that says you      are on your own, you can sign your own, so they consider you      18 so you can live on your own and manage your own stuff.       And just a little while my dad thought I would be better      off at the age of 17, and I thought I would too, but it is      kind of hard even though I am fighting through it, but that      is not what I am here to tell you about is my money problems.      It is about the lack of knowledge people have on this topic,      because when I am trying to get my phone, electricity and      cable hooked up to my place, they said I needed my parent to      do it.       How can I do things on my own when and if they do not let      me be on my own? They need to give me a chance for me to do      it on my own. The law says I can sign on my own and do all      the things that an 18-year-old could do, but the public does      not know about this law and if they did they would be able to      say yes to the things that I need to do on a common basis.       There are some people that do know about the law and they      are not sure as to what the rights I would get or you would      get. The only thing I ask is for you to show people about      this law and not just this one but other laws as well as what      they also mean. There are many places you can do this, like      on TV commercials or visits in the schools and tell them      about the laws. I do not see things that you guys--I do not      see things that people do to inform about the laws because I      never heard about it and I never knew about it. Why I think      you need to inform a lot more people about the law and others      is because I have hardly ever heard of this law or anything      about it until it happened. Thanks.                                  ____                                                 Elizabeth Bombard Regarding School Safety       Elizabeth Bombard: My topic is safety in schools. Safety in      schools has become a hot topic these days after all that has      happened in school in the past few years. Many schools around      the nation have heightened security to try to prevent any      more tragic events from occurring. The bottom line, the      shooting at Columbine really changed how safe students feel      at their school.       Colchester High School had to take safety measures last      year when repeatedly we got bomb threats. For about a week we      had to enter the school from the front doors and go through      metal detectors. That goes to show even small schools in      small towns are affected by this. Schools throughout the      country have started programs to try to prevent things like      Columbine from happening.       A school in Ashtabula, Ohio put together a group called the      Positive Education Program which helps develop social skills      and trust activities. This is a program that school officials      think could help include more students and prevent violence      from entering their school. Many people think they have more      opportunities for children to get involved to help lift the      students that do not feel included and may be the violent      ones.       Many other schools have also started programs including a      school in Tampa, Florida which awarded ``Stop and Think''      stickers at their own elementary school to children who show      exceptional good behavior. Many think this is more effective      than metal detectors and security guards. Even though nothing      extreme has happened close to Vermont, I do not think it is      too early to take safety measures to make sure our schools      stay safe for learning.       CHS has done a little to help open more doors to students      or things to do, some of which are CHS Cares and Through      Helpers. CHS Cares is a group of students who raise money and      goods to make baskets for people in our town that need help      around the holidays. This year we supplied turkey dinners to      many families in the community for Thanksgiving. Through      Helpers are sophomores, juniors and seniors who offer to help      under classmen with problems they have in school or socially.       I do agree with the many people who think more involvement      may help kind students. I also think that many problems with      children start right at their own home, but there are little      we can do about that. I think the schools around here do need      to make more programs and activities open for children to do      so they do not have so much free time. It should also include      transportation home afterwards for the students who do want      to do the programs but do not have parents home until late to      pick them up. Often the children who are causing trouble are      also the ones who do not have parents home until     late in the evening. Having more opportunities can try to      help prevent the problem of violence in our school before it      starts.       What I would like to see happen from doing this speech is      more funding in schools to try to have more clubs and groups      for students which includes transportation.                               ____________________
