When I told him Senator Mike DeWine and I had been successful on the Senate floor in putting in $180 billion more on the global AIDS fight, a big smile crossed his face.  Today, 42 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS--5 million were newly infected last year. We have seen 3.1 million AIDS-related deaths in 2002. Each year, AIDS deaths claim more than the entire population of Chicago. Life expectancy has dropped below 40 years of age in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS has already erased 15 years of progress in the worse affected countries. Despite our efforts to date, this epidemic continues its deadly spread across the globe. As the disease spreads, unraveling social structures and decimating populations, the national security implications for the United States multiply--in number as well as intensity.  Last year, the National Intelligence Council released a report supplying grave statistics for ``the next wave.'' In 5 of the world's most populous countries, the number of HIV-infected people will grow from 14 million to 23 million currently to an estimated 50 million to 75 million by 2010.  The disease infiltrates national armies, as well as the public sector, weakening the country's ability to govern and respond to regional threats. As the number of infections grows, the cost of fighting HIV/AIDS overwhelms national governments and competes for the same funds they need to maintain their economy and basic social structure.  Most governments face a lose-lose situation: Either they fight AIDS and underfund the infrastructures necessary to sustain continued immunity, or they continue to build the infrastructures while HIV/AIDS decimatesany progress, and they fall victim to it and watch their state crumble.  On every continent, AIDS is traveling along social fault lines and exploiting the weaknesses, hurting both lives and economies.  HIV/AIDS is a national security issue that is as important to our time as the war on terrorism. It is an economic issue, a health and safety issue, and it is a moral issue. Without comprehensive action, the HIV/AIDS epidemic will worsen, demanding even more attention and funding. That is why I introduce this bill to reset global AIDS as a top priority in this Congress.  The main purpose of the bill is to provide a comprehensive response to the AIDS pandemic and acknowledge the growing need for resources. In the form of specialized initiatives, my bill will focus on the growing number of AIDS orphans, the lack of health professionals in AIDS-ravaged countries, and the lack of access to affordable treatment for the majority of those afflicted with HIV/AIDS.  I have designed the Global CARE Act to achieve four major goals: Better coordination of our own agencies in fighting global AIDS; the provision of programs that address all components necessary to support a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS, including prevention, treatment, care, and investment in broader health systems and national economies; increased accountability for the health and policy objectives we will seek to achieve with our financial and human investment; and the ability to mobilize the most effective human capacity-building tools to address the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  Last year, I introduced a version of this bill which authorized $2.5 billion in global AIDS spending for fiscal year 2003. For fiscal year 2004, I have proposed authorization levels of $3.35 billion. The United States, unfortunately, only contributed $1 billion to fighting this epidemic in 2002. With the passage of the Durbin-DeWine amendment, the Senate allocated $1.525 billion in its fiscal year 2003 appropriations bills. This is a breakthrough--a 50-percent increase by the United States in its commitment.  But these funding levels are still far short of the goal. To meet the need, our target for fiscal year 2004 should be in the $3.35 billion range. Frankly, when you look at the world this year, the global need just to fight HIV/AIDS stands at $8.2 billion. Despite these good efforts by the United States, we can do more. But other countries in the world can do more as well. Let them join the President and the Congress in our commitment to this fight. We have been shortchanging this epidemic for too long. We take tiny steps in pursuit of a challenge that is racing away from us.  Because the spread of this disease remains in its infancy, we have to look at it in more serious terms. We must do more for the 42 million people worldwide who are living with HIV/AIDS, and we have to understand that the disease is not going to wait for our political determination.  A 15-year-old boy in Botswana faces an 80-percent chance of dying from AIDS. We have to change his future. To do that, the Global CARE Act addresses this epidemic aggressively and honestly. I hope this bill will provide a basic blueprint for the United States, and I hope we can join on a bipartisan basis in passing it. I hope my colleagues who read my remarks and follow this debate will believe, as I do, that the President has given us a great opportunity on a bipartisan basis to stand together and tell the world that this caring Nation is committed to dealing honestly and effectively with the global AIDS crisis.                                 ______                                       By
