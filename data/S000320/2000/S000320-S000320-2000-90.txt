 President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle dated May 21, 2000, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                             Select Committee on Intelligence,                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2000.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader,     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Senator Lott and Daschle: S. 1902, the Japanese Imperial      Army Disclosure Act, contains provisions affecting      intelligence activities and programs. This legislation, which      amends the National Security Act of 1947, would permit the      release of any portion of any operational file of the Central      Intelligence Agency. As you know, these are issues of      significant interest to, and clearly within the jurisdiction      of, the Select Committee on Intelligence. Therefore, pursuant      to Senate Resolution 400, we hereby request that S. 1902 be      referred to the Intelligence Committee for consideration.           Sincerely,     Richard C. Shelby,       Chairman.     Richard H. Bryan,       Vice Chairman.                          ____________________
