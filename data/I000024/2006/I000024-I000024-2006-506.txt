President, first, let me say to my friend from Alabama, I do not think we have ever been in disagreement on anything. I have a little different take on this issue than he does and a little different background because of an experience I had when I served in the other body.  First, I think realistically, looking at this, you may say ``in writing,'' but if you call your leader and tell him, ``I plan to go ahead and object to this,'' and he knows it is going to come in writing, unless you don't get along with the leader very well, I don't think that would be a real serious problem. But I do agree with the Senator from Alabama that passing laws is not necessarily a good thing. My feeling is we have too many laws, not too few laws. I have said that many times.  But let me share with you an experience I had in the other body. When I was first elected in 1986 to the House of Representatives, I found there was a process used to keep the signatures of a discharge petition from being open to the public. So there could be something very popular. For example, a gun control bill might not be popular in West Texas, but there might be a West Texas Democrat whose party tells him for the national scene, ``We want lots of gun controls, and I know it is not popular in the State, but there is a way you can go home and say you opposed gun controls and at the same time you can get by with appeasing the leadership.''  That is what they did. They would put the discharge petition in the drawer of the Speaker's desk, and you could not get it out unless a majority of people signed the discharge petition. Consequently, they would go ahead and tell people they had signed it when, in fact, they had not.  I had a one-sentence bill that totally reformed that. It stated that all signatures on a discharge petition shall become public record. We actually had seven editorials by the Wall Street Journal. We had all these things saying: Finally, there is light.  All I want--all I want--is to be able to have everyone being accountable for what they are saying. I have two holds right now, and I have said publicly that I am the one who has the holds. I have never, in the 12 years I have been here in this body, not specifically stated that I had holds when I did. So I think that is the main thing. There are similarities between the situation that occurred in the House, and I agree with Reader's Digest, the Wall Street Journal. They said that was the greatest single reform in the last 60 years.  So when I first came to this body, I made this statement: that it appeared to me that being able to put on holds without being accountable is a very similar practice to the inability of knowing what the signatures were on discharge petitions. Consequently, I started back 12 years ago working on this issue. I am very happy to join Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley in what I consider to be a reform that is badly needed in the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a November 1994 article in Reader's Digest by Daniel Levine be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Reader's Digest, November 1994]                How the Trial Lawyers Finally Met Defeat                 A story of democracy and Capitol Hill                         (By Daniel R. Levine)       When a twin-engine Cessna airplane crashed near Fallon,      Nev., four years ago, the National Transportation Safety      Board (NTSB) ruled pilot error was the cause. But that didn't      stop lawyers for two of the injured passengers from suing      Cessna on the grounds that the seats on the 25-year-old plane      did not provide adequate support. The seats had been ripped      out without Cessna's knowledge and rearranged to face each      other. But the lawyers claimed that Cessna should have warned      against removing the seats. A jury awarded the two plaintiffs      more than $2 million.       In Compton, Calf., a single-engine airplane nearly stalled      on the runway and sputtered loudly during take-off. Less than      a minute into the air it crashed, killing two of the three      people on board. On July 18, 1989, two days before the one-     year statute of limitations would expire, the survivor and      relatives of the deceased passengers filed a $2.5 million      lawsuit naming the plane's manufacturer, Piper Aircraft      Corp., as a defendant. Not mentioned in the suit was the fact      that the plane, built in 1956, had been sitting at the      airport unused and uninspected for 2\1/2\ years. The case,      awaiting trial, has already cost Piper $50,000.       The NTSB found that 203 crashes of Beech aircraft between      1989 and 1992 were caused by weather, faulty maintenance,      pilot error or air control mishaps. But trial lawyers blamed      the manufacturer and sued each time. Beech was forced to      spend an average of $530,000 defending itself in each case      and up to $200,000 simply preparing for those that were      dismissed.       Such product-liability lawsuits have forced small-plane      makers such as Cessna to carry $25 million a year in      liability insurance. In fact, Cessna stopped producing      piston-powered planes primarily because of high cost of      defending liability lawsuits. Thus, an American industry that      15 years ago ruled the world's skies has lost more than      100,000 jobs and has seen the number of small planes it      manufactured plummet from over 17,000 in 1978 to under 600      last year.       That may all change. Bucking years of intense lobbying by      trial lawyers, Congress voted last summer to bar lawsuits      against small-plane manufacturers after a plane and its parts      have been in service 18 years. The legislation will create an      estimated 25,000 aviation jobs within five years as      manufacturers retool and increase production.       This was the first time that Congress has reformed a      product liability law against the wishes of the lawyers who      make millions from these cases. And the dramatic victory was      made possible because of the efforts of a little-known      Congressman from Oklahoma who challenged Capitol Hill's      establishment.       On his first day in 1987 as a member of the U.S. House of      Representatives, Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.) asked colleague Mike      Synar (D., Okla.) how he had compiled such a liberal voting      record while winning reelection in a conservative district.      Overhearing the question, another longtime Democratic      Congressman interjected: ``It's easy. Vote liberal, press-     release conservative.''       This was a revealing lesson in Congressional ethics, the      first of many that would open Inhofe's eyes to the way      Congress really ran. He soon realized that an archaic set of      rules enabled members to deceive constituents and avoid      accountability.       When a Congressman introduced a bill, the Speaker of the      House refers it to the appropriate committee. Once there,      however, the bill is at the mercy of the committee chairman,      who represents the views of the Congressional leadership. If      he supports the legislation, he can speed it through hearings      to the House floor for a vote. Or he can simply ``bury'' it      beneath another committee business.       This arrangement is tailor-made for special-interest      lobbies like the Association of Trial Lawyers of America      (ATLA). For eight years, bills to limit the legal liability      of small-aircraft manufacturers had been referred to the      House Judiciary Committee, only to be buried. Little wonder.      One of the ATLA's most reliable supporters on Capital Hill      has been Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), powerful chairman of      that committee and recipient of regular campaign      contributions from ATLA.       The only way for Congressmen to free bills that chairmen      such as Brooks wanted to kill was a procedure called the      discharge petition. Under it, a Congressman could dislodge a      buried bill if a House majority, 218 members, signed a      petition bringing it directly to the floor for a vote. But      discharge petitions virtually never succeeded because, since      1931, signatures were kept secret from public. This allowed      Congressmen to posture publicly in favor of an issue, then      thwart passage of the bill by refusing to sign the discharge      petition. At the same time, House leaders could view the      petitions, enabling them to pressure signers to remove their      names. Of 493 discharge petitions ever filed, only 45 got the      numbers of signatures required for a House vote. And only two      of those bills became law.       Inhofe saw the proposals overwhelmingly favored by the      American People--the 1990 balanced-budget amendment, school      prayer, Congressional term limits, the line-item veto--were      bottled up in committee by the House leadership. When      discharge petitions to free some of the bills were initiated,      they were locked in a drawer in the Clerk's desk on the House      floor. The official rules warned that disclosing names ``is      strictly prohibited under the precedents of the House.''       In March 1993, Inhofe filed a one-sentence bill on the      House floor challenging the secrecy: ``Once a motion to      discharge has been filed the Clerk shall make the signatures      a matter of public record.''       The bill was assigned to the Rules Committee, where it was      buried. Three months later, on May 27, Inhofe started a      discharge petition to bring the bill to a floor vote. Among      those signing was Tim Penny (D., Minn.), a lawmaker who after      ten years in the House had grown so disgusted that he had      decided not to run for re-election. ``Discharge petitions      procedures are symbolic of the manipulative and secretive way      decisions are made here,'' said Penny. ``It's just one more      example of how House leaders rig the rules to make sure they      aren't challenged on the floor.''       Inhofe, though, was badly outnumbered. The Democrats 82-     seat majority controlled the flow of legislation. But he was      not cowed. From his first years in politics Inhofe had shown      an independent streak--and it had paid off. After initially      losing elections for governor and Congress. He was elected to      three consecutive terms as mayor of Tulsa,     beginning in 1977. In 1986, he ran again for the Congress and      won. Four years later, he bucked his own President, George      Bush, by voting against a 1991 budget ``compromise'' that      included a $156-billion tax hike.       By August 4, two months after filing his discharge      petition, Inhofe had 200 signatures, just 18 shy of the 218      needed to force his bill to the floor. But the House      leadership was using all its muscle to thwart him. On the      House floor, Inhofe announced: ``I am disclosing to The Wall      Street Journal the names of all members who have not signed      the discharge petition. People deserve to know what is going      on in this place.''       It was a risk. House leaders could make him pay for this      deed. But by making public the names of non-signers, he would      avoid a direct violation of House rules. Inhofe collected the      names by asking every member who signed the petition to      memorize as many other signatures as possible.       The next day, The Wall Street Journal ran the first of six      editorials on the subject. Titled ``Congress's Secret      Drawer,'' it accused Congressional leaders of using      discharge-petition secrecy to ``protect each other and keep      constituents in the dark.''       On the morning of August 6, Inhofe was within a handful of      the 218 signatures. As the day wore on, more members came      forward to sign. With two hours to go before the August      recess, the magic number of 218 was within his grasp.       What happened next stunned Inhofe. Two of the most powerful      members of Congress--Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman      John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rules Committee Chairman Joseph      Moakley (D., Mass.)--moved next to him at the discharge      petition desk. In a display one witness described as      political ``trench warfare,'' the two began ``convincing''      members to remove their names from the petition.       Standing near the desk was Rep. James Moran (D., Va.).      Moakley warned him that if Inhofe succeeded, members would be      forced to vote on controversial bills. ``Jim,'' he said      sternly, ``I don't have to tell you how dangerous that would      be.'' When the dust settled, Moran and five colleagues--     Robert Borski (D., Pa.), Bill Brewster (D., Okla.), Bob      Clement (D., Tenn.), Glenn English (D., Okla.) and Tony Hall      (D., Ohio)--had erased their names.       Still refusing to quit, Inhofe faxed the first Wall Street      Journal editorial to hundreds of radio stations. Before long,      he found himself on call-in programs virtually every day of      the week.       When The Wall Street Journal printed the names of the      nonsigners on August 17, House members home for the summer      recess could not avoid the public outcry Inhofe had      generated. With scandals in the House bank, post office and      restaurant still fresh in their minds, voters were      demanding openness.       Feeling outgunned, Moakley allowed his Democratic      colleagues to sign the discharge petition. When Rep. Marjorie      Margolies-Mezvinsky (D., Pa.) affixed her name to the      petition on September 8, she became the 218th Signatory.       Inhofe's bill won overwhelming approval on the final vote,      384-40. Even though most Democrats had not supported him, 209      now voted with Inhofe. Groused Dingell: ``I think the whole      thing stinks.''       The first real test of Inhofe's change came last May when      Representatives Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) and James Hansen (R.,      Utah) filed a discharge petition to free their bill limiting      small-plane manufacturer liability. Even though it was co-     sponsored by 305 members, the bill had been bottled up in the      Judiciary Committee for nine months. But because members'      signatures would now be public, voters would finally know who      truly stood for product-liability reform and who did not.       Meanwhile, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America was      pulling out all the stops to kill the bill. Members      personally lobbied Congressmen and orchestrated a ``grass-     roots'' letter-writing campaign in which prominent trial      attorneys urged their Representatives not to support the      bill. ATLA even fired off a maximum-allowable contribution of      $5,000 to Representative Hansen's opponent in the November      election.       The pressure didn't work. Within two weeks 185 members had      signed, and House leaders realized it would be impossible to      stop the petition. Their only way was to offer a compromise      version. In mid-June, Brooks reported out of committee a bill      that differed only slightly from the original. On August 2,      the Senate approved similar legislation. The next day the      bill cleared the House without dissent. On August 17,      President Clinton signed it into law.       Glickman, whose Wichita district is home to Cessna and      Beech aircraft companies, said the procedural change      spearheaded by Inhofe was crucial to victory. ``A lot of      forces did not want this bill to go forward,'' he continued,      ``and it would not have succeeded without the discharge      petition.''       The success of this legislation is proof that when Congress      is required to do the people's business in the open, the      people--rather than special interests--win. The high cost of      product-liability lawsuits, to manufacturers as well as      consumers, will require far more sweeping reform of the tort      system. But the passage of this one bill is an important      first step in the right direction. And it took a little-known      Representative from Oklahoma to point the way.
