President, this amendment addresses a subject with which we are all very familiar. In the early fifties, we put together a very good and effective Federal program to reimburse the States for revenue that was lost because of Federal activities--whether it was a military base or Indian reservation--anytime those properties were taken off the tax rolls. Yet that particular type of activity brought in additional students. It was set up to reimburse the local school districts.  It is called impact aid. It is one of the oldest Federal education programs dating back to the fifties. The rationale for compensation is Federal activity deprives local school districts of the ability to collect sufficient property and sales tax, even though the school district is obligated to provide free public education.  Since the early eighties, impact aid has not been fully funded despite the obligation of the Federal Government to make local school districts whole. We introduced some time ago a resolution that would do that very thing. It has the support of quite a number of Members of the Senate. In fact, I have a letter signed by a large number of Senators. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2000.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Labor, HHS, Education, and Related Agencies          Subcommittee.     Hon. Tom Harkin,     Ranking Member, Labor, HHS, Education and Related Agencies          Subcommittee.       Dear Senators Specter and Harkin: We recognize and      appreciate the support you have shown in the past for the      Impact Aid program. As you know, this vital funding source      for local school districts began experiencing a shortfall in      the early 1980's due to budget constraints. As a result,      critical needs have been and continue to be unmet.       We also recognize that although the budget is in balance      and there are now surpluses as opposed to deficits, funds are      not unlimited. However, we would remind you that the Impact      Aid program is an obligation of the Federal Government to      make local school districts whole for federal activities      which preclude them from collecting the necessary revenues to      adequately fund their schools. Thus, we would like to propose      annual increases in Section 8003(b) of the Impact Aid program      of 12% until it is fully funded in FY 2004. Specifically, we      would propose funding the program at 64% in FY 2001, 76% in      FY 2002; 88% in FY 2003; and 100% in FY 2004.       A 12% increase in Section 8003(b) of the Impact Aid program      in FY 2001, which constitutes the largest portion of Impact      Aid dollars, would not only provide needed dollars to our      local school districts, but would send a strong signal that      the Federal Government is committed to fully funding this      important education program. In some cases, every one dollar      of Federal Impact Aid frees up one local dollar to purchase      buses, do building maintenance or hire additional staff to      lower pupil teacher ratios. However, there     are school districts that do not have the ability to make up      the Impact Aid deficit because either they cannot afford it      or there are restrictions on the local taxing authority which      prevent them from increasing sales or property taxes to      compensate for the lack of federal contribution. In these      cases, needed infrastructure repairs, replacement of buses      and textbooks or additional personnel just do not happen      because there is no money. Continued under funding of this      program puts a unreasonable and unfair burden on our schools.      This inequity must be resolved.       We believe a phased-in full funding schedule is not only      doable but is fiscally responsible. Thus, we would      respectfully ask that you fund Section 8003(b) of the Impact      Air program at a minimum of 64%. Listed below, are proposed      funding levels for those sections of the Impact Aid program      that are of most concern to our states.
