 President, again to review the bidding, the only amendment that Senator Specter has remaining is the one that he and Senator Simon just debated. The Simon amendment listed as S. 1234 also drops because that has been merged. So Senator Simon has no other amendment, other than the pending amendment, left. And that would leave, as I said, again only for debate Brown and possibly Nunn, Biden, and possibly Kennedy, but I hope we can accept the [[Page S7763]] Kennedy amendment. I believe we will be able to accept the Abraham amendment in a moment.
