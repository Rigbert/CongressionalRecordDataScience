 In fact, I am from this very Chamber about 25 feet from here going to have a meeting with Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Reyes, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Conyers on proceeding to accomplish the objective the gentleman wants to seek and we want to seek.  As you also know, 2 days ago, we had a vote on ensuring the extension of the existing statute, not because we believed that was necessary but for an abundance of caution, and as the gentleman knows, every one of your Members voted against that extension on the demand that we do what you wanted us to do now. But in the protection that was available to you to extend for 21 days the protections you say are now going to be absent, every one of you voted ``no.'' I'm sorry that that happened.
