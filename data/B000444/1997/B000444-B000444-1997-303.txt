 President, there is no doubt a lot of women in their forties who are awfully confused these days about whether they should receive a regular mammogram to test for breast cancer. Over the last several years--and especially over the last couple of months--the debate in the scientific community and the conflicting scientific studies have not painted a very clear picture for younger women.  But, what is perfectly clear--what is not in dispute--is that older women should receive regular mammograms. Mammograms save lives. And, the scientific studies confirm it. If all women over 50 received regular mammograms, breast cancer mortality could be reduced by one-third. The recommended screening guidelines reflect this, no matter what group's guidelines you read. The American Cancer Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians all recommend that women over 50 receive annual mammograms.  Now, here's the problem. Women 65 and over have Medicare as their health insurance. The guidelines tell them--and their doctors are telling them--to get a mammogram once a year. But, Medicare pays for mammograms only once every 2 years. This means that an elderly woman must pay the cost of every other mammogram herself--or go without a mammogram every other year. And, even when Medicare pays for the mammogram, the woman is still responsible for at least 20 percent of the cost.  The result, Mr. President, is that too many women are following Medicare's payment rules--and not getting tested--rather than following the scientific guidelines--and being tested.  Two years ago, a study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It found that only 14.4 percent of women without Medicare supplemental insurance--that is, women who do not have, on top of Medicare, private insurance that may cover mammograms on an annual basis--only 14.4 percent of those women received even a mammogram once every 2 years, let alone annually. Even among those women with supplemental insurance, less than half had a mammogram over the course of 2 years. The study concluded that a woman's inability to pay a share of the costs for mammograms ``is an obstacle to the effective mass screening of older women for breast cancer.'' And, I would add, an obstacle to saving thousands of lives.  So, Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare Mammography Screening Expansion Act. This bill does two things. First, it would cover mammograms under Medicare once every year, as recommended by the guidelines, instead of once every 2 years, which is now the law. Second, it would eliminate the 20-percent copayment that is currently charged to women when they receive a mammogram, so that women are not discouraged from obtaining this important preventive measure because of the cost. I should note that eliminating the copayment is not unprecedented. Medicare already does not charge copayments for flu shots and most clinical laboratory tests.  Mr. President, we know that mammograms save lives. Yet, current Medicare policy creates barriers that arepreventing women from seeking this simple, life-saving procedure. I urge my colleagues to join me in making mammography screenings more available and more affordable for American women.                                 ______                                       By
