The debate has worked out well by going back and forth, showing the usual comity here in the Senate.  I began my discussion of Judge Alito's nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court with the same issue I began my questions to Judge Alito and, before that, to now Chief Justice Roberts: That is the issue of checks and balances on Government power. Obviously, the answers given by Chief Justice Roberts I found satisfactory. I voted for him. The answers by JudgeAlito, as I will explain further, I did not find satisfactory.  It is important because we are at a pivotal point in our Nation's history. This is a time of unprecedented governmental intrusion into the lives of ordinary Americans. The President has attempted to justify secret warrantless wiretapping of Americans, the evasion of legal bans against torture, and the detention of American citizens without due process of law. The Bush administration is making extraordinary claims of essentially unlimited power. There are troubling signs that this nomination is part of that effort by the President and Vice President to uphold Presidential claims of unchecked power and to upset the careful balance of our system of government, a system of government that was so carefully crafted by the Framers in our national charter, the Constitution. I have said I do not believe that Judge Alito would be that kind of a careful check and balance against Presidential overreaching. Because of that, I said I would not support his nomination.  I don't take this position lightly. There are nine members of the Supreme Court, seven of them nominated by Republican Presidents. I have voted for eight of those nine, but I will not for this one. I feel that the judge's record, his missed opportunities during the hearings to answer concerns about his record, leaves me to wonder whether he appreciates the role of the Supreme Court as a protector of Americans' fundamental rights and liberties. It is a test he failed. The Supreme Court has to be a source of justice. It has to be an institution where the Bill of Rights and human dignity are honored. It must be an institution dedicated to the mission embodied in the words etched in Vermont marble above the entrance to the Court where it says ``equal justice under the law.'' It must be an institution which carries on the spirit enshrined in our Constitution, refined following the Civil War, and realized further over the course of landmark decisions in Brown v. Board of Education and Baker v. Carr. Judge Alito's record and testimony demonstrate that he does not understand the vital role of the courts in implementing the constitutional guarantees of equal protection and equal dignity for all Americans.  A stark example of his failing the test took place during his confirmation hearing when I asked him a question Senator Specter had asked then Justice Rehnquist at his hearing to become the Chief Justice. I know; I was at the hearing. The question was a basic one: whether the Supreme Court can be stripped of jurisdiction to protect fundamental constitutional rights. I asked Judge Alito whether the Supreme Court could be stripped of jurisdiction to hear first amendment cases involving freedom of the press or freedom of religion or freedom of speech. The First Amendment is probably the greatest part of our Bill of Rights. I told him Senator Specter had previously insisted on an answer from Justice Rehnquist and that Justice Rehnquist had answered that it would not be constitutional to strip the Court of its jurisdiction, its vital function to protect fundamental rights. Unlike the late Chief Justice, Judge Alito responded as though it were merely an academic question. He said that there are scholars on both sides. He refused to state his view. This is a basic and fundamental issue for anybody aspiring to be a member of the Supreme Court. Justice Rehnquist got it right. For that matter, Judge Bork got it right. Judge Alito got it wrong.  When he failed to respond to my question, Senator Specter revisited it, but Judge Alito still failed the straightforward test. I asked the same question with respect to the fourth amendment, the fifth amendment, and the sixth amendment. Again, there was no answer. These are the constitutional amendments that guarantee our privacy rights, our protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, our right to due process, our right against self-incrimination, our protection against Government takings, and our right to public trial and to counsel. These are basic American rights that help to define us as a free people. They control the intrusiveness of Government power.  Judge Alito has shown through his answers that he does not appreciate the constitutional role of the Supreme Court as the protector of America's fundamental rights. In fact, in our system of checks and balances, the Supreme Court has to be the ultimate defender of Americans' constitutional rights. Judge Alito's refusal to acknowledge that in his answers is more than deeply troubling; it is stunning. It is stunning that anybody up for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States would not answer such basic questions. Suppose if by legislative act we could remove the constitutional right to freedom of religion or free speech how quickly we could remove our freedoms as Americans. Again, Justice Rehnquist and Judge Bork had it right. Judge Alito had it wrong.  I even gave him a concrete example. I asked whether in the early 1950s, Congress could have stripped the courts, including the Supreme Court, of jurisdiction to hear cases involving racial segregation in schools. This historical hypothetical raised the question whether the Supreme Court could have been prevented from deciding Brown v. Board of Education and enforcing the equal protection clause of the Constitution and calling for an end to unconstitutional racial segregation. His answer was no better. He was clearly stumped.  No Senator who truly cares about civil rights, equal rights, freedom of religion and speech and the press can have any confidence that Judge Alito understands the critical role of the Supreme Court in protecting those rights.  I ask unanimous consent that letters from civil rights organizations in opposition to Judge Alito's nomination be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Washington Bureau, National Association for the            Advancement of Colored People,                                      Washington, January 9, 2006.     Re NAACP urges thorough review of Judge Samuel Alito's          troubling record on civil rights & civil liberties during          Judiciary Committee hearing     Members,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As you are aware from earlier correspondence,      the NAACP is opposed to the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito      to the United States Supreme Court based on our thorough      review of his dismal record on upholding civil rights and      civil liberties protections. As such, we would urge you, as a      member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, to use your      position and your Constitutionally-mandated responsibility to      thoroughly review Judge Alito's record on civil rights and      civil liberties and to try to determine the extent to which      Judge Alito is likely to preserve the civil rights of      Americans if he is confirmed to our Nation's highest court.       The Supreme Court is, in many cases, the last opportunity      for many Americans to assert their rights and ensure the      protection of their liberties. Many of the civil rights gains      that have been made over the past 50 years are a result of      Supreme Court rulings. Thus, the NAACP feels that it is of      the utmost importance that any nominee to the Court is clear      about his or her intentions to protect the civil rights gains      that have been made over the past 5 decades and have always      been promised to us by the US Constitution.       Of specific concern to us from Judge Alito's past history      is:       In a 1985 job application for a position with the Reagan      Administration, Judge Alito disagreed in writing with the      Warren Court's reapportionment decisions now known as ``one      man, one vote'', which are among the Court's most widely      accepted decisions on civil rights and equal representation.      The ``one man, one vote'' theory is also one of the basic      tenets of Voting Rights that the NAACP has fought for;       In the 1993 case Grant v. Shalala Judge Alito ruled against      a class action alleging racial and other bias by an      Administrative Law Judge when determining Social Security      benefits, arguing that the Court of Appeals lacked the      authority to conduct a trial and make independent findings on      actions taken by an Administrative Law Judge for the Social      Security Agency. In a strongly worded dissent to the Alito      ruling, Judge Leon Higginbotham said that the decisions is      ``. . . effectively have courts take a back seat to      bureaucratic agencies in protecting constitutional liberties.      This . . . is a radical and unwise redefinition of the      relationship between federal courts and federal agencies.''       In the 1997 case Bray v. Marriot Hotels, Judge Alito      strongly dissented from a Third Circuit ruling and made it      clear that he supports impossibly high barriers for victims      of discrimination to have their cases heard;       In a separate 1997 case, Riley v. Taylor, Judge Alito held      that a prosecutor was not motivated by race in striking all      African Americans from the jury of a death-penalty case      involving an African American defendant. When the defendant      produced statistical evidence showing the prosecution      repeatedly     striking African Americans from juries, Judge Alito contended      that this was irrelevant and likened it to a study showing      that a disproportionate number of recent Presidents have been      left-handed.       In a 2004 case, Doe v. Grady, Judge Alito dissented from a      ruling against police officers who had strip-searched a woman      and her 10-year-old daughter while executing a search warrant      authorizing the search of her husband and their home.       In short, during the course of the NAACP's investigation      into Judge Alito's past we became convinced that he is unfit      to sit on the United States Supreme Court because race and      gender are still a real problem in the United States; a fact      he appears to neither recognize nor appreciate.       Accordingly, as I said earlier, I hope you will ask tough      questions, and demand thorough answers, during the hearings      that begin today on Judge Alito to try to determine even      further the extent to which he is, or is not, committed to      upholding and protecting the civil rights and civil liberties      of all Americans. On behalf of the NAACP, I would also like      to further express our strong opposition to the nomination      and our hope that you urge your Senate colleagues to oppose      and defeat Judge Samuel Alito's nomination. Please contact      me, or my Bureau Counsel, Crispian Kirk, at (202) 463-2940      soon to let me know your position on this matter, and to let      me know what I can do to work with you to ensure that      President Bush nominates, and the Senate confirms, moderate,      not extremist, judicial candidates to the federal bench.           Sincerely,                                                Hilary O. Shelton,     Director.                                  ____                                        National Urban League,                                                 January 10, 2006.     Senate Committee on the Judiciary,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: As you know, the National Urban League, Inc.      (``Urban League'') is the oldest community-based civil rights      organization in the country. Through our 102 professionally-     staffed affiliates, located in 34 states and in the District      of Columbia, the Urban League works to ensure, in a non-     partisan way, economic and social parity and full civil      rights for African-Americans and other people of color.       Nominations to the United States Supreme Court are of      particular concern to the Urban League Movement because of      the high Court's tremendous power and impact on the issues      relevant to our mission of securing civil rights and economic      empowerment for African Americans. Since the President      nominated Judge Samuel Alito, Jr. to be an Associate Justice      of the United States Supreme Court, the National Urban League      has carefully and exhaustively reviewed his judicial record,      judicial philosophy, and professional qualifications. Our      study found that Judge Alito has a long and unambiguous      history of opposition to critical and established voting      rights protections, civil rights remedies and social justice      guarantees. Our examination also established that Judge Alito      frequently injects this philosophy into his judicial      decision-making, often in direct contravention of well-     settled law. A copy of our report is attached.       Based upon this review, it is our conclusion that Judge      Alito's stated opposition to reasonable and established civil      rights remedies and voting rights protections, and his      consistent record of injecting these views into his decision-     making to the degree that it undermines basic civil rights      protections make him unsuitable for a seat on our nation's      highest court.       Therefore, we urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject      the nomination of Judge Alito to be a Supreme Court Justice      and look forward to working with you to ensure the nomination      and confirmation of judges who will uphold fundamental civil      rights protections.           Respectfully,                                                   Marc H. Morial,     President and CEO.                                  ____           NAACP Legal Defense Fund Opposes Alito NominationReport details hostility to civil rights and warns of tipped balance on                                High Court       On December 15, 2005, the NAACP Legal Defense and      Educational Fund, Inc. (LDF) announced opposition to the      nomination of Samuel Alito, Jr. to the U.S. Supreme Court,      citing his hostility to strong enforcement of civil rights      laws. LDF warned that confirmation of Judge Alito would      threaten to shift significantly the Supreme Court's      jurisprudence relating to affirmative action, voting rights,      employment and criminal justice issues.       At a press conference in Washington, D.C., LDF released a      10-page report detailing what it called an ``extreme''      judicial approach by Judge Alito that would demonstrably      impact important future decisions of the High Court. The LDF      report cites cases in which Alito has attacked congressional      legislative authority in a manner that his colleagues viewed      as extreme. As a Justice Department lawyer, he argued to      uphold police use of deadly force and undermine the rights of      criminal defendants. In the area of affirmative action, LDF      highlighted ``troubling signals'' that Alito would tip the      delicate Court balance to unravel policies ``at the epicenter      of the modern struggle for racial equality.''       ``We can predict with substantial certainty that Judge      Alito will very likely vote in a manner that, given the      current composition of the Court, will cause a substantial      shift in the Court's civil rights jurisprudence with      devastating effects,'' the LDF report cautioned.       Judge Alito is scheduled to appear before the Senate      Judiciary Committee in early January for confirmation      hearings.       LDF Director-Counsel and President Theodore M. Shaw      stressed that the organization does not relish opposing a      nomination to the Supreme Court and does so only when the      nominee's record is contrary to the goals of equal justice      that are the hallmark of LDF's work.       With the announcement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's      retirement last summer, LDF called upon President Bush to      nominate a successor who is not ideologically rigid and      predictable, but who is fair and open-minded, and committed      to protecting advances in civil rights. LDF emphasized that      Justice O'Connor's successor should not be a mission-driven      ideologue but, even if a conservative, should maintain the      balance on the Court with respect to civil rights issues.       To analyze Alito's record, LDF reviewed published and      unpublished opinions in cases decided by Judge Alito as well      as documents released by the White House and the National      Archives. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the U.S.      Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1990, Alito spent      his entire legal career at the Department of Justice.       LDF's report also reveals:       Unquestionably, Justice O'Connor cast pivotal votes in      civil rights cases coming before the Supreme Court. While      Justice O'Connor did rule against civil rights litigants, at      least her vote on important issues such as affirmative action      was ``always in play.'' In contrast, a review of Samuel      Alito's tenure at the Justice Department reveals that he was      directly involved in the Reagan Administration's frontal      attacks on affirmative action, arguing against affirmative      action in three significant cases before the Court. In his 15      years on the bench, he has ruled against African Americans on      this issue.       Judge Alito's record should be extremely troubling to      minority workers, women and others who depend on equal      opportunity protections in the workplace. Although he has      heard dozens of cases, Judge Alito has almost never ruled in      favor of an African-American plaintiff in an employment      discrimination case; he has never authored even one opinion      favoring an African-American plaintiff on the merits in such      a case.       Judge Alito's criticism of the Warren Court's      reapportionment decisions is extremely troubling. These cases      ``set into motion a process that led to the dismantling of a      political system infected both by prejudice and other forms      of patent electoral manipulation.'' In his only opportunity      on the bench to interpret the Voting Rights Act, Alito voted      to uphold an at-large system of electing members to a      Delaware school district, perpetuating an electoral system      that diluted the voting strength of racial minorities.       In the criminal justice area, Judge Alito has repeatedly      parted ways with his colleagues and failed to heed Supreme      Court precedent in important cases regarding race      discrimination in jury selection, the right to effective      assistance of counsel, and search and seizure issues.                                  ____                                      Lawyers' Committee for Civil                                             Rights Under Law,         Washington, DC, January 5, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy: As the Co-     Chairs of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,      we submit the enclosed ``Statement of Board Members Opposing      the Nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito as an Associate      Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States'' on behalf      of the 114 individual members of the Board of Directors and      Trustees who subscribe to the Statement.       These members of our Board oppose Judge Alito because the      record demonstrates that his views are in direct conflict      with the core civil rights principles to which the Lawyers'      Committee is dedicated, and that as a member of the Supreme      Court, Judge Alito would cast votes and write opinions that      would set back the cause of civil rights in our country and      impede our progress toward the goal of equal justice for all.      It is worth noting that in the Lawyers' Committee's 42-year      history, its Directors and Trustees have opposed a Supreme      Court nominee on only two previous occasions.       We also enclose a Final Report that analyzes Judge Alito's      legal philosophy pertaining to civil rights and      constitutional interpretation. This in-depth Report serves as      the basis for the conclusions contained in the Statement and      provides extensive analysis of Judge Alito's background. If      Judge Alito's testimony during confirmation hearings or other      evidence justifies a change in the conclusions we have drawn,      we will so inform you.       We hope the Statement and Report are of assistance to you      and your staff. For the reasons noted in them, we strongly      urge the Ju-     diciary Committee to vote not to confirm this nominee.           Respectfully,     Marjorie Press Lindblom,                                                         Co-Chair.     Robert E. Harrington,     Co-Chair.                                  ____                                              American Association                                       for Affirmative Action,                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2006.     Re Nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., as Associate          Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chair,     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: The American      Association for Affirmative Action (AAAA), an association of      equal employment opportunity (EEO), diversity and affirmative      action professionals founded in 1974, respectfully urges you      to oppose the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito, nominated to      serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.       AAAA has reached this conclusion based on Judge Alito's      very troubling record on equal employment opportunity and      affirmative action. In his 1985 application to be the Reagan      Administration's Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the      Office of Legal Counsel, Samuel Alito expressed his support      of the ``same philosophical views'' that he believed were      central to the Administration. In this application, Alito      highlighted his work as Assistant Solicitor General on      affirmative action and reportedly wrote that he was      ``particularly proud'' of his ``contributions in recent cases      in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that      racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed. . . .'' To      use Judge Alito's ``Hank Aaron'' analogy, affirmative action      requires not moving the fence in but opening the gate. After      that, it is up to the player to demonstrate his or her      abilities. Whoever selected Hank Aaron, Secretary Rice or      Justice O'Connor understood that the essence of affirmative      action is opportunity, not favoritism or quotas.       Judge Alito's application described the efforts of the      Reagan Justice Department to restrict affirmative action and      court-awarded remedies for discrimination as ``quota''      litigation. In one such case, Alito signed a brief arguing      for restricting affirmative action remedies, even in cases      where discrimination was intentional, egregious, and      longstanding. In Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers'      International Ass'n v. EEOC, the Solicitor General's brief      advanced the extraordinary theory that relief in Title VII      cases could be granted only to ``identifiable victims of      discrimination,'' contradicting an earlier view of the EEOC      itself. The Supreme Court rejected this argument.       In Local Number 93, International Association of      Firefighters, AFL-CIO v. City of Cleveland, Alito signed on      to an amicus brief seeking to reverse a consent decree that      included numerical goals for the promotion of black firemen.      By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court again rejected the Solicitor      General's argument and upheld the affirmative action plan.       In the months before Alito applied for a job with Attorney      General Edwin Meese, Meese waged a fierce campaign to have      President Reagan abolish Executive Order 11246, signed by      President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. The Order requires that      federal contractors not discriminate in employment and that      they use affirmative action. Ultimately, two-thirds of the      Reagan cabinet repudiated the extreme views of the Justice      Department and a coalition of corporations, members of      Congress and civil rights organizations successfully defeated      Meese's campaign against affirmative action.       There is nothing subsequent to Mr. Alito's tenure in the      Reagan Administration or his testimony before the Senate      Judiciary Committee to suggest persuasively that he has      moderated his views on equal opportunity law enforcement. In      civil rights cases he has often argued for higher barriers      that victims of employment discrimination would have to      overcome to secure remedies for such discrimination. For      example, in Bray v. Marriott Hotels, Judge Alito's colleagues      said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ``would be      eviscerated'' if Judge Alito's approach were followed. In      Nathanson v. Medical College of Pennsylvania, Judge Alito      dissented in a disability rights case where the majority      said: ``Few if any Rehabilitation Act cases would survive''      if Judge Alito's view were the law.'' And in Sheridan v.      DuPont, he was the only one of 11 judges on the court who      would apply a higher standard of proof in a sex      discrimination case.       According to a report of the NAACP Legal Defense and      Educational Fund, Inc., Judge Alito has almost never ruled      for an African-American plaintiff in employment      discrimination cases and has never written a majority opinion      for the Third Circuit in favor of an African-American      plaintiff on the merits of a claim of race discrimination in      employment. In each majority opinion authored by Judge Alito      and addressing such a claim, he has ruled against the      African-American plaintiff.       This is not the time for the Judiciary, a longstanding      refuge for victims of discrimination, to reverse fifty years      of progress. The record emerging suggests that Judge Samuel      Alito is not prepared to interpret the laws on behalf of all      Americans.           Sincerely,                                               Shirley J. Wilcher,                                       Interim Executive Director.
