As he knows from our work on the Senate Commerce Committee, I worked with the Senator from Arizona again and again because I appreciate his counsel and his wisdom. Yes, we have talked about this subject. We talked about it, in fact, the night that Senator Smith and I tried another effort to come up with a bipartisan approach that would satisfy the Senator from Arizona. Today, we do feel that we have to go forward and protect our constituents.  People in Arizona are, in fact, going to be protected. As Senator Smith said, the 939th is going to go to Arizona. That means the two Senators from Arizona, both of whom I value as good friends and worked with on many subjects, are going to have protection for their constituents.  What we have said is, now that Arizona is going to be protected, let us try another approach, an approach that is not injurious to the Senators from Arizona, so that our citizens, in an area where there are vast amounts of Federal land and great risks for our citizens, can also be protected. So it is in that context that I seek to have this move forward today in conjunction with Senator Smith.  Finally, as I yield to my good friend from Arizona, I want to say to him that I will continue to work with him on this issue and virtually everything else that conceivably comes before the U.S. Senate because I value his input and his counsel.  We have worked together on a whole host of questions. Now, if the Senator from Arizona desires me to yield to him, I am glad to yield to the distinguished Senator.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Oregon. The fact is I have never had a direct conversation with the Senator from Oregon on this issue. He knows it and I know it.
