She is superbly qualified, and once confirmed, she will be the first woman of color to serve on the Federal Circuit.  She has the strong endorsement of the non-partisan Hispanic National Bar Association as well as from the Federal Circuit Bar Association, and the American Intellectual Property Law Association. In its letter of support to the Judiciary Committee, the Hispanic National Bar Association, HNBA, wrote that their due diligence has confirmed that Ms. Farnandez Stoll ``maintains the highest ethical and professional standards. She is also competent and hardworking. Her litigation experience, commitment to public service, and temperament make her an ideal candidate for a court appointment.'' I could not agree more. So why did it take so long for the Republican leadership to schedule a confirmation vote for this uncontroversial, highly qualified, and historic nominee?  The President nominated Ms. Farnandez Stoll last year--nearly 8 months ago. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported her nomination to the full Senate more than 2 months ago. There is no good reason why her confirmation vote has been stalled over and over again.  Unfortunately, the Republican majority's treatment of Ms. Farnandez Stoll's nomination is more pattern than aberration. Six months into this new Republican-led Congress that was supposed to move forward on things and the Senate has only confirmed a handful of judges. In fact, it has been more than 6 weeks since a vote was even scheduled by the majority leader for a single judicial nominee. This glacial pace of confirmations is a dereliction of the Senate's constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees. Many are concerned that such treatment threatens the functioning of our independent judiciary.  We have 11 other consensus judicial nominations pending on the Senate Executive Calendar in addition to Ms. Farnandez Stoll. No one can credibly claim that the majority's slow pace in scheduling confirmation votes is due to a lack of nominees. This group includes another nominee who has received the strong support of the HNBA--Armando Bonilla--one of five pending nominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, CFC. Like Ms. Farnandez Stoll, Mr. Bonilla's confirmation will be an historic milestone--when confirmed he will be the first Hispanic judge to hold a seat on the CFC.  In less than 48 hours, the Judiciary Committee is expected to report out another HNBA-endorsed nominee, Luis Felipe Restrepo, who will fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Judge Restrepo was unanimously confirmed 2 years ago by the Senate to serve as a district court judge in Pennsylvania. I have heard no objection to his nomination, yet it took 7 months just to get him a hearing. Once confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second Hispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit.  If Senate Republicans had an issue with any of the pending nominees or if they sought time to debate them on the floor, some of the delay might be understandable. But no Senator has spoken in opposition to any of the pending nominees. In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported all 11 of them by voice vote. Instead of receiving timely consideration of their nominations, however, these uncontroversial nominees have not been treated fairly by the Senate majority.  There is a different way to lead. In the last 2 years of George W. Bush's term, Democrats came into the majority. Some thought we would slow up his judges. We did not. I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during those last 2 years of President George W. Bush's administration and we confirmed 68 district and circuit court judges during that time. In fact, by this time in the seventh year of the Bush administration, the Democratically controlled Senate had confirmed 21 judges--including 18 district and 3 circuit court judges. Compare that to this seventh year of the Obama administration under Republican control, in which the Senate has thus far confirmed just four district court judges this year. Just four. Now this is outrageous. It hurts. It politicizes the Federal bench. It hurts the rules of law in this country.  So under a Democratic majority with a Republican President, we confirmed five times more judges than the Senate Republican majority has allowed under their control of the Senate for a Democratic President. The disparity of treatment is clear, and it is wrong. Incidentally, that is the same way we did it when Democrats took over control of the Senate during the last 2 years of President Reagan's term. We moved judges at a much faster pace than anything Republicans have allowed us to do under President Obama. This is wrong. This is petty partisanship that hurts our independent judiciary. We are not asking for anything special but we are saying it would be nice if Republicans treated Democrats the same way we treated them.  We should also not forget the rising number of judicial vacancies in our Federal courts. At the start of this Congress, there were 44 vacancies, including 12 vacancies deemed ``judicial emergencies'' by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. That number has climbed to 63 vacancies, including 27 ``judicial emergency'' vacancies on our district and circuit courts. The vast majority of these vacancies are concentrated in States with at least one Republican home State Senator. Of particularly concern are four circuit court ``judicial emergency'' vacancies: two in Texas, one in Alabama, and one in Kentucky. Each vacancy has been left open for well over a year, including one in Texas that has remained vacant for almost 3 years.  All Senators know that it is our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent on judicial nominees. When it comes to filling vacancies on the Federal courts in our State, we have unique insight into our States' legal communities to share with the President before he makes a nomination. Americans expect us to do our jobs and in the Senate that includes ensuring their access to the Federal courts. I urge all Senators to work with the President to fill the growing number of judicial vacancies in their States.  We will at least make some small progress today as we finally take up Ms. Farnandez Stoll's nomination. Her extensive experience on issues that come before the Federal Circuit will serve the court well. She is currently a partner at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett and Dunner, a law firm specializing in intellectual property law. Ms. Farnandez Stoll also teaches as an adjunct professor at George Mason University Law School. Before practicing law, Ms. Farnandez Stoll was a patent examiner in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Ms. Farnandez Stoll received her B.S. in electrical engineering from Michigan State University in 1991 and her J.D. from Georgetown University Law School in 1997. Upon graduating from law school, she served as a law clerk to Federal Circuit Judge Alvin Schall. I trust that her background and the reputation she has earned in the legal community will serve her well as she begins this new chapter. =========================== NOTE ===========================     S4678, July 7, 2015, in the middle column, the following language appears: . . . law, Ms. Fernandez Stoll wa . . .

I urge the Senate leadership to act responsibly by scheduling votes for the other 11 uncontroversial judicial nominees still pending on the Executive Calendar.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
