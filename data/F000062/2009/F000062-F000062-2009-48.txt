 President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Javier Lopez-Urenda and his wife, Maria Leticia Arenas. Mr. Lopez-Urenda and his wife are Mexican nationals living in Fremont, California, and the loving parents of three U.S. citizen children, Bryan, age 16, Ashley, age 12, and Nancy, age 6.  I have decided to introduce this private bill to ensure that this family stays together because they have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to each other and the greater community in the Bay area. I believe Mr. Lopez-Urenda and Ms. Arenas merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  Javier Lopez-Urenda was born in Michoacan, Mexico. When he was 19 years old, his father was stabbed and murdered while working as a cab driver. In 1990, at the age of 23, Mr. Lopez-Urenda came to the United States to find a higher paying job to support his extended family. Leticia Arenas came to the U.S. at the age of 17 after her mother died of cancer. Mr. Lopez-Urenda and Ms. Arenas have now been living in the U.S.for almost 20 years.  Mr. Lopez-Urenda is the sole financial provider for his wife and three U.S. citizen children and owns his own home. For over 17 years, Mr. Lopez-Urenda has worked at Full Bloom Baking Company, a commercial bakery in San Mateo, California, and was the second employee that they hired. With Mr. Lopez-Urenda's help, the company grew to one of the largest commercial bakeries in the Bay Area, which currently employs approximately 385 people in the bay area.  Full Bloom Baking Company has stated:       Javier is critical to the operation of our business. . . .      He holds a tremendous amount of `institutional knowledge'      that can never be replaced. He mentors and develops Team      members, conducts training classes, and has deep      understanding of complex industrial baking equipment and is      an expert on how to produce wonderful artisan quality      products from the intricate interactions of formula, people      and equipment.  Mr. Lopez-Urenda's coworkers have also written to me about his value to the company. Coleen Donnelly writes:       I am lucky enough to have worked with Javier briefly at the      bakery he helped build from the ground up. I always knew he      was in the room before I saw him. His presence is such a      positive force. He has the natural ability to manage and lead      people and make it all seem like play, not work. Without      Javier at the bakery, the lives of hundreds of people will      change.  With the encouragement of his employer, Mr. Lopez-Urenda sought legal advice in 1996 in an attempt to legalize his status. However, the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act, IIRIRA, eliminated his ability to apply for suspension of deportation.  Mr. Lopez-Urenda also attempted to legalize through his employer, but the labor certification remained unadjudicated for nearly three years. Once the Department of Labor granted his labor certification, Mr. Lopez-Urenda could have legalized his status but for the fact that his removal case had already been resolved against him due to the change in law.  When the Ninth Circuit Court denied his appeal, the Court acknowledged the compelling circumstances of Mr. Lopez-Urenda's case. The court stated:       We are not unmindful of the unique and extremely      sympathetic circumstances of this case. By all accounts,      Petitioner has been an exemplary father, employee, and member      of his local community. If he were to be deported, he would      be separated from his wife, three U.S. citizen children, and      the life he has worked so hard to build over the past      seventeen years. In light of the unfortunate sequence of      events leading up this juncture and Petitioner's positive      contributions to society, Petition may very well be deserving      of prosecutorial grace.  Unfortunately, Mr. Lopez-Urenda faces deportation today despite his sympathetic circumstances and the significant positive contributions that he and his family have made to society.  These contributions to the San Mateo and Fremont communities have truly been exceptional. He is an active volunteer for the Women's Foundation of California, Lance Armstrong's Livestrong Foundation, the Saint Patrick Proto Cathedral Parish, the American Red Cross, and just last year he was one of the key organizers of the California AIDS Ride.  Ms. Arenas has also volunteered in the community as a religious school teacher at Our Lady of the Rosary Church, a health promoter at the Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, and a sexual assault counselor at Bay Area Woman Against Rape.  My office has received 46 letters of support on behalf of this family staying together in the community that they have helped build. Below are a few notable excerpts from the letters I have received reflecting the impact of this family on the community:  Patricia W. Change, CEO of Feed the Hunger Foundation, former President/CEO of the Women's Foundation of California, and a prior San Francisco Commissioner and U.S. Commissioner writes:       Mr. Urenda has always operated with the highest integrity.      Asking Mr. Urenda to leave the United States would deprive      his children of their father, an upstanding resident of the      country. It would deprive the community of an active      participant, leader, and volunteer.  The Bay Area Women Against Rape indicates that Leticia has been ``successful, available, [and] committed to the cause of breaking the silence of sexual abuse in our community.''  Judy Patrick, President/CEO of the Women's Foundation of California, writes:       Javier Urenda is fulfilling tremendous needs within his      community. He is a model participant in this society.  Christine Bozzini, a friend and former coworker of Mr. Lopez-Urenda, writes:       Javier strives to create a meaningful and rewarding life      with his children, focusing on supporting them in their      studies, as well as a variety of athletic pursuits and      personal interests. For example, over the last few years he      has taken great pride in traveling to various U.S. monuments      in order to teach his children about the birth of their      country.  One of the other compelling reasons for permitting these parents to remain in the United States is the impact that deportation would have on their three U.S. citizen minor children, Bryan, Ashley, and Nancy.  All too often, U.S. citizen children face the loss of a parent through deportation. A January 2009 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that, over the last 10 years, 108,434 immigrant parents of U.S. citizen children were removed from this country.  A separate report completed this year by Dorsey & Whitney LLP for the Urban Institute affirms what many of us know--the deportation of a parent is deeply traumatic and causes long-lasting harm to U.S. citizen children.  Mr. John Arthur Balano, Head Coach and Faculty Instructor at the City College of San Francisco, has known Mr. Lopez-Urenda through his volunteer work at Washington High School in Fremont, California. He has stated that Mr. Lopez-Urenda ``actively participates in the daily life of his children. Be it school, domestic, or extra-curricular activities, socialization and citizenship, Javier is always furthering their growth.''  In addition, Ms. Marlene Davis, the Principal of Patterson Elementary School, where two of the Lopez-Urenda children currently attend, has written me, stating that:       Mr. Lopez-Urenda and his wife are very involved in their      children's lives and school work. If they were not, the      children would not be doing as well as they are. I think      without his presence, the children would definitely fare very      poorly indeed both because of the psychological shock of      having their father taken away but also academically because      their mother would not be as available and one half of their      scholastic support would be missing. . . . This would be a      terrible strategy which could be avoided if the children are      able to remain in the same stable environment with two loving      and supportive parents who are committed to their children's      success.  Enactment of the legislation I am introducing today on behalf of Mr. Lopea-Urenda and Maria Leticia Arenas will enable this family to continue to remain in the U.S. and make positive contributions to each other and their extensive community in Fremont, California.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this private bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1747       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR JAVIER LOPEZ-URENDA                    AND MARIA LETICIA ARENAS.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of      section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.      1151), Javier Lopez-Urenda and Maria Leticia Arenas shall      each be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for      adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted      for permanent residence upon filing an application for      issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act      (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of status to lawful      permanent resident.       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Javier Lopez-Urenda or Maria      Leticia Arenas enter the United States before the filing      deadline specified in subsection (c), that alien shall be      considered to have entered and remained lawfully and shall,      if otherwise eligible, be eligible for adjustment of status      under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1255) as of the date of the enactment of this Act.       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only to an application      for issuance of an immigrant visa or an application for      adjustment of status that is filed, with appropriate fees,      within 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting      of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Javier Lopez-     Urenda or Maria Leticia Arenas, the Secretary of State shall      instruct the proper officer to reduce by one, during the      current or next following fiscal year, the total number of      immigrant visas that are made available to natives of the      country of that alien's birth under section 203(a) of the      Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if      applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that are made      available to natives of the country of that alien's birth      under section 202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).                                  ____                                     FullBloom Baking Company,                                        Newark, CA, July 20, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing you to ask for your      help to support my key employee and friend, Javier Lopez-     Urenda, and his family in their efforts to lawfully remain in      the United States. Mr. Lopez-Urenda's case is extremely      sympathetic. He had the misfortune of beginning the process      of legalizing his status in the summer of 1996. It was prior      to the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and      Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). As you know, IIRIRA      brought a sea of change to our immigration laws, which has      now left Javier, his wife and their three U.S. citizen      children facing the imminent prospect of being forced to      leave the U.S., essentially forever.       Mr. Lopez-Urenda challenged the retroactive application of      IIRIRA to his case, but the Ninth Circuit Court has recently      ruled against him. While the Ninth Circuit case was pending,      based on humanitarian concerns and his extensive community      involvement, he sought deferred action of his removal from      the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (USICE). He      requested that the agency exercise its prosecutorial      discretion to grant a request for deferred action,      considering Javier's immigration history, length of U.S.      residence, criminal history, and cooperation with law      enforcement, future admissibility, community attention and      humanitarian concerns. However, the agency denied his request      and has issued a surrender notice for Monday, May 24, 2004.       The Labor certification that my company, FullBloom Baking      Company filed for Javier on April 26, 2001, after 3 long      years, was finally granted on March 19, 2004. We immediately      filed a petition to immigrate Javier with the California      Service Center. Our lawyers have also filed a motion to      reopen and request for stay at the Board of Immigration      Appeals (BIA) for Javier, but I am told that it is unlikely      the BIA will grant such a motion if the USICE does not join      or does not oppose this motion. Therefore, I am requesting      that you call officials at USICE and urge them join or to not      oppose Javier's motion to reopen now pending before the BIA.      (Contact names and numbers attached). We acknowledge that      this type of action is only taken in the most extraordinary      cases, but as you will see below, Javier is an extraordinary      individual and a very well-respected member of his community.       Javier, a 42-year-old native of Mexico, first came to the      U.S. in March of 1990 and resides in Fremont, CA with his      wife and three U.S. citizen children, Bryan who is sixteen,      Ashley who is twelve, and Nancy who is six. In 1996, Javier      sought the advice of an immigration attorney and started the      process to legalize his status. Javier appeared at an      immigration hearing on January 29, 1999, where he attempted      to file for suspension of deportation but was informed that      because his court proceedings did not begin until September      7, 1997; he was not eligible for that relief. However, the      Immigration Judge remarked that ``[t]he Court believes that .      . . he would have been a good candidate for that relief and      appears to be a good person who would contribute to this      country in a meaningful and positive way.'' Javier appealed      the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), but      the BIA dismissed the case on February 14, 2002. Javier's      employer, FullBloom Baking Company, filed a labor      certification for Javier on April 26, 2001 which would make      him eligible for permanent residence, but the application has      not yet been approved. On March 15, 2002, Javier filed a      Petition for Review with the Ninth Circuit, which was      dismissed. He subsequently filed a petition for rehearing en      banc which was dismissed on January 2, 2004.       Javier has been a resident of the U.S. for more than 19      years, and has never departed the U.S. since his first entry.      He has worked at FullBloom for the past 17 years where he now      is the Production Process Manager, managing the transition of      recipes from the R&D bench top prototypes to fully scaled up      production runs. He supervises four line supervisors and up      to 210 production employees in the company's daily production      of more than 346,000 pieces of artisan organic and natural      pastries that are distributed to a wide range of grocery      stores & cafes including FullBloom's largest client,      Starbucks Coffee Company (Nationally). Javier is critical to      the operation of our business which has grown from an idea in      1989 to a run rate of over $55MM/year in gross revenue. He      holds a tremendous amount of ``institutional memory'' that      can never be replaced. He mentors and develops Team members,      conducts training classes, has deep understanding of complex      industrial baking equipment and is an expert on how to      produce wonderful artisan quality products from the intricate      interactions of formula, people and equipment.       He is an outstanding member of his community; Javier has      helped to raise money for     numerous local organizations and participates in the annual      AIDS Ride. He volunteers regularly with his son's swim team,      the local homeless shelters; Lance Armstrong's Livestrong      Foundation and is an active member of his local church. He      has absolutely no criminal history and has always attended      his court hearings and, with the help of his employer, has      tried repeatedly to legalize his status, but has been the      victim of changes in the law and a slow-moving labor      certification system. Moreover, Javier's removal from the      U.S. would render him effectively ineligible for future      immigration as he has more than one year of unlawful presence      and is subject to the ten-year bar to admissibility. Most      importantly, Javier's removal from the U.S. would cause      emotional and financial hardship to his family, especially      his three U.S. Citizen children. If his family remains in the      U.S. and he is removed, they would be unable to support      themselves, and more importantly, his U.S. citizen children      would be separated from their devoted father at a critical      point in their lives. On the other hand, if his children      accompany him to Mexico, they would suffer extreme hardship      in adjusting to life in a completely foreign country at the      ages of sixteen, twelve and six.       I thank you for your interest in and willingness to review      Javier's case. I will contact you to further discuss this      case once you have had a chance to review this letter. You      may also feel free to contact me at any time.           Sincerely,                                                  Karen Trilevsky,     Founder & CEO.                                  ____                                                    July 22, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: In February of this year, I stood      and applauded as you accepted the Anne B. Stanton Award for      Extraordinary Leadership and Dedication to Bay Area Youth      given to you by Larkin Street Youth Services. It was a great      moment, knowing the history of your involvement with the      agency and how it has allowed Larkin Street to survive and      flourish. As everyone knows, your actions were critical in      securing the future of this organization and the futures of      the many people it serves.       I am asking you now to consider another very important      intervention. Javier Urenda is set to be deported from this      country next week after 19 years of living here as a      responsible citizen. This action defies reason. He has a      family, a career, owns his home and gives back to the      community through volunteer work. He is exactly the kind of      person this country needs more of, not fewer!       I am lucky enough to have worked with Javier briefly at the      bakery he helped build from the ground up. I always knew he      was in the room before I saw him. His presence is such a      positive force. He has the natural ability to manage and lead      people and make it all seem like play, not work. Without      Javier at the bakery, the lives of hundreds of people will      change.       His family has relied on him to provide for them and he has      never let them down. The Urendas are part of their community,      part of what makes up this country as it has evolved. To send      him away is moving backwards. I urge you to take action to      reverse this destructive trend towards tearing apart families      that have the same right to be here as you and I do.       Senator Feinstein, this is a defining moment. Javier is not      the only one unfairly facing deportation. Many before have      been forced to leave and if this practice is left unchecked      many more will follow.       Please help. All of us who care about this issue are      grateful for your consideration.           Sincerely,     Coleen Donnelly.                                  ____                                   Feed the Hunger Foundation,                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am respectfully writing to you,      as a citizen, a prior San Francisco Commissioner and a      Commissioner of the United States, a former President & CEO      of the Women's Foundation of California, and the current CEO      of Feed The Hunger Foundation. I am writing in support of      Javier Urenda Lopez and urging you to allow Mr. Urenda to      remain in the United States as a lawful permanent resident,      eligible for citizenship to the United States of America.       Mr. Urenda deserves to be in the United States on both      procedural as well as personal grounds.       Mr. Urenda recently received an approved labor      certification (pending for the last three years), and is      finally eligible for adjustment of status. However, the      recently issued ``surrender notice'' takes effect on July 29,      2009. Had the approved labor certification been approved in a      timely manner, this current ordeal would have been      unnecessary. If the Board were to reopen his case, he could      adjust his status immediately and be a lawful permanent      resident.       I have had the honor and pleasure of knowing Mr. Urenda      over the past ten years as an employee of FullBloom Baking      Co., a volunteer of the Women's Foundation of California, an      active community member and a friend.       Mr. Urenda has, in the time that I have known him, been the      Managing Director of FullBloom Baking Co., supervising and      mentoring over 190 employees. His intellect, ability and      hunger to learn, and perhaps most importantly, his motivation      and spirit, has enabled FullBloom Baking Co. to become a      multi-million dollar business and a major contributor to      communities in California. FullBloom Baking Company is a      leader in the field of small businesses both in terms of its      treatment and advancement of employees, and in being a model      corporate citizen. No other company of which I am aware,      provides free bilingual courses in both English and Spanish,      computers, dentistry, a matching pension program, and      numerous gifts to all of their employees and to their      respective family members as FullBloom Baking Co. In      addition, this company contributes nearly $1 million per year      to the community. Mr. Urenda has made this possible.       I first met Mr. Urenda when he personally delivered baked      goods to the graduation party of 50 participants of the      Women's Foundation of California's welfare to work program.      Mr. Urenda could have sent one of his company's drivers to      deliver these donated goods. However, he wanted to support      those individuals who were struggling to gain skills and      become active contributors to the economy of this country--     just as he has done. Mr. Urenda has, since that time, become      a volunteer to the Women's Foundation of California, serving      on a committee determining which non-governmental      organizations would receive funding and assistance from the      foundation as well as mentoring young adults. Mr. Urenda has      always operated with the highest integrity. He is reliable,      hard working, and creative.       Mr. Urenda is an individual who contributes all of himself      to all of his endeavors. He has involved himself in the arena      of sports: engaging in five day bike-a-thons to raise money      for AIDS; running in races for his community and others; and      coaching swimming and soccer meets. He consistently takes      classes at night to improve his skills and resources in      management, business development, and in the arts.       On top of all that I described, Mr. Urenda is a devoted      father to three children of the United States who he is      teaching to be upstanding citizens of this country. Asking      Mr. Urenda to leave the United States would deprive his      children of his guidance, love, and mentorship. It would      deprive his children of their father, an upstanding resident      of this country. It would deprive the community of an active      participant, leader, and volunteer. It would deprive      FullBloom Baking Co. and its employees of an unparalleled      decision maker, manager, and mentor. And it would deprive our      country of an individual who lives up to the very values and      standards that make the United States a great nation.       If Mr. Urenda's family were to leave with him, it would      cause an extreme hardship to his wife and three children,      aged 6, 12 and 16. His children would leave the only country      they have ever known, to go to a country that they have never      visited and where they do not speak the language. Bryan, his      eldest son, would be unable to receive treatment for a      learning disability for which he has been diagnosed.       Thank you for your kind attention and assistance to this      matter. If you have any questions about Mr. Urenda, please do      not hesitate to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                Patricia W. Chang,     President & CEO.                                  ____                                                    July 21, 2009.     Re request for assistance in the case of Javier Lopez-Urenda          and family.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It is with the utmost faith that I      submit this letter to you, with the hope that you will      prevent a potentially devastating tragedy with exponential      ramifications from occurring by sponsoring a private bill for      my former coworker and friend, Javier Lopez-Urenda. It is my      understanding that at this time, the only hope for this      upstanding family man, leader, and community volunteer to      remain in the U.S. is through a private bill. Please sponsor      this outstanding person and prevent the senseless tragedy of      losing such a valuable contributor to our country.       During these past years of a complex legal battle, I have      often reflected on the irony that a person who so greatly      embodies the ideal citizen could be ejected from our country.      Javier is more than a model citizen. He goes beyond what any      average person would do to better his community, his      workplace, the lives of his family members, and himself.      Every year, Javier participates in charity events such as the      AIDS ride and the Providian Relay supporting organ donation,      as well as being an active member in his church and a      frequent contributor to many local food banks. At FullBloom      Baking Company, where we worked together for eight years,      Javier's leadership helped to launch the company and to      propel it into its newest phase of growth and success in a      new cutting edge facility, where staff and production levels      have recently doubled.       I've literally never known a more dedicated and loving      father. Javier strives to create a meaningful and rewarding      life with his children, focusing conscientiously on      supporting them in their studies, as well as a variety of      athletic pursuits and personal interests. For example, over      the last few years he has taken great pride in traveling to      various U.S. monuments in order to teach his     children about the great country of their birth. I can think      of nothing more destructive and unfair to Bryan, 16; Ashley,      11; and Nancy, 5; than to either face separation from their      father, or to be forced to leave their country of origin, the      only country they have ever known.       During the years I've know Javier, he has been a great      inspiration to me and many others, sharing his captivating      warmth, his compassionate support for those who need help,      and his passion for learning (English, French, neuroscience,      politics--you name it!). To this day, I attribute my fluency      in Spanish to him, telling people, ``Everything I know, I      learned from Javier''. The thought that he, a person who      exemplifies the spirit and the triumph of America, is      threatened with deportation brings tears to my eyes and keeps      me up at night. It is utterly unfathomable the extent to      which our legal system has failed Javier and his family,      leading to this urgent plea for your support to quite      literally ``save'' them.       Please help to prevent this potentially disgraceful tragedy      through your crucial sponsorship.           Sincerely,                                                Christina Bozzini,     Psychotherapist.                                  ____                                            Department of Physical                               Education, Athletics and Dance,                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.     U.S. Department of Justice,     Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Sansome Street, San          Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am exceedingly humbled by      opportunity to write this letter on behalf of Javier Urenda.      It has been my good fortune to know Javier the past 18 years.      During this time I have been continually astounded at his      remarkable embrace of the very values we all share as      citizens of our great land.       As a person commitment to his family. their wellbeing, and      Javier actively participates in the daily life of his      children. Be it school, domestic, or extra-curricular      activities, socialization and citizenship, Javier is always      furthering their growth. His belief in family as a solid      foundation, where meals and private time is shared. Javier      fundamentally understands that these critical, formative      years are critical to his children's future so that they may      fully embrace the untold opportunities our great country      affords our citizens. Javier's belief is that when children      feel truly loved in the home, with a solid foundation of      right and wrong therefore, creating an intrinsic obstacle to      the many pestiferous temptations that the youths of today      encounter.       As well, Javier is a good husband, who works hard to      provide not only the material but, assuring that there is      always calm, reason, and attentiveness. Javier affection can      be found in simply hand picking flower rather than the      ostentatious. I have witnessed thoughtful his response in      uncomfortable situations rather than pugnacious. Always      respecting and embracing the other point of view, nurturing      too, the love of his wife. It's that constant striving for      synergy that constantly amazes me.       As a member of academia, I am proud that Javier continually      seeks knowledge and makes time to further his education. He      fundamentally understands that knowledge is power and with      that, his affect and direct contribution to society      magnified. I subscribe to the notion that each and every      single citizen contributes to our society; and the more      knowledgeable the individual, society's enrichment as a whole      is not insignificant. In my lifetime, with extreme      confidence, Javier is a shining example to that end.       The strong sense of community in Javier is expressed by his      deeds. He was volunteer coach for me when I was the Head      Track and Field Coach at Washington High School in Fremont,      California. There, Javier assisted with the distance runners      who had many levels of athleticism and talent, His grassroots      approach and caring for each student/athlete as an individual      and maximizing their own individual potential made that      diverse group flourish. Beyond the track, they had the      highest GPA on the team. To this day, I firmly believe that      Javier's influence in embracing challenge and to look at it      not as an obstacle but, as an opportunity, played a      significant role in their academic success,       Holding dear the notion of our country's diversity, Javier      has participated in several AIDS Rides, personally raising      thousands of dollars to contribute to fighting that virulent      disease. Annually, he volunteered for a transition station      with the Providian Relay which supports organ donation. At      present he continues to support a myriad of other events and      community fund-raisers through his running and cycling      efforts. He lends time too, to the less fortunate in feeding      the homeless within the community. All the while, Javier      shuns kudos for his efforts and is embarrassed by any      attention as he believes that is what a neighbor typically      does for his fellow human being.       Penning this letter to you gives me great pride. In our      United States, during these very trying times, Javier Lopez-     Urenda is a beacon for responsibility, accountability,      compassion, and active citizenship.       I hope that I have conveyed to you my thoughts on Javier      and why he should remain a part of our country. He has      contributed to our society immensely thus far by being who he      is; a person with strong family values understands the      significance of education, volunteerism, and hard work in      making the United States the leader of the free world it is      today. It is those very tenets that many of us hold dear; yet      Javier embodies them. He has been encouraging to each person      he meets, be it in passing or those in need and a trusted and      loyal friend.       There are citizens in our land from all walks of life, from      every possible background and social status that comprise the      bedrock in continuing to make our country strong. Javier is      the type of person that makes us a better land and continues      to remain a shining light of limitless opportunity.       I pray that the good Lord will allow for the rendering of a      favorable decision to allow Javier to remain in the country      that I love.       Thank you so very much in allowing me to be a voice for my      dear friend.           Respectfully,                                               John Arthur Balano,     City College of San Francisco.                                  ____                                             Patterson School,                                     Fremont, CA, August 25, 2009.     Re Javier Lopez-Urenda.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein, I am writing on behalf of Javier      Lopez-Urenda's United States citizen children. They have all      attended Patterson Elementary School. Nancy, the youngest, is      currently in first grade this year. Ashley graduated from      sixth grade last year. Bryan graduated about five years ago.       The Lopez-Urenda children have sometimes struggled      academically, particularly Bryan. However, as a result of      keen parental involvement, they are doing well. Mr. Lopez-     Urenda has volunteered his time as a coach for after-school      sports that Bryan was involved in. Teachers have reported      that he and his wife are actively involved in their      children's school activities and meet with teachers in order      to support their children's schoolwork and try to help them      address areas of concern.       All the children have been a pleasure to have in school. As      an educator, I can tell you that I have witnessed the      spectrum of parental involvement from parents who are      actively involved in their children's lives to those who are      at best minimally engaged in their children's activities.      Javier Lopez-Urenda and his wife are very involved in their      children's lives and schoolwork. If they were not, the      children would not be doing as well as they are. I think      without his presence, the children would definitely fare very      poorly indeed both because of the psychological shock of      having their father taken away but also academically because      their mother would not be as available and one half of their      scholastic support would be missing. In my experience, that      void is generally filled with bad behavior, bad influences,      poor decisions and academic deterioration. With three      children who struggle in school already, I honestly cannot      foresee anything positive for the children in the future if      their father is no longer living with them and supporting      their academic milestones. Rather, I imagine it would be      quite possible that they would drop out or flunk out. This      would be a terrible tragedy which could be avoided if the      children are able to remain in the same stable environment      with two loving and supportive parents who are committed to      their children's success.           Sincerely,                                                 Marlene C. Davis,     Principal.                                  ____                                  Bay Area Women Against Rape,                                       Oakland, CA, July 21, 2009.     U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service,     St. Albans, VT.       To Whom It May Concern: This letter pertains to Javier L      Urenda and it gives me great pleasure to furnish you with      pertinent facts and information about this extraordinary      supporter of the oldest rape crisis center in the nation, Bay      Area Women Against Rape (BAWAR).       I have known Mr. Urenda for nearly a year. I had the      privilege of meeting Mr. Urenda through his wife Leticia      Arena at that time when she was taking our intensive state      certified rape crisis training. One of the things that is      crucial towards the successful completion of our training is      the support that trainees receive from their family members.      Not only are participants trained for three months, but they      are also in commitment to volunteer 36 hours per month for 9      consecutive months after their certification. I believe that      without the support that Mr. Urenda gave to Leticia during      her training and during her volunteer activities at our      agency she would not had been as successful, available or      committed to the cause of breaking the silence of sexual      abuse in our community.       In addition, Mr. Urenda not only gives constant support to      his wife's social responsibility, but he also is an active      participant in our fundraising events. Mr. Urenda has shown      to be a strong supporter for our walkathon in benefit of      sexually assaulted youth. Just last month, Mr. Urenda went to      his employer at Full Moon and bravely asked for an in-kind      donation of 500 delicacies to be given away to walkers the      day of the event. This came to BAWAR's great surprise since      we did not expect this massive contribution. Mr. Urenda has      far exceeded our expectations and by far surpassed the in-     kind donations that other advocates have tried to acquire      from local donors. It was for this reason that Mr. Urenda      holds a very special place in our agency.       To this end and without reservation, I strongly believe      that Mr. Urenda will be a wonderful and positive addition to      our community. If you have further questions or concerns,      please feel free to contact me.           Sincerely,                                                  Kristina Molina,     Latina Outreach Coordinator.                                  ____                         The Women's Foundation of California,                                 San Francisco, CA, July 22, 2009.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Women's Foundation      of California, we are writing to convey our support for      Javier Urenda to remain in the United States and become a      lawful permanent resident.       Javier is a vital member of his community who participates      at all levels: he is a hardworking and dedicated employee of      FullBloom Baking Company, a Newark, California based company      which did $58 million in business last year; he is a devoted      husband and father to three US citizen children; and he is an      important role model to community members and co-workers.      Javier was the second person hired by FullBloom and has      helped grow FullBloom to a company which now has 388      employees. Javier's dedication, technical know-how and      effective management abilities have been critical to      FullBloom's success. The local community has been well served      by FullBloom, which provides employment, health benefits and      educational opportunities to its employees and their      children. Javier's community would also be severely impacted      if it were to lose his volunteer efforts in his children's      schools and his tireless fundraising for charity.       The Women's Foundation of California has a long history of      supporting immigrants and immigrant communities throughout      the state. Through our research, grantmaking, and other      programs, we have seen many of the benefits that new      Americans give to our economy, society, and our overall      infrastructure. The state's economy would suffer tremendously      without the incredible achievements of immigrants.       Javier has recently received an approved labor      certification (which had been pending for nearly three years)      and is now eligible for adjustment of status. However, he has      been issued a ``surrender notice'' which takes effect on July      29, 2009. If he is forced to leave the country, he would be      barred from returning for 10 years causing his children and      his employer enormous hardship. If Javier were granted a stay      of his deportation order, he could adjust status immediately      and be a lawful permanent resident.       We understand that the Immigration and Naturalization      Service has established immigration policy to meet the needs      of this country and others. Javier Urenda is fulfilling      tremendous needs within his community. He is a model      participant in this society and deserves to remain here      legally.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                     Judy Patrick,                                                President and CEO.                                 ______                                       By
