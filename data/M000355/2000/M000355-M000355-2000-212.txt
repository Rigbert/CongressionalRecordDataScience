 President, I rise today to congratulate Mary Middleton of Covington, Kentucky, for receiving the Friends of Covington Award for Outstanding Community Service.  Mary is a devoted civic leader and volunteer in Covington and throughout Kenton County. She gives her time and energy to numerous activities at church, and has provided leadership for several Northern Kentucky organizations. Mary helped found the Northern Kentucky Interfaith Commission and was the first president of the area's Salvation Army Auxiliary. In her many years of service to the community, she also was president of the Covington Art Club, Booth Hospital Auxiliary, Church Women United, and the Mary Circle of the Gloria Dei Lutheran Church.  Mary's kindness and generosity does not end there--she also has been involved with the Heritage League, Northern Kentucky Symphony, Women's Health Initiative, American Cancer Society, Florence Women's Club, and the Friends of Covington.  Aside from being involved in civic and philanthropic activities, Mary has long been an active member of the Northern Kentucky Republican Party and a driving force for Kentucky's Republican women. Back in the 1960s, Mary helped found the Kenton County Republican Women's Club and continues her work there today.  Mary also deserves credit for the many successes in her personal life. She and Clyde have been happily married for many, many years and have showed enormous strength of character and have a marriage that is an example to us all.  My colleagues and I join in congratulating you, Mary, on yet another fine achievement and we thank you for the time and effort you have put into others lives. I know the people of Northern Kentucky will continue to benefit from your generosity for many years to come.                          ____________________
