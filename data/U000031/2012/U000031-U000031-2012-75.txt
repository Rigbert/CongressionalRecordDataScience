The reports      shall be published for public comment. After review of the      reports and receipt of public comments, the Secretary shall,      if warranted, adopt appropriate changes to the methodology.

Subtitle D--Accelerated Approval     SEC. 841. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-                   THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.       (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--       (1) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:       (A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this      subsection as the ``FDA'') serves a critical role in helping      to assure that new medicines are safe and effective.      Regulatory innovation is 1 element of the Nation's strategy      to address serious and life-threatening diseases or      conditions by promoting investment in and development of      innovative treatments for unmet medical needs.       (B) During the 2 decades following the establishment of the      accelerated approval mechanism, advances in medical sciences,      including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics,      have provided an unprecedented understanding of the      underlying biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease.      A new generation of modern, targeted medicines is under      development to treat serious and life-threatening diseases,      some applying drug development strategies based on biomarkers      or pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial      enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial designs, such      as adaptive clinical trials.       (C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical      advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more      broadly effective processes for the expedited development and      review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet      medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or      conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions,      using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and      modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle      when appropriate. This may result in fewer, smaller, or      shorter clinical trials for the intended patient population      or targeted subpopulation without compromising or altering      the high standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.       (D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and      effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs      for serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.       (E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on      the day before the date of enactment of this Act governing      expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening      diseases or conditions should be amended in order to enhance      the authority of the FDA to consider appropriate scientific      data, methods, and tools, and to expedite development and      access to novel treatments for patients with a broad range of      serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that the FDA should apply the accelerated approval and fast      track provisions set forth in section 506 of the Federal      Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), as amended by      this section, to help expedite the development and      availability to patients of treatments for serious or life-     threatening diseases or conditions while maintaining safety      and effectiveness standards for such treatments.       (b) Expedited Approval.--Section 506 (21 U.S.C. 356) is      amended to read as follows:     ``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-                   THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.       ``(a) Designation of Drug as a Fast Track Product.--       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of      the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and      expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether      alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the      treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or      condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet      medical needs for such a disease or condition. In this      section, such a drug is referred to as a `fast track      product'.       ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug      may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast      track product. A request for the designation may be made      concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an      application for the investigation of the drug under section      505(i) of this Act or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health      Service Act.       ``(3) Designation.--Within 60 calendar days after the      receipt of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall      determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request      meets the criteria described in paragraph (1). If the      Secretary finds that the drug meets the criteria, the      Secretary shall designate the drug as a fast track product      and shall take such actions as are appropriate to expedite      the development and review of the application for approval of      such product.       ``(b) Accelerated Approval of a Drug for a Serious or Life-     Threatening Disease or Condition, Including a Fast Track      Product.--       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may approve an application      for approval of a product for a serious or life-threatening      disease or condition, including a fast track product, under      section 505(c) of this Act or section 351(a) of the Public      Health Service Act upon making a determination that the      product has an effect on--       ``(A) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to      predict clinical benefit; or       ``(B) a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than      irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably      likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or      mortality or other clinical benefit,     taking into account the severity or rarity of the disease or      condition and the availability of alternative treatments. The      evidence to support that an endpoint is reasonably likely to      predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological,      pathophysiologic, pharmacologic, therapeutic or other      evidence developed using, for example, biomarkers, or other      scientific methods or tools.       ``(2) Limitation.--Approval of a product under this      subsection may, as determined by the Secretary, be subject to      the following requirements--       ``(A) that the sponsor conduct appropriate post-approval      studies to verify and describe the predicted effect of the      product on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other      clinical benefit; and       ``(B) that the sponsor submit copies of all promotional      materials related to the product, at least 30 days prior to      dissemination of the materials--       ``(i) during the preapproval review period; and       ``(ii) following approval, for a period that the Secretary      determines to be appropriate.       ``(3) Expedited withdrawal of approval.--The Secretary may      withdraw approval of a product approved pursuant to this      subsection using expedited procedures (as prescribed by the      Secretary in regulations, which shall include an opportunity      for an informal hearing) if--       ``(A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required post-     approval study of the product with due diligence;       ``(B) a study required to verify and describe the predicted      effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other      clinical benefit of the product fails to verify and describe      such effect or benefit;       ``(C) other evidence demonstrates that the product is not      safe or effective under the conditions of use; or       ``(D) the sponsor disseminates false or misleading      promotional materials with respect to the product.       ``(c) Review of Incomplete Applications for Approval of a      Fast Track Product.--       ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary determines, after      preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the      sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective, the      Secretary shall evaluate for filing, and may commence review      of portions of, an application for the approval of the      product before the sponsor submits a complete application.      The Secretary shall commence such review only if the      applicant--       ``(A) provides a schedule for submission of information      necessary to make the application complete; and       ``(B) pays any fee that may be required under section 736.       ``(2) Exception.--Any time period for review of human drug      applications that has been agreed to by the Secretary and      that has been set forth in goals identified in letters of the      Secretary (relating to the use of fees collected under      section 736 to expedite the drug     development process and the review of human drug      applications) shall not apply to an application submitted      under paragraph (1) until the date on which the application      is complete.       ``(d) Awareness Efforts.--The Secretary shall--       ``(1) develop and disseminate to physicians, patient      organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,      and other appropriate persons a description of the provisions      of this section applicable to accelerated approval and fast      track products; and       ``(2) establish a program to encourage the development of      surrogate and clinical endpoints, including biomarkers, and      other scientific methods and tools that can assist the      Secretary in determining whether the evidence submitted in an      application is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit      for serious or life-threatening conditions for which there      exist significant unmet medical needs.''.     SEC. 842. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS.       (a) Initial Guidance.--Not later than one year after the      date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and      Human Services (in this subtitle referred to as the      ``Secretary'') shall issue draft guidance to implement the      amendment made by section 841.       (b) Final Guidance.--Not later than one year after the      issuance of draft guidance under subsection (a), after an      opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall--       (1) issue final guidance to implement the amendment made by      section 841; and       (2) amend the regulations governing accelerated approval in      parts 314 and 601 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations,      as necessary to conform such regulations with the amendments      made by section 841.

(a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States      shall conduct a study to examine the cause of drug shortages      and formulate recommendations on how to prevent or alleviate      such shortages.       (b) Consideration.--In conducting the study under this      section, the Comptroller General shall consider the following      questions:       (1) What are the dominant characteristics of drugs that      have gone into actual shortage over the preceding three      years?       (2) Are there systemic high-risk factors (such as drug      pricing structure, including Federal reimbursements, or the      number of manufacturers producing a drug product) that have      led to the concentration of drug shortages in certain drug      products that have made such products vulnerable to drug      shortages?       (3) Is there a reason why drug shortages have occurred      primarily in the sterile injectable market and in certain      therapeutic areas?       (4) How have regulations, guidance documents, regulatory      practices, and other actions of Federal departments and      agencies (including the effectiveness of interagency and      intraagency coordination, communication, strategic planning,      and decision-making) affected drug shortages?       (5) How does hoarding affect drug shortages?       (6) How would incentives alleviate or prevent drug      shortages?       (7) How are healthcare providers, including hospitals and      physicians responding to drug shortages, to what extent are      such providers able to adjust care effectively to compensate      for such shortages, and what impediments exist that hinder      provider ability to adjust to such shortages?       (c) Consultation With Stakeholders.--In conducting the      study under this section, the Comptroller General shall      consult with relevant stakeholders, including physicians,      pharmacists, hospitals, patients, drug manufacturers, and      other health providers.
