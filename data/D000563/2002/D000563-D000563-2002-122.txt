I say to the Senator from Nevada that I heard from not only businesses and developers and unions but from ordinary people about terrorism insurance. There is a fear--legitimate fear--if we don't pass something soon, it is going to have a dramatic negative impact on employment.  We are already losing jobs. That is another issue the White House won't discuss. I have talked about national security and health care security. There is an income security thing, as well--not only the loss of jobs in this country but terrorism insurance plays right into this. What is the President doing? What is Congress doing? Can the President give us 1 hour a week on the economy, 1 hour a week on income security, to talk about what we can do to increase the number of jobs? A meeting in Waco, TX, in August for a day is not enough. It takes a bipartisan, honest effort and to engage the Congress in doing something. Let's pass the terrorism bill. Let's have the President call on Democrats and Republicans to get it done this week. We should do it this week. If we do not, we are not meeting our responsibility.
