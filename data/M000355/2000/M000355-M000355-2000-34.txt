 Bunning):  S. 3140. A bill to transfer administrative jurisdiction over land of the Tennessee Valley Authority within the Daniel Boone National Forest to the Secretary of Agriculture and compensate the Authority for the transfer; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.           kentucky national forest land transfer act of 2000  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Kentucky National Forest Land Transfer Act of 2000. The purpose of this legislation is to provide an equitable solution to a problem that exists in Kentucky--specifically, to allow the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to donate mineral rights, which it owns, to the Forest Service in exchange for compensation through the sale of other mineral rights in the Federal land inventory.  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to give my colleagues some background on this issue and why this is necessary. During the 1960's, TVA purchased coal mineral rights on land that was later designated as the Daniel Boone National Forest. Today, TVA owns 40,000 acres of mineral rights under the forest.  This past July, TVA announced that it no longer had a need for these extensive mineral rights, and announced that after a 15-day comment period, it intended to auction the rights to a coal operator to mine the land. In TVA's view, this was a way to get much needed funds to pay down the $26 billion debt which they have amassed over the years. Since TVA originally had purchased the land with ratepayer funds, they were unwilling simply to donate the land, and consequently defended their proposal to auction off their rights to a coal operator by arguing that they currently have the ability to mine the land since they owned the mineral rights before the forest was created.  As you can imagine, Mr. President, this proposal hit a nerve with Kentuckians, who were quick to express their outrage at the proposition that TVA could allow mining in the Daniel Boone National Forest. The Courier-Journal, in an editorial published on August 7, 2000, wrote that TVA's proposal was a ``rush to judgment'' that failed to take the public interest into consideration. The editorial went on to say that ``the best outcome, obviously, would be for the U.S. Forest Service to control the mineral rights under the acreage that it manages. And if there are legal problems to overcome in arranging that, the auction should be held up until Congress can remove them.'' Mr. President, that is essentially what my legislation will achieve. I would like to submit the editorial for the Record.  Well, Mr. President, both Congress and TVA responded to the public outcry. First, Senator Bunning offered an amendment to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill requiring TVA to conduct an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) before it could move forward on its proposal to auction off mineral rights. In response to that, a week later, TVA withdrew its auction plan, citing its concern that the proposal had sent the wrong signals. Despite these developments, the interested parties continued to press their case for transferring the mineral rights to the Forest Service, and again, I say, Mr. President, that is exactly what my bill will do.  My bill is a compromise solution that will protect the forest and protect TVA's ratepayers, by compensating TVA. This legislation is narrowly crafted to require TVA to donate the mineral rights under the Daniel Boone to the Forest Service in exchange for the right to sell other mineral rights owned by the Interior Department. Under this agreement, TVA will receive fair market value from the sale, which it can then use to reduce its burgeoning debt.  My bill has the support of TVA and the Forest Service, and is necessary inorder to implement the compromise which we have worked to achieve. This solution is based on the Mt. St. Helens National Volcanic Monument Completion Act (P.L. 105-279), which allowed for the acquisition of private mineral rights within the Monument through a swap. That legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It is my hope that my colleagues will recognize the merits of my legislation and pass it with similar support.  Mr. President, we are in the waning days of the 106th Congress and time is running out to implement this carefully crafted solution, which is in the best interest of Kentucky's citizens and TVA's ratepayers. This is a win-win proposition and I urge the Senate to expeditiously consider and pass this important legislation. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and an editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3140       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

But for what it's worth, we'll comment anyway: It      stinks.       Talk about a rush to judgment. Comment was shut off just 15      days after TVA revealed its plan to sell.       Given that it's at least a quasi-public entity, TVA      certainly ought to keep the broad public interest in mind      when it makes major business decisions. TVA should be able to      say what public good will result from selling these mineral      rights to the highest bidder, as if they were some tax      evader's living room furniture being auctioned on the      courthouse steps.       TVA environmental engineer Steve Hillenbrand defends the      sellout (and we do mean to invoke the word ``sellout'' in      both its meanings, the ordinary and the pejorative) by saying      the agency needs money. But on that basis just about any      outrage could be rationalized. Obviously there needs to be      some better justification.       Hillenbrand also said TVA wants out because these mineral      deposits are not in the Tennessee Valley.       Odd. The distance between Eastern Kentucky's coalfields and      the utility's service area never discouraged TVA's interest,      or its coal buyers, before. Indeed, for decades the Kentucky      River coalfield was stripped and augered, its watersheds      compromised, its resources depleted, its people victimized,      for coal to feed the power plants of TVA.       The story of coal barons and their work in Appalachia, on      behalf of TVA, would make a great book, if Upton Sinclair or      Ida Tarbell were still around to write it.       How can TVA simply turn its back on that history and      depart, with the proceeds of its auction?       One newspaper story about the auction said TVA wants at      least $3.5 million, and will sell only to those who agree not      to strip mine. But the legalities are unclear, and protection      for all the national forest land against stripping is not a      sure thing. Nor would such a restriction address the      potential impact of deep mining or oil-and-gas exploration,      which could be devastating.       The best outcome, obviously, would be for the U.S. Forest      Service to control the mineral rights under the acreage that      it manages. And if there are legal problems to overcome in      arranging that, the auction should be held up until Congress      can remove them.       Selling mineral rights to the highest bidder is not a      responsible policy. The National Citizens' Coal Law Project      is right to oppose it, right to call for a full Environmental      Impact Statement on the plan instead of some half-baked      assessment, and right to urge that, if all else fails, only      those with exemplary mining and reclamation records be      allowed to bid.                          ____________________
