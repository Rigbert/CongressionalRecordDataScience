Speaker, I rise tonight in special tribute to a beloved citizen of Ohio, Dr. Arthur Naparstek, a brilliant scholar, humanitarian, and community-builder. Dr. Naparstek dedicated his life to raising a beautiful family, teaching the leaders of this new generation, strengthening the communities in which he lived along with communities across our country and world, and giving voice to the most needy people in neighborhoods across our nation. To his beloved wife Belleruth, an amazing woman, to his precious children--Keila, Aaron, and Abe--our state and people express very deepest sympathy. We owe Art a lasting debt of gratitude for the exceptional manner in which he lived his life.  I first met Art and Belleruth during the 1970's when Dr. Naparstek worked with Msgr. Geno Baroni as the top policy analyst for the National Center for Urban Ethnic Affairs in Washington, D.C. This organization provided hope as well as technical assistance and analysis across urban America in some of the most forgotten, ethnically and racially diverse places in our nation. Through the Center, Dr. Naparstek embraced the nation during the tumultuous modern Civil Rights era and helped move her forward. Dr. Naparstek began his professional career in Gary, Indiana working as an advisor to Mayor Richard Hatcher, the first African American mayor of that city. Art was always looking for ways to understand the dynamic of urban America, and to build bridges between people of varying heritage. During the Civil Rights era, I think it is fair to say, Dr. Naparstek became one of the leading intellects that probed the nature of urban unrest, what to do about it, and how to rebuild America's cities, neighborhood by neighborhood. During the Administration of President Jimmy Carter, it was Dr. Naparstek who wrote the authorizing legislation for the National Commission on Neighborhoods, creating a national effort to document, understand, and share what was being accomplished across our nation to build interracial and interethnic understanding and to revitalize the back streets of our nation. Dr. Naparstek looked at poverty head on. He never flinched. His probing mind and gregarious nature lent an optimistic tone to every encounter. His pathbreaking work helped spearhead national legislation that followed in so many critical areas of American life--addressing the redlining of poor communities through passage of the Community Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the National Commission on Neighborhoods, and even welfare reform and culturally sensitive treatment for the mentally ill and the forgotten. His scope was amazing.  As professor and later Dean of the Case Western Reserve University School of Applied Social Sciences, he took his national legacy from works such as People, Building Neighborhoods and put it to work teaching a diverse student body. During the last quarter of his life, his efforts were applied to the improvement of Cleveland's needy communities, as he had done in so many other locations. During the 1990's, he served as director for the Cleveland Foundation's Commission on Poverty. He always applied knowledge to better the human condition. His rare dedication to the underprivileged became a lifelong mission. Born in New York City, the son of Polish immigrants, his career spanned the nation. He graduated with a master's degree in social work from New York University and a doctorate from Brandeis University Florence Heller School of Advanced Studies in social Welfare Administration.  One of the recent conversations I held with Art involved how to begin to build toward peace in the war ravaged Israeli-Palestinian situation. He was already deeply engaged in community development planning in that part of the world. I truly regret that we will not have his firm hand guiding us as we carry on his great vision for a better life for all people. He truly appreciated the valued variants of a common humanity. May his family find peace in the knowledge we are all better for his generous life, for his probing mind, and for his good heart. May he rest in peace. I might add, though, he would not expect us to rest at all. So, let us carry his good works forward. Shalom.                          ____________________
