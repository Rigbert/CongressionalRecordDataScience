Speaker, I rise to introduce H.R. 2174, Robert S. Walker and George E. Brown, Jr. Hydrogen Future Act of 2001, a reauthorization of the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996.  I strongly support continued hydrogen research and development. While serving as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Science I began consideration of this reauthorization, which has come to fruition today.  The President's National Energy Policy calls for a balanced energy supply portfolio--I completely support the President's recommendations. America's unprecedented economic growth and prosperity rests on an affordable supply of energy. And, we can all agree that reducing emissions and conserving resources is a good idea. For this reason, I continue to advocate the pursuit of greater efficiencies and reduced energy consumption in our industrial processes, in our transportation sector and in our communities and homes. The national energy strategy that will emerge from Congress and the Bush Administration will include all our energy options and hydrogen will have a place in that strategy. In fact, I am excited to report that the Bush Administration came out in support in my reauthorization bill today at the Science Committee's Subcommittee on Energy hearing today on ``Hydrogen and Nuclear Energy R Legislation.''  Mr. Speaker, I first became interested in the possibilities that hydrogen presents through my work with CD-CERT, an excellent engineering center at the University of California, Riverside--located within my 43rd Congressional district. CE-CERT is nationally renowned for initiating innovative programs to reduce energy demand and improve the environment. CE-CERT has successfully demonstrated a hydrogen vehicle, which has been well received. Additionally, Riverside County,also within my district, participates with a number of other partners in Sunline--a highly successful public bus fleet demonstration of hydrogen technology, which includes hydrogen infrastructure. Programs such as CE-CERT and Sunline show that hydrogen vehicles are not only possible but also practical. Programs such as these are critical to sustaining my district's growth while continually improving air quality.  For this reason, last year, while Chairman of the Science Committee's Energy and Environment Subcommittee, I considered sponsoring the reauthorization of the Hydrogen Future Act of 1996. 1 am proud to be introducing this legislation today, and I understand that Senator Harkin will also be introducing similar legislation in the Senate today.  The bill will reauthorize appropriations for hydrogen R at the Department of Energy  My bill is named after two former colleagues. George E. Brown, Jr., who honorably served the district adjacent to mine for many years--he was my mentor and good friend. I was proud to serve under Chairman Walker on the Science Committee and respected his leadership on this, as the author of the previous Hydrogen Future Act, and many other issues.  I am pleased to introduce this bill with 13 original cosponsors and I invite more of my colleagues to join me in support of this important, forward-looking R legislation.                          ____________________
