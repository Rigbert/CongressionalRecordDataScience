 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an educational institution that has been determined to create job opportunities and more easily accessible pathways to attaining professional degrees for Kentuckians, Midway College.  Midway College is a private school in Midway, KY, located in between Lexington and Frankfort. The school, established in 1847, has since created not only a rich tradition but a bright future for itself as well. Grounded in the golden rule, the school's motto is ``ama vicinum acte,'' Latin for ``love your neighbor in deed.'' And Midway College and its faculty are dedicated to living just so. The college has opened 14 different branches across the State offering numerous disciplines students can choose to study and thereby diversifying the type of student who could potentially enroll by constructing schools in an array of unique locations.  In 2009, Midway College president Dr. William B. Drake, Jr., along with attorney G. Chad Perry III, and his wife Judy Perry, had a vision to create a 15th branch of the college in a small Kentucky town. This new branch would be expected to not only strengthen the Commonwealth but the entire Nation as well. Their dream soon became a reality in January of 2010 when Midway College's board of trustees announced plans to open the Midway College School of Pharmacy in Paintsville, KY.  The small community of Paintsville is located in Johnson County, and, according to President Drake, they could not have asked for a more perfect location for the school. The town's citizens, who strongly care about education, got involved early with the project and stepped forward to ensure that Paintsville would be the right home for the school. The new institute of learning will not only offer over 100 jobs to an area that is suffering from high unemployment rates but will generate around $30 million in revenue each year.  The climate of our Nation is rapidly changing. As baby boomers age and are now in more medical need than ever before, Midway College is breaking new grounds in its attempt to combat the problem. Only four States have greater need of pharmacists than Kentucky, a State which currently has only two pharmaceutical schools. Midway seeks to provide an opportunity to students in the Appalachian regions of eastern Kentucky, in hopes that they will take their professional degree and return totheir hometowns across the Commonwealth and make a difference for those in need.  Eighty percent of Kentuckians are still without a college degree. The fight to educate citizens of Kentucky wages on, and with the help of forward-thinking institutions like Midway College, the future looks brighter than ever before. So today I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate if they would join me in recognizing the faculty and staff of Kentucky's own Midway College.  Mr. President, the Kentucky publication ``Discover the Power of Southeast Kentucky,'' published by the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, recently printed an article extolling Midway College and its president, Dr. William B. Drake, Jr. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      [From Discover the Power of Southeast Kentucky, Summer 2011]           Midway College President Dr. William B. Drake, Jr.       Anticipation is in the air as the new Midway College School      of Pharmacy prepares to greet its inaugural class. The City      of Paintsville, Johnson County, and people throughout the      region are excited about the arrival of students aspiring to      earn the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree.       Five years ago, the vision of bringing a pharmacy school to      eastern Kentucky began taking shape in the minds of      Paintsville attorney G. Chad Perry III, his wife, Judy, and      the administration of Midway College led by Midway College      President Dr. William B. Drake, Jr. One by one, the people      whose support was needed recognized the merit of the idea and      got behind it. One by one the obstacles to such an ambitious      plan were overcome.       In January 2010, Midway College Board of Trustees Chairman      James J. O'Brien, Chairman and CEO of Ashland, Inc.,      officially announced that the Midway College School of      Pharmacy would open in Paintsville. Local and state      government officials were on hand along with a large crowd      gathered for the announcement. U.S. Representative Hal Rogers      said, ``This project will bring a hundred good paying jobs to      the region during a time of high unemployment rates. It also      builds educational resources at home to continue the mission      of providing quality opportunities so our best and brightest      students don't have to leave Kentucky for professional      degrees and careers.''       In explaining why Midway College chose Paintsville as the      site, President Drake said, ``The citizens of this community      care about education and these citizens, as well as the local      public officials, have stepped forward at this unique time to      make this school happen.'' A two-million dollar campaign took      place in Paintsville to assist with the capital expenses of      building the new school. The school is expected to generate      more than $30 million in economic activity annually in the      Paintsville area.       President Drake said the college could not ask for a more      enthusiastic or dedicated community than Paintsville. ``They      understand the value of education,'' he said. ``And it is an      incredibly attractive place to work, live, and earn your      professional degree.''       Dr. Drake has been making weekly trips to Johnson County to      oversee the process which he says has been taxing but      worthwhile. ``It's like building a whole new culture,'' he      said, describing the many facets of expanding the college's      already sizable system of location. He called the projected      $20-million startup venture one of the biggest decisions ever      for the private college, whose roots predate the Civil War.       Founded in 1847, Midway College has a main campus in      Midway, Kentucky, which is located between Frankfort and      Lexington, and offers coursework in 14 different locations      across the Commonwealth. In addition to offering in-seat      coursework in both the traditional and accelerated setting,      Midway offers classes in an online format, providing      additional flexibility for students to have the opportunity      to obtain their degree. One program unique to Midway includes      an online bachelor's degree in Mining Management and Safety.      This is one of the only programs in the country designed for      those working in the mining industry. Midway College also      offers a Masters of Business Administration and will launch a      Master of Arts in Teaching this fall, both of which are      offered in an online format.       The new school is expected to fill a need for pharmacists      all across the nation. With the baby-boomer generation coming      into its retirement years, there is a call for pharmacists      not only to care for the aging populace but to replace those      ``boomers'' who are retiring from behind the drug counters      themselves. According to industry data, there are      approximately five applications for each opening at pharmacy      schools in the U.S., with even greater need in Appalachia.      Only four states have more difficulty than Kentucky in      filling pharmacists positions, and there are only two other      pharmacy schools in Kentucky--the University of Kentucky in      Lexington and the Sullivan School in Louisville.       ``Because of the number of students that apply to pharmacy      schools, we could fill enrollment with students from      California, there are that many,'' Dr. Drake said. But, he      explained, there is a special emphasis on drawing students      from the immediate area. ``It has been the intent of those      who care about the school that we look first and foremost at      the students from Appalachia'' he said.       ``As students graduate from our school they will meet the      pressing need that exists in Kentucky today for      pharmacists.''       Within a year of the official announcement about the      opening of the school, the process was underway to select the      80 students who would make up the enrollment of the first      class. More than 430 applications were received for the      coveted 80 spots. To date, 25 faculty and staff members have      been hired with an anticipated total of approximately 100.      The school's faculty salaries will be in the 60th percentile      of pharmaceutical faculty salaries in the United States.       When asked about the contributions of his staff, President      Drake said, ``Having a staff like mine, with such an      entrepreneurial spirit, has been like gold to me.'' The staff      includes Martha Jean McKenzie Wells (PhD, MsS) and Emily L.      Coleman (PhD, MEd) who are natives to the area. The school is      also honored to have Dr. Barry Bleidt taking the helm as its      Dean. Dr. Bleidt, who earned his undergraduate degrees in      Pharmacy and Environmental Geography from the University of      Kentucky, was formerly a founding member of Texas A&M's      Health Science Center College and left there as the school's      Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Associate Dean of      Academic Affairs. He has also held prestigious positions at      other pharmacy schools in California, Virginia, and      Louisiana.       The School of Pharmacy has a vision of expanding the scope      of pharmacy practice and elevating the level of care to      patients in all practice settings, with special emphasis on      eastern Kentucky and Appalachia. With that goal in mind,      Midway College has signed an agreement with the University of      Pikeville guaranteeing interviews to the top 10 students who      meet the academic qualifications. Similar agreements have      been penned between Midway and Eastern Kentucky University,      Big Sandy Community and Technical College, and Morehead State      University. These agreements not only benefit the students      through specific pharmaceutical instruction, but they will      allow all schools to share their academic resources. Hand in      hand with the University of Pikeville's School of Osteopathic      Medicine and other post-secondary institutions in the area,      Midway is looking to show the mountain communities the      diverse options that are available to them. With 80 percent      of Kentuckians without college degrees, the new institution      will offer a fresh new route, a route that's already proving      popular with students from the area. Fifty-five to 60 percent      of the incoming class is from the state, and even more from      adjacent mountain communities.       In keeping with the original vision of Midway and its      donors, the new pharmacy school is by Kentuckians for      Kentuckians, strengthening the region through strong ties to      surrounding communities and its renewed outlook to higher      education.                          ____________________
