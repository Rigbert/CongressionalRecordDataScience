Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the 20th anniversary of the Presidential Management Intern Program [PMI]. On August 25, 1977, by Executive order, President Jimmy Carter introduced and implemented this effective and constructive program, to encourage the best and brightest into public service.  Mr. Speaker, the Presidential Management Intern Programs have a mission to help build the character and credentials of our citizens. The Presidential Management Intern Program's goal is to ``Attract to Federal service men and women of exceptional management potential who have received special training in planning and managing public programs and policies.''  Although the requirements are strenuous, the lessons learned through this program compel individuals to reach beyond themselves and touch the lives of others. The selection process requires the recipients to have pursued a course of study oriented toward public management at a graduate level. The final selection of interns is made by the head of the government, agency, or component within the Executive Office of the President in which the intern is to be employed. No more than 500 interns can be actively engaged at one time. However, interns who display exceptional aptitude and attitude may be granted competitive Civil Service status.  Mr. Speaker, what is impressive is that over 3,500 individuals have served as Presidential management interns. Even more astounding is that nearly 50 percent remain employed with the Federal Government today. It has been said ``That the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.'' The truth to this quote is that the Presidential Management Intern Program is rooted in wholesome, educational opportunities. This program has promoted and produced opened doors for thousands of ambitious and bright individuals who may have never witnessed the privilege of public service. Today, Presidential management interns are active in all three branches of Government, ranging from the House of Representatives to the White House.  Mr. Speaker, it is programs like PMI which enhance, encourage, and empower the full potential embedded in the lives of people like these.  When we labor in the life of another our hours are never spent in vain but valiantly invested in tomorrow's leaders.  Mr. Speaker, and colleagues, please join with me in wishing the Presidential Management Intern Program continued success and congratulations on their two decades of helping young leaders reach their fullest potential.                          ____________________
