Speaker, on July 27, 2013 we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. By signing the armistice agreement, the border between the Koreas near the 38th Parallel was established. It was in the wake of this armistice that Holt International Children's Services first began its compassionate work, and today continues to be a leader in the field of adoption and child welfare issues.  Harry and Bertha Holt of Eugene, Oregon were from humble means--Harry a lumberjack and a farmer and Bertha a nurse. In 1954, the Holts went to a small high school auditorium to view a film about Amerasian children living in South Korean orphanages. Moved by the film, their faith and a firm belief that all children deserve permanent, loving homes, the Holts began their lifelong mission in 1955 to revolutionize intercountry adoption.  At the time, there were no laws allowing children to immigrate from one country to another for the purpose of adoption. Overcoming legal and cultural barriers, Mr. and Mrs. Holt sought families for children orphaned by the Korean War. The Holts persuaded Oregon United States Senator Richard Neuberger to introduce legislation titled ``The Relief of Certain Korean War Orphans.'' The legislation became law on August 11, 1955, enabling the Holts to adopt eight Korean War orphans: Joseph Han, Mary Chae, Helen Chan, Paul Kim, Betty Rhee, Robert Chae, Christine Lee and Nathanial Chae. With this act of love and the founding of their agency, Holt International Children's Services, two farmers from rural Oregon pioneered international adoption.  Today, Holt International strives to uphold Harry and Bertha's vision to find loving homes for children regardless of race, religion, ethnicity or gender. Holt is committed to findingfamilies for children, not children for families, an important distinction that sets the tone and priorities for Holt. Since the 1955 act, Holt has placed 49,630 children from 31 countries with families in all fifty states. As the oldest intercountry adoption agency, Holt is the only organization that has more than three generations of adult adoptees.  Holt continues to play an active and vital role in establishing policy and practice for intercountry adoption. In 1993, Holt adoptees Susan Cox and David Kim were members of the U.S. delegation to the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, an agreement which sets international standards for intercountry adoption that protects the child, the birth family and the adoptive family. Later, in 2008, Holt was a leading advocate in ensuring the U.S. ratify the Hague treaty. Holt believes that adoption is a life long experience and has been at the forefront of developing post adoption services to ensure that adoptees grow and develop to their fullest potential.  In addition to these monumental accomplishments, Holt International has become much more than an adoption agency. When considering a child's future, Holt always keeps the child's best interest at the forefront of every decision. For some children adoption is the only option, but Holt realizes that it is not the first option for children without families. Holt believes that it is best if children can stay with their birth family. Over the years, Holt has worked to develop and maintain programs overseas to give orphaned, abandoned and vulnerable children safe and nurturing environments in which to grow and thrive. These overseas programs include initiatives directed at Family Preservation, Nutrition Support, Child and Maternal Health, Income Generation, Assisting Children with Special Needs, and Shaping and Establishing Intercountry Child Welfare Systems. Through these initiatives, Holt impacts approximately thirty thousand children each year and helps to ensure that children at all stages of need are provided for in an effort to avoid the separation of families.  In November, as we celebrate National Adoption Month, it is appropriate to recognize Holt International Children's Services for its diligent efforts and accomplishments in the field of child-welfare and intercountry adoption that have impacted thousands of children in the United States and around the world.                          ____________________
