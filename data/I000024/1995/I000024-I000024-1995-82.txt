President, I have been told, and we hear over and over again that we have lost the war on words on the Republican side and that this, what has now become known as the ``big lie'' around the country, is selling; that people are buying the idea that the Republicans are cutting Medicare and giving tax credits and tax relief for the very wealthy.  Of course, this just is not true. I come here with a message of hope this morning, because I really believe that the American people will catch on. We are going to go through the same thing we went through a couple years ago when they were talking about socializing medicine. I am not nearly as distressed as other people are because we have time, time works in our favor, we have logic on our side, and we are seeing some things happening right now that I get really quite excited about.  The other day, I picked up an editorial that was in the Washington Post. Mr. President, we are talking about the Washington Post now. This is not the Limbaugh Letter and this is not the Human Events, this is the Washington Post. Generally, the Washington Post is more liberal on their editorial outlook. If anything, they are more on the Democratic side than the Republican side.  The editorial is called ``Meda- gogues.'' This is really a kind of neat article. The first paragraph says. I will paraphrase it:       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole accused the Democrats and their      allies yesterday of conducting a campaign based on distortion      and fear . . . They're right; that's precisely what the      Democrats are doing--it's pretty much all they're doing--and      it's--  A crummy idea.  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial, entitled ``Medagogues,'' printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Medagogues       Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole accused the Democrats and their      allies yesterday of conducting a campaign based on distortion      and fear to block the cuts in projected Medicare spending      that are the core of the Republican effort to balance the      budget in the next seven years. They're right; that's      precisely what the Democrats are doing--it's pretty much all      they're doing--and it's crummy stuff.       There's plenty to be said about the proposals the      Republicans are making; there's a legitimate debate to be had      about what ought to be the future of Medicare and federal aid      to the elderly generally. But that's not what the Democrats      are engaged in. They're engaged in demagoguery, big time. And      it's wrong--as wrong on their part now as it was a year ago      when other people did it to them on some of the same health      care issues. Then, they were the ones who indignantly      complained.       Medicare and Medicaid costs have got to be controlled, as      do health care costs in the economy generally. The federal      programs represent a double whammy, because they, more than      any other factor, account for the budget deficits projected      for the years ahead. They are therefore driving up interest      costs even as they continue to rise powerfully themselves.      But figuring out how to contain them is enormously difficult.      More than a fourth of the population depends on the programs      for health care; hospitals and other health care institutions      depend on them for income; and you cut their costs with care.      Politically, Medicare is especially hard to deal with because      the elderly--and their children who must help care for them      to the extent the government doesn't--are so potent a voting      bloc.       The congressional Republicans have confounded the skeptics      who said they would never attack a program benefiting the      broad middle class. They have come up with a plan to cut      projected Medicare costs by (depending on whose estimates you      believe) anywhere from $190 billion to $270 billion over the      seven-year period. It's true that they're also proposing a      large and indiscriminate tax cut that is a bad idea and that      the Medicare cuts would indirectly help to finance. And it's      true that their cost-cutting plan would do--in our judgment--     some harm as well as good.       But they have a plan. Enough is known about it to say it's      credible; it's gutsy and in some respects inventive--and it      addresses a genuine problem that is only going to get worse.      What the Democrats have instead is a lot of expostulation, TV      ads and scare talk. The fight is about ``what's going to      happen to the senior citizens in this country,'' Dick      Gephardt said yesterday. ``The rural hospitals. The community      health centers. The teaching hospitals . . .'' The      Republicans ``are going to decimate [Medicare] for a tax      break for the wealthiest people, take it right out of the      pockets of senior citizens. . . .'' The American people      ``don't want to lose their Medicare. They don't want Medicare      costs to be increased by $1,000 a person. They      don't want to lose the choice of their doctor.''       But there isn't any evidence that they would ``lose their      Medicare'' or lose their choice of doctor under the      Republican plan. If the program isn't to become less generous      over time, how do the Democrats propose to finance it and      continue as well to finance the rest of the federal      activities they espouse? That's the question. You listen in      vain for a real response. It's irresponsible.
