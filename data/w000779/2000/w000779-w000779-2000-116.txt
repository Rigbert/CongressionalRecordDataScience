President, before I go on to touch on the issue of prescription drugs for a few moments, I, too, join with the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the minority whip, Senator Reid, in congratulating Senator Byrd on the anniversary of his Senate service.  I think what is especially striking about Senator Byrd's contributions is that when so many get tired, and so many get frustrated and exasperated with public service--we all know there is plenty in which you can be frustrated about--Senator Byrd does not give up. He does not flinch from the kinds of travails of public service. He seems to get stronger and stronger.  Those of us who watch him and seek him out for his counsel very much appreciate his contributions to the Senate. But this Senator especially appreciates one of his traits, which I think is the hallmark of being successful in any field, and that is his persistence. He is persistent about public service. He is persistent about upholding the standards of the Senate.  I join with the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the minority whip in congratulating our friend and colleague, Senator Byrd.                          ____________________
