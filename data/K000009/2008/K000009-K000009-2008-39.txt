 On behalf of the American people and certainly the citizens of Ohio who remain extremely proud of John Werth and his colleagues and his air controller associates across our country, please let the record show we extend our abiding thanks on this historic day. We extend our deep remembrances to the families and communities still affected. And we ask God to bless America and help us lead the world to a more peaceful day.                    [From USA Today, Sept. 11, 2008]                7 Years Later, the Terror Is Still Vivid                            (By Alan Levin)       Oberlin, Ohio--He spent most of his life controlling      airplanes. But on this day seven years ago, United Flight 93      was beyond control.       Cleveland Center air-traffic controller John Werth had      never heard anything like it--the sounds of an animalistic      struggle crackling over his radio. He heard screaming,      hollering and two guttural groans coming from the cockpit.       The horror of one of the four 9/11 suicide hijackings was      playing out, Werth tells USA Today in his first public      recounting of the day that forever changed America.       ``I lost 40 people that day,'' Werth says of the desperate      efforts he and his colleagues made to communicate with Flight      93 and keep other planes away from it until the jet crashed      in a rural Pennsylvania field.       Today, the story of that flight is well known--in books,      movies and tales of heroism about the passengers who tried to      retake the jet from four al-Qaeda terrorists, and probably      prevented an attack on the White House or U.S. Capitol. For      Werth, it's been a vivid--if largely private--reality. He was      there. He heard it all.       Werth's account provides new details about what happened as      the hijacking unfolded and how the chaos in the skies caused      alarm and confusion for controllers and national security      forces.       For seven years, Werth, 61, hasn't told his story publicly,      initially because he was not allowed to because of a      government subpoena related to the prosecution of al-Qaeda      operative Zacarias Moussaoui, and later because Werth didn't      want the attention. Now, Werth's ready to discuss it and set      the record straight.       It was Werth who heard the transmission from Flight 93 that      suggested a bomb was aboard. The transmission, in a thick      accent and broken English, likely was from hijacker pilot      Ziad Jarrah, the 9/11 Commission determined later.       The bomb was apparently a bluff, a threat the hijackers      used to try to control the passengers.       At the time, Werth says, it created a new level of alarm      among the controllers clearing other planes out of the      wayward path of Flight 93, which had departed from Newark,      N.J., that morning and flown into Ohio before making a U-turn      toward Washington.       What if, Werth wondered, the hijackers had a bomb--maybe      even a nuclear device? How far would Werth have to keep other      jets from a nuclear bomb's shock wave? Twenty miles? Thirty?       Every time Werth turned other planes away from Flight 93,      the hijacked jet seemed to surge toward them, he recalls,      raising questions about what the hijackers were trying to do.      At the time, he knew that some passenger jets were missing      and that one had hit a World Trade Center tower in New York.       ``I'm saying, `What is he doing?' '' Werth recalls. `` `Is      this about a midair collision.' '' an attempt to ram another      passenger jet with Flight 93?       All the while, uncertainty gripped the nation--and      Cleveland Center, which oversees a wide swath of the nation's      skies between Chicago and New York.                      ``Something was really off''       That morning began routinely for Werth as he sat in front      of his radar screen and radio, surrounded by maps and      computers. Soon, the news began trickling down to him.       Two jets were ``lost'' over New York. Someone said a small      plane (actually a jet, it turned out) had hit the World Trade      Center in New York. A supervisor told him to try to contact      American Airlines Flight 77, which had gone missing over      Kentucky.       ``That's when I knew something was really off,'' he says.       He was also told to keep an eye on Delta Air Lines Flight      1989, which had taken off from Boston. Amid the confusion,      controllers in Boston worried it was connected to the jets      missing in New York. Those jets, American Airlines Flight 11      and United 175, also had departed from Boston.       Finally came word that a second plane, a large jet, had hit      New York's twin towers.       The pilots of Flight 93, headed west to San Francisco from      Newark, arrived at 9:24 a.m. in Werth's control sector, a      roughly 100-by-100-mile patch in the Cleveland area that      handles only high-altitude traffic. The Boeing 757 carried      seven crewmembers and 37 passengers, including the four      hijackers. Within four minutes of arriving in Werth's sector,      according to the 9/11 Commission Report and other government      documents, the hijackers had launched a violent takeover of      the jet.       During the struggle, one of the pilots tried to make a      distress call or inadvertently switched on the radio's      microphone, allowing Werth and other planes in the area to      overhear what was happening aboard Flight 93.       Werth says most of the sounds of the struggle were      unintelligible. There were screams and groans. Werth recalls      turning to another controller. ``I looked at him and said,      `Dave, did that sound the same to you as it did to me?' He      just kind of looked at me wide-eyed and nodded.''       He knew another flight was probably under attach, but which      one? ``Somebody call Cleveland?'' he radioed. No one replied.       Thirty-three seconds later came a second broadcast from the      cockpit. It also had the sounds of a struggle, but this time      Werth made out a few words: ``Get out of here. Get out of      here.''       About that time, Flight 93 descended about 700 feet. By      then, Werth was pretty sure the flight had been hijacked.      What were the hijackers up to? Why do they want to be over      Cleveland? Why are they this far west? I thought at first,      well, you've got the Sears Tower (in Chicago) straight      west,'' he says.       There were no procedures or training exercises for such an      emergency, Werth says, so he made it up as he went along. He      asked other crews whether they had heard the scuffle over the      radio. When they replied, he knew they were still OK.       The hijacked jet became erratic. It sped up and started      gaining on another United flight. Werth commanded the second      jet to turn right. Seconds later, Fight 93 turned to the      right, too.        Minutes later, as Flight 93 climbed from 35,000 to 41,000      feet, Werth told Delta Fight 1989 to turn right to clear it      away from the hijacked jet. Then Flight 93 made a 180-degree      turn back toward the east, forcing Werth to move the Delta      flight back out of the way. ``Delta 89, we're gonna go the      other way,'' he radioed.       As Flight 93 passed over Akron, headed by that time in the      direction of Washington, Werth heard a supervisor call out      that a jet had just struck the Pentagon.                          ``It's the Delta!''       Before United 93 had even checked in with Werth, a      supervisor had asked him to watch Delta 1989, a westbound      flight from Boston to Los Angeles. It was 60 miles east of      his sector, flying behind the United jet.       Werth has never been sure who called the facility to warn      about the flight or why, and other accounts have been murky.      The flight was a Boeing 767 like two other hijacked flights      out of Boston. It would have been logical to suspect that it,      too, might have been a target.       As Werth struggled to keep other jets away from United 93,      he had to turn the Delta flight several times. The pilots      responded normally. He couldn't be sure of anything that day,      but it seemed a safe bet that the Delta flight hadn't been      hijacked.       However, someone in the military seemed to have mixed up      the Delta flight with the hijacked jet. A supervisor rushed      up to Werth and said, ``It's the Delta, it's the Delta!''      Werth recalls. She told him that a military liaison on the      phone had confirmed that the Delta jet was hijacked.       Werth told her he was pretty sure United 93 had been      hijacked, not the Delta one. A few moments later, she came      back.       ``He's fine--at least for now,'' Werth told her.       After consulting again on the phone, she returned again.      ``They said it's a confirmed hijack and a bomb threat,'' she      told him. It was United 93 that had made the bomb threats,      Werth thought. That convinced him they had to be confusing      the two flights.       ``Tell them they're full of it!'' Werth says he replied.      ``I thought, `God, don't (have military jets that were being      scrambled) go after the wrong plane.' ''       At 9:44 a.m., the Delta pilots requested a change of course      from Werth. The same concerns about their safety had been      passed on to the company, and dispatchers had ordered it to      land as soon as possible in Cleveland.       As it turned out, the military was in no position to shoot      down Delta 1989, but Werth didn't know that. He followed the      flight on radar until it landed safely.       Fight 93 didn't make another radio transmission after 9:39      a.m.Werth watched on radar as the jet crashed near      Shanksville, Pa., at 10:03.                         A bond with Flight 93       Werth retired in 2003 without ever having made an air-     traffic error during his 32-year tenure, according to the      Federal Aviation Administration, a remarkable record in an      era when computers automatically track when planes get too      close together.       He says he has focused his life on his wife, Mary Kay, and      his passion, golf. He says he has watched with occasional      outrage as he has been portrayed in movies and books about 9/     11 by people who had never spoken to him.       Today, he will attend a memorial service in Shanksville for      the crew and passengers of Flight 93.He's not sentimental or      emotional about that day, but he feels a bond with the      victims.       ``It's hard, when you're a controller, to lose an      aircraft,'' he says. ``When there is absolutely nothing you      can do and you're not in control, it's doubly hard.''
