President, I would like to bring to the Senate's attention the hard work, dedication, and perseverance of the Carbone Auto Group in Bennington, VT. The Carbone Auto Group is celebrating its recent showroom expansion, where they have merged their Ford, Hyundai, Honda, and Toyota dealerships.  From its first garage in 1933, to its 25 franchises currently running across Vermont and central New York, the Carbone Auto Group is an award-winning business that has garnered many regional and national accolades. Approaching eight decades in business, the Carbone Auto Group deserves recognition for its diligence in running such a prosperous family-owned business. The company's longevity and success is a testament to its dedicated staff members and management--particularly the founding partners, Joe Carbone and Phil Sacco. The hub of the auto group, Don-Al Management Company, Inc., is now managed by third-generation family members Joe, Don, Jr., Enessa, and Alex.  The Carbone Auto Group has helped hundreds of Vermonters purchase vehicles over the years, and it has created numerous Vermont jobs. I am pleased to see this local business celebrate its recent expansion, and I wish them continued success in the future.                          ____________________
