Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. George Guyante is one of these individuals. On Wednesday, April 1, 2004, he will be honored at a retirement reception.  George has called many places ``home'' during his life, having grown up in a military family. He followed in his father's footsteps and joined the Army and later attended Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. After receiving his degree in city and regional planning he obtained a job as a planning technician for the City of Corona in 1976.  In 1978, George started the city's Redevelopment Agency which later encompassed an economic development division as well. During his time he helped create Team Corona, a marketing and retention program designed to attract businesses and create jobs through the agency. Under his leadership Corona experienced and managed a period of high growth. The city grew from 27,000 to 140,000 during his tenure and continues to experience booming housing and commercial markets.  In May 2001, after serving as the interim city manager since November 2000, the City Council appointed George city manager after considering 44 other applicants. Under his guidance the city has worked to improve transportation, provide ample park areas for residents, provide affordable housing to low-income residents, and help the homeless.  George's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community projects and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
