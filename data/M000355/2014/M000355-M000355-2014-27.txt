 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. Jim Taylor as he ends his 35-year stint as president of the University of the Cumberlands. Dr. Taylor is an educator of the highest degree and deserves the praise of this body for his unremitting devotion to his students and his community.  When Dr. Taylor retired last month, he ended the longest tenure as president of any college or university in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. He led the university for so long, however, because he continued to get results from his students and contribute positively to his community--year after year.  Over the course of his tenure, enrollment in the school rose from 1,885 to over 5,500, the endowment rose from $6 million to $79 million, and numerous campus renovations were made including the construction of hundreds of handicap access ramps.  Dr. Taylor's impact did not stop at the boundaries of campus, however. He worked tirelessly to better his community--raising money for scholarships for Appalachian students and overseeing clothing and food drives for area families.  For now, Dr. Taylor and his wife of 46 years, Dinah Louise Taylor, will move to their home in Florida. However, Dr. Taylor could not separate himself from the institution for which he had worked for so long in one fell swoop. He will remain involved with the university in his new position of chancellor, where he will help with fundraising and provide counsel to his successor in order to provide for a smooth transition.  Dr. Jim Taylor's life of service to his students and his community provide a shining example of excellence for us all. Therefore, I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary citizen.  The Times-Tribune of Whitley County, KY, recently published an article detailing the life and career of Dr. Jim Taylor. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [From the Times-Tribune, Oct. 8, 2014]The Ending of an Era: University of the Cumberlands President To Retire                          (By Kristina Smith)       Boxes filled the large rectangular room where Dr. James      Harold Taylor usually sat and carried out his day-to-day      business as president of the University of the Cumberlands.       Each box was marked with bold, white letters--``mover.''       Until Oct. 16, that's exactly what Taylor will be doing--     moving.       Taylor's 35 years as president comes to an end next week as      he officially retires and Dr. Larry Cockrum takes over the      top position. His retirement also means the end of the      longest tenure of a Kentucky college or university president.       So for now, Taylor prepares to move to his Florida      residence with his wife of 46 years, Dinah Louise Taylor.       ``I'm telling everybody goodbye and expressing my      appreciation,'' Taylor said of his last week as president.      ``This job is too big for one working alone. It takes a team,      and we have a great one here. We have great faculty, staff      and students.''       Taylor and his team have molded the university into the      largest private college or university in the state of      Kentucky during his time as president.       ``We're also the only Baptist university in the state,''      Taylor quickly pointed out. ``Well, except for Clear Creek      Bible School.''       Taylor is proud of the university and the over 5,000      students he is leaving behind. He mentions that he is      especially happy with the developing physician's assistant      program, nursing program and health programs.       However, he is most proud of the impact within the      community that he leaves behind.       ``What I'm pleased about is that we've been able to build      145 homes for people. Distributed tons of food and clothing.      We've built hundreds of handicap access ramps, done      insulation projects, roofing. We have a toy program for kids      at Christmas who normally wouldn't get toys. Then we have      Thanksgiving, where we do vouchers for people,'' Taylor said.       The list goes on and on.       ``I've had a lot of fun,'' Taylor said with a grin.       But Taylor isn't boasting on his accomplishments. Once      again, he points to the team of people surrounding him.       ``When I'm talking about this, I'm just talking about how I      hire smart people who are really good,'' Taylor said. ``And I      just get out of their way and let them work.''       Running a university that spans over 100 acres is a lot of      work, and Taylor acknowledges that his predecessor will have      no easy task before him.       ``This school is so much bigger than people think,'' Taylor      said. ``See, our operating budget is $50 million a year. The      fiscal plan here is around $200 million. You have to maintain      all of it. So we raise probably around $300 million, and      spend around $305 million. It takes a lot to keep it going.''       So Taylor will provide some help to Cockrum going forward.      He hopes to help make the transition as smooth as possible.       For about a week of every month, Taylor will assist in      raising money and identifying friends for the college as      chancellor.       ``No one does anything alone. It takes many heads, hearts      and hands,'' Taylor said. ``Dr. Cockrum will take us to      stellar heights and allow us to do things we've never done      before.''       Taylor believes that choosing Cockrum to follow in his      steps will help the university continue to flourish after      he's left campus and moved to the Sunshine State. He notes      that Cockrum has been with the university for nearly a      decade, and has seen firsthand the work Cockrum is capable      of.       ``You know, this profession is filled with talkers. But, he      delivers. He's about the best I've seen,'' Taylor said of      Cockrum. ``I feel like all we've done is built the foundation      and he's going to let this rocket ship fly.''       While Cockrum is preparing to blast off into his new      presidential role, Taylor will take the time to ponder upon      his years with the university.       ``It's time for relaxation and reflection,'' Taylor said.      ``I'm grateful for my wife who has allowed me to do what      needed to be done in terms of promoting the institution. It's      fulfilled this opportunity to serve. It's been a blessing.      It's fulfilled our lifelong dreams. Few people get to live      out their dreams--I was fortunate to be able to do that.''       Taylor has already thought of a few words of advice to the      university he leaves behind, though.       ``You have to have a moral compass, a true north. I think      the Christian faith can give you that,'' Taylor said. ``Oh,      and always measure twice, but cut once.''       So Taylor will finish packing papers, photos and his      personal belongings into the cardboard boxes that are piled      in his office. But he will be back to visit; he's not ready      to leave Williamsburg completely behind.       ``I'll come back some because our son is buried here, and      we'll have a home here,'' Taylor said. ``But we'll come in      for the holidays and things like that. We'll come in for some      ball games.''       As a final note, Taylor quotes a line of Shakespeare to sum      up his time with the university and his pending retirement.       ``The crown rests heavy on the head of the king,'' Taylor      said.                          ____________________
