Speaker, I wish to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) and the chairman of the full committee, and rise in very strong support of the Obey motion to instruct.  Mr. Speaker, I want to specifically address the portion of the motion to instruct that involves the $35 million of the request for the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  I would say that if Members have been paying any attention to the newspapers and see what is going on in Europe and in Latin America, they would see the pressures on our Department of Agriculture to keep out of our country these severe animal diseases that are just absolutely devastating both livestock and human lives in places around the world.  Our Department has a special new responsibility that they have been trying to augment with this supplementary appropriation bill. They have asked us for this $35 million to hire additional custom inspectors and veterinarians, and to make sure we have a doubling or tripling of our canine force to try to detect animal and disease problems that may be entering our country.  This really is, I think, a difficult issue for many Americans, yes hard to understand. Life is pretty comfortable for the majority of people in our country. It is hard to understand that there actually could be such serious threats to our food chain. America has not had foot and mouth disease since 1929. But it spreads rapidly. And it will be devastating if it enters this country. We have seen mad cow disease do its damage to millions of animals and now to humans in Europe. Human beings are dying in Europe, in very developed economies, from this. These are almost, it seems, other-worldly experiences, but they could happen to us.  We really need this $35 million to help the USDA. They have asked us for this money, and hopefully with this motion to instruct we will be able to get it. Mr. Speaker, the USDA continues to need the money. The gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), who has just been so vigilant on this issue, will be talking about this in a minute. He has another letter from USDA seeking this assistance.  We had a vote in the subcommittee, in the full committee, very close, 27 to 35 when I offered it as an amendment. It was defeated on a close margin at that point, but I urge the conferees and I urge this House to consider this motion to instruct. Give us this $35 million the Administration has requested. Keep America free of these exotic pests and serious animal diseases.                              {time}  1230
