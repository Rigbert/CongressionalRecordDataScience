Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation to amend the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act of 1992. My legislation will provide for the transfer of services and personnel from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the Office of Self-Governance and to emphasize the need for job creation in Alaska native communities and on Indian reservations.  Since its enactment in 1992, the ``477'' program of the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services Demonstration Act, has become one of the few successful economic development programs in Indian country. This program was implemented to help tribes address severe problems in employment and poverty faced in their communities. It allows tribal governments to consolidate formula funded employment, training and related programs into one streamlined, efficient program, which enable tribes to reduce administrative time and costs, and increase services to their members. Alaska tribes have informed me that they have reported great savings in administering employment and training programs through consolidation of application and reporting requirements.  On October 9, 1997, Senator Campbell introduced S. 1279 and on this same date, Senator Murkowski introduced S. 1281, which proposed amendments to the ``477'' program, and included Alaska-specific provisions. On May 14, 1998, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held a committee oversight hearing to discuss the program of the program. S. 1279, as amended, incorporates several provisions of S. 1281, and makes other technical corrections. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held a mark-up of their two bills and favorably reported S. 1279 out of Committee.  My legislation is identical to S. 1279, as reported out of committee, and would at long last address the extreme unemployment in Alaska native communities and to provide young Alaska natives with both educational and job skills so they can fully participate and contribute to Alaska's economy. The bill I am introducing today will lead to further economic growth and more efficient use of Indian job training dollars. I urge my colleagues to support my bill                          ____________________
