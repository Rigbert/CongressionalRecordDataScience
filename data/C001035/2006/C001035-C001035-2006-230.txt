President, the amendment offered by Senator Dorgan is a restriction on the U.S. Special Trade Representative's authority in negotiations. As such, it is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee. However, it is my understanding that the chairman and the ranking member of the Finance Committee have no objection to acceptance of the amendment.  I urge acceptance of the amendment.
