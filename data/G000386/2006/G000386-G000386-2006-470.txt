 President, on Medicare--and I know the debate here is not about Medicare, but Senator Kennedy spoke to one part of the new prescription drug program to which I wish to make reference. He referred in his remarks to the dual eligibles. He spoke about a problem that is real--the problem of signing up people who were dual eligibles into the new Medicare Part D prescription drug program.  I do not find fault with his explanation. I will say, however, that our committee which has jurisdiction over this, the Senate Finance Committee, has been working with Secretary Leavitt and Administrator McClellan of CMS to work through these problems.
