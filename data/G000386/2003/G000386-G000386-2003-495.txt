 President, I hope the Senator from Pennsylvania will withdraw his amendment. I have had a lot of discussion with him tonight on it. He makes a very strong case about something which I have not studied, nor am I convinced he is wrong. But based upon how I approach bankruptcy--that is, I see bankruptcy as an impartial person, a judge making a decision on whether a business ought to continue or go out of business or how it ought to be restructured--we are talking about tax legislation that has been on the books for an awfully long time.  But we are also aware, as the Senator has told me, of crafty people giving advice to corporations on how they can maybe restructure and become strong and avoid taxation such that other corporate entities that are competitors maybe would have a disadvantage. But I am not convinced of it. I would probably have to fight the amendment if it were offered tonight.  I can promise the Senator, first of all, we will go into depth on this matter with Treasury, with my own Finance Committee staff, and with the Joint Committee on Taxation staff, and it probably will lead to a hearing. I hate to promise with the workload of the committee on taxes, on welfare, and on prescription drugs this summer that we are going be able to have a hearing tomorrow. But I will give very serious consideration to the very strong position that the Senator from Pennsylvania has made.  The Senator is a member of my committee. He is a strong advocate for his position. I don't think it is going to get lost in the dust. I will do what I can to keep it paramount in my mind because I want to make sure we don't have crafty people advising people who are in bankruptcy any more than we have crafty people advising about corporate tax shelters who are not in bankruptcy. We will look into it with the same vigor that I pursued other corporate tax shelters and as I pursued other inversions and other attempts of corporations to avoid taxation.                      Amendment No. 648 Withdrawn
