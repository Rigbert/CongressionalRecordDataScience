We strongly support the levels of that. That was not controversial.  Also, the Syria sanctions bill--of course, we have passed the Syria sanctions bill, and we are working on other bills that relate to that.  Unfortunately, they are being held up in the Senate by some Republican Senators. The Syria sanctions bill has not been moved in the Senate. It also has the Jordan MOU, which is noncontroversial. It has Syria, Jordan, and the MOU. Those are the three factors. One is controversial.  It is controversial because of whether or not it comports with the law. There have been a substantial number of State cases that have been ruled on, State actions taken on this issue that have been held not to be consistent with law and the Constitution.  We are concerned about that because I share the gentleman's view. I am an opponent of the BDS movement. I think it harms one of our most important allies, and it is inconsistent with, I think, the welfare of the people in Israel and, frankly, the Palestinians in the West Bank.  Having said that, we are strong supporters of the resolution. That resolution has bipartisan support, I think, and if it comes to the floor, it will have bipartisan support. The gentleman indicated that.  We intend to come forward with that, but we are trying to work to make sure that other suggestions are consistent with law, and we may move with those as well.  We haven't made that determination yet.
