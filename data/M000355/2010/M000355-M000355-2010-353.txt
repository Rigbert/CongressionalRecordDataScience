 They are asking us to scrap the massive bills Democrats have been trying to force on them. They want us to focus on cost instead. That has been their clear message now for over a year. But yesterday Democrats in Washington said they know better. The President and his allies in Congress made up their minds to turn aside any pretense of bipartisanship and plow ahead on a partisan bill--a partisan bill, by the way, that Americans don't want. In a last-ditch effort to get their way, they have staked themselves to a flawed vision of reform over the wishes of the public. What is that vision? It is a vision of health care whereby the Federal Government would become more involved in the health care decisions of every man, woman, and child in America; where small businesses get hit with new job-killing taxes; where Medicare is slashed for millions of seniors, insurance premiums go up, and Federal taxpayers are required, for the first time ever, to cover the cost of abortions.  The administration and its allies in Congress have tried repeatedly to jam this vision of health care through Congress without success. Now they are doubling down. They have one more tool in their arsenal, and they are deploying it. Meanwhile, the American people are watching all this in utter disbelief. Americans do want reform, but they don't want this. They are fed up because the longer Democrats cling to their flawed vision of reform, the longer Americans have to wait for the reforms they really want, the longer they will have to wait for us to focus on jobs and the economy.  The President did a very good job of laying out the problem yesterday. But the heart of the problem, as he himself described it, is the high cost of care, and the simple fact is, the bill he wants doesn't lower cost. On the contrary, the administration's own experts say the Democratic plan increases cost. This alone should be reason enough to start all over and put together a list of commonsense, step-by-step reforms that will actually lower cost.  The good news is we already have the list. At last week's health care summit at the White House, both parties acknowledged a handful of reforms on which all of us could agree. That is where we should start, on the things on which we agree.  Unfortunately, even before the summit began, Democrats were already intent on pushing the same old version they were pushing before the summit by any means possible. They couldn't get the old version over the finish line, even with all the backroom deals, the kickbacks, and the buy-offs, so sometime after the Massachusetts election,they hatched a plan to win over wavering Democrats in the House by promising to use some legislative sleight of hand that will only require a slim partisan majority in the Senate. This is outrageous on two counts--first, because the method they are proposing has never been used on such a sweeping piece of legislation; second, because Americans have already told us, loudly and clearly, they don't want this partisan approach. What about public opinion do our friends in the majority not understand? The American people are saying loudly and clearly they don't want us to do this.  What is worse, many of the same Democrats who are now pushing this party-line vote are on record as being foursquare against it for major legislation such as this. Here is what one senior Democratic Senator had to say about party-line votes on major legislation only a few years ago:       I've never passed a single bill worth talking about that      didn't have as a lead co-sponsor a Republican. And I don't      know of a single piece of legislation that has ever been      adopted here that didn't have a Republican and a Democrat in      the lead. That's because we need to sit down and work with      each other. The rules of this institution have required      that--that's why we exist.  I couldn't agree more. Americans expect big bills to command big majorities. That is why this is not a fight between Democrats and Republicans; it is a fight between Democrats inside the beltway and their constituents beyond it.  There is a better way. There is a better path to reform that none of us will regret. It is time to listen to the American people. It is time to work together on the kinds of step-by-step reforms they are asking for. Americans aren't stupid. They know the option they are being presented with--the option of some massive bill or nothing. That is a false choice.  So let's drop the partisan plan. Let's drop this unsalvageable bill, and let's start over.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
