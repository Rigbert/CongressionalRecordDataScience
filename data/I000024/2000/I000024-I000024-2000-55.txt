President, this is a very simple, straightforward, easy-to-understand amendment. It merely takes $7.3 million and puts it into the Indian Health Services for diabetes. It does take that out of the National Endowment for the Arts, but all it does is take it out of the increase. Last year they had $97 million. They are increasing it this year to $105 million. All I am asking is to take that $7 million, instead of increasing the National Endowment for the Arts, and to put it into the Indian Health Services' diabetes program.  I am prejudiced because I come from the State that has in terms of percentages, the largest Indian population. However, I can tell you this, that of the national Indian population, 12.2 percent of them have diabetes because of the environment in which they live. It is an unhealthy environment. There are cases where they have all kinds of infections that set in where they are unable to keep from having amputations. So it is a very serious thing.  You will hear from the other side an argument that says we are hurting the National Endowment for the Arts. I want Senators to remember, when you cast your vote, this does not take any money away from the allocation they had last year; it merely freezes that allocation in for the coming year. Even with the increase of $30 million that is currently in this program, that still is less than 10 percent of the amount of money that is spent for research on cancer and AIDS.
