Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Wisconsin for bringing this diagram to the floor of the House so that we may be able to graphically see how a partial-birth abortion is performed. The difference between a partial-birth abortion, which this bill will ban, and first-degree murder is three inches. Three inches. That is why this bill is not a travesty. This bill is a serious attempt to get rid of a gruesome and barbaric procedure. Anyone who does not think this procedure is gruesome and barbaric ought to look at the diagram that the gentleman from Wisconsin has presented to the House.
