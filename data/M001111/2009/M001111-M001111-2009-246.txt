 I wish to let all Senators know I appreciate their cooperation. We are working through a number of amendments on both sides that I am hoping we can get through this afternoon. Senator McCain will speak to his amendment now, and we are hoping to have a vote around 2 to settle that and several others. If Members have an amendment they are working on and have some last-minute language to work on, please get it done because we would like to finish this bill today.  I yield the floor.
