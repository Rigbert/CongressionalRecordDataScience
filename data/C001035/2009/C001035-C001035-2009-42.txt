President, I will be glad to respond to the question of my colleague. My colleague did not have the benefit of being on the Senate floor when I first presented my amendment, and I addressed this very issue.  I was very careful in drafting this amendment to make clear that I was not talking about positions that are recognized in law. Some of my colleagues legitimately have taken a different approach. But that is not the approach that is before the Senate now. Rather, I have taken into account the issues that have been raised by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, such as Senator Byrd--who certainly knows more about the Constitution than I think any of us who are serving at the present time--who has expressed concerns about the proliferation of czars. I have taken into account concerns expressed by Senator Feingold, by Senator Feinstein. I have done a careful, narrowly tailored amendment that does not attempt to sweep in positions that are recognized in law, nor does it sweep in positions that are subject to Senate confirmation.  That is why it is so disappointing to me that my colleagues are not unanimously adopting my amendment, which it looked like they were going to do earlier this week before the White House weighed in, because I did not take a broad sweeping approach. I took a very narrow, careful approach that aimed at the promise the President talked about, the lack of oversight, transparency, and accountability.
