Pier has led Fermilab through some challenging times, but he has also led the lab to many remarkable achievements.  Pier was born in Peru and after earning degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University, he worked at Caltech, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.  Then in 2005, Pier and his wonderful wife, Barbara, moved to Fermilab, giving up the sunny west coast for cold Chicago winters. They arrived to 6,800-acres of former farmland that Pier and the Fermilab team have worked to restore to its native prairie. The laboratory maintains strong ties with the descendants of the farm families that once worked the land where Fermilab now sits, and every summer the families are invited to a picnic the lab hosts for the community.  No other national lab director can boast of barns and a herd of bison.  An avid photographer, Pier has spent many weekends walking the lab's grounds trying to capture its natural beauty through the lens. This is one of the things he has loved most about Fermilab. Whether raising bison or maintaining high-tech facilities, Pier has worked diligently to ensure that Fermilab continues to attract some of the best scientists from around the world.  And it does.  Today, Fermilab is America's premier particle physics laboratory, supporting thousands of scientists as they solve the mysteries of matter, energy, space, and time.  Fermilab's mission is to drive discovery in particle physics by building and operating world-class accelerator and detector facilities, performing pioneering research with global partners, and transforming technologies for science and industry.  It has often been said that physicists build huge, complex machines to study the tiniest, most basic particles. Well, Fermilab physicists build facilities and create new technologies to carry out discovery science and contribute to America's technology base.  During Pier's tenure as director, Fermilab launched a new era of scientific research focused on high-intensity particle beams through its cutting-edge muon and neutrino experiments.  Fermilab also pushed forward the world's understanding of the dark matter and dark energy that constitute 96 percent of the universe with its leadership roles in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the state-of-the-art Dark Energy Camera.  While this work was advancing, more than 100,000 students, from kindergarten through high school, were welcomed to the laboratory. Fermilab's strong partnership with Illinois schools and teachers helps achieve their shared goal of inspiring young people to learn more about particle physics, environment, ecology, and accelerator science--and ultimately encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM fields.  In addition, Fermilab's Tevatron particle collider laid the groundwork for the discovery of the Higgs particle last year by developing the technologies and analysis tools that helped confirm evidence of the Higgs boson's existence.  And though the Tevatron has ended its extraordinary 28-year run, under Pier's guidance Fermilab has maintained its position at the forefront of scientific research by serving as the U.S. hub for more than 1,000 physicists working at the Large Hadron Collider.  The laboratory contributed large magnets and other components key to the construction of the Large Hadron Collider and its experiments. Pier even created a control room at Fermilab so U.S. scientists can perform experiments at the Collider remotely.  In his last year as director, Fermilab partnered with the State of Illinois to construct the Illinois Accelerator Research Center, or I-ARC, which aims to accelerate the transition of technologies developed for particle physics research to other sectors of society.  I-ARC will also assist small businesses as a test facility, providing technical expertise in accelerator technology and serving as a training ground for the next generation of accelerator scientists and engineers.  Beyond the lab's accomplishments, Pier has been awarded many honors in his own right. He won the Panofsky Award of the American Physical Society for the invention of the Asymmetric B-Factory, a new kind of particle collider designed to study the difference between matter and antimatter. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences. And, in case one was not enough, he also holds an honorary doctorate from the Illinois Institute of Technology.  Needless to say, it is likely that Pier's contributions to particle physics and to Fermilab will continue to benefit Illinois and the international research community long after he retires next month.  When asked what he plans to do upon his retirement, Pier talks about making wine on the vineyard he and his wife own in California.  At one point he even thought of this as a field of research at Fermilab. He would try planting grapevines at the lab, hoping that the heat from the beam lines would keep the vines warm enough to survive the winters. This way, the lab could make wine while unlocking the mysteries of the universe. It might not be a bad idea, but unfortunately he never had any time to test the experiment.  Now, after 8 years as director, Pier's wine-making skills may be a little rusty, but I am sure he will be back to harvesting his Cabernet and Zinfandel grapes in no time. And I am also sure that Pier and Barbara will find more time to spend with their 2-year-old granddaughter and the rest of their family.  On behalf of the people of Illinois and the global community of particle physicists, I thank Pier for his 8 dedicated years at Fermilab and congratulate him on his successful career. I wish him all the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
