I ask unanimous consent that Rene's comments be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Remarks by Rene Pomerleau       Mon's death was blessed relief. The going was long and hard      and she wanted to go. And it was hard for Marcelle and Pat,      who were there and supported her in her need. And it was hard      for those of us who loved her and the care givers, and      couldn't be there to help.       And it was the same way with Dad.       But I'm going to miss her very much. I miss them both very      much.       Mom was a friend. Both Mom and Dad were friends. More and      more I realize what a good fortune that was, one that a      surprising number of the people I know, and know of, can't      claim.       I think I speak for Claude and Marcelle as well when I say      that we've always thought of our parents as friends. Maybe we      didn't use that word, always, but when I analyze my feelings      and our actions, that's the word that describes it.       In Richmond, the home I remember best--because I left home      for school when we lived there, and Vermont was more a place      to visit--I don't remember an environment of intrigue and      competition and distrust. I remember friends--the Carles; the      neighbors on the right, Mr. and Mrs. Smallwood; Mrs. Reynolds      on the left; Hay, who cleaned house for us once a week;      Father Hodges, Father Perreira.       We were surrounded with their friends. They chose their      friends carefully, and they tried to teach us to do the same.       Our parents left us a legacy of friendship. If we've made      great friendships in life, if we're surrounded today by good      friends, if we think of our relatives as friends first, it's      thanks to them--and to people like them.       Mom may be joining Dad in a better place, but the place      they've left is the better for their having been here.       And we're going to miss them.
