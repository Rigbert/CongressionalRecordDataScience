President, I rise to pay homage to Sergeant Ross Pennanen, who, in the words of his father, ``gave the ultimate sacrifice for his country--his life.'' Sergeant Pennanen, or ``Penn'', as his friends called him, was a dedicated defender of America who learned the value of serving his country from his father's example in the United States Air Force. For his service and his sacrifice, I am proud to honor him on the Senate floor today.  Sergeant Pennanen was assigned to C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 5th Field Artillery Regiment, III Corps Artillery at Fort Sill, OK. A native Oklahoman whose mother and father live in Ada and Midwest City, respectively, Sergeant Pennanen grew up in McLoud and joined the Army 2 years ago at the age of 34 in hopes of improving himself and emulating his father. He was himself a good father who spent a lot of time with his 7-year-old son, Gage.  Sergeant Pennanen died tragically on November 2 when a CH-47 Chinook helicopter in which he was riding crashed in Fallujah, Iraq. He was a good soldier: he received the Army Commendation Medal two days before his death. Despite questions about his age, Sergeant Pennanen proved a ``gung-ho'' example for his fellow soldiers. According to his stepmother, ``He didn't keep up with them. He set the pace out in front of them.''  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I ask that we pay tribute to Sergeant Pennanen and the men and women like him, who know the true meaning of service and sacrifice. These men and women have tasted freedom, and wish to ensure that freedom for those who have never experienced it. I honor the memory of our sons and daughters who have died for this noble cause.  We could not have asked for a better soldier or diplomat of humanity than Sergeant Ross Pennanen. I am proud of him, and proud of the commitment he showed to winning the freedom of those he did not know. My prayers are with his family for the loss of such a special man.
