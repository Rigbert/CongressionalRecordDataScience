 As I have said before, I would be happy to see a private enterprise stake. As we know, this administration has dramatically increased the number of Government employees. They went down substantially during the 8 years of President Clinton's administration, and they have increased more than any time in a dozen years by this administration. Maybe they could look for areas of outsourcing but not outsourcing in those areas that are critical to our lives and our national security and fight against terrorism.  I am perfectly willing to go to a vote on the Thomas amendment, but I would remind everybody that it kills the Leahy-Nelson et al amendment and allows at a time of heightened terrorist threat the Department of Homeland Security, which dramatically increased the number of employees, to take some very key governmental employees and turn them over to the private sector and say the private sector can handle our security from terrorists who might try to come in under the immigration rubric better than our own Government could do.  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
