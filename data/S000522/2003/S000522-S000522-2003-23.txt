Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, the resolution before us condemns the terrorist attacks in Istanbul last Saturday as well as yesterday morning. I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), my friend, for proffering this resolution and for the prompt consideration that is being given to it by our leadership in scheduling it very quickly before the body today.  This resolution conveys our deepest and heartfelt sympathy to the victims and their families and states that the United States stands in solidarity with the Turkish people in the fight against terrorism. These attacks, Madam Speaker, bear all the hallmarks of al Qaeda, and that terrorist group has claimed responsibility for these cruel and cowardly acts.  This demonstrates, once again, that the target of global terrorists is not just the United States of America, but all those who reject their hateful vision of a clash of civilizations and governments by religious extremism.  I thought President Bush in the United Kingdom the other day said it so well when he said, ``I want to express my deep sympathy for the loss of life in Turkey. The nature of the terrorist enemy is evident once again. We see their contempt, their utter contempt, for innocent life. They hate freedom,'' the President went on. ``They hate free nations. Today, once again, we saw their ambitions of murder. The cruelty is part of their strategy. The terrorists hope to intimidate; they hope to demoralize. They particularly want to intimidate and demoralize free nations. They're not going to succeed.''  Madam Speaker, despite some significant human rights issues, and no one has been more of a critic of Turkey than I have in the past, although they are making some progress, despite all of that, Turkey remains one of the few successful democracies in the Muslim world, with a tradition of religious tolerance. The Turkish Republic is an example of how a predominantly Muslim country can enjoy a secular, democratic government. Turkey has shown that the Islamic faith of its citizens and a secular democracy can flourish side by side.  By targeting synagogues and Turkish citizens of the Jewish faith on Saturday, the terrorists attacked the notion that Muslims can live in peace and harmony with other faiths. It was a profoundly anti-Semitic act. The terrorists know that the successful example of Turkey lays bear the emptiness of their own hateful vision. It is working in Turkey, and yet now they are trying to give a different impression to the world.  By targeting the British Consulate General and a leading British bank, these terrorists viciously illustrated that all of our allies and their targets must remain united with our allies in the fight against terrorism.  Madam Speaker, these contemptible acts killed almost 50 people, including the British Consul General in Istanbul, and injured more than 750 innocent people. Our deepest condolences go out to their families and to their nations.  Turkey has been a strong American ally, as we all know, the underbelly of NATO for more than 50 years. By agreeing to this resolution, we affirm our mutual commitment to that common defense.  I would remind my colleagues that after the September 11 of 2001 attacks, NATO invoked its collective defense clause, declaring that the al Qaeda attacks in the United States were attacks against the entire alliance.                              {time}  1200  I thought British Prime Minister Tony Blair summed it up very well when he said, ``And when they say is this an attack directed against our alliance, indeed, it is directed against anybody who stands in the way of that fanaticism'' he went on to say, ``That is why our response has got to be to say to them as clearly as we possibly can, you are not going to defeat us because our will to defend what we believe is, in actuality, and in the end, stronger, better, more determined than your will to inflict damage on innocent people.''  Madam Speaker, let me conclude by saying this: Turkey and the United Kingdom both played important roles to drive al Qaeda from its base in Afghanistan and to replace the Taliban government that harbored those terrorists. They were the first two countries to command the International Security Assistance Force, which has stabilized the Kabul region and supported the Karzai government. Turkey and the United Kingdom stood by the United States when our Nation was the target of global terrorism. By passing this timely resolution today in a bipartisan way, Democrats, Republicans, moderates, liberals and conservatives, we affirm our determination to stand by our longtime allies and to defeat the terrorists who bear the guilt for these highly reprehensible acts.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
