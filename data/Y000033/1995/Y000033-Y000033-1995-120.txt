Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I am hard-pressed to compete with show-and-tell on television. That is one of the things that is wrong with our Congress today. It was well done.  But there is more to legislation than a show-and-tell program for those that promote one side of the issue. This issue was voted for in committee and thoroughly defeated. No one spoke in favor of this in the committee. Every council, the North Pacific, Pacific council, mid-Atlantic council, South Atlantic council, and the gulf council spoke against this amendment, and yet this body and the audiences exposed to a very good presentation, but it is not scientific. The issuer of setting optimum yield [OY], maximum sustainable yield, [MYSY], is a complicated one that fisheries management has been arguing about for years. It is not an easy issue. It is just not a little display with red fish and green fish and little fish and big fish.  If you believe in science, the scientists oppose this amendment. Yes, they do. There are some conservation groups or so-called preservation groups or antifishing groups that do support it.                              {time}  1215  Unfortunately, the thing that bothers me the most is that under this legislation, this amendment, the council will now be required to address those stocks which are overfished and institute a rebuilding of those stocks, including saber tooth flounder, which kill everything else that flows and grows in the ocean. And they may be God's creatures, but there are other creatures out there that in fact are the prey of the saber tooth flounder. And yet we are in the business of saying we are going to have sustained yield for all those fish that spawn and all those fish that we consume and all those fish that support the fishermen in the communities. We are also asking the council to manage them well enough where they have a sustainable yield, but under this amendment those which prey upon that other than the fish themselves, which in reality would be devouring those little fishes at the bottom of the scale.  Now, those that do not believe that man should be involved in this management program, I would vote for the amendment, too; if we want to exclude everybody out of it, including the fishermen, then I would vote for the amendment, too.  But I can suggest respectfully we have made great progress with the councils today. We are managing our fish much better. By the way, this is relatively a new law in the scope of time, 1976. And why did we pass this law? Because the foreign fleets literally were raping our seas and our fish and leaving nothing back but the carnage that they created.  This Congress finally decided we should Americanize our fleet. I tell you, we did make some mistakes, because we were unprepared to manage it. But every council, every region, the National Fishery Institute, and all the scientists that I know directly involved with this, oppose this amendment.  Again, I cannot compete with someone that is a professor that presents a very nice and simple explanation. But if you believe in the committee process and the testimony before the committees, one of my biggest disappointments in this body has been the lack of listening to those who testify and allowing amendments to come to this floor with really no backing or justification for them, other than to be interest-special to be presented to this Congress, and because it has the pizazz, people vote for it. I understand that. We just went through one of those votes. It is easy. But the credibility of the legislation as we write a law is diminished when this type of event occurs.  Again, let me stress, every council, the National Marines Institute, Fishery Institute, everybody involved directly oppose this amendment.  Now, if the committee process means nothing, vote for the gentleman from Maryland's amendment. If you believe man should not be involved with the management of, vote for the gentleman from Maryland's amendment, and everybody will be happy. But if you believe in the process of science, the process of the councils, and the committee process, you will vote no on this amendment.  The gentleman is well intended, his intentions are honorable. The gentleman made a great presentation, and I compliment him. But this is a bad amendment and it should be rejected.
