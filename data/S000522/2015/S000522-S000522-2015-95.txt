Thank you, Chairman Mica.  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Joe Pitts, and just before I do, I note that Mr. Pitts not only chairs the Subcommittee on Health for the Energy and Commerce Committee, but prior to coming to Washington, he was one of the prime authors of a sweeping pro-life law in Pennsylvania that has saved countless lives.
