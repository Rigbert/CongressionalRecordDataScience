Speaker, on August 26 the citizens of Toledo held a ceremony in commemoration of World War II. I was privileged to participate in that ceremony to honor the 70 million strong allied nations who achieved that victory. We honored in particular the 405,000 Americans who gave their lives in that struggle, our 671,000 wounded, and the 16 million who served abroad and on the home front. It was a moving ceremony, Mr. Speaker, and I ask that the remarks of the participants be included here in the Congressional Record:             World War II Commemorative Community Ceremony       We are here today as free citizens, as the heirs of true      patriots. It is especially fitting to commemorate together      this 50th anniversary of Allied victory in World War II, and      that we publicly pay tribute to the 400,000 dead Americans,      671,000 wounded, the 16 million who served in that war, and      the over 70 million Allies who united in a struggle for      freedom.       I am pleased to tell you that the final site selection for      our nation's World War II Memorial to be located in      Washington, DC will be made by the first of October. Ground      for the Memorial will be broken on November 4, 1995, a      dedication which will kick off a week of celebrations and      remembrance--of allied victory in Europe, in the Pacific, and      in North Africa and the Mediterranean.       The soon-to-be-built World War II Memorial in our Nation's      Capital, which took five years of hard work to gain passage      through Congress, will serve as a permanent memorial to the      veterans of that war which preserved liberty in this      generation. The memorial will also stand in tribute to the      homefront families and civilians who served this nation in      myriad ways. It is a memorial to the men who captained      neighborhood drilling in blackouts, to ``Rosie the Riveter'',      to all of the men and women who kept our country running      while so many others were overseas, to everyone who bought a      War Bond, who planted a Victory Garden, who carefully      utilized ration cards for gasoline and food. And it is a      memorial to our nation's truest legacy: the children born      after the war, and their children, and their children, and on      into the 21st century.       In one way or another America will always be fighting      against some form of tyranny, and for the rights of men and      women to live in freedom and with dignity. We are reminded of      the lofty words in America the Beautiful, ``those heroes      proved in liberating strife who more than self their country      loved, and mercy and sacrifice more than life.'' We are      reminded of how great our debt is to those who went before,      and what a real responsibility it is to measure up to them,      to plan and work for our secure and free future, and that of      our children.       During this second half of the twentieth century, our      country led the world into the nuclear age and tamed its      awesome power. Our nation built the Hoover Dam and harnessed      the powers of the oceans and the waters. Ours is still the      finest health care system in the world even with its      shortcomings. Social Security gives our senior citizens      dignity in retirement. In the last 50 years, American lifted      half of the nation out of poverty and built a middle class.       The Statue of Liberty, Mother of Exiles, boldly remains a      beacon of hope to the world's dreamers seeking sanctuary on      our golden shores. She observes us today as the sons and      daughters of those who faced a darkened world, with tyranny      triumphant, and beat back the global forces of darkness to      enshrine the rule of law. Our forbearers preserved the      inalienable rights of each person and enlarged freedom for      the majority. They forged an industrial and agricultural      giant, prosperous and democratic, unknown in all the      history of humankind. In things great and small, they      affirmed again and again their fighting faith that      tomorrow would be better than today, that they could make      it so.       We, the children of freedom, must rededicate ourselves to      bettering America and charting a new course for a new      century.       We must infuse the spirit of America--our liberty and our      nationhood--with a renewed optimism such as Carl Sandberg      captured when he eloquently penned, ``I see America, not in      the setting sun of a black night . . . I see America in the      crimson light of a rising sun, fresh from the burning,      creative hand of God. I see great days ahead, great days      possible to men and women of will and vision. . . . ''       In remembrance of those years of World War II and in      recognition of all that has passed in the 50 years that      followed the peace of the Spring and Fall of 1945, I am      honored to present to Lucas County Commission President Sandy      Isenberg this award, conferred by the President of the United      States and the U.S. Department of Defense, designating Lucas      County, Ohio as a World War II Commemorative Community.                                  ____   Remarks by Rev. George M. Rinkowski at World War II Commemorative                            Community Ceremony       To all assembled here, today, and to the whole Nation! A      Benediction is a blessing. We, the United States of America,      have been wonderfully blessed during the course of our      history. But, we have been a blessings to the world at large      and to many nations individually. As we commemorate the end      of World War II, we must keep in mind our prisoners of war      and our missing in action, are comrades. We must not forget      the sacrifices these comrades are still making and the      suffering they are still suffering for us and our way of      life. They must remain alive in our minds and our hearts.      Their families continue to suffer along with them.       We are ``One Nation Under God'' Indivisible, with Liberty      and Justice for all.. These ten words of our pledge of      allegiance to the flag of our country summarize the      Declaration of Independence made by fathers of our land. We      are commemorating with thanksgiving the many sacrifices of      our Army, Navy, AirForce, Marines and Coast Guard who brought      liberty and justice to those many nations enslaved by the      powers of darkness and the evils of aggression..       In the history of the world there has never been a nation      that conquered and the rehabilitated both the freed nations      and the aggressor war-mongers. We did good to those who had      done so much evil. And we bettered the lives of those who had      been overcome by intruders.       Fifty years and in every year since then we have been a      blessing to the world. The principles of government which we      established a few centuries ago have become the force for      good to many nations and a good example to many more.       As we remember with thanksgiving the great work of the      sixteen million members of our Armed Forces who served as a      bulwark against evil aggressors, we want to commemorate the      millions of our fellow citizens who worked and supported our      fighting forces. The agony and suspense of those at home      cannot be calculated. We send prayers to God to reward them      for their goodness.       Thanks be to God!! And God Bless America!  A China-Burma-India Theater and Pacific Theater Veteran World War II                          (By Earl W. Hoffsis)       Over 53 years ago I served half way around the world from      Toledo, the place of my birth.       After a lengthy, 94 day trip from Newport News, VA, I      arrived India, the mysterious East. In the China-Burma-India      Theater of war, a land area comprising the largest theater of      the war, the majority of the 325,000 manpower were in support      of the Army Air Force. My unit, XX Bomber command had the      task of preparing and utilizing the newly manufactured      Superfort the B-29 to shorten the war in the far east. The      CBI theater was last in all supplies, men and equipment as      the war was getting hot in the European theater with invasion      at Normandy imminent.       In this land of the famous Flying Tigers and Merrill's      Marauders and the Mars Task Force, a great deal of the making      of the initial airfields was by hand labor with hundreds of      Indian and Chinese pulling huge rollers to get the fields in      shape for the biggest bomber of the war.       Since supplies were scarce as was the means of getting them      to the forward bases, the ATC and Bomb Groups were also put      into action to get the gas, bombs, food, clothing and food      over the Hump into China. Due to the extreme altitude and      many sudden breaking storms, many planes were lost between      India and Kunming, China. The route became known as the      ``Aluminum Trail'' due to the many C47's and crews sacrificed      through storms, enemy action or accident.       The 4 engine bombers, B-24's and B-29's flew some of the      longest missions of World War II, some in excess of 3200      miles, where mines were laid in harbors in the Singapore and      Rangoon area.       The Burma, China terrain was some of the roughest of the      war. At times, trails were only wide enough for men and their      mules, such as those of the 612th and 613th Field Artillery.      Few if any jeeps could make the grade or path width. Some of      the diseases of the area accounted for many of the casualties      of the CBI.       Shortly after seeing the Stars and Stripes at half mast in      memory of our fallen leader, President Franklin Roosevelt,      the XXth Bomber Command was shipped to Tinian Island, where      along with the XXIst Bomber Command located on Tinian, Saipan      and Guam were better able to complete their bombing missions      in the Tokyo area. The round trip time was 12 to 14 hours.       The gallant Marines, Army and Navy had cleared the      Marianas, Okinawa and Iwo Jima with a heavy toll of life.      Many heavy bombers were saved by the islands of Okinawa and      Iwo Jima being under American Control. In all it reported      that over 8,000 airmen were saved from ditching in the      Pacific, over enemy territory and with damaged planes      through their making emergency landings on Iwo Jima or Okinawa.       It was from Tinian, a short distance from our base that the      Enola Gay made its flight into history. This date just 50      years ago this past August 14 will be known forever as V-J      day to all veterans of the China-Burma-India and Asiatic      theaters.       For us old veteran, historians cannot change the events as      etched permanently in our memory.                         Letter to Marcy Kaptur                                            Veterans Memorial,                                    Toledo, Ohio, August 26, 1995.       As a Nation, and as a people, we are always available to      celebrate war. Flesh against flesh--blood against blood--     and--steel against steel. We mark with pride the winning of      war, but without ego centered on victory. Equally we turn out      collective back on war, if there is no winner.       Turn back to the end of the war in Korea. Remember . . .      that February day when Vietnam released and returned      prisoners. Was it victory when Gerry Denton stepped off the      plane and held Jane in his arms for the first time in over      seven years? It was for Denton, but not for America. We      celebrate victory, perhaps, because we have never learned to      celebrate peace.       When I came home to Tucson after my time in the service of      my country, my road was--perhaps, different from yours, and      yours, not because I am a woman, because no sooner was the      ink on my separation papers dry--then I was, along with so      many other women, lost in the bright light of victory in Asia      and in Europe.       My return raised more eyebrows than salutes. The question      of patriotism lost in the questions. A widow at 20, a reason,      perhaps. A call to do what was needed to be done, a need to      compete, anything you can do--I can do better. Or was it a      legacy of generations of soldiers and sailors, a bloodline an      Uncle in South Africa and winning the Victoria Cross, dead in      the battle of the Marne in France. Cousins in the battle of      Normandy and in the landings in the Pacific. A brother in the      North Atlantic on the run to Murmansk (sp) in Russia. Are my      genes less willing? Wiling to take the oath. Any less willing      to work for victory? Parades? Celebrations! And perhaps--     thanks for the peace.       But no parades, no thanks, only the challenge that comes      from the feeling--as soon as I took off that uniform, put my      wings in a drawer and visited my mother's grave, that I was      overcome by the feelings, my service had stepped into the      glare of challenge, and somehow, never cast a shadow.       Like many other women who answered the call, heard the      challenge, we marched home to the sound of muffled drums, and      vanished. Over the past few years the drums have picked up      the beat, was it Desert Storm? Or was it the women, in gun      ships, on bomb runs, or was it the shadow of the women in the      1940s who hit the flight lines running, who heard the call.       Was it my cousin who--as a nurse--lead the children into      safe haven from the bombing in Liverpool, or was my cousin      who commanded an ack ack battery near Dover and who met the      ragged convoy coming from France and to find her badly burned      brother in those wounded.       My challenge to myself, and to you, today, will be to      pledge to volunteer for peace. To extend that hand that      covers your heart and reach out to help. Help the fallen and      the falling. To steady the step of those who have lost the      way. Take the time to share--time--with those who have only      the memory of other times. To wage a war for peace!       Hear again the call to volunteer, when you raise your right      hand to pledge your life, your energy, your compassion to win      the peace.       As veterans we share a common thread of willingness to be      counted. Our Nation is calling on you again to be counted.      Get out of the back row and step up front. Into the front      lines--get the facts. Get the ammo of involvement, and get      off your fences and fight for the right to be an American. A      nation that shows the way with people, not with the gold of      treasury, the strength of industry, but a people who are      celebrating peace; hearing and healing.       I am proud of my American birth, I must also thank the      warriors my family gave me in my heritage. A heritage I      pledged for war and continue to pledge--again--for peace.       My husband, of only four weeks, name is on this monument. I      honor his name and will not forget his sacrifice.                                                   Lois M. Nelson,     Women Airforce Service Pilot, WWII.                          ____________________
