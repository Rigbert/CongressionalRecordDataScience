The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) has been reelected 19-plus times. We all had the opportunity of serving here with Mr. Whitten who was reelected, I believe, 25 or 26 times, served a half a century. Clearly, Peter Rodino was one of the longest serving. But serving a long time in and of itself simply means that you were able to live and to be reelected. Serving well is the mark of one who served our country, and that is Peter Rodino's legacy.  His lead role as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment investigation has been spoken of here, and that is clearly what he will be remembered for. However, he also doggedly, as has also been said, fought for the rights of people, authoring multiple civil rights reports which formed the basis of several landmark civil rights bills.  That was in a time when we recall that the Senate was refusing to pass legislation to outlaw lynching. The Senate just a few days ago apologized for that. The House passed a number of bills, but the Senate failed to pass them. Peter Rodino, even at that time, before it became really popular and the thing to do, was standing tall for the rights of individuals. John Conyers spoke eloquently to that just now.  The son of an Italian immigrant. How proud Nancy Pelosi, herself a child of a famous Italian family, must have felt in rising to speak about Peter Rodino, an Italian who brought luster to his Italian heritage and to his American citizenship and country. He demonstrated extraordinary determination that characterized so many of his generation. Tom Brokaw called Peter Rodino's generation the greatest generation. Peter Rodino demonstrated that both at war and at peace, on the fields of battle in World War II and on the floor of this House, particularly in the 1970s.  For 10 years, he worked days and attended law school at night, graduating from what is now Rutgers law school.                              {time}  2115  His personal courage, of course, was never in question. He volunteered for service during World War II, as I have said, even though he was too old and could have been exempted. Some lied, of course, and said they were 18 when they were 16 to get in the service. But Peter Rodino, who had served ably at that point in time in his community said, ``send me,'' ``send me,'' to his country.  He served in the army from 1941 to 1946, fighting with the First Armored Division in North Africa and in the home of his father's birth, Italy. He was awarded the Bronze Star, a War Cross, and Knight Order of the Crown from Italy.  His defining moment, of course, as we have all said was 1974, when he stood up for the Constitution, for the American people, for a way of life, for a continuity of government. Judiciary Chairman Rodino demonstrated wise judgment. ``Wise'' has been used a number of times in referring to Peter Rodino. How appropriate.  At a moment of instability and uncertainty for our Nation, which could have been dangerously exacerbated by excessive partisanship or overzealous action, Chairman Rodino brought wise, measured, thoughtful, and honest consideration to this awesome task.  This Nation was blessed by God with Peter Rodino, as God has blessed this Nation with many others at times of crisis to stand and serve ably and wisely.  I want to say to his family that we share their loss, we thank them for his service, and we will remember our dear and faithful, wise and kind, good colleague, Peter Wallace Rodino.  I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.
