 President, I come to the floor today to remind my colleagues and the American people, once again, about the deadly tornadoes, storms, and floods that affected the Midwest earlier this year. Iowa, my State, was especially hard hit by this severe weather event. The people in Iowa have great pride and resiliency. They don't like to complain, and it is even harder for them to ask for help. However, I wish my colleagues to know that Iowans are hurting, similar to people in other natural disasters. I see it in their eyes as they sort through the rubble and try to rebuild their lives.  As their Senator, their friend, their neighbor, I am asking my colleagues to help and to help now. I thank my colleagues who have come to me and the rest of the Iowa congressional delegation and other Members whose States were affected. We have all had colleagues come to us to share their condolences and ask how they can help.  However, I have heard some comments that this disaster was not severe enough to warrant special legislative attention. Washington doesn't seem to understand the devastation. That is the way I see it. In other words, it is not on television for 2 months in a row such as it was in New Orleans, so we don't seem to be getting the attention of colleagues such as we did from Hurricane Katrina. But we do have an emergency, and Congress needs to respond such as we did after 9/11 for New York City or after Katrina for New Orleans.  Ten States were affected by this severe weather system. In Iowa alone, 340 communities were affected by these tornadoes, storms, and flooding. Iowasuffered well over $10 billion in damages. Of this amount, approximately $4 billion was agricultural loss, $4 billion was business loss, and $1 billion was housing damage and loss. Right now, those are very rough figures. I think they are only going to climb every day after these initial estimates.  The floods in Iowa were well over a 500-year flood event level in many parts of my State. For example, the Cedar River in the Cedar Rapids area was 11 feet over record flood stage. Since we began keeping records in the 1850s, the highest flood level had been 20 feet. The levees protecting the city are at 22 feet. In June, Cedar Rapids had 31 feet of water, well over the 22 feet of the levee protection and the the previous record of 20 feet.  Even my small hometown of New Hartford, IA, was first hit by an F5 tornado, which caused several deaths and severe damages and, just 2 weeks later, hit by severe flooding. Mr. President, 240 out of 270 homes had moderate to complete damage. Many of the businesses also suffered severe loss. They are trying to figure out how to stay in business. Unfortunately, for my small town, several have decided not to reopen.  On Monday, I visited the home you see in this photo. This is one of my constituents in Cedar Rapids, IA. As you can see, they have already taken out the moldy drywall. Here, this lady, Shirley, is showing how high the water was on the first floor, and that is after the basement had been completely filled with water. We also couldn't go to the second floor in this home because half of the steps were washed away.  So we are not just talking about standing water. At one point this was rushing water, turning over appliances and leaving boats in people's living rooms. It is people such as Shirley, who are in limbo because Congress is not acting, needing to know what assistance can be provided. They do not know whether the Government will help. Should they stay or should they leave?  Then we have business owners who are worried about their employees not having homes. Will they leave town because they do not have a place to live? Then will the small businesses be closed because customers who use the local diner won't be there or the local flower shop won't be there? It is a vicious circle when you don't have housing for your workers.  My colleagues in the Midwest and I have been working with appropriators on additional emergency assistance to help us with the recovery and with the rebuilding process. I happen to be concerned that this additional emergency assistance is being held up by nonemergency, nonrelated, and, in fact, quite controversial provisions. I believe we should do what we did for New York and what we did for New Orleans: consider the emergency portion separately from other appropriations that people think need to be done, and do it before the August congressional recess.  Aid to the Midwest should not be held hostage to politics. Iowans are beginning to notice the inaction in Congress. I get asked why--why hasn't something been done? I would like to read to you parts of an editorial running in the Waterloo Courier. Waterloo is close to my hometown. I am not going to read it all, but, I want to include the entire editorial in the Record. I will read from just portions of it because it tells what Iowans are thinking about the inaction in Congress and that maybe there is a double standard.  The headline is: ``Congress Needs To Make Time To Help Iowa.''       Iowans who don't agree with the recent minuscule approval      ratings of Congress may want to take a second look. Congress      has delayed consideration of a bill that includes further      disaster aid for Iowa until after Congress' August recess.  The editorial goes on:       That's quite a slap in the face to those people and      businesses already confused by which direction to take      concerning housing and rebuilding issues. The Senate      Appropriations Committee was scheduled to take up the      supplemental package on Thursday, but Senator Robert Byrd,      Democrat of West Virginia, the committee chairman, announced      late Tuesday it was putting off consideration until after the      recess.  Then they quote Senator Byrd:       There is no opportunity to begin consideration of a      supplemental appropriations bill during the next 10 days.  Then the editorial goes on to say that Byrd said the Senate was busy debating legislation on housing, energy, defense policy, and taxes before the recess.  Continuing to quote the editorial:       Our response to Senator Byrd and the rest of the Congress      is: Make the time. Delay the recess if you have to. We'd also      like to remind the Senator of his comments just last month      after areas in West Virginia were ravaged by storms.  The editorial refers to that statement, with Senator Byrd saying this:       Once again, West Virginia has suffered at the hands of      Mother Nature. Every moment counts in the recovery efforts,      and every little bit of help is crucial.  Then the editorial repeats again the last words of Senator Byrd's statement--``every moment counts.'' That was his plea then.  It goes on to say:       Sounds very similar to situations faced today by many Iowa      communities, businesses, families, and individuals. It      appears that Byrd's view on timely assistance doesn't extend      to the Midwest.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire editorial so people can read it in its entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From The Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier, July 25, 2008]                Congress Needs To Make Time To Help Iowa       Iowans who don't agree with the recent minuscule approval      ratings of Congress may want to take a second look.       Congress has delayed consideration of a bill that includes      further disaster aid for Iowa until after Congress' August      recess.       That's quite a slap in the face to those people and      businesses already confused about which direction to take      concerning housing and rebuilding issues.       ``Congress doesn't seem to understand the devastation,''      Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said. ``We've got an      emergency, and Congress needs to respond. If my colleagues      doubt me that this is an emergency, I'm in Iowa every weekend      and I'll be happy to show them around.''       Don't expect too many of Grassley's cohorts to take him up      on his invitation.       On Tuesday, Iowa Gov. Chet Culver met with a congressional      delegation and said he was asking for an additional $1      billion in disaster relief. The government has already      approved $2.6 billion in assistance.       The Senate Appropriations Committee was scheduled to take      up the supplemental package on Thursday, but Sen. Robert      Byrd, D-West Virginia--the committee chairman--announced late      Tuesday it was putting off consideration until after the      recess.       ``There is no opportunity to begin consideration of a      supplemental appropriations bill during the next 10 days,''      Byrd said in a statement.       Byrd said the Senate was busy debating legislation on      housing, energy, defense policy and taxes before the recess.       Our response to Sen. Byrd and the rest of Congress is: Make      the time. Delay the recess if you have to.       We'd also like to remind the senator of his comments just      last month after areas in West Virginia were ravaged by      storms.       ``Once again, West Virginia has suffered at the hand of      Mother Nature,'' Byrd said. ``Every moment counts in the      recovery efforts, and every little bit of help is crucial. I      appreciate the willingness of the Bush Administration to      extend relief to additional counties in our state. This wise      decision will bring much needed FEMA aid to these struggling      communities so they can begin the difficult task of      rebuilding.''       Just to reiterate: ``Every moment counts,'' was his plea      then.       He had previously written to the president asking for a      disaster declaration as soon as possible, as the damage was      ``beyond the capabilities of the State of West Virginia and      the affected local governments.''       Sounds very similar to the situations faced today by many      Iowa communities, businesses, families and individuals.       It appears Byrd's view on timely assistance doesn't extend      to the Midwest.       Sen. Byrd's Web page is www.byrd.senate.gov. An e-mail      address can be found there. If you feel compelled to leave      him a message, please make it brief. We would hate to take up      too much of his time.
