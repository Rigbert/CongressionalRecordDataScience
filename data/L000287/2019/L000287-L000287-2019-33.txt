Paula Kocher Barnes on her retirement from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and for her decades of public service.  For over 40 years, Ms. Barnes served our country--most recently as deputy associate general counsel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Office of the General Counsel located in Georgia's Fifth Congressional District.  It took some time for Ms. Barnes to make her way to our wonderful city. A native daughter of Iowa, Ms. Barnes completed her undergraduate degree at Coe College in Cedar Rapids. She continued her studies at Emory University's School of Law, where I believe Metro Atlanta infused her spirit. Ms. Barnes began a career in federal service at the Department of Education in 1980 and joined the HHS Office of the General Counsel in the Region IV Atlanta Office a couple of years later.  After five years in the regional office, Ms. Barnes transitioned to the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), where she continued her federal career for the next 32 years. During her tenure with the ATSDR, Ms. Barnes served on the front lines of implementing policy at the intersection of environment and health policy, an issue that is near and dear to my heart. As an attorney-advisor, Ms. Barnes worked to implement the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, a monumental bill which became public law the same year that I was elected to Congress.  As a senior attorney, Ms. Barnes continued this important effort by providing key counsel for interagency initiatives and memoranda on environmental health policy. In January 2014, the Centers for Disease Control promoted Ms. Barnes to the prominent position of deputy associate general counsel for the CDC/ATSDR Branch. Over the years, she contributed to litigation efforts regarding the Agent Orange exposure studies, the Federal Advisory Committee Act-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Diesel Study, Freedom of Information Act, ATSDR cost recovery, and the precedential Hanford Downwinders case.  Ms. Barnes also managed to find the time to advance scholarship and policy in her professional field by contributing to numerous publications, including two prominent public health law textbooks and several articles. In addition, she served as an adjunct professor at Georgia State University's and Emory University's law schools and as a guest lecturer at Duke University.  During her esteemed career, Ms. Barnes played a critical role in several significant public health activities and events, including emergency responses to the September 11th tragedy, anthrax threats, Ebola Virus, Zika, and several major natural disasters. Our nation and the global family are forever grateful for Ms. Barnes and so many other CDC employees who help keep us safe, healthy, and alive.  Today, I would like to thank Ms. Barnes for her 41 years of federal service, for her dedication to public health, public service, and education. As she prepares for a well-deserved retirement, I wish Ms. Barnes the very best as she embarks upon this next chapter.                          ____________________
