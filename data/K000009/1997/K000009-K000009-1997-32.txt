Speaker, I want to say that I am not going to vote for this bill because I cannot even find the bill. I went down to the Clerk's office just now because I was told that is where the only copy of the bill was. In fact, I was told that it was filed at the Government Printing Office at 4:15 this morning. So then we call over to the Committee on Ways and Means. I said, I will run over to the Committee on Ways and Means and get the bill. I call over to the Committee on Ways and Means, and they said, we have only got the sections that deal with our committee. We have got Social Security, we have got Medicare, we have got Medicaid.  I said, let us take a look and see if it is up in the Committee on Rules. They said, no, the Committee on Rules does not have the bill. Maybe there is one copy down on the floor, maybe the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley], maybe the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] have that copy.  Then I said, well, let us go to the web site. So we went to Thomas.loc.gov. Guess what? The bill is not on the web site. I am not elected by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon]. I am not elected by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Moakley]. I am elected by the people of the Ninth Congressional District of Ohio. I cannot get a bill, and I do not want to listen to the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. Spratt] because he did not elect me. The people back in Ohio elected me.  To bring this kind of a bill to the floor today and tomorrow, what is the rush? Are we afraid the American people might actually know what is in this bill and would not want us to vote on this until September when we have had a chance to study the bill? What is the rush? I can see a fast ball when it comes.
