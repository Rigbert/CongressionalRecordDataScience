James C. Metts, Jr. an award to recognize his research on the fate of General Casimir Pulaski's remains. Dr. Metts, coroner of Chatham County, Georgia, served as the chairman of a 10-year investigaton to positively identify General Pulaski's remains. Mr. Kingston and I want to congratulate Dr. Metts upon receiving this award.  The birthday of Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski in George Washington's Continental Army was marked for the first time on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, March 6, 2007, the 262nd anniversary of his birth in Warsaw, Poland.  To celebrate the occasion, the National Polish Center (also known as the American Center of Polish Culture of Washington, DC) sponsored a birthday breakfast at the Rayburn House Office Building. Among those who came were sponsors of the resolutions to make Pulaski an honorary U.S. citizen and other notables from Congress and the Polish-American community. The featured speaker, Dr. Thaddeus Radzilowski, was president of the Piast Institute in Detroit, Michigan, and former president of St. Mary's College in Orchard Lake, Michigan.  Dr. Metts was recognized for his leadership and report on General Pulaski, whose remains were found September 1996. They had been buried in a crypt under the Pulaski Monument in Savannah, Georgia, since 1853, though Pulaski had been widely rumored to have been buried at sea.  Edward Pinkowski, internationally known authority on General Pulaski, was the chief sponsor of the Pulaski identification project.  Pulaski's remains were examined by forensic specialists in Savannah since 1996. Dr. Metts said the remains are ``consistent in remarkable detail with the physical appearance, life history, and cavalry lifestyle of Casmir Pulaski.''  Pulaski's remains were re-interred in October 2005 in front of the monument in Savannah's Monterey Square.  At the Washington event, a wreath was laid at the heroic-size marble bust of Pulaski located in the Capitol Building. The bust was carved by Henry Dmochowski (1810-1863) from Carrara marble and moved to Capitol Hill in 1882.  According to Jack Pinkowski, Ph.D., vice chairman of the National Polish Center, ``this first birthday celebration at the Capitol is important because it identifies Pulaski's correct birth date as March 6, 1745. It also gives us an opportunity to recognize the 10 years of work of Dr. Metts and his team in Poland and in the United States.  Casimir Pulaski was born and raised in Warsaw, the son of Count Joseph Pulaski, a member of the Polish parliament (Sejm). The young Pulaski won his reputation as a guerilla fighter in Poland's struggle for independence.  Political intrigue forced him to leave Poland in 1772, and he spent time in Turkey, Germany, and France. He went to America in 1777 with a letter of recommendation from Benjamin Franklin, who was solicited by Pulaski's friends. Pulaski was commissioned by the Continental Congress as a brigadier general to command four cavalry regiments and later formed the Pulaski Legions.  Among his exploits in the American fight for freedom were saving George Washington's life and the successful defense of Charleston in May 1778. He was wounded at the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779, and died on board the ship Wasp. He was secretly buried on Greenwich Plantation next to Thunderbolt Bluffs on the banks of the Wilmington River next to the plantation where the Wasp was tied up to a finger wharf and where Samuel Bullfinch, captain of the Wasp, wrote a letter that notified General Benjamin Lincoln of Pulaski's death. He said that Pulaski died on board his ship on October 15.  Pulaski remains a symbol of Polish courage, Polish initiative, and Polish friendship for the United States.  We thank Dr. James C. Metts, Jr. for his efforts to remind us of this American Revolutionary War hero, and congratulate him on his receipt of the American Center of Polish Culture award.                          ____________________
