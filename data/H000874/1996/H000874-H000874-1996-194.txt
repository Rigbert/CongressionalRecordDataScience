Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Let me tell my colleagues what I think the American public appreciates: Honesty and candor. I have been on this committee since 1983. I cannot tell my friends how many hundreds of Members have come to me to say I cannot vote for it but I sure need that cost of living adjustment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 20 seconds to the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], the distinguished chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, one of the most respected Members in this House.
