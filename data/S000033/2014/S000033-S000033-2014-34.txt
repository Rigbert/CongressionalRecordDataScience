 President, yesterday the House voted 420 to 5 for this conference report. They understood that taking care of veterans, as Senator McCain just indicated--the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend us, who have sacrificed so much--is a cost of war, and in fact what we are talking about is an emergency. That is what the House said overwhelmingly yesterday.  On June 11, 2014, 6 or so weeks ago, by a vote of 93 to 3, the Senate supported the Sanders-McCain bill and it was emergency funded as a cost of war.  This bill, as Senator Coburn indicated, is about one-third of the cost of what we voted on in the original Sanders-McCain bill.  Let us defeat this point of order. Let us stand with the veterans of this country, let us reform the VA, and let us go forward.
