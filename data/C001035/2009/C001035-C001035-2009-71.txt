President, I rise today to offer a bill to reduce the production of black carbon, a potent contributor to global climate change. I am pleased to be joined on this bill by my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, as the lead cosponsor.  Black carbon is a particulate produced during the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials. It has been estimated to have, on an equivalent mass basis, more than 500 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Reducing the production of black carbon would help stabilize the global climate.  Black carbon is produced by some events, such as forest fires, that cannot easily be corrected by Senate actions. My bill addresses a mechanism of black carbon production that we can influence.  Throughout the world today, an estimated two billion people cook with solid fuels over an open fire or with primitive stoves. More than 50 percent of the controllable black carbon emissions in the world are due to these practices. Modern stoves, designed to efficiently burn fuel, can eliminate up to 90 percent of the black carbon produced during cooking and home heating.  Additionally, cooking and heating with poorly designed stoves emits noxious gases and particulates. Experts believe that these pollutants cause the premature deaths of over 1 million people, chiefly women and children, each year. Replacing these stoves with modern alternatives will strongly reduce the number of these deaths. There is a real need to find alternatives to those poorly performing stoves to improve global environmental and human health.  The U.S. Agency for International Development carries out activities under a number of existing projects to place low-cost, fuel efficient stoves in poor communities. It has found that, to be successful, the new stoves must be customized to fit the needs and cooking traditions of the community. These programs have had a very positive impact. But, they have not had the resources to optimize stoves to minimize black carbon emissions.  Our bill authorizes $1 million per year for 2 years for the U.S. Agency for International Development to conduct a pilot program to develop and test stoves that optimize both fuel efficiency and black carbon reduction.  This measure addresses an issue, global climate change, that we must take very seriously. It also provides funding that, while addressing an important global pollutant, also alleviates a public health disaster affecting developing nations. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1396       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the      Administrator of the United States Agency for International      Development.       (2) Black carbon.--The term ``black carbon'' means a      particulate formed through the incomplete combustion of      fossil fuels, biofuel, and biomass.     SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM ON PROMOTION OF FUEL-EFFICIENT STOVES                    ENGINEERED TO OPERATE WITHOUT THE PRODUCTION OF                    BLACK CARBON.       The Administrator shall establish a 2-year pilot program to      promote the production and use of fuel-efficient stoves      that--        (a) do not produce significant amounts of black carbon;      and       (b) are customized for use throughout the world.     SEC. 3. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.       Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of      this Act, and not later than 30 days after the last day of      the pilot program established under section 2, the      Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on the pilot      program that includes--       (1) the names of the organizations receiving funding      through the pilot program;       (2) the names of communities identified for participation      in the pilot program and descriptions of the socioeconomic      parameters that led to their selection for participation in      the pilot program;       (3) a description of the services carried out by the      Administrator under the pilot program;       (4) an assessment of the effectiveness of the pilot      program; and       (5) the recommendations of the Administrator with respect      to the extension or expansion of the pilot program.     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this      Act $1,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2011.                                 ______                                       By
