 President, tomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to the consideration of the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act of 2004. At 2:15 the Senate will proceed to two back-to-back rollcall votes. The first vote will be on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill we have been discussing, the Pregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act. That vote, regardless of outcome, will be immediately followed by a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to recommit S. 1637, the FSC/ETI JOBS bill. These two votes will be the first votes of the day.  In addition to those votes, the majority leader has repeated his desire to consider and complete the pension equity conference report prior to the Easter recess. That conference report is here and is available. We will be seeking an agreement, obviously, to finish that bill.                          ____________________
