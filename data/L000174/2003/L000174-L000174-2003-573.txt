President, while the distinguished Senator from Florida is still in the Chamber, I wish to thank him for his impassioned comments. I am going to be speaking later this week on this same subject. I am one who, for a number of reasons--geopolitically, strategically, and economically--have not supported the current embargo on Cuba. I am, however--and I feel proud--as Vermonters say, I bow to nobody on the question of human rights on this floor.  I met with Mr. Castro in Havana a couple years ago at a time when there was another crackdown of dissidents. I told him specifically what I felt about that in very strong words. He obviously disagreed with me, but I felt as an American in Cuba, it would be wrong for me not to express such a view.  I will follow with a speech later this week on Cuba, but I hope my good friend from Florida, who has been such an extraordinary leader in this area over the years, when he was in State government in Florida, when he was in the House of Representatives, and as a Senator--he has been such an extraordinary leader. I hope he knows, no matter how one might feel about our overall relations with Cuba, no American should find justifiable the silence of those who simply wish to speak to basic human freedoms, basic human rights--the right of speech, the right of religion. These are issues that, from the time of Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and George Washington, we have enunciated in this country, but I do not know any country that can claim any form of democracy and freedom that would feel that way. I commend my friend. I hope others will listen to him. I hope 90 miles from his home State that it will be heard as strongly as it was heard on the floor of the Senate. I commend him.
