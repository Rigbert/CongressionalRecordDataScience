Speaker, I was unavoidably detained and unable to vote on rollcall vote Nos. 566 and 567. Had I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall No. 566, on ordering the previous question to House Resolution 288, and ``no'' on rollcall No. 567, on agreeing to House Resolution 288. I ask unanimous consent to have this statement appear in the appropriate place in the Congressional Record.                          ____________________
