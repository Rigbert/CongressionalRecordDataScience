President, I rise today to support the amendment introduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to strengthen the capability of our law enforcement community to protect older women from violence.  There is no conduct less consistent with the precepts of a civilized society than the physical abuse of those unable to defend themselves. Our recognition of this has led to an aggressive and ongoing campaign against child abuse, and it must lead to an equally strong response to domestic violence directed at older Americans.  Mr. President, at a 1995 hearing in Portland, Maine, chaired by my predecessor, Senator Cohen, elder abuse was aptly described as ``society's secret shame.'' Family violence, particularly when directed at the elderly, was a major concern of Senator Cohen, and I welcome the opportunity to continue his efforts to combat this intolerable mistreatment of older Americans.  Mr. President, earlier this year my home state released its crime statistics for 1997. I was cheered by the wonderful news that crime fell by 8.7% from 1996, to the lowest rate in at least 20 years. Hidden behind this positive statistic, however, was one that was very disquieting, namely, that domestic violence increased by 7.8%. Ironically, at the same time as we are becoming less likely to be harmed by strangers, many of our neighbors face an increasing threat from members of their own households.  National data demonstrate that cases of domestic elder abuse, which includes neglect as well as physical abuse, are steadily increasing. From 1986 to 1996, the number of cases went from 117,000 to 293,000, an increase of 150%. Furthermore, there is widespread agreement that this type of abuse is greatly underreported. For example, although the number of reported cases in 1994 was 241,000, the National Center on Elder Abuse estimates that the true number of cases was 818,000.  Mr. President, while these numbers indicate a serious and growing problem, all of the statistics in the world do not describe the problem as eloquently as the words of a single victim. At the Maine hearing, one such victim told what happened to her at the hands of her husband after her children left home.       [T]hings got really bad. I had two broken wrists, cracked      ribs, held down with his knee on my chest with a knife at my      throat. I was made to crawl across the floor with a gun      resting on my head, ready to fire. I've been choked until I      was limp, and then he would drop me on the floor with a kick.      I've been spit on, thrown through a window, dragged into the      lake as he said he was going to drown me.Astonishingly, but not atypically, the witness was married to her husband for 44 years.  Mr. President, this type of treatment cannot be tolerated. As a cosponsor of the Durbin amendment, I sincerely hope that my colleagues will take this modest step to enhance the ability of the law enforcement community to protect this vulnerable segment of our society.                           amendment No. 3313(Purpose: To modify the membership of the Federal-State Joint Board on                            universal service)       On page 72, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:       Sec. 209.
