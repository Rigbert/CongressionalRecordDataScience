REID. We are talking about $30 billion.  I do not have time. I will be happy, when my time is up, to respond to questions from the Senator from Oklahoma.  This would affect about 4 million students a year. It would reduce Pell grants, and Pell grants go to the most needy students, it would reduce Pell grants for individual students by 40 percent. That is wrong. We would cut back moneys for the Head Start Program, special education. That is not the right priority. The right priorities are to achieve a balanced budget but let us eliminate tax cuts. That is the first way to go. It makes it very simple. And I would be very interested in doing away with some of the tax loopholes that are still in the Federal Tax Code. We could freeze tax loopholes at their current levels and save $300 billion. If we want to be more specific and maintain some of those, which this Senator would be willing to do, we would maybe only save $250 billion. The point is simply that we would save lots of money by cutting tax loopholes. That is what we need to do.  The Republican balanced budget plan is a plan that is harmful to people who want to work. We are talking about equal sacrifice. This is not equal sacrifice, as was said on National Public Radio yesterday by noted Republican commentator Kevin Phillips. He said that the Republican plan in effect damages and hurts the working people but rewards significantly the rich. There is no equal sacrifice. The rich would benefit from the plan while all the sacrifice would go to the working middle class.  That is not the way we should go. I believe, Mr. President, that we must be careful that we do not ruin Medicare; that we not have tax cuts only for the most affluent of our society; that we have reasonable, noninjurious cuts in Medicare; that we make sure we do not damage the education phase of our system; and most of all that we do not hurt the working people of this country.  I would be happy to respond to a question of my friend from Oklahoma.
