Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of U.S. Marine Corps Captain Sarah Deal. Captain Deal deserves the warmest, most heart-felt congratulations for her accomplishment of becoming the first female pilot in Marine Corps history. Her achievements reflect her courage, determination and self-belief. On behalf of Ohio's lawmakers and citizens, I wish to pay tribute to this outstanding young woman.  Growing up in Pemberville, Ohio, Captain Deal always had a passion for flying, in part inspired by her father, a former Marine, who worked as an engineer testing jet engines. A graduate from Eastwood High School, she went on to study Aviation at Kent State University. From there, she made the tough choice to join the United States Marine Corps to begin training as an air traffic control officer. Even though women were allowed to fly in the Army, Navy and Air Force, she still chose the Marines, knowing that the only way she would be allowed to fly would be recreationally. However, her difficult choice was rewarded with the landmark Defense Department decision in 1993, ordering the armed forces to end their ban on women flying combat missions. Following the announcement, Captain Deal immediately chose to attend Marine flight school despite being the only women there. Her persistence and hard work were rewarded in April 1995, when her father had the pleasure of pinning her wings to her uniform at her graduation ceremony in Milton, Florida.  Abigail Adams once wrote in a letter to her husband, ``all history and every age exhibit instances of patriotic virtue in the female sex; which considering our situation equals the most heroic of yours.'' Captain Deal follows in the footsteps of the legendary Grace Hopper, mathematician and computer pioneer, who became the first female Rear Admiral in the US Navy. And of Sally Ride, the first female U.S. astronaut. And of Mary Hallaren, champion for permanent status for women in the military after World War II and subsequent director of the Women's Auxiliary Corps from 1947-1953. All these women have proved there is nothing that cannot equally be achieved by women in our armed forces. Captain Deal's achievements are a proud demonstration of what can be achieved by women in today's society. Her achievements offer hope and encouragement to all women to follow their dreams and to pursue paths that have previously been unjustly denied them. Her efforts have been a key factor in breaking the gender barrier that existed in the armed forces and in opening the eyes of others to more tolerant attitudes.  This month Captain Deal will be inducted into the Ohio Women's Hall of Fame, in recognition of her achievements. On behalf of Ohio's Ninth District, I would like to wish Captain Deal every success with her military career and in her current assignment with the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, California. We are truly grateful for her service to our country and once again congratulate her for all her achievements. Her virtue and patriotism are a shining example to all women, and indeed, all people in this Nation.                          ____________________
