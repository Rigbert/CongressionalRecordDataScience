 President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senator Snowe and Senator Wyden, to support the bipartisan Medicare Enhancement for Needed Drugs Act. This legislation is an important step toward controlling the spiraling cost of prescription drugs for America's seniors.  Last November, I voted in favor of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act because I believed it was the right step toward finally delivering on a promise Congress made to its seniors to modernize Medicare by providing prescription drug coverage in the nearly 40-year-old program.  I personally ran the numbers and looked at a variety of options to add a prescription drug benefit in Medicare, but I decided to support the final bill that was passed last November and signed into law in December because I felt it would make a genuine, positive difference for the seniors in my State, particularly those with low incomes or very high drug bills.  The key to the Medicare bill is that the prescription drug coverage is voluntary. No senior will be forced to enroll in drug coverage in Medicare, also called Medicare Part D. Those who do will receive assistance from the Federal Government for their drug bills up to $2,250 in total drug costs and will only pay 5 percent of their drug costs above $3,600 in out-of-pocket spending.  I have said several times on the floor of the Senate that I was dismayed at a provision in the bill that prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from negotiating lower prescription drug prices. Similarly, I said that I would take action to remove this provision and work toward lowering costs of the program.  I feel strongly that savings to the Medicare Program can be achieved by provisions in the Medicare Enhancement for Needed Drugs Act. Now is the time to find solutions that reduce the cost of prescription drugs for our Nation's seniors and for the future of Medicare. I know seniors in my State who have had to make the terrible choice of paying for their prescription drugs and paying for rent and groceries. In the end, many skip or reduce their dosages putting their health at risk. That is simply unacceptable.  This bill represents a comprehensive approach to strengthening the drug coverage in the Medicare bill by addressing the skyrocketing drug costs.  First and foremost, the bill strikes language in the Medicare bill called the ``noninterference'' provision. That section bars the HHS Secretary from interfering with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and sponsors of prescription drug plans. I strongly believe that the Secretary should be given the authority similar to that of other Federal entities that purchase prescription drugs in bulk to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered part D drugs.  CBO estimates that the effect of striking the ``noninterference'' provision would have a ``negligible effect'' on Federal spending because the savings CBO predicts private plans will be able to obtain will be greater than what the Secretary will be able to achieve.  However, what if CBO's predictions are not the reality and private plans cannot achieve the lowest prices available? What if competition among private plans does not bring about greater cost savings? In that scenario, the HHS Secretary would not be able to step in and use the full force of the Federal Government's bulk purchasing power to lower prescription drug prices.  A 2001 inspector general's report from the Department of Health and Human Services found that the Department of Veterans' Affairs, VA, paid an average of 52 percent less for a list of two dozen drugs than did Medicare. The VA employs a number of cost-saving techniques such as using generics whenever available and substituting high-priced medications with just as effective ones for lower prices.  I strongly believe that the Federal Government should employ the cost-saving techniques for Medicare as the VA does for the acquisition of prescription drugs.  As an incentive to participating Medicare drug plans to negotiate the lowest possible drug prices, the bill allocates $500 million from the Medicare Stabilization Fund to be used by the HHS Secretary for those plans to secure negotiated prices that are on average within 10 percent of VA or Department of Defense.  In order to ensure that seniors can make an ``apples to apples'' comparison when determining which drug plan suits them best, the bill requires that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, determine the negotiated savings received from each plan.  The bill makes a significant step toward increasing access to lower cost reimported prescription drugs by ensuring access to these markets. It prohibits any company that discriminates publicly, privately or otherwise against foreign retailers or wholesalers who pass along discounts to consumers living in the United States from taking advantage of the advertising deduction allowed under the U.S. Tax Code. The purpose of this provision is to stop the practice of drug manufacturers limiting their shipments to foreign countries expressly to prevent reimportation by American consumers.  I have heard concerns raised by many of my constituents about the impact the Medicare bill will have on their medigap plans. This bill directs the HHS Secretary to work with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to conduct a review of the changes to the medigap policies in the new drug benefit for the purpose of evaluate its impact on Medicare beneficiaries.  CBO projects that Americans over 65 will spend $1.8 trillion on prescription drugs over the next 10 years. Recent studies of United States and Canadian drug price comparisons show that, on average, prices charged by manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers were higher in the United States, most recently by about 70 percent.  If we do not address the exorbitant costs of prescription drugs in this country today, we threaten the viability of programs like Medicare for future generations. I am pleased to join Senators Snowe and Wyden in the fight for lower prescription drug prices for our seniors.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.                          ____________________
