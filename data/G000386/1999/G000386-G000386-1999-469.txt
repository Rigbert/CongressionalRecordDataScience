 President, I rise in support of the Enzi, Grassley, Thomas, Conrad amendment. Livestock producers have few viable risk management tools available to deal with drought, excessive rain and snow, flood, or disease. Dismal profits for cattlemen and the collapse of hog market in the Fall of 1998 are two of the predominate factors which have spurred a renewed interest in livestock insurance. I feel it is important that any consideration of reform for federal crop insurance and/or federal risk management programs should include the needs of livestock producers.  Since the introduction of revenue insurance programs in 1996 farmers raising crops have been provided risk management tools which better mediate the unavoidable risks farmers experience. Programs such as Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC), Income Protection (IP), and Revenue Assurance (RA) are available for crops, but currently a statutory prohibition bans the development of federally supported livestock insurance.  It is my opinion that we have a responsibility to provide risk management tools to all farmers, whether they raise crops or livestock. Iowa State University's Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) has studied the possible benefits of Whole-Farm Revenue Insurance for crop and livestock producers.
