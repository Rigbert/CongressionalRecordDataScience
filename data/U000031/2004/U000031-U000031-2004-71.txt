Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the girls of Brownie Troop 139 of South Haven, Michigan, who have over the last few months sent numerous care packages to our troops serving in Iraq. These young ladies have shown remarkable dedication and devotion to our troops, and I am confident that this great project has been received with gratitude and appreciation from those overseas.  Since the troop began their project, they have collected more than $1,200 worth of items totaling 345 pounds. Some of the items these generous girls have sent include granola bars, playing cards, batteries, hand lotion, boot laces, and of course Girl Scout cookies. Over the holidays, the girls put together special packages to give our troops a sense of home.  Brownie Troop 139 is comprised of Jeanne Lyon, leader of Troop 139; Marilyn Shaefer, co-leader; Stephanie Balke; Maggie Filbrandt; Jessica Overholser; Hannah Lyon; Shelby Murphy; Erin Cooper; and Lauren Montgomery. The magnificent work this troop has done to encourage morale and give support to our troops has been inspiring. It greatly pleases me to honor the great charity these girls have done, and I find their patriotism and selflessness to be deeply moving.                          ____________________
