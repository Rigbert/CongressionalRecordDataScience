Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the good-hearted gentleman from Massachusetts. I have had the great privilege to serve in the United States Congress with Joe Kennedy since we were both elected in 1986. Over the years, Joe Kennedy has become more than just my colleague, he has become my friend and my brother. He will be missed in this great institution. He will also be remembered for his indefatigable capacity to help those and to stand up for those who have been left out and left behind.  It is no great secret that Joe Kennedy is the oldest son of my friend and hero, Robert F. Kennedy. There goes a saying that the apple never falls very far from the tree. Since I first met Joe, I knew he possessed the same passion for justice and equality that characterized the extraordinary political career of his father. For some, to follow in the footsteps--let alone be the eldest son--of an American hero would be a curse. But for Joe, he honors his father and his mother, Ethel Kennedy, by being a passionate fighter for what is right. Our nation has been well served by his advocacy for better public and affordable housing for every American, by his tireless efforts for low income energy assistance, by his tenacious efforts to stop the practice of redlining by banks and other institutions and by his leading opposition to the School of the Americas, better known as the ``school of assassins.'' I will miss Joe Kennedy, but the poor, the elderly, the dispossessed and the lovers of democracy will miss him even more.  When you consider all the accomplishments of Joe Kennedy, both as a private citizen andas a member of the House, he has stood tall for the ``dignity of mankind.'' He has never faltered in the long walk toward justice. He has never feared the good fight. He knows how to build a coalition and bring together disparate voices under one tent. We need more Joe Kennedys in the U.S. House of Representatives. We need men and women who are willing to stand up for the enduring principles of democracy. Joe Kennedy is, above all else, an American patriot--he cares deeply for justice, equal opportunity and peace.  As we lose one of the finest members of this Congress, Massachusetts gains a concerned and tireless citizen. I know he will not give up in fighting for those who will need heated homes for the long New England winters. He will continue to speak up and speak out for what is right and for what is just and for what is fair.  It was Joe's father--Robert Kennedy--who used to say: ``Some men see things as they are and say why, I dream of things that never were and say why not.'' Joe Kennedy has lived up to his father's words. He has always said ``why not?''  I am convinced that the spirit of history will continue to guide Joe Kennedy. I pray that the spirit of history guides him to even greater challenges. Thank you, Joe, for your great service to our nation. You have made a profound difference in the lives of millions of Americans. I will miss you, your colleagues will miss you and the American people will miss you. Keep your eyes on the Prize!                          ____________________
