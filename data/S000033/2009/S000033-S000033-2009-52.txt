 I go to the Capitol physician's office. That is where I go. We pay extra money for it. I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield, but I go there. Do you know who runs the Capitol physician's office, which I suspect the vast majority of the Members of Congress go to and get very fine primary health care?  Well, it is that terrible government agency, the U.S. Navy. So maybe some of our friends who are busy denouncing government health care might want to say they do not want to take advantage of that very fine, high quality health care, and that speaks for the whole military as well. While we are at it, maybe you should abolish health care for the U.S. military, which is all government run and, by the way, generally regarded as pretty good quality health care.  I would ask my friend his views on that.
