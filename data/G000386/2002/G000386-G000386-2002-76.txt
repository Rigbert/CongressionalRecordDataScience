 As you can see, all taxpaying families in all States benefit. The examples are endless of the great benefits that we realize when we give tax relief to working families.  While I am pleased about the first anniversary, I won't be satisfied until we make these bipartisan measures permanent.  Let's tell every taxpayer they can count on the 10 percent bracket 10 years from now. Let's tell the small business owner that, after 10 years of hard work, they won't face a tax rate of 39.6 percent. Let's tell the single mother with two children that her taxes won't rise by $1,200. Let's tell the newlyweds that 10 years from now they don't have to face a marriage penalty. Let's tell family farmers they won't face the death tax 10 years from now. Let's tell workers saving for retirement that they can put away $5,000 in their IRA 10 years from now. Let's tell a young couple that 10 years from now they will continue to be able to save $2,000 each year per child for college savings.  I would like to sum up. In historical context, the tax relief package provides a modest refund to all taxpayers at a level previously supported by the Democratic leadership. Over time, the Democratic leadership's notion of what the top rate of tax should be has moved up.  Three assertions about the tax relief package, repeated almost daily by its critics, are incorrect. I will correct them once again. The tax relief package is bipartisan. The tax relief package did not cause our current or long-term budget problems. The tax relief package is progressive.  Finally, and most importantly, the tax relief package provides important resources for families, small businesses, retirement security, and education. These resources are valuable and should be available to the American people on a permanent basis.
