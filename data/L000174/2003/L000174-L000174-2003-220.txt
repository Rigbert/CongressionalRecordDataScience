REID. The Senator is correct. We are going to have an ominous omnibus bill. It is too bad we are going to do that because it will be a massive document. It will be done at the last minute. There will be a lot of little things jammed in there by the leadership. And then, of course, as the Senator knows, conferences that we do have are just one-sided. They don't include us in them. It is a funny way to run the country. This decision has been made by a Republican President, a Republican-controlled House and Senate.  I appreciate very much the Senator yielding.
