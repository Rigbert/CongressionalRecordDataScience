 President, I listened to my friend raise questions about the [[Page S7729]] amendment. My response is that all the questions he raised are totally irrelevant.  Whether or not 40 percent of the American people are afraid of their Government, the idea is that who they should be afraid of is anybody walking around with a bomb, grenade, rocket launcher, or a silencer on their gun, or a machine gun. That is who they should be afraid of. Whether there have been prosecutions or not is totally unrelated to whether or not the statute of limitations should be 3 or 5 years. And the notion of dangling over their head the prospect of prosecution--I have zero sympathy for anyone, whether they are a Mafia don, whether they are a rapist, or whether they are someone walking around with a rocket-propelled device, I could give a darn about their concern, if they violate the law. The question is did they violate it or did they not? They will have a chance to prove it in court. The police should have a chance to bring them to court.  With all due respect, I think his questions raised are irrelevant. I hope my friend from California will not bother to answer them, but that is the right of the Senator from California.
