With these student loans, the government guarantees that you get 100 percent back no matter what happens, plus your interest, no matter what happens. The student dies, goes bankrupt,leaves the country, you will get it back. So why are the interest rates so high?  Their eyes got big and they looked at me and said, well, very profitable. Yes. Guess what? We can charge the students 8, 9 percent interest for loans that are guaranteed by the Federal Government. So after much pressure from our side and from the parents and the families and the kids, the Republicans had to lower the interest rate just a little bit for the kids, but they gave an additional subsidy to the banks. So the banks are still going to get a guaranty of 100 percent repayment. They are still getting obscenely high interest rates. Interest rates are falling through the floor and the banks are getting an increase in the interest rates and the kids are not getting the loans.  Direct student loans, take out the middlemen. What do we need the banks in the middle for? Why should we guarantee the loans and give them a subsidy and give them those high interest rates and take the money out of the kids' pockets? If we had direct student loans through the institutions, through the kids, like I got when I was in college, another 600,000 kids could get student loans of $4000 or $5000 this year, if we just took out the banks' profits.  They say, that is too complicated. They said we tried to do an experiment. It did not work. Ross Perot was running the program.  But it can work, and that can be a much better way of doing this. And you can give more kids a higher education.  I just want to make one other point before I have to leave. The gentleman touched on this. From what they have not done, by not reforming HMOs and the insurance industry, from what they have not done in terms of dealing with teenage smoking, from what they have not done in terms of raising the minimum wage or protecting the environment, they have gotten some very rich and powerful friends. And those rich and powerful friends are rewarding them handsomely. That is why they are in a hurry to get out of Washington, D.C. now, not because they want to do a good job or get the job done or leave with the job done. They want to get home and start spending the obscene amounts of campaign cash that they have piled up.  I would just ask the people that are watching television today, when they watch those ads come piling out in October and up in the first few days of November, when they see them four and five to one, as a Democrat, I would like them to think, where did all that money come from? Where did all that money come from? It came from the HMOs.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
