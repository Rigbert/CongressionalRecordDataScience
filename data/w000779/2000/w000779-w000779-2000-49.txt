President, I wish today to draw the Senate's attention to National Assisted Living Week. The National Center for Assisted Living is sponsoring National Assisted Living Week this week to highlight the significance and the hope that this type of service can provide seniors.  Assisted living is a long term care alternative for seniors who need more assistance than is available in retirement communities, but do not require the heavy medical and nursing care provided by nursing facilities. Approximately one million of our nation's seniors have chosen the option of assisted living in this country. This demonstrates a tremendous desire by seniors and their families to have the kind of assistance that they need in bathing, taking medications or other activities of daily living in a setting that truly becomes their home.  This year's theme of National Assisted Living Week is ``The Art of Life'' and it is intended as recognition of the value of creative expression. I think that it is appropriate because it shows that assisted living is a real option for seniors to continue experiencing ``the art of life'' in living arrangements tailored to meet their needs for socialization, independence and services.  Oregon has led our nation in the concept of assisted living. My state spends more state health dollars to provide assisted living services than any other in our nation. Assisted living has taken different directions in different states, and I believe offering these choices for consumers is important to provide security, dignity and independence for seniors.  Assisted living will become even more important as an option of seniors and their families as our nation experiences the demographic tsunami of aging baby boomers. It is important for us to continue to support options that allow seniors and their families a choice of settings in order to assure that they get the level of care that they need.                          ____________________
