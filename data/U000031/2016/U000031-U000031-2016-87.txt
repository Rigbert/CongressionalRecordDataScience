Speaker, last Friday, we celebrated Earth Day. Every year on April 22 we recognize how much we have at stake in preserving the wondrous natural resources of not just the United States, but of the entire planet. As someone who has sponsored important legislation to upgrade pipeline safety standards and keep microbeads out of our waters while helping to broker a landmark deal that opened up markets for energy exports and extended tax credits for renewables, I understand the many momentous ways in which we have improved the environment within our great country since the first Earth Day in 1970. And no organization has captured the many ways in which our private businesses have made, and continue to make, huge strides toward sustainability than the Business Roundtable.  But to me and so many of our colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, the unsung heroes in the effort to make our nation cleaner and more abundant are the private companies that develop technologies that are responsible for a cleaner environment.  They are the ones who have developed technologies that have helped to clean our Nation's vital waterways, including the Great Lakes.  They have cleaned the air in Los Angeles, where the ``brown layer'' over the entire basin of 30-40 years ago is a distant memory. This is thanks to breakthroughs from auto manufacturers and oil refiners alike.  Chemical companies are enhancing energy efficiency in our homes and businesses, and increasing the productivity of our farmland.  The ability to tap into natural gas that seemed out of reach, if we even knew it existed, has enabled us to radically reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.  The Business Roundtable has done us all a great service by canvassing its members and compiling a document, entitled ``Create, Grow, Sustain: People and Technology at Work'' that acquaints us with the technologies that these very companies have used so effectively, and the cutting-edge approaches they have developed that will facilitate sustainability long into the future.  This report represents a catalog of technologies promise to bring about advances under the heading of sustainability at an even more rapid pace than we seen over the past decades. The future is bright indeed.  Mr. Speaker, I hope our colleagues will take the time to review the Business Roundtable 2016 sustainability report so they can see for themselves the exciting technologies being put into commerce by our leading companies.                          ____________________
