Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in commemorating National Public Service Recognition Week. I spoke earlier tonight of teachers. This more general recognition week was established in 1986. It is a week of national effort to educate and inform Americans about the range and quality of services provided by our public employees on the Federal, State, and local level.  As part of the national recognition effort, this weekend down on the Mall there are scores of exhibits that allow everyone to explore and learn more about the important work our civil servants perform across the country. I encourage any who can to attend.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the hundreds of thousands of hardworking civil servants across the country, many of whom devote their entire careers to serving others and strengthening this great Nation.  At the outset I would like to commend the efforts of my friend, the gentleman from Baltimore, MD, Mr. Elijah Cummings, the new ranking member of the Subcommittee on Civil Service. I would also like to thank the members the Bipartisan Federal Government Task Force, which I cochair, for continuing to fight for the hardworking Federal employees.  Mr. Speaker, in describing our Nation's civil servants, President Clinton recently noted, and I quote, ``Each day in schools and offices across the country, in hospitals, parks, museums, and on military installations, America's public employees dedicate their time, energy, and talent to create a brighter future for their fellow citizens and for our Nation.''  I could not agree with the President more. Of course, I hold a special affinity for our Nation's Federal work force. I represent thousands of Federal employees and retirees. I have worked hard to protect and preserve their pay and benefits over the years. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to do so.  Last Friday, I joined President Clinton to announce the balanced budget deal at a press conference in Baltimore. While it is not the deal that I would have written, I am pleased that the final package will apparently not contain a delay in cost of living adjustments for Federal retirees or require Federal employees to pay a higher percentage of the overall contribution to their health benefit package. I hope that ends up being in the agreement. We are working toward that end.  Over the last 20 years the Federal work force, Mr. Speaker, has lost an estimated $220 billion in pay and benefits to which it was entitled under law existing in 1980.                              {time}  1830  Let me repeat that for those who are listening. We have a budget deficit. The Federal work force has contributed mightily to solving that deficit by facing changes in law affecting their pay and benefits to the extent that they have received in pay and benefits $220 billion less over the last 17 years than they would have if the law had not been changed.  We must remain vigilant to ensure that we do not single out our Federal employees for cuts to pay and benefits. We must not balance the budget on the backs of hard-working Americans, hard-working Americans who work for the Federal Government.  Mr. Speaker, all too often some paint a picture of our public servants as incompetent, uncaring paper pushers. At times we even vilify our hard-working Government employees, sometimes with tragic results.  Mr. Speaker, last month we paid tribute to the men and women who lost their lives in the tragic Oklahoma City bombing. The majority of these people, the overwhelming majority were hard-working Federal employees. They were not nameless, faceless, presumably defenseless bureaucrats, as some would say.  Let me be perfectly clear and to the point. I get angry, and I hope many Members in this House do, over those who would denigrate our civil servants. All too often it is the prevailing habit of this body to attack the character and devotion of our Federal employees, even our own.  Mr. Speaker, we must stop the senseless scapegoating and needless bashing of our civil servants. Federal employees play an integral, albeit often invisible, role in our daily lives. Federal employees make sure that our senior citizens get their monthly Social Security checks and that our veterans get the care and treatment they need. Federal employees are responsible for printing our money and even insuring it when it makes deposits at the bank.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this time to stand and say that we appreciate the efforts of those who work for our Federal Government, including most specifically those who work for this House of Representatives.                          ____________________
