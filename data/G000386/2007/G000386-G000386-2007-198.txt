  Without a doubt, we have an illegal immigration problem. People are crossing our borders each day to live and work in the United States. Some individuals may have innocent motives, some may not. Some may be living in the shadows and wish to do our country harm.  We do not live in a pre-9/11 world anymore. We must do all we can to protect our country. That is why I am proposing this amendment. It would do two things very appropriate in the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill. It would require the entire Department of Homeland Security to use the basic pilot program--also known as the electronic employment verification system.  The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful for employers to knowingly hire and employ aliens not eligible to work. It required employers to check the identity and work eligibility documents of all employees.  The easy availability of counterfeit documents has made a mockery of the 1986 bill. Fake documents are produced by the millions and can be obtained very cheaply.  In response to the illegal hiring of immigrants, Congress created the basic pilot program in 1996. This program allows employers to check the status of their workers by checking one's Social Security number and alien identification number against Social Security Administration and Homeland Security databases.  The immigration bill before the Senate last year and this year would have required all employers to use the basic pilot program over a period of time byphasing it in. Both the administration and Congress were poised to pass legislation mandating participation in this program. It has been argued that the employment verification system is crucial to enforcing the laws already on the books. Many say the system is a needed tool for employers to check the eligibility of their workers.  Since 1996, the system has been updated, the system has been improved. It is a Web-based program, and employers can go online quickly and very easily when hiring an individual. Employers in all 50 States can use the program, and it is voluntary for the private sector. Currently, over 18,000 employers use the basic pilot program.  Under current law, however, the Federal Government is supposed to be using the employment verification system--emphasis upon ``current law'' and ``supposed to be using.'' We are talking about the Federal Government as an employer and whether we are setting a good example for the private sector on checking whether people are legally in this country if they are going to work for us. Of the 18,000 users I have mentioned, Homeland Security says 403 Federal agencies are using this pilot program. But my colleagues will be shocked to hear that very few of the 22 agencies at the Department--the Department of Homeland Security--are actually participating in this program.  I asked Secretary Chertoff in January of this very year about requiring all agencies to use this system and extending the requirement to contractors who do business with the Federal Government.  The Department of Homeland Security responded by saying these 403 Federal agencies are participating in the basic pilot program. The Department said it was also on track to make sure all agencies were using this system by the end of the fiscal year.  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record my letter to the Secretary and the Department's response.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2007.     Hon. Michael Chertoff,     Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Chertoff: Thank you for your time on Monday      to discuss the worksite enforcement actions against Swift &      Company. I appreciate the time you took to hear our concerns,      and discuss solutions to improve our efforts to reduce      identity theft by illegal aliens.       As I stated in our meeting, our government agencies must do      a better job of communicating with each other. That is why I      authored an amendment last year to the immigration bill that      would give your department access to taxpayer information      maintained by the Social Security Administration. I look      forward to pushing this measure into law.       Additionally, I want to reiterate my concerns about the      need for federal government agencies to use the basic pilot      program. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant      Responsibility Act of 1996 included a provision requiring      select entities to participate in the program. The law states      that ``Each Department of the Federal Government shall elect      to participate in a pilot program and shall comply with the      terms and conditions of such an election.'' I would like to      know how this law is being enforced, and how your department      is working to ensure compliance by all federal agencies.       Furthermore, I would like the Department's legal opinion      about the ability to require contractors and subcontractors      of the federal government to use the basic pilot program.      Last July, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)      arrested nearly 60 illegal immigrants at Fort Bragg in North      Carolina. Last week, ICE arrested nearly 40 illegal      immigrants hired by contractors working on three military      bases (Fort Benning, Creech Air Force Base, and Quantico      Marine Base), one of which was reportedly a member of the      dangerous MS-13 gang. There are many similar stories of      illegal aliens being hired by contractors who work at      critical infrastructure sites throughout the United States.      Requiring those who do business with the federal government      should be held to the same standard as our executive      department agencies. I encourage you to take steps to ensure      that contractors are using the tools that we have provided,      and are participating in the department's electronic      employment verification system.       I appreciate your time and consideration of these views. I      look forward to hearing from you.           Sincerely,                                               Charles E. Grassley     U.S. Senator.                                  ____         Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, U.S.            Department of Homeland Security,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: On behalf of Secretary Chertoff,      thank you for your letter regarding federal agencies and      government contractors using the Basic Pilot Employment      Verification Program (Basic Pilot).       Currently, there are 403 federal agencies that are      participating in the Basic Pilot. The majority of the federal      Basic Pilot participants are member offices of the      legislative branch, although there are several key executive      branch participants, such as the U.S. Citizenship and      Immigration Services headquarters office and components of      the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration      Services, which oversees the Basic Pilot, is exploring      several approaches this fiscal year to use Basic Pilot to      verify all executive branch new hires. Also under      consideration is whether the Office of Personnel Management      (OPM) could conduct the verifications through the Basic Pilot      on behalf of all executive branch new hires or whether each      agency should individually conduct the verifications for its      own new hires. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)      would be pleased to keep your staff apprised of the status of      this planning effort. DHS's goal is to ensure that all      executive branch new hires are verified through the Basic      Pilot by the end of FY 2007.       With respect to whether or not departmental contractors use      the Basic Pilot program, DHS is exploring options to      encourage contractor participation in the program.       I appreciate your interest in the Department of Homeland      Security, and I look forward to working with you on future      homeland security issues. If I may be of further assistance,      please contact the Office of Legislative and      Intergovernmental Affairs at (202) 447-5890.           Sincerely,                                              Donald H. Kent, Jr.,                                              Assistant Secretary.
