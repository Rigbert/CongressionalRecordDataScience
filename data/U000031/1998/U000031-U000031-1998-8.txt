DeLay) whose district will receive $31.5 million more under this program.  Mr. DeLAY. Madam Chairman, I appreciate the money. I am rising in support of this common sense legislation and urge my colleagues to vote for it.  Today we have a simple choice. We can give more money to teachers and classrooms to help students learn, or we can give more money to the Washington bureaucracy.  So if my colleagues are in favor of improving education in this Nation, they will vote for this piece of legislation. If my colleagues are in favor of expanding the Washington bureaucracy, they will vote against this legislation.  The American people believe that education is best handled at the local level, not in Washington. This legislation gives our teachers and school boards help without giving them unfunded mandates.  Make no mistake about it. This legislation is a winner for our Nation's schools. Under this bill, no school districts would lose money. This bill signals and shows how Federal education dollars can be delivered to our Nation's schools. It will send more dollars directly to the classroom while giving States and local educators more funding options.  School districts could choose to put greater amounts of Federal money into priorities such as school technology, teacher improvement, and school reform.  Madam Chairman, I ask my colleagues to vote for this legislation and vote to really improve education in this country.
