The deficit then was a lot smaller, the national debt was a lot smaller. The amount of interest that we paid on that debt was about $50 billion.  Today, 15 years later, 16 years later, we are now 15 years away, our generation, from the big retirement age, with all the entitlement kick-ins and all of that, and we are not spending $50 billion on interest, we are spending $250 billion on interest, and the debt, not being $1 trillion or so, is now actually over $5 trillion, and in 2 years, we will be spending more just on the interest, servicing that $5.5 trillion national debt, than all of defense, foreign aid, Congress and the Intelligence budgets put together.  We have got to make some tough choices. It is not easy to say no to some of these different groups that are coming in. The easy vote is always yes. Somehow in this Chamber, working with the administration downtown, because we do not have the votes, let us face it, to override a veto, we have got to work together and bridge the gap to get the job done.  I have a 4-year-old and I have an 8-year-old, and a newborn child today is going to pay, their share of what we owe is $185,000 in taxes just to pay the interest on the national debt. Somehow I think that it should be incumbent on everyone in this Chamber, as we think about our kids and their kids and this country, to work together in a bipartisan fashion to do a number of things.  First of all we have got to come up with a balanced budget. Why did our side pick 7 years? Because the markets, those folks running the markets say if it is not 6, 7, or 8 years, it is not going to be credible; you put it off in the future and no one will believe it.  We need declining deficits each and every year. None of this stuff where you have a straight line deficit, and then the last 2 years it falls off to zero. They have to be real, and they have to come down in benchmark fashion each and every year.  The other thing, we said this on our side and so has the President and the Democrats, is we have got to have an honest scoring mechanism, the Congressional Budget Office.  I want to share a story. Back in 1990, when President Bush was in office, you probably went down there, as well as I did. In fact on the budget agreement in 1990, President Bush, I spent a lot of time with him. I worked with him. I worked with President Reagan, as I said earlier, for a number of years. His office was around the corner when he was Vice President, and my office, I was in charge of congressional affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.                              {time}  1715  President Bush called me down to his office and put his hands on my shoulders. He said: Fred, you can vote for this. You are going to get reelected. I have been to your district. I know you. You are going to win your race, and I need your vote for this. This is so important. We have the gulf war coming up, and we need to get this off the table and get this country on a sound fiscal basis.  And I said: Mr. President, I cannot vote for this because I did not run for office, and I do not feel in my heart that I can vote to increase spending and increase taxes, and that is what your budget does.  And as I look back at those numbers, back then, in 1990, in my notes, his statisticians told him if his budget passed, and it did, we would have a surplus in 1995 of $63 billion. Well, they are off only by $250 billion.
