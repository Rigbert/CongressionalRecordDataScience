I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Arizona who had indicated earlier that he fit us in because of conflicting schedules that the Senator from California and I have. Before I even begin, I want to again thank the distinguished Senators from Arizona and California for all they have done on this issue.  This past Sunday, as we all know, marked the start of National Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year to refocus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims. One would almost think we would not have to do that, but as a matter of fact, too often, the needs of victims are not met, and their rights are not fully honored. I learned this during my time as a prosecutor. I think all of us have learned this, from the experiences and some terribly gripping stories that we have heard from our constituents.  This year, the Senate had been scheduled to mark the occasion of National Crime Victims' Rights Week by taking up S.J. Res. 1, a proposed constitutional amendment. It was going to end up being days, maybe weeks, of debate even though everyone knew that the constitutional amendment was not going to pass. We went through this process back in April of the year 2000, during the last Presidential election year.  I said then, during that earlier debate on the constitutional amendment, that I have worked long and hard to protect and advance crime victims' rights, as have many on both sides of the aisle in this body. As a prosecutor for 8\1/2\ years, I worked day to day, year to year alongside victims, seeking justice on their behalf. This was back at a time before people spoke much about victims having rights. I like to think that my office was a model in this regard, for making sure that victims were heard.  I have worked on and have led many legislative efforts on behalf of victims throughout my service in the Senate. One of the most recent of those efforts was the creation of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. I am grateful to have been able to take part in something that has brought some relief to so many victims.  But I will never forget the victims I worked with as a prosecutor or the needs of the new victims minted each day through the crimes committed against them.  For years, at Christmas time, I received a very poignant letter from a woman who was the victim of a very serious crime. She told me how she was doing, how her children were doing.  When I go to the grocery store in Vermont, or I'm walking down the street, I run into people who were helped during those years and who had a voice during those years. It is gratifying, but I have to think about the fact that every single day, there are a whole lot more crimes, and a whole lot more victims.  I have always believed that victims should be afforded certain basic protections. I believe victims should be notified when the defendant is in court or when he is about to be released. I believe victims should be heard at critical stages of the prosecution. I believe victims are entitled to restitution from offenders.  In recent years, the debate has never been about whether victims should be protected. Of course they should. Rather, the debate has been about how victims should be protected.  I did not think the proposed constitutional amendment was the best way forward. I still believe that. We all agree, and every witness who testified before the Judiciary Committee on this issue agreed, that every right provided by the victims' rights amendment can be, or already is, protected by State or Federal statutory law.  So we have long had the power to enhance victims' rights through regular legislation, passed with a simple majority vote, and make an immediate difference in the lives of crime victims. Legislative enhancements are more easily enacted, more directly applied and implemented, and more able to provide specific, effective remedies. In addition, as Chief Justice Rehnquist and others have pointed out, statutes are more easily corrected if we find, in hindsight, that they need correction, clarification, or improvement.  When we pass the Kyl-Feinstein-Hatch-Leahy Victims' Rights Act, we will take a step that I have long advocated. So I thank and commend the principal sponsors of S.J. Res. 1, the distinguished Senators from California and Arizona. We came from both sides on the constitutional debate, but all of us are deeply committed to the cause of victims' rights, and that is why we came together on this legislation.  This legislation will provide crime victims in the Federal system with all the rights and protections that the proposed constitutional amendment would have provided. In fact, our statute goes further than the constitutional amendment because it gives the same rights and protections to all crime victims, not just to the victims of violent crimes. The elderly woman who is defrauded out of her life savings will get the same protection from this statute as other crime victims.  This statute, S. 2329, also spells out how victims' rights are to be enforced, using language that Senator Kennedy and I developed in S. 805, the Crime Victims Assistance Act. In addition to providing victims with standing to assert their rights in mandamus actions, S. 2329 will establish an administrative authority in the Department of Justice to receive and investigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate action on the part of criminal justice and victims' service providers. Department of Justice employees who fail to comply with the law pertaining to the treatment of crime victims could face disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination of employment.  We have incorporated other proposals from S. 805 as well, to help States implement and enforce their own victims' rights laws. And we have called for two annual reports, one by the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the other by the General Accounting Office, to make sure we get some feedback on how the rights and procedures established by the statute are working in practice. Over time, we will be able to modify and fine-tune the statute so that it provides an appropriate degree of protection for the rights of crime victims.  I have no doubt we are going to pass this law today. I believe the other body will pass the law, and the President will sign it. Then part of our duty is going to have to be to follow up to see how it works.  I said to some of the representatives of victims' groups this morning, keep our feet to the fire. Make sure we follow up. Passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its implementation by Congress. If, as I hope, federal judges and prosecutors take victims' rights seriously, there should be little need for victims to bring mandamus actions to enforce their rights. But if, for whatever reason, victims feel that they are not being treated fairly, we may see a wave of new litigation in the federal courts, with victims and their lawyers having to insert themselves into criminal cases. We will need to monitor the situation closely.  I am committed to giving victims real and enforceable rights. But I am convinced that prosecutors should be capable of protecting those rights, once we make them clear. In my experience, prosecutors have victims' interests at heart.  Senator Kennedy and I proposed in the Crime Victims Assistance Act a limited-standing provision, which applied with respect to the victim's right to attend and observe the trial, and under which a victim could assert her right if the prosecutor refused to do so. Passing such a provision would have allowed us to observe over a period of time whether direct participation of victims in criminal proceedings has any unanticipated consequences for the administration of justice.  This Victims' Rights Act proposes a bolder experiment, entitling victims to assert a panoply of rights, regardless of whether the prosecution is already asserting the same rights on their behalf. For example, at the insistence of other sponsors, this bill will enable victims to bring mandamus actions alleging the denial of their statutory right ``to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy,'' which may be difficult claims to adjudicate.  I note with some regret that S. 2329 picks up language from S.J. Res. 1 denying victims any cause of action for damages in the event that their rights are violated. Allowing victims to vindicate their rights through separate proceedings for damages instead of through mandamus actions in the criminal case could well be a more efficient as well as a more effective way of ensuring that victims' rights are honored. Certainly the prospect of being held to account in such proceedings would provide a powerful incentive to take victims' rights seriously. But theRepublican sponsors of the bill did not want to provide for damages.  Similarly, some Republican Senators did not want to allow courts to appoint attorneys to help crime victims. It is my hope and belief that victims will seldom need representation, since they already have powerful advocates in our public prosecutors. Still, it is possible that a judge would want to appoint an attorney for a victim in an extraordinary case, as for example if there is a material conflict between the victim's interests and the interests of the prosecution. By failing to provide for this possibility, S. 2329 may perpetuate a system of unequal justice for victims, where the wealthy have the benefit of counsel, and the poor do not.  There are other provisions that were also, regrettably, left on the cutting-room floor during negotiations on this bill. First, we dropped a provision that was in the proposed constitutional amendment, which would have given victims certain rights in the context of clemency proceedings. I know Attorney General Ashcroft, when he was a Member of the Senate, felt strongly that victims should have a voice in these proceedings. I would welcome the chance to work with him, to have him provide for that within the Federal system, to do in the Federal system what he wanted to do while a member of this body.  A second provision that I would have liked to include in the bill would have authorized funding for a broad range of compliance authorities to help enforce the rights of crime victims in the state systems. Senator Kennedy and I proposed such a program in the Crime Victims Assistance Act, but I was unable to persuade my colleagues to include it in this bill.  There are a variety of remedies for violations of rights that are operating at the State level, all of which have strengths and weaknesses. Some States use more than one approach. Arizona has a non-statutory ombudsman staff position in the Attorney General's office, to receive and investigate victim complaints; a victims' legal assistance project run by a non-profit and the Arizona State University College of Law, and a system of auditing those who receive grants to implement victims' rights. Wisconsin uses a State employee to receive and attempt to resolve victim complaints, as well as a victims' rights board that can formally receive complaints and seek sanctions for violations. Alaska has a State Office of Victims' Rights. South Carolina has an independent victim ombudsman. Connecticut has a State Victim Advocate. Vermont is exploring various options. We do have a Center for Crime Victims Services, which advocates informally for victims and is one of the premier victims' services sites in the country.  Finally, I want to comment on the unusual genesis of this bill, and the extraordinary procedure that has brought us so swiftly to a vote in the Senate. As I mentioned earlier, the Senate was scheduled to begin work this week on the proposed constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 1. On Wednesday, the Republican leadership moved to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. I would not have opposed this motion. I voted to proceed to an earlier iteration of this constitutional amendment four years ago, and I would have been prepared to proceed to it again this week. Even given the time this would have taken and the expected outcome, I would not have opposed a debate on the constitutional amendment.  It was under these circumstances that we had so little opportunity to work on crafting the crime victims' statute. I would have liked to have gotten the views of the Office for Victims of Crime and other components of the Department of Justice, for example. Many victims' groups and domestic violence organizations opposed the constitutional amendment, as did many law professors, judges, and prosecutors. I would have liked to hear their views on this statute. I am personally concerned that the statute may not adequately address the special problems raised in domestic violence and abuse situations. If it does not, then we may need to amend it again.  Given the Republican leadership's insistence on proceeding to the constitutional amendment today, there was not as much time as I would have liked to develop the statutory alternative that we vote on today, and no time to hold hearings on it or improve the bill in Committee. Fortunately, however, this is to be a statute, not a constitutional amendment, and it can be modified and improved. We will be able to make it better as we go along.  I commend my good friend, Senator Feinstein, for mediating this consensus legislation. I know that she would have preferred to pass a constitutional amendment. She has made that clear. Nevertheless, she worked hard to produce a bill that we all can support, showing once again that she is first and foremost a legislator who wants to get things done. Due in large part to Senator Feinstein's efforts, we now have an opportunity to advance the cause of victims' rights with strong, practical, bipartisan legislation. I have never doubted Senator Feinstein or Senator Kyl's commitment to victims' rights. I am delighted that we have come together to advance that common cause.  My friend and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, is another lead sponsor of this legislation. He and I have worked together on the Judiciary Committee in this area. He has been a tireless advocate for the rights of crime victims, and more generally for fairness in the administration of justice.  I want to thank David Hantman and Steve Cash of Senator Feinstein's staff; Bruce Artim and Grace Becker of Senator Hatch's staff; Steven Higgins of Senator Kyl's staff; Robin Toone of Senator Kennedy's staff; Bob Schiff and Alex Busansky of Senator Feingold's staff; Neil MacBride and Louisa Terrell of Senator Biden's staff; Chris Kang of Senator Durbin's staff; Mark Childress and Jennifer Duck of Senator Daschle's staff; and, most especially the members of my own staff for their hard work on this bill over the last several days under extraordinary circumstances and pressures.  I also want to commend and thank the many victims' advocates and service providers in Vermont and across the country who show their dedication every day of the year to crime victims. I want to thank those who work in the area of domestic violence and abuse in particular. I am thankful for their dedication and grateful for their advice and insights over the years.  For more than 20 years I have sponsored and championed legislation to help victims. I have mentioned the recent September 11 Victim Compensation Fund, and I am also proud of such other advancements on behalf of victims as a law to provide assistance to victims of international terrorism, and bills to raise the cap on victims' assistance and compensation programs and to protect the rights of the victims of the Oklahoma City bombing. Today's vote provides us the opportunity to make progress on yet another important measure to address the needs of victims.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Center for Victims of Crime stating strong support for S. 2329 be printed in the Record as well as, for the sake of completeness, a number of editorials that appeared on this subject recently.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           The National Center for                                             Victims of Crime,                                                   April 21, 2004.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The National Center for Victims of      Crime strongly supports the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper,      Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims'      Rights Act. This landmark piece of legislation would provide      clear and enforceable legal rights to all direct victims of      crime at the federal level. We are pleased to see a long      overdue recognition that victims of all crime, violent and      nonviolent crime alike, deserve these important rights.       This bill also sets a new standard for federal victims'      rights compliance, giving victims and prosecutors the legal      standing to assert victims' rights; clearly authorizing      victims and the government to seek writs of mandamus to      enforce victims' rights; and calling on the Attorney General      to develop regulations to promote victims' rights through      training, disciplinary sanctions for violations of rights,      and the creation of an office to receive and investigate      complaints.       By making new funding available to jurisdictions with laws      substantially equivalent to those established in this bill,      this bill legislation will promote a strengthening of      victims' rights across the country. By providing funding to      promote victim notification and compliance with victims'      rights at the state     level, this bill will improve the implementation of victims'      rights nationwide. We urge Congress to go further--to broaden      this funding to support other mechanisms to promote      compliance, such as state-level victim advocates and other      authorities to receive and investigate the complaints of      victims, and not limit funding for enforcement to one method.       This legislation represents a real Congressional commitment      to improve our nation's response to victims of crime. The      National Center for Victims of Crime commends you for your      hard work and dedication to this issue, and we urge your      colleagues to join you in this effort.           Sincerely,     Susan Herman.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 19, 2004]                             Amendmentitis                             (By Bob Barr)       The circus is back in town. Every 2 years, as we roll      around to another grand Olympics of federal, state and local      elections, the hopper in Congress begins to fill up with      dangerous and unnecessary amendments to our U.S.      Constitution.       Few, if any, are for ``great or extraordinary occasions,''      the bar James Madison set for changing our Founding document.      In fact, most are either one or two things: a cheap ploy to      get votes or an attempt to streamroll through right- or left-     wings social policies--think gun control or marriage--that      have been unable to get any traction through normal channels      of government.       Just this session alone, Congress has seen or will see      votes on the Flag Desecration Amendment, the Victims Rights      Amendment, the Federal Marriage Amendment, even the      Continuity in Government Amendment. Frankly, I would like to      see one last constitutional amendment--the No More Amendments      Amendment.       In the American political system, the Constitution was      meant to operate like people who freeze their credit cards in      a block of ice. That is, when faced with supremely important      and emotional decisions involving things like the censorship      of unpopular ideas or the seizure of firearms, the      Constitution makes us walk to the corner and take a time out.       Specifically, we have to get a two-thirds supermajority in      both chambers of Congress and then tree-quarters of the      States to agree. It is an amazingly onerous process.       The last amendment to the Constitution--the 27th--which set      limits on congressional pay, was initially proposed in the      States' petitions to the first Constitutional Congress in the      1780s but only started to move in the 1990s. It took more      than two centuries to finally earn a spot alongisde free      speech and the right not to self-incriminate.       During the Cold War, Americans of conscience like to brag      we were a Nation of laws, not men. That is, the main      difference between American representative democracy and      Soviet tyranny was that the latter's government did not have      to abide by a piece of yellowing parchment with some petty      clear instructions on what it could or could not do to its      citizens.       And, while we have failed to meet those lofty goals on a      number of important occasions, for the post part, we have      managed to pedal through without too many monumental      abridgements of personal liberty. That is why we are still      here and they went long ago to a nursing home for evil ideas.       However, we risk betraying that proud history in the      political imperative to fiddle with the Constitution. Take,      for instance, the Victims Rights Amendment. Pushed by a a      mixture of Democrats and Republicans feeling the need to      burnish their tough-on-crime badges, the VRA would be a      disaster for basic principles of fairness and dispassion in      our criminal justice system.       It would guarantee victims of crime--a loosely defined term      in the legislation--the ``right'' to notice, to be present      and to speak at an array of judicial proceedings, including      those dealing with bail, trial, sentencing and parole. It      also requires the court to take victims into account in      deciding whether to release prisoners or when to schedule a      trial.       As with many of these amendments, on its face the measure      hits all the right notes. It is tough on crime and soft on      victims. It is bipartisan--as a lawmaker, if you oppose      it, the other side will accuse you of being ``anti-     victim,'' whatever that means. It cost no federal tax      dollars (at least, not directly); states have to foot the      bill. Finally, it makes for a feel-good, ``I supported      such and such'' speech on the campaign trail.       But, as with many of these other amendments, it is      seriously flawed. Foremost among its problems is that it      will, ironically, obstruct justice. In 2000, Beth Wilkinson,      the lead federal prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing      case, explained in testimony against the amendment that, had      it been in force, she might not have successfully sent      Timothy McVeigh to death row and Terry Nichols to jail for      life.       Their convictions hinged on the testimony of one Michael      Fortier, who plea bargained to 12 years in federal prison,      for knowing about the impending bombing but not informing      authorities, in exchange for taking the witness stand. Had      the relatives of the 168 people killed in that horrible      tragedy been able to address the courtroom in opposition to      Fortier's plea, it could have sunk the whole case.       In addition to these practical concerns, the VRA also      threatens basic due process protections and objectivity in      the criminal justice system by making it more about vengeance      than justice. We trust our adversarial process--which pits      zealous advocates against one another in front of a judge and      jury--to arrive at the best approximation of the truth in      criminal prosecution, which helps ensure the guilty are      punished and the innocent go free.       However, when one injects the emotion of a murder victim's      family into a bail or a parole hearing, that adversarial      system is thrown directly out of whack. The defense counsel      then faces an onslaught of vindictiveness that cannot be      countered by facts or logic. Justice must remain blindfold to      be effective. Otherwise, we will have vigilante posses      waiting outside with lit torches and nooses tied every time      something really senational goes to trail.       Finally, in an ironic twist that really hammers home the      folly of such constitutional amendments, the vast majority of      states--and the federal government--already have laws on the      books protecting victims and ensuring their interests are not      forgotten as their cases progress through the system.       The bottom line with the Victims Rights Amendment and its      ilk is that the Constitution should not be co-opted as the      tag line for a political attack ad. It is arguable the most      sacred secular document in the history of the world, as it      has kept humanity's strongest democracy healthy long enough      to also make it humanity's oldest democracy.                                  ____        [From the Chicago Tribune Online Edition, Apr. 18, 2004]                  A Phony Proposal for Victims' Rights   There is no need to tinker with the Constitution to Guarantee the  rights of victims--our entire judicial system is already set up to do                                just that                           (By Steve Chapman)       Americans cherish and revere the Constitution. But often      their attitude brings to mind the Broadway show: ``I Love      You, You're Perfect, Now Change.'' It seems that the only      thing many of them like more than the Constitution is the      opportunity to fix its grievous flaws. The latest suggestion      for improvement stems from a belief that it shortchanges the      needs of crime victims.       The entire criminal justice system, of course, could be      seen as a giant apparatus set up to vindicate the interests      of crime victims. Every year in the United States, we arrest      more than 13 million suspects and keep more than 1.4 million      offenders in prison. All those police, prosecutors, judges,      parole officers and prison guards are there mainly to detect,      investigate, prosecute and punish criminals for what they do      to their victims.       But critics say the system often abuses the people it's      supposed to protect. And they insist that the only way to      assure fairness to victims is to enshrine their rights in the      Constitution. President Bush has endorsed the amendment. Sen.      John Kerry has not.       Americans often have a tendency to see a problem and      conclude, ``There oughta be a law.'' In this instance,      though, there is already a multitude of laws. Every state has      passed legislation to protect victims' rights, and at least      33 have such provisions in their state constitutions.       But Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), co-sponsor of the amendment,      says these efforts have been a bust. He says one study found      that even in states with strong measures in place, 44 percent      of victims weren't alerted to the sentencing hearing, and      nearly half weren't notified of plea negotiations.       Why don't existing laws do the job? Because, according to      Kyl, ``criminal defendants have a plethora of rights that are      protected by the Constitution that are applied to exclude      victims rights.''       The only way to correct the imbalance is to give victims'      rights equal status.       But where are the constitutional provisions that work      against victims?       Defendants do have a right to a speedy public trial by      jury, to be represented by a lawyer, to avoid self-     incrimination and so on. But nothing in the Constitution      prevents authorities from informing victims of proceedings,      from letting them speak during trials, sentencing and parole      hearings, from altering them when an assailant is about to be      released, or from requiring criminals to pay restitution.      Those are the victims' rights specified in the constitutional      amendment, all of which can be (and often are) safeguarded      without the drastic step of altering the nation's charter.       Supporters complain that some courts have been so eager to      assure the defendant a fair trial that they bar victims from      the courtroom. But that happens only before a victim is      scheduled to testify, and it's simply meant to prevent      victims from tailoring their testimony (intentionally or not)      to match what other witnesses say.       By protecting the truth-seeking function of a trial, the      practice works to the benefit of victims--who, after all,      gain absolutely nothing from sending the wrong person to      jail.       If we want to abolish this custom, despite its virtues, we      don't need an amendment. Duke University law professor Robert      Mosteller says many states allow victims to     be present throughout a trial even if they are going to      testify. The practice of excluding victims until they      testify, Mosteller notes, ``is generally a matter of      statutory or common law'' and ``rarely even approaches      constitutional significance.'' It was an issue in Timothy      McVeigh's Oklahoma City bombing trial--but in the end, all      victims were allowed to attend even if they were expected to      appear as witnesses.       Victims' rights, it's true, have not always been enforced.      But that's partly because they're a new concept and take time      to be fully implemented. And it's partly because they are      administered by large, fallible government bureaucracies      trying to keep track of a lot of people and information,      sometimes without adequate funds.       Amending the Constitution won't make the bureaucracies less      fallible. The obvious way to do that is to make them pay for      their mistakes by letting victims collect damages when their      rights are ignored. But this proposal explicitly forbids that      remedy. It's all bark and no bite.       Unless, of course, the opponents hope to curtail the      protections we grant to those accused of crimes. The      supporters deny that, but they also decline to include a      section stating that the amendment wouldn't diminish any      existing guarantees.       So maybe the amendment would be an attack on longstanding      constitutional rights, or maybe it would be an ineffectual      piece of symbolism. Either way, we're better off without it.                                  ____              [From the Washington Times, April 20, 2004]                        We, the Clutterers . . .            (By Bruce Fein, special to the Washington Times)       The Senate should balk at cluttering the Constitution when      it votes next Friday on a crime victims' rights amendment      [VRA].       To forgo the VRA is not to cherish victims' rights less,      but to venerate the brevity and accessibility of the      Constitution more. Amendments are appropriate only when      flexible and adaptable statutes would be insufficient to      achieve a compelling objective; or, to protect discrete and      insular minorities from political oppression. Neither reason      obtains for the VRA.       Crime victims deserve and evoke legal sympathy. Every state      and the District of Columbia feature statutes that endow      victims with participatory rights in the criminal justice      system. Further, 33 states have amended their state      constitutions by overwhelming majorities to protect crime      victims.       Congress has enacted a cornucopia of victim-friendly      statutes since 1982, including a right to restitution, victim      impact statements, and a victims' Bill of Rights. According      to the latter, federal law enforcement agencies must treat      putative victims with fairness and respect; protect them from      accused offenders; provide them notice of court proceedings;      offer opportunities to attend public sessions under certain      conditions and to confer with government prosecutors; and      transmit information about the conviction, sentencing,      imprisonment, and release of the offender.       A crime victim's authenticity remains in doubt, it should      be remembered, unless and until the accused is convicted.       As I previously testified before the Senate Judiciary      Committee: ``Crime victims have no difficulty in making their      voices heard in the corridors of power; they do not need      protection from the majoritarian political process, in      contrast with criminal defendants whose popularity      characteristically ranks with that of Gen. William Tecumseh      Sherman in Atlanta, Ga.'' A recent vignette from Lake County,      Mich., corroborates the political hazards of slighting crime      victims. In September 2003, a county prosecutor was recalled      by voters angry over a lenient plea bargain that had outraged      the family of a murder victim: a 23- to 50-year sentence for      the killer. The prosecutor's explanation he was seeking to      avoid costly trials on a penurious $200,000 annual budget      proved unavailing.       VRA proponents insist statutory rights are second-class      rights compared with constitutional rights enjoyed by the      accused. Statutes fortified by strong pubic sentiments,      however, command virtual constitutional sanctity. The 1964      Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the National      Labor Relations Act, and the Sherman Antitrust Act are      illustrative. As to the latter, the Supreme Court in United      States vs. Topco Associates [1972] amplified: ``Antitrust      laws in general, and the Sherman Act in particular, are the      Magna Carta of free enterprise.''       Moreover, the elevation of victims' rights from a statutory      to a constitutional plateau does not guarantee greater      effectiveness. The 14th and 15th Amendment rights of blacks,      for instance, slept for 80 years in the chambers of      prosecutors and judges because of public indifference. In any      event, government officers are every bit as bound by oath to      obey statutes as to comply with the Constitution.       VRA crusaders speciously argue victims' constitutional      rights in criminal prosecutions should reasonably mirror      those of the accused. Unlike a putative victim, a criminal      suspect confronts the loss of life, liberty, or property and      a formidable arsenal of government investigatory and      prosecutorial weapons. The victim, moreover, may seek damages      from the defendant, including restitution, in parallel civil      proceedings a la the O.J. Simpson wrongful death judgments.       History has also demonstrated a government propensity to      persecute by overzealous prosecutions. The Declaration of      Independence denounced King George III, ``For transporting us      beyond the seas to be tried for pretended offenses.''       Former Attorney General and Associate Justice of the      Supreme Court, Robert Jackson, worried that prosecutors are      routinely tempted to pick a man to indict for personal or      ideological reasons, and then to scour the books to pin an      offense on him, in lieu of discovering a crime and then      searching for the culprit. To blunt the potential for      vindictive or wrongful convictions, the Constitution endows      defendants with a modest array of rights, for example, proof      beyond a reasonable doubt, jury unanimity, and the right to      counsel. Crime victims, however, can point to no      corresponding history of government oppression. Indeed, they      are the contemporary darlings of state legislatures and      Congress.       The VRA would also vitiate the truth-finding objective of      trials by injecting victim concerns that could undermine the      impartiality and reliability of verdicts. The amendment would      require judges in jury selection, evidentiary rulings, or      jury instructions to ``consider the victim's safety, interest      in avoiding unreasonable delay, and just and timely      restitution from the offender.'' It would permit victims who      intend to testify to avoid sequestration, a customary      requirement to foil the tailoring of witness stories.      Sequestration has been celebrated by an icon in the law of      evidence, however, as ``one of the greatest engines that the      skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in      a court of justice.''       Thus, the biblical Apocrypha relates how Daniel exonerated      Susanna of adultery by sequestering two accusing elders and      eliciting conflicting answers as to where the alleged crime      occurred.       Much additional mischief besets the VRA, but their telling      must be forgone as a concession to the shortness of life. The      proposed amendment should be smartly defeated.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 21, 2004]                            Wrong on Rights       The Senate is due to take up a constitutional amendment      designed to grant rights in criminal court proceedings to      victims of violent crimes. The last time the proposal arose,      its sponsors, Sens. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) and Dianne Feinstein      (D-Calif.), had to yank it back to avoid defeat. But support      for the idea has grown. Nobody likes to oppose crime victims,      and on its face the amendment's promises seem      unobjectionable: ``reasonable and timely notice'' of      proceedings; the right of victims to attend those proceedings      and to speak at sentencing, clemency and parole hearings; and      the right to seek restitution from perpetrators. What harm      can there be in placing victims' rights even with the rights      of the accused?       Quite a lot, actually. For starters, none of the      amendments' terms are defined--including, critically, who      counts as a ``victim.'' Is it limited to immediate relatives      or can extended family members qualify? Nor does the      amendment specify a remedy for violations of victims' rights.      In fact, it specifically says that it does not ``authorize      any claim for damages.'' So it is unclear how exactly a      victim is supposed to take advantage of his rights. The      result will be litigation--a lot of it--as victims seek to      exercise their new constitutional rights and defendants seek      to ensure that victims' rights don't come at the expense of      their own.       The fundamental trouble is that victims' rights, if taken      seriously, will come at the expense of the rights of the      accused. Sometimes a defendant's right to a fair trial cannot      be reconciled with a victim's right to speak to the jury.      Right now, the victims' rights yield in such cases, as they      should. The state, after all, is not seeking to deprive the      victim of liberty or, in the extreme case, life. The rights      of the accused flow out of the jeopardy in which the state      puts them.       Though the criminal justice system's treatment of victims      has improved, it could and should be better. But it would be      a profound error to place such obligations on the same plane      as the Constitution's essential protections against unchecked      government power.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. As a former county prosecuting attorney, this is an issue about which I feel very strongly. All too often, our criminal justice system overlooks the victims of crime in efforts to ensure the legitimate rights of accused defendants.  Crime victims simply have not been given the equal footing that they deserve. From start to finish, the legal system sometimes can be a terrible ordeal for victims--a bureaucratic nightmare that seems to and in fact many times does go on and on and on.  We substantially protect the rights of defendants, as well we should. We ensure that they have every reasonable benefit--and that is good--so as to ensure the acquittal of the innocent. But, in the process, I believe that many times, we don't give the victims of crime the rights that they, too, deserve. When I was a county prosecutor in Greene County, OH in the 1970s I saw too many crime victims--people whohad already been hurt--hurt a second time by a callous legal system. That is why I did everything that I could to protect the rights of those victims. Our bottom line has to be this: To be victimized once by crime is already once too often. To be victimized yet again by an uncaring judicial system is totally unacceptable.  Accordingly, I am pleased to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation that will afford these victims, the fundamental right to participate in the criminal justice system. It just makes good sense for the innocent victim of a crime to be given the right to know if his or her assailant is released or escapes from prison. It is simply fairness to recognize a crime victim's right to reasonable notice of public proceedings involving the crime; the right to not be excluded from such public proceedings; and the right to be heard at the public release, plea, sentencing, reprieve, and pardon proceedings involving that victim's assailant. It's about time that we guarantee crime victims their rights to court decisions that duly consider their safety, their rights to have the courts avoid unreasonable delay in adjudicating those charged with harming them, and their rights to just and timely restitution from their offenders. This legislation is about victims. This legislation is about working to keep victims safe from further harm. This legislation is about keeping their concerns at the forefront.  When I was Green County prosecuting attorney, I had seen the victims of murder and other terrible crimes. I interviewed people who had been abused, assaulted, and raped. I learned a lot from talking to these innocent people. I learned that we have to make the crime victim a full participant--not a forgotten person, not a neglected person--in the criminal justice system.  That is why I cosponsored this bipartisan legislation. It is designed to help guarantee that the victims of crime have access to our criminal justice system. It is time to stop treating the victims like they are the criminals. Let's move the legitimate concerns of victims toward center stage in our criminal justice system and finally provide these innocent victims with the rights they deserve.
