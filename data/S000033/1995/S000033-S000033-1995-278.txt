  If I might, we have been joined by the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Fields]. An interesting night because we have somebody from the Midwest, somebody from the south, Mr. Becerra is from California, and I am from Vermont, so I think it should be a good discussion.                              {time}  2300  Mr. Fields, would you like to join us.
