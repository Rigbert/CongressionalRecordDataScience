President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary work of nine fifth graders and their teacher from the Oak Lawn Elementary School in Cranston, Rhode Island. On Friday, June 5, these students became the first civilians in the 223-year history of the U.S. Navy to name a naval ship.  In February, the Navy challenged America's school children to name its newest oceanographic survey vessel. Out of 1,600 submissions, the Navy ultimately chose the name proposed by these young Oak Lawn students: the USNS Bruce C. Heezen.  Bruce C. Heezen was a pioneer in oceanographic research. During his career, Heezen identified the rift at the center of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, discovered ocean turbidity currents and formulated theories about ocean crust formation. He dedicated his life to exploring the world's oceans, providing future oceanographers with an invaluable knowledge base upon which to build. Heezen died in 1977 while aboard the Navy's nuclear research submersible enroute to further study the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  These fifth graders dedicated tremendous time and energy to this project. Not only did they learn about oceanography, but they also shared their new knowledge with their fellow students at Oak Lawn Elementary. Now, with the naming of this new vessel, the USNS Bruce C. Heezen, the work of these outstanding young scholars will enlighten all those who look upon this great ship. I commend Amanda Baillargeon, James Coogan, Meagan Durigan, Stephen Fish, Patricia Gumbley, John Lucier, Sara Piccirilli, Dana Scott, Rebecca Webber. I also want to recognize their teacher, Ms. Marilyn Remick, who has been expanding the minds of students for 28 years.  The USNS Bruce C. Heezen is a fine and fitting name for the Navy's newest oceanographic survey vessel. Rhode Islanders and all Americans should be proud that students like those at Oak Lawn Elementary are keeping Heezen's memory alive to inspire future oceanographers. I hope the fifth graders ofOak Lawn Elementary will inspire others in search for knowledge.                          ____________________
