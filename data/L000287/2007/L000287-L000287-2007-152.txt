Madam Speaker, today, almost last, but certainly not least, Congress takes action on a bill to authorize a major medical facility project that will create modern inpatient wards at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia. This is an investment of $20.5 million to provide a standard of care our Nation guarantees for veterans across America. This is a relatively small bill but it is part of keeping a very big promise. We should always keep that promise.  This project will renovate 3 inpatient floors to meet ADA accessibility requirements. Our handicapped veterans should have bathrooms, showers and toilet facilities they can actually use. This project will also meet needs of a growing group of women veterans. It will provide patient privacy where it has been inadequate. And it will make the staff work more efficiently by simply making the layout of the building better for work. In addition, an enclosed connecting bridge will be built between the Medical Center and VA Regional Office buildings so there will be more fluid access between what goes on at the hospital and what goes on at the benefits administration.  The Atlanta VA Medical Center has an active affiliation with the University of Emory Medical School. This project will keep this relationship on sound footing. Hundreds of medical doctors and students with Emory make contributions at the hospital and see firsthand the result of sacrifices made from generation to generation. Unfortunately, with the number of our boys and girls coming home from war growing as we speak, these physicians are going to be caring for so many more people with so many more health problems.  I want to applaud the efforts of my colleague from Georgia, Senator Johnny Isakson, for working to pass this bill through the Senate. I know on this issue, the issue of caring for our veterans, all of us from Georgia and on a bipartisan basis in the House and Senate can agree that no expense should be spared in order to ensure the best care modem medicine can provide.  We have more work to do on this and so many other issues. It is my hope we can come together on more bills in the coming year, much larger bills, which benefit those who wear the uniform, as well as kids and seniors who need better health care.                          ____________________
