I want everybody to know, this is 7.25 billion new dollars, new spending under this formula. If you vote for this, you are voting to increase the authorized level by $7.25 billion.  If you look at the pending bill, it says: Under the IPAM Program, under section 139 of that title, $2 billion for fiscal year 2004 and nothing thereafter. If you look at the amendment, it says:       $2,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005. . .      .  That is $4 billion, plus:       $1,750,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2006, 2007, and      2008.  You add it up, and that is $9.25 billion, $7.25 billion more than the pending bill. Everyone has to understand that. When you vote for this, you are voting to increase the spending under this bill.
