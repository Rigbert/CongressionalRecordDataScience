President, I rise today to submit legislation along with my colleague, Senator Barack Obama, to establish the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area in Illinois.  Illinois has long been known as the ``Land of Lincoln.'' Reminders of the 16th President's legacy can be found throughout the State.  Last week, Senator Obama and I attended the dedication of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, IL. This wonderful new facility brings together the entire story of President Lincoln's life in a rich, unified experience.  In the same spirit, our legislation would establish an Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area, formally tying together the many Illinois natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources that have been touched by the life and influence of the Nation's greatest President. Establishing a Lincoln National Heritage Area will connect-these scattered elements to provide a more cohesive experience of Lincoln's legacy for Illinoisans and visitors alike.  The impact of the life and works of Illinois's favorite son extends far beyond the prairies of the Midwest.  Not long ago, I sat in the United States House of Representatives and listened as the new president of Ukraine, the leader of his nation's peaceful Orange Revolution, spoke of his countrymen and women's dreams to live under a ``government of the people, for the people.''  Just weeks before that, I was in the Green Zone in Baghdad and heard an official of the new Iraqi Government quote President Lincoln on the need for national unity.  In a sense, the Land of Lincoln is anywhere that people dream of freedom and equality and opportunity for all.  So the whole world would benefit, as the people of Illinois work to preserve Lincoln's history. And we invite the world to come to Illinois and learn not just about the history of this greatman, but also about what he can teach us today.  The Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area will help spread that message for generations to come, to Americans, and to students of Abraham Lincoln everywhere on Earth.  This bill is the Senate companion to legislation introduced by Representative Ray LaHood and endorsed by every member of the Illinois congressional delegation in the House of Representatives, as well as representatives from every part of the country.  Senator Obama and I ask our colleagues to join with us in recognizing the richness of the Lincoln legacy by supporting the passage of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
