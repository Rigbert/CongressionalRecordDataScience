Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I tell my good friend the gentleman from California (Mr. Radanovich) that this amendment is not necessary, nor needed. If we do as the Committee on Appropriations should do, we would, under CARA, fully fund PILT.  Last year, the Committee on Appropriations funded $135 million last year and $10.7 million. Under this program that is not appropriated, we would, in fact, fully fund it with $185 million and $15 million in refuge so it would be fully funded. It would be perfectly funded for the first time.  What has to happen now, the requirement now is through the Committee on Appropriations, who has not fully funded it. I agree with the gentleman, it should be. But under CARA, for the first time, we will have the money to fully fund the program as long as the Committee on Appropriations continues to do their job.
