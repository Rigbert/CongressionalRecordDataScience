President, I thank my colleague from Texas for speaking to a higher level of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate.  I sensed this in returning to Illinois and out on the campaign trail for my colleague, Senator Obama, that this is a sentiment widely shared. The American people understand we have a lot of challenges in this country, and they also understand it is easy to gridlock the Senate.  We had an all-time record number of filibusters initiated by the minority side of the aisle this last year. Sixty-two, I believe, was the final count, which eclipsed the 2-year record of 62 filibusters that had been prevailing. Certainly, we all know how to stop this train in the Senate. Minority rights are well respected by the Senate rules. And 15 minutes into our service in the Senate, you might hear the words ``unanimous consent,'' and realize: Well, I will be darned. If I stand up and object, everything stops. And it is a fact.  Many Senators have used that for valid and invalid reasons, but it has been used a lot. We have one Senator on the other side of the aisle who takes pride in the fact that he has singlehandedly stopped 150 pieces of legislation from even being debated and considered on the Senate floor. Many of them are not even controversial.  I hope we find a way around this. I want to respect every Senator's right, but if we truly want bipartisan cooperation, there are ways to achieve that. Using filibusters would not be that; objecting to bills just categorically would not be that approach either. But the one thing the American people certainly want us to do is to wake up and smell the coffee. And this morning, if you woke up and smelled the coffee, you also smelled something burning on Wall Street. What is burning is the Dow Jones Industrial Average. I do not know what it is at this moment, but it has been pretty awful starting this day, and it has been pretty awful for a long time.  It is interesting in American politics that when I first started running for Congress 25 years ago, the most important information for most voters was how many people were unemployed. And the monthly reports on unemployment really kind of fueled the campaign. If a President had more and more people out of work, there was a downturn in the economy and a downturn in that President's popularity. That was historically the standard. But over time we have stopped talking about the unemployment figures as much and tend to watch the stock market a lot more.  I think it has to do with many of us have our retirement savings tied up in mutual funds and 401(k)s and IRAs. And so what happens is the stock market, at least in the back of our minds, is how I am doing. If the stock market is not doing well, my family is not doing well. So when the news came out yesterday that the bottom is falling out of international markets, and the Dow Jones opens with a tremendous slump of 400 points or more, people understand something is not right.  Last week, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, called me and many leaders in the Senate and all but acknowledged that we need to do something, and do it in a hurry, if we are going to try to stop this economy from sliding into a recession.  Well, I agree with him completely. If you look at what we have done over the past 7 years, to many of us it is no surprise where we are today. There were many on the Republican side who argued for years and years, and still continue to argue, that tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America are the answer to everything.  If you have a surplus, you need a tax cut. If you have a deficit and need to stimulate the economy, you need a tax cut. You always need a tax cut. This kind of moralistic position of cutting taxes for the wealthiest people in America has been the basic doctrine of the Republicans in leadership for a long time.  They have had their way: President Bush's tax cuts, even though they have generated the highest deficits in our history; a greater dependence on foreign countries and foreign capital than ever before; the fact that the President made history, in an unusual way, in calling for more tax cuts in the midst of a war.  All of these things notwithstanding, our economy is slumping. There are a lot of reasons for that. One of the reasons, of course, is we have ignored the obvious. The strength of America is the strength of our families. And 40 percent of the families in America do not get close to the numbers that Republicans consider to be the right level for tax cuts.  Over 40 percent of the people in this Nation struggle in an effort to pay their bills and really live paycheck to paycheck.  It doesn't take much to derail that family train, whether it is the loss of a job or serious illness or some other catastrophe. These people have not been a priority of the Republican leadership in the Senate, the House, or the White House. Now comes the time when the economy is slumping, and all of a sudden this group that had been ignored for so long by Republicans in their tax-cutting priorities is, front and center, the centerpiece for saving the American economy. Welcome to real America, I say to my colleagues. These are the people who have been struggling for a long time and waiting to be rediscovered. They should be rediscovered.  I am troubled to learn--at least some speculation is out there--that this so-called stimulus package is going to be limited so that it still doesn't help those in middle-income status or lower middle-income status, those working families who really do put up a struggle trying to get by. You don't have to spend much time out in the real world to meet them. They are not the legendary welfare kings and queens. These people get up and go to work every morning. They work hard. They don't make a lot of money. They struggle with no health insurance or health insurance that is virtually worthless. They struggle with trying to fill up a gas tank. It may be a beat-up old car, but it is their lifeline to get to work, to make a paycheck, to keep things going. They struggle with heating bills in a harsh and cold winter. They struggle with the dream of a college education for their kids and pray they will have a better life. These are the real-world struggles of real families who have been largely ignored in this economic debate in Washington.  When we get down to a discussion of an economic stimulus package, we ignore these families again at our peril. Any stimulus package that fails to acknowledge their need will fail to stimulate the economy. I don't know what the parameters will be. Targeted, temporary--all of these things make sense. But let's make sure we are doing the right thing for the right people.  Many people go to work every day making a minimum income. They struggle to get by. At the end of the day, they pay their taxes but don't have a Federal income tax liability. How can that be? They are paying their Social Security taxes, they are paying the Medicare requirements, all of the things all workers have to pay. But they don't make enough money because of the size of the family to be liable for Federal income tax.  Who are these people? I can give an example. We estimate that 40 percent of all households may not make enough to qualify for one of the proposed stimulus packages. Families of four making less than $25,000 a year would get nothing. A family of four making $25,000 a year, if it isn't given a refundable tax credit, will receive nothing by way of a stimulus check.  What does a family do if they are making $25,000 a year and receives $1,600, let's say, from the Federal Government? Well, if you are trying to get by on $2,000 a month, $1,600 from the Federal Government may be the answer to your prayers. You may finally be able to turn around and buy something you have put off for a long time. You may be able to catch up on some of your bills. Getting $1,600 when you are making $2,000 a month is a big deal.  Let's look at the other end of the equation. What if you are making $20,000 a month and you get $1,600 more? That is nice. I am sure there is something you can do. Will it change your lifestyle? Will it change the economy? It is not as likely.  That goes back to something I learned a long time ago from a Jesuitpriest who taught economics at Georgetown University called the marginal propensity to save. For every dollar you are given, what is the likelihood you will spend it and the likelihood you will save it? Economists look at that, and they know that if you are in a lower income group, you are less likely to save, more likely to spend, because you are living paycheck to paycheck. If you have a lot of money, you are more likely to save and less likely to spend because you are meeting your needs each paycheck. So when we devise a stimulus package, let's make sure we keep that fundamental rule of economics in mind. Let's make sure struggling families at lower incomes aren't left behind. The fact that they don't pay income tax doesn't mean they are tax free. They do pay taxes for Social Security, for Medicare, other things--sales tax, for example. This is the targeted group when it comes to a real stimulus.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter sent to all Members in leadership on January 18 from John Sweeney. John is president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, the AFL-CIO. John lays out his priorities, the priorities of his organization when it comes to a stimulus package, a short-term stimulus.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial            Organizations,                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 2008.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid: As Congress      considers legislative responses to current and anticipated      weakness in the U.S. economy, the AFL-CIO urges you (1) to      include in a short-term stimulus package measures that will      have the most impact on the economy and get the ``biggest      bang for the buck'': and (2) to address the underlying causes      of current economic weakness.                          Short-Term Stimulus       It is encouraging that President Bush has recognized the      immediate need for an economic stimulus package. Judging from      initial reports, however, it appears that President Bush's      proposals are too heavily weighted towards tax cuts over      much-needed spending, do not address crucial problems facing      working families, and do not target tax benefits to those      families who need them most and will spend them fastest.       In particular, we are concerned that the President's income      tax cut proposal would not be sufficiently stimulative      because it fails to target lower-income and middle-income      households who, as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)      wrote last week, are likely to spend a larger share of any      tax benefit they receive. We are also concerned that the      President's proposal to cut business taxes would not be      sufficiently timely and, because of the linkages between      federal and state tax codes, could trigger economically      depressing budget cuts and tax increases by state      governments.       While we understand that compromise will be necessary to      enact a stimulus package within the next month, we urge you      to insist on legislative measures that will have the greatest      stimulative impact on the economy and would not lead to      economically depressing budget cuts and tax increases at the      state and local level.       (1) Extension of unemployment benefits. The Congressional      Budget Office (CBO) and Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com      rank unemployment benefits at the top of the list of possible      stimulus choices, increasing economic demand by $1.73 to      $2.15 for each dollar spent. We urge you to enact a one-year      federal unemployment compensation program that provides 20      weeks of extended unemployment benefits in all states; 13      additional weeks in ``high unemployment'' states with an      unemployment rate of 6.0% or more; a $50 per week benefit      increase; and additional administrative funding. We also urge      Congress to provide federal financing for states to expand      eligibility to lower-income workers, part-time workers, and      workers who leave their jobs for compelling family reasons.       (2) Increase in food stamp benefits. Many food stamp      recipients are not tax filers and do not receive unemployment      benefits, so they would not benefit from a tax rebate or      unemployment benefit extension. An increase in food stamp      benefits would be one of the most effective forms of economic      stimulus, since it would almost certainly be spent in its      entirety very quickly, boosting demand for goods and services      in the short term.       (3) Tax rebate targeted towards middle-income and lower      income taxpayers. The individual income tax rebates proposed      by President Bush should be retargeted towards middle-income      and lower-income taxpayers, who are most likely to spend the      money and thereby stimulate economic activity, by making them      available to taxpayers who pay payroll taxes but not income      taxes. According to Mark Zandi, a one-time uniform tax rebate      would increase demand by $1.19 for every dollar spent.       (4) Fiscal relief for state and local governments to avoid      the economically depressing effect of tax increases and      budget cuts. State and local governments are experiencing      lower property and sales tax revenues, due to the slumping      housing market and slowing economic activity. Tax collections      are down in 24 states, and at least 20 states are expected to      have budget deficits this year. Since many states have      balanced budget requirements, a decrease in revenues can lead      to budget cuts or tax increases, both of which intensify the      impact of an economic downturn. Congress should provide at      least $30 billion in aid to the states in the form of      revenue-sharing grants and increases in the Medicaid match.      According to Mark Zandi, state fiscal relief would increase      demand by $1.24 for every dollar spent.       (5) Acceleration of ready-to-go construction projects.      Putting Americans to work directly in construction and repair      projects is an obvious response to rising unemployment, and      would directly create additional demand. Unlike tax rebates,      all of this investment would be spent to increase domestic      economic activity, none would be spent on imports, and none      would be saved.       Furthermore, we believe public investment in infrastructure      can be targeted and timely. For example, there is a backlog      of at least $100 billion in needed repairs to U.S. schools.      There are 6,000 bridges that have been declared unsafe, and      many of these projects are ready for work to begin      immediately.       We urge Congress to provide $40 billion for public      investment in infrastructure, including school, bridge, and      sewage treatment repair.         addressing the longer-term causes of economic weakness       We are hopeful that Congress and President Bush can enact a      short-term stimulus within the next month. However, given the      nature of legislative compromise, any stimulus package      enacted within that time frame is likely to be only a down      payment on what is necessary to address this country's      economic problems-even in the short term. Congress may even      need to consider a second stimulus package later in the year.       Congress must also begin focusing today on the most      fundamental underlying causes of our current economic      weakness. While it is appropriate for Congress to focus on      measures that have an immediate economic impact as it crafts      a short-term stimulus package, this is no excuse to put our      heads in the sand and do nothing about the underlying longer-     term problems afflicting our economy.       One of the underlying causes of our current economic      weakness is the stagnation of ordinary Americans' incomes.      This will probably be the first business cycle in which the      typical family will have lower incomes at the end of the      recovery than they did at the beginning of the last      recession. Wage stagnation, which began in the 1970s, has led      to longer working hours, higher consumer debt, and increasing      reliance on home equities. But today home values are      plummeting, home foreclosures are on the rise, consumer debt      is reaching unsustainable levels, and prices for energy,      health care, and education are soaring out of reach for many      working families.       There are various long-term solutions to the underlying      problem of wage stagnation, They include fixing our broken      labor laws so that workers who want to form a union can      bargain with their employers for better wages and benefits;      ensuring affordable health care and retirement security;      fixing our flawed trade policies; and reactivating the      historically successful fiscal and monetary policies that      place a higher priority on full employment. Near-term energy      investments in the greening of our energy base would also      offer both environmental and economic payoffs in the form of      good jobs and improved competitiveness.       Another underlying cause of our current economic weakness      is deregulation of the financial sector. The absence of      transparency and effective regulation of the mortgage and      financial services industries cries out for urgent attention.       Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid: though we have      framed this discussion in the rather dry and impersonal      language of stimulus and macroeconomic impacts, there is a      human dimension to this story we can never lose sight of.      Many, many working families all over this country are barely      hanging on and are deeply worried that the steep economic      downdraft will pull them off their perilous perch. The real      test for any economic proposal considered by Congress in the      coming weeks and months should be: what does it mean for      them?       Thank you in advance for your consideration of our      concerns.           Sincerely,                                                  John J. Sweeney,                                                        President.
