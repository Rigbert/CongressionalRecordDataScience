President, I strongly support the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey to address the crisis in Darfur, Sudan.  This amendment appropriates $95 million to support the African Union mission that will help to provide desperately needed security in Darfur.  We simply must act: What is happening there is genocide. The Congress has said it. The Secretary of State has said it. The world knows it. People are dying at a staggering rate, and it will only get worse.  After we appropriate this money, there is one other important piece of the puzzle--the administration must spend it. I will be working with the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from Ohio to ensure that the President does the right thing and spends this money.  I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his strong leadership on this issue.
