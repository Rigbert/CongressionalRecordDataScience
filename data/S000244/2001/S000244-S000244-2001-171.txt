 Madam Speaker, this bill also attempts to improve the patent reexamination system. It aims at closing an unfortunate administrative loophole and bridging a legal gap in the working of our patent system. The reform also comes out of two hearings that the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property held earlier this year.  While I strongly endorse the professionalism of the Patent and Trademark Office, I believe it is necessary to place a check on the PTO's actions by affording all participants judicial review before a Federal appeals court.                              {time}  1545  This check by a higher independent authority is an important safeguard and adds transparency to the process. Rest assured this appellate review will not impose additional burdens on patent-holders arising from Federal trials.  This is an important and necessary amendment that is an overdue change to our intellectual property laws. I urge Members to support H.R. 1886.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
