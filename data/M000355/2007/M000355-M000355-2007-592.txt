 President, let me say to my good friend, the assistant Democratic leader, we appreciate the willingness of the majority leader and the Senator from Illinois to consider the amendments that we would like to offer to the continuing resolution. Members on my side of the aisle have been on the Senate floor all afternoon discussing what they believe to be the shortcomings of the continuing resolution as it is currently structured. I appreciate the majority taking a look at those amendments and allowing us to continue discussion about the appropriateness of making some adjustments to this massive $464 billion bill.  I have also had some conversations with the majority leader about some nominations that we hope to wrap up next week. There is a circuit judge reported out of the Judiciary Committee today. I have an understanding with the majority leader that judge will be confirmed next week. There are some other executive branch nominations that we think should not generate any controversy that, hopefully, we can wrap up before the Lincoln recess.  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.
