I think that is very helpful. He and I talked about it last week and he said he would work on it. I very much appreciate that and I know the Members do as well. I thank you for that.  Mr. Leader, this may have been an oversight. You did not mention that first votes will be 6:30 on Tuesday of next week. Is that correct?
