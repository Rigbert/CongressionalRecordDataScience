President, after many weeks of intensive negotiations, I am pleased the members of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the administration were able to come to an agreement on S. 880, the Fuels Regulatory Relief Act. I take this opportunity to clarify certain points of this important legislation.  One item that is of particular concern is the possibility for circumvention by covered persons. New subparagraph (H)(xii)(II) states that it ``does not restrict the dissemination of off-site consequence analysis information by any covered person in any manner or form except in the form of a risk management plan.'' My concern is that this provision would seem to allow a government official in possession of this information to alter it in some minor, trivial way--like white out the words ``Risk Management Plan'' at the top of the page--and then distribute it with complete impunity. That possibility would obviously undermine the entire purpose of the legislation.
