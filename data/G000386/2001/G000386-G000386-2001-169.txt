 President, I rise with determination to join Senators Akaka and Levin introducing legislation on an issue that should concern us all: the integrity of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. I enclose editorials and op-ed commentaries, ranging from the New York Times to the Washington Times highlighting the needs for this law to be reborn so that it achieves its potential for public service. Unfortunately, it has become a Trojan horse that may well be creating more reprisal victims than it protects. The impact for taxpayers could be to increase silent observers who passively conceal fraud, waste and abuse. That is unacceptable.  I was proud to be an original co-sponsor of this law when it was passed unanimously by Congress in 1989, and when it was unanimously strengthened in 1994. Both were largely passed to overturn a series of hostile decisions by administrative agencies and an activist court with a monopoly on the statute's judicial review, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The administrative agencies, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board, appear to have gotten the point. They have been operating largely within statutory boundaries. Despite the repeated unanimous congressional mandates, however, the Federal Circuit has stepped up its attacks on the Whistleblower Protection Act. Enough is enough.  The legislation we are introducing today has four cornerstones, closing loopholes in the scope of WPA protection; restoring a realistic test for when reprisal protection is warranted; restoring the normal structure for judicial review; and codifying the anti-gag statute passed as an appropriations rider for the last 13 years. Each is summarized below.  As part of 1994 amendments unanimously passed by Congress to strengthen the Act, the legislative history emphasized, ``[I]t also is not possible to further clarify the clear language in section 2302(b)(8) that protection for `any' whistleblowing disclosure truly means `any.' A protected disclosure may be made as part of an employee's job duties, may concern policy or individual misconduct, and may be oral or written and to any audience inside or outside the agency, without restriction to time, place, motive or content.''  Somehow the Federal Circuit did not hear our unanimous voice. Without commenting on numerous committee reports and floor statements emphasizing this cornerstone, it has been creating new loopholes at an accelerated pace. Its precedents have shrunk the scope of protected whistleblowing to exclude disclosures made as part of an employee's job duties, to a co-worker, boss, others up the chain of command, or even the suspected wrongdoer to check facts. Under these judicial loopholes, the law does not cover agency misconduct with the largest impact, policies that institutionalize illegality or waste and mismanagement. Last December it renewed a pre-WPA loophole that Congress has specifically outlawed. The court decreed that the law only covers the first person to place evidence of given misconduct on the record, excluding those who challenge long term abuses, witnesses whose testimony supports pioneer whistleblowers, or anyone who is not the Christopher Columbus for any given scandal.  There is no legal basis for any of these loopholes. None of these loopholes came from Congress. In fact, allcontradict express congressional intent. Since 1978, the point of Federal whistleblower protection has been to give agencies the first crack at cleaning their own houses. These loopholes force them to either remain silent, sacrifice their rights, or go behind the back of institutions and individuals if they want to preserve their rights when challenging perceived misconduct. They proceed at their own risk if they exercise their professional expertise to challenge problems on the job. They can only challenge anecdotal misconduct on a personal level, rather than institutionalized.  Our legislation addresses the problem by codifying the congressional ``no exceptions'' definition for lawful, significant disclosures. The legislation also reaffirms the right of whistleblowers to disclose classified information about wrongdoing to Congress. National security secrecy must not cancel Congress' right to know about betrayals of the public trust.  In a 1999 decision, the Federal Circuit functionally overturned the standard by which whistleblowers demonstrate their disclosures deserve protection: lawful disclosures which evidence a ``reasonable belief'' of specific misconduct. Congress did not change this standard in 1989 or 1994 for a simple reason: it has worked by setting a fair balance to protect responsible exercises of free speech. Ultimate proof of misconduct has never been a prerequisite for protection. Summarized in lay terms, ``reasonable belief'' has meant that if information would be accepted for the record of related litigation, government investigations or enforcement actions, it is illegal to fire the employee who bears witness by contributing that evidence.  That realistic test no longer exists. In Lachance v. White, the Federal Circuit overturned the victory of an Air Force education specialist challenging a pork barrel program whose concerns were so valid that after an independent management review, the Air Force agreed and canceled the program. Unfortunately, local base officials held a grudge, reassigning Mr. White and stripping him of his duties. He appealed under the WPA and won before the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Federal Circuit, however, held that he did not demonstrated a ``reasonable belief'' and sent the case back. That raises questions on its face, since agencies seldom agree with whistleblowers.  The court accomplished this result disingenuously. While endorsing the existing standard, it added another hurdle. It held that to have a reasonable belief, an employee must overcome the presumption that the government acts fairly, lawfully, properly and in good faith. They must do so by ``irrefragable'' proof. The dictionary defines ``irrefragable'' as ``uncontestable, incontrovertible, undeniable, or incapable of being overthrown.'' The bottom line is that, in the absence of a confession, there is no such thing as a reasonable belief. If there is no disagreement about alleged misconduct, there is no need for whistleblowers.  The court even added a routine threat for employees asserting their rights. Although Congress has repeatedly warned that motives are irrelevant to assess protected speech, the court ordered the MSPB to conduct factfinding for anyone filing a whistleblower reprisal claim, to check if the employee had a conflict of interest for disclosing alleged misconduct in the first place. This means that while whistleblowers have almost no chance of prevailing, they are guaranteed to be placed under investigation for challenging harassment. Ironically, in 1994 Congress outlawed retaliatory investigations, which have now been institutionalized by the court.  In the aftermath, whistleblower support groups like the Government Accountability Project must warn those seeking guidance that if they assert rights, they will be placed under investigation and any eventual legal ruling on the merits inevitably will conclude they deserve punishment and formally endorse the retaliation they suffered. The White case is a decisive reason for those who witness fraud, waste and abuse to remain silent, instead of speaking out. Profiles in Courage are the exception, rather than the rule. Our legislation ends the presumptions of ``irrefragable proof'' and protects any reasonable belief as demonstrated by credible evidence.  This is the third time Congress has had to reenact a unanimous good government mandate thrown out by the Federal Circuit. This is also three strikes for the Federal Circuit's monopoly authority to interpret, and repeatedly veto, this law. It is time to end the broken record syndrome.  The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 contained normal ``all circuits'' court of appeals judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act. This was the same structure as all other employment anti-reprisal or anti-discrimination statutes. In 1982, the Federal Circuit was created, with a unique monopoly on appellate review of civil service, patent and copyright, and International Trade Commission decisions. Unfortunately, this experiment has failed. Our amendment restores the normal process of balanced review. Hopefully, that will restore normal respect for the legislative process.  In 1988, I was proud to introduce an appropriations rider to the Treasury, Postal and General Government bill which has been referred to as the ``anti-gag statute.'' It has survived constitutional challenge through the Supreme Court, and been unanimously approved in each of the last 13 appropriations bills. This provision makes it illegal to enforce agency nondisclosure policies or agreements unless there is a specific, express addendum informing employees that the disclosure restrictions do not override their right to communicate with Congress under the Lloyd Lafollette Act or other good government laws such as the Whistleblower Protection Act.  The provision originally was in response to a new, open-ended concept called ``classifiable.'' That term was defined as any information that ``could or should have been classified,'' or ``virtually anything,'' even if it were not market secret. This effectively ended anonymous whistleblowing disclosures, imposed blanket prior restraint, and legalized after-the-fact classification as a device to cover up fraud or misconduct. Since employees no longer were entitled to prior notice that information was secret, the only way they could act safely was a prior inquiry to the agency whether information was classified. That was a neat structure to lock in secrecy when its only purpose is to thwart congressional or public oversight. I am proud that the anti-gag statute has worked, and the strange concept of ``classifiable'' is history. After 13 years and over 6,000 individual congressional votes without dissent, it is time to institutionalize this merit system principle.  It should be beyond debate that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. I want to recognize the efforts of those whose stamina defending freedom of speech has applied that principle in practice. Senator Levin has been my Senate partner from the beginning of legislative initiatives on this issue. His leadership has proved that whistleblower protection is not an issue reserved for conservatives or liberals, Democrats or Republicans. Like the First Amendment, whistleblower protection is a cornerstone right for Americans.  Nongovernmental organizations have made significant contributions as well. The Government Accountability Project, a non-profit, non-partisan whistleblower support group, has been a relentless watchdog of merit system whistleblower rights since they were created by statute in 1978. Thanks to GAP, my staff has not been taken by surprise as judicial activism threatened this good government law. Kris Kolesnick, formerly with my staff and now with the National Whistleblower Center, worked on the original legislation while on my staff and continues to work in partnership with me.  In the decade since Congress unanimously passed this law, it has been a Taxpayer Protection Act. My office has been privileged to work with public servants who exposed indefensible waste and mismanagement at the Pentagon, as well as indefensible abuses of power at the Department of Justice. I keep learning that whistleblowers proceed at their own risk when defending the public. In case after case I have seen the proof of Admiral Rickover's insight that unlike God, the bureaucracy does not forgive. Nor does it forget.  It also has been confirmed repeatedly that whistleblowers must prove their commitment to stamina and persistence in order to make a differenceagainst ingrained fraud, waste and abuse. There should be no question about Congress', or this Senator's commitment. Congress was serious when it passed the Whistleblower Protection Act unanimously. It is not mere window dressing. As long as whistleblowers are defending the public, we must defend credible free speech rights for genuine whistleblowers. Those who have something to hide, the champions of secrecy, cannot outlast or defeat the right to know both for Congress, law enforcement agencies and the taxpayers. Every time judicial or bureaucratic activists attempt to kill this law, we must revive it in stronger terms. Congress can not watch passively as this law is gutted, or tolerate gaping holes in the shield protecting public servants. The taxpayers are on the other side of the shield, with the whistleblowers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the October 13, 1999 article from The Washington Times and the May 1, 1999 article from The New York Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 13, 1999]                         Silent Whistleblowers                  worker protections are under attack               (By Tom Devine and Martin Edwin Anderson)       Judicial activism is always suspect, but when it overturns      laws protecting the public's interest in order to shield      bureaucratic secrecy, it makes a mockery of the legal system      itself.       The issue has become a front-burner in Congress as it takes      a new look at a significant good-government law that twice      won unanimous passage. In the aftermath of extremist judicial      activism that functionally overturned the statute, a crucial      campaign has been launched this week on the Hill to enlist      members as friends of the court in a brief seeking Supreme      Court review of the circuit court decision.       At issue is a ruling made final in July by the Federal      Circuit Court of Appeals, which disingenuously overturned two      laws unanimously passed by Congress--the code of Ethics for      Government Service and the Whistleblower Protection Act. The      decision, White vs. Lachance, was the handiwork of a chief      judge whose previous job involved swinging the ax against      federal workers who dared to commit the truth.       At issue is the fate of Air Force whistleblower John White,      who lost his job in 1991 after successfully challenging a      pork-barrel ``quality management'' training program as      mismanagement. Government and private sector experts      concurred with Mr. White, and universities affected by it      began heading for the door. Even the Air Force agreed,      canceling it after outside experts agreed with Mr. White.       Thrice the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an      independent federal agency, ruled in Mr. White's favor. Each      time the Justice Department appealed on technicalities. Now      the federal court went further than asked while speculating      that Mr. White's disclosures may not have evidenced a      ``reasonable belief''--the test for disclosures to be      protected.       The court camouflaged its death-knell for the whistleblower      law in banal legalese, defining ``reasonable belief'' as,      ``Could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the      essential facts reasonably conclude gross mismanagement?''      But the bland explanatory guidance exposed a feudalistic duty      of loyalty to shield misconduct by bureaucratic bosses:      ``Policymakers have every right to expect loyal, professional      service from subordinates.'' So much for the Code of Ethics      for Government Service, which establishes the fundamental      duty of federal employees to ``put loyalty to the highest      moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons,      party or Government department.''       The court also disarmed the whistleblower law, claiming it      ``is not a weapon in arguments over policy.'' Yet when it      unanimously approved 1994 amendments, Congress explicitly      instructed, ``A protected disclosure may concern policy or      individual misconduct.''       Worse was a court-ordered ``review'' as a prerequisite to      find a ``reasonable belief'' of wrongdoing. It must begin      with the ``presumption that public officers perform their      duties correctly, fairly, in good faith and in accordance      with the law. . . . [T]his presumption stands unless there is      `irrefragable' proof to the contrary.''       ``Irrefragable,'' according to Webster's Dictionary, means      ``incapable of being overthrown, incontestable, undeniable,      incontrovertible.'' The court's decision kills freedom of      speech if there are two rational sides to a dispute--leaving      it easier to convict a criminal than for a whistleblower to      be eligible for protection. The irrefragable presumption of      government perfection creates a thick shield protecting big      government abuses--precisely the opposite of why the law was      passed.       Finally, the court ordered the MSPB to facilitate routine      illegality by seeking evidence of a whistleblower's conflict      of interest during every review. Retaliatory investigations--     those taken ``because of'' whistleblowing activities--are      tantamount to witch-hunts and were outlawed by Congress in      1994. For federal employees, the Big Brother of George      Orwell's ``1984'' has arrived 15 years late.       Key to understanding the decision is the role played by      Chief Judge Robert Mayer. Previously, Judge Mayer served as      deputy special counsel in an era when MSPB's Office of      Special Counsel (under its Chief Alex Kozinski, now a 9th      Circuit Court of Appeals judge) tutored managers and taught      courses on how to fire whistleblowers without leaving      fingerprints. Congress passed the WPA in part to deal with      these abuses.       Now Judge Mayer's judicial revenge is a near-perfect      gambit, as his court has a virtual monopoly on judicial      review of MSPB whistleblower decisions.       Congress must act quickly to pass a legislative definition      of ``reasonable belief'' that eliminates the certainty of      professional suicide for whistleblowers and restores the      law's good-government mandate. It also needs to provide      federal workers the same legal access enjoyed by private      citizens; jury trials and all circuits judicial review in the      appeals courts.       It is unrealistic to expect federal workers with second-     class rights to provide first-class public service. Returning      federal workers to the Dark Ages is an inauspicious way to      usher in a new millennium.                                  ____                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 1999]                    Helping Whistle-Blowers Survive       Jennifer Long, the Internal Revenue Service agent who      nearly lost her job two weeks ago after publicly blowing the      whistle on abuses at the agency, was rescued at the last      minute by the intervention of an influential United States      Senator. But the fact that her employers had no inhibitions      about harassing her is clear evidence that the laws      protecting whistle-blowers need to be strengthened. As they      stand, these laws merely invite the kind of retaliation that      Mrs. Long endured.       A career tax auditor, Mrs. Long was the star witness at      Senate Finance Committee hearings convened in 1997 by William      Roth of Delaware to investigate complaints against the I.R.S.      She was the only I.R.S. witness who did not sit behind a      curtain and use a voice distortion device to hide her      identity. She accused the agency of preying on weaker      taxpayers and ignoring cheating by those with the resources      to fight back. She has since said that she was subject to      petty harassments from the moment she arrived back at her      district office in Houston. Then, on April 15 of this year,      she was given what amounted to a termination notice, at which      point Mr. Roth intervened with the I.R.S. commissioner and      saved her job--at least for now.       Had he not intervened, Mrs. Long's only hope of vindication      would have been the remedies provided by the Civil Service      Reform Act of 1978 and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act of      1989. These two statutes prescribe a tortuous and uncertain      appeals process that in theory guarantees a whistle-blower      free speech without fear of retaliation, but in practice is      an exercise in frustration. Despite recent improvements, only      a handful of Federal employees, out of some 1,500 who      appealed in the last four years, have prevailed in rulings      issued by the Government's administrative tribunal, the Merit      System Protection Board. Overwhelmingly, the rest of the      cases were screened out on technical grounds or were settled      informally with token relief.       A few prominent whistle-blowers have won redemption outside      the system. Frederic Whitehurst, the chemist who was      dismissed after disclosing sloppiness and possible dishonesty      in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crime laboratory,      won a sizable cash settlement because he had a first-class      attorney who mounted an artful public relations campaign.      Ernest Fitzgerald, the Pentagon employee who disclosed      massive cost overruns, survived because he was almost      inhumanly persistent and because his cause, like Mrs. Long's,      attracted allies in high places. But the prominence of an      issue does not guarantee survival for the employee who      discloses it. Notra Trulock, the senior intelligence official      at the Energy Department who tried to alert his superiors to      Chinese espionage at a Government weapons laboratory, has      since been demoted.       Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has been      seeking ways to strengthen the 1989 law with the help of the      Government Accountability Project, a Washington advocacy      group that assists whistle-blowers. One obvious improvement      would be to give whistle-blowers the option to press their      claims in the Federal courts, where their cases could be      decided by a jury. To guard against clogging the system with      frivolous litigation, the cases would first be reviewed by a      nongovernment administrative panel. But the point is to give      whistle-blowers an avenue of appeal outside the closed loop      in which they are now trapped.       A reform bill along these lines passed the House in 1994      but died in the Senate. With Mrs. Long's case fresh in mind,      the time has come for both Houses to re-examine the issue.                                 ______                                       By
