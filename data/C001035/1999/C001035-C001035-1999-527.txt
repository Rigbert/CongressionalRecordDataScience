President, I rise to bring my colleagues' attention to the celebration of National TRIO Day on February 27th. The 99th Congress designated the last Saturday in February as the day to celebrate these very important and successful federal programs designed to raise the educational aspirations of students by providing services that help them overcome social, cultural, and other barriers to success in higher education.  Currently, two thousand colleges, universities, and community agencies sponsor TRIO programs. More than 780,000 lower-income middle school, high school, and adult students benefit from the services of such TRIO programs as Talent Search, Upward Bound, and Student Support Services. Not only do students personally benefit from their participation in higher education, but also our nation benefits from a better-educated population motivated to serve their communities and their country.  My home state of Maine has one of the country's lowest rates of participation in postsecondary education. The fifteen TRIO programs operating in Maine are working successfully to increase this number. Each year, these programs serve 6,000 students, building their aspirations for higher education and providing them the counseling, confidence, and academic support they need to pursue higher education.  Father James Nadeau, a native of my hometown in Aroostook County, is a graduate of the Bowdoin College Upward Bound program. His story tells why the TRIO programs are so important. His parents did not have the opportunity to pursue an education beyond the eighth grade. Father Jim's participation in Upward Bound changed his life and opened up a world of opportunity to him.  Beginning in 1977, Father Jim spent three summers enrolled in Upward Bound and then attended Dartmouth College and studied in France and Scotland. Subsequently, he studied for five years at the Gregorian University in Rome and received two graduate degrees in theology. His ministry has spanned from Mother Teresa in Calcutta to school children in Portland, Maine and continues to affect lives all over the world. He is an excellent role model for the youth of Maine and remains a terrific example of the success of the TRIO programs. There are many similar stories of TRIO graduates in all professions and walks of life. These are stories of successful, educated individuals who were introduced by a TRIO program to the endless possibilities that become attainable through education.  I encourage all of my colleagues to visit TRIO programs in their states as I have done in Maine. You will see for yourselves why these programs are vital to our efforts to promote equal educational opportunity for all our citizens.                          ____________________
