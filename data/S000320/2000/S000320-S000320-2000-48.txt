 We would be pleased to work with the Senator and I support the thrust of his request.  His request tracks very closely with the subcommittee's philosophy regarding FAA modernization. Funds provided in this bill for next generation navigation should not be used solely to protect programs which our bill report details are struggling to various degrees but to deploy the immediate benefits of satellite based technologies as quickly as possible.  I thank the Senator for his interest and look forward to working with him.
