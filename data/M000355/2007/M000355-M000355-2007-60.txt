 President, when Robert C. Byrd was born, America had just sent its first troops to France, an angry mob had just abolished private property in Russia, and the New York Times published its first op-ed piece.  Unfortunately, the ``Times'' would continue to publish daily editorials in addition to those op-eds. But fortunately for the country and for us, his colleagues, the Lord granted Robert Carlyle Byrd the gift of years--a lot of them.  Next week, Senator Byrd celebrates one more milestone in a long and growing list of them: his 90th birthday. And I think I speak for every Member of this body when I say we are grateful to have lived in an age in which we could serve with such a remarkable man.  Writing about the foundation of any great society, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote:     Not gold, but only men can make a nation great and strong     Men who for truth and honor's sake stand fast and labor long     Real men who work while others sleep     Who dare while others fly
