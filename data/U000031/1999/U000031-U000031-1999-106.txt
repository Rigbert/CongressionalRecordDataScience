Speaker, I rise today to introduce H.R. 2840, Children's Asthma Relief Act of 1999, legislation providing a comprehensive, community-based response to the increasingly serious incidence of childhood asthma. I am pleased that my colleague, Henry Waxman, is the original cosponsor of this bill.  Chronic asthma is a serious and growing health problem confronting our nation, and particularly our nation's children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 6.4 percent of our population report having asthma--a dramatic 75-percent increase over the last two decades. Childhood asthma has increased even more dramatically--over 160 percent since 1980--and is the most common childhood chronic disease. It is particularly prevalent among the urban poor, in all likelihood because of lack of access to health care and the high number of allergens in the environment. Asthma deaths have tripled over the past two decades, despite improvements in clinical treatment. In my own state, 5.7 percent of the population, or 542,300 Michiganders suffer from asthma.  The legislation we are introducing today will help us marshal and coordinate our resources to much more effectively wage war against this significant threat to our nation's health. First, the bill creates a $50 million program within the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program to assist communities in areas with a high prevalence of childhood asthma and a lack of access to medical care to establish treatment centers. In addition to providing medical care on site and in various areas of the community through ``breathmobiles,'' the centers will also provide education to parents, children, health providers and others on recognizing the signs and symptons of asthma, provide medications, and provide training in the use of these medications. The centers will also provide other services, such as smoking cessation programs and home modifications to reduce exposure to allergens.  In order to be eligible to receive grants under this program, applicants will be required to demonstrate that they will coordinate the services they are offering with other federal, state and local programs that may be serving these children and their families. Further, grantees are required to demonstrate that they are getting results and making progress in improving the health status of children in the program.  The bill encourages coordination of services in several other ways. First, it establishes a $5 million matching grant program to encourage states to incorporate asthma prevention and treatment services in their state Child Health Insurance Programs. Second, it makes reducing the prevalence of asthma and asthma-related illnesses among urban populations an explicitly allowable activity under the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant program. Third, it requires the director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, acting through the National Asthma Education Prevention Program Coordinating Committee, to identify all federal programs that carry out asthma-related activities and develop, in consultation with these agencies and voluntary health organizations, a federal plan for responding to asthma. Finally, it requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct surveillance activities that will help us get a better handle on the prevalence and severity of asthma and the quality of asthma management.  With these provisions in place, I am convinced that we can significantly advance our efforts to reduce the prevalence and severity of asthma in communities across the nation. I encourage you to sign on as a cosponsor and work with Representative Waxman and me for the passage of this law.                          ____________________
