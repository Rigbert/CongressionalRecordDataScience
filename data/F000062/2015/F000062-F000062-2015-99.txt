 President, I rise today to introduce legislation to facilitate additional housing and services for Southern California's veterans. It would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to leverage the resources of local governments and non-profits to build supportive housing for veterans at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center Campus. My colleague Senator Barbara Boxer is a cosponsor of this bill. Congressman Ted Lieu is introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Mayor of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors all support this legislation.  Los Angeles has the largest concentration of homeless veterans in the United States, currently estimated to be 4,300. These are brave men and women who served our nation with honor, and I believe it is our duty to ensure they have access to housing and the clinical services of the Greater Los Angeles VA Health System.  This legislation would provide two authorities to the department. First, it would allow the West Los Angeles VA to use enhanced-use leases to engage in public-private partnerships to provide supportive housing for veterans. Enhanced-use leases allow the department to leverage private or local funding and partners to construct new housing on the campus. For example, California passed a bond measure in 2014 that provides $600 million in funding for the construction of supportive veteran housing. I want to note that this enhanced-use leasing authority is the same authority that the department has for every other VA campus in the nation.  Second, my bill would allow the West Los Angeles campus to enter into out-leases to provide critical services to veterans housed on the campus, ranging from education to recreation. Services must be provided to create a healthy and sustainable community for veterans. Veterans housed on the campus will need access to mental health care options, job training, and physical recreation. These services can be provided by community partners leasing property on the campus, such as the University of California--Los Angeles.  I would like to make you aware of the long history of the West Los Angeles VA campus. This campus is approximately 400 acres and is located at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Interstate 405. The land was deeded to the Federal government by former Senator John P. Jones, for use exclusively as a ``soldier's home.'' The beautiful campus has numerous historic buildings, including a church.  In 2007, I included language in an appropriations bill to prohibit the ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs to lease or sale any property on the West Los Angeles Campus, due to reports of mismanagement and inappropriate leasing of VA property to commercial entities. In several cases, these commercial entities had nothing to do with serving veterans.  After the ban was signed into law, questionable practices continued through land-sharing agreements. This led to the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, of Southern California filing a lawsuit against the department in 2011 over its mismanagement of the campus.  In a large part due to our new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert A. McDonald, the department reached a settlement with the ACLU earlier this year to return the campus to its original purpose to serve veterans. The ACLU and the department are working to create a new Master Plan for the campus that includes community input, which I expect will include a focus on ending veteran homelessness in Los Angeles. My legislation will provide the department with the tools it needs to get veterans off the streets and ensure the West Los Angeles campus truly serves the veterans of Los Angeles.  This legislation contains important oversight provisions to ensure the management mistakes of the past are not repeated.  First, it maintains a restriction put in place in 2007 that prohibits any part of the West Los Angeles campus from being sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of.  Second, it requires the VA to report to Congress 45 days before entering into any lease, and to provide an annual evaluation of all land-use and leases on the campus.  Third, it requires regular audits by the Office of the Inspector General, OIG, and restricts the VA from entering into any new leases if the OIG finds any violation of Federal law or policy, or gross mismanagement of the campus. The VA would have to certify to Congress that it addressed any issues found by the OIG before entering into new leases on the campus.  Finally, the legislation requires all land-use, including leases, to be consistent with the new Master Plan that is agreed upon for the campus. It also requires all leases to principally benefit veterans.  I believe these oversight provisions will ensure that the historic mismanagement of the West Los Angeles campus will not recur.  Let me conclude by saying that Congress must meet its responsibility to care for the veterans who have fought for our Nation's freedom and security. It would be a shame to leave private resources untapped in a city where 4,300 veterans are currently homeless. I hope all of my colleagues will support enacting this legislation as quickly as possible.                                 ______                                       By
