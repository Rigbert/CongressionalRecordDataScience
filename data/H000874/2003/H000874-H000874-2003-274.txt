Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information he provided us. I would like to ask a number of questions about bills that we see on the horizon, to see whether or not they may be scheduled in the near future.  The Associated Health Plans, can you tell us what day we might consider that bill, and how the bill will be considered, and whether or not we will be allowed a substitute and/or amendment?
