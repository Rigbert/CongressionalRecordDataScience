 We can give a closer estimate, but I suspect at least a third of those amendments are place holders that are not likely to be moved at all. But one thing for sure, the list is decreasing, not increasing.  I was asked by the Democratic leader if we thought we could finish this bill by tomorrow night. I believe we can finish it by tomorrow night, at least the amendments by tomorrow night. Hopefully we will not move into Wednesday on this legislation. I certainly want to move it. Thus far I have seen cooperation on both sides to move contentious amendments.
