 President, I speak today to submit a resolution with my good friend and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter. Our resolution recognizes and commends the National Sexual Assault Hotline for counseling and helping more than 1 million callers. One of the most telling statistics since passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 is the number of individuals reporting rape to the authorities. Almost half--42 percent of rape victims are now stepping forward and reporting these heinous crimes to the authorities, while prior to 2002, only 31 percent reported their attacks. Each number represents a brave victim who steps forward and says out loud that she has been raped. For years, rape was a crime of shame. Our society blamed the victim. Police, lawyers, and judges focused on her conduct--what did she wear? where was she walking? was she drinking alcohol? Slowly but surely, we are working to change societal attitudes about rape and improve our criminal justice system to encourage reporting and prosecution of rapes, whether committed by the neighbor next door or a stranger in an alley.  A critical partner in our fight to end sexual assault has been the National Sexual Assault Hotline operated by RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network. RAINN created this toll-free telephone hotline--1-800-656-HOPE--in 1994 and manages it with 1,100 local affiliates in 50 States, and the District of Columbia. Victims from across the country can telephone the Hotline and receive confidential, trained expertise from experienced professionals with the assistance of over 10,000 volunteers. In June 2006, the Hotline received its millionth call since it answered its first call in 1994. In 2005 alone, the Hotline helped 137,039 individuals, an average of 11,420 people a month.  The National Sexual Assault Hotline is truly a national treasure. It helps individuals and families recover from a horrendous violation. It provides a safe haven for victims to talk about the crime, and offers referrals on local psychological and physical help. A call to the National Sexual Assault Hotline is often the first step towards justice for a victim. Research shows that victims who receive counseling are significantly more likely to report the assault, and more likely to fully participate in the prosecution. Every 2.5 minutes, another American is sexually assaulted. We are fortunate to have the hotline there to answer victims' calls for help and healing. The hotline's volunteers are doing God's work, and deserve our gratitude. I am proud to rise with my good friend from Pennsylvania to introduce a resolution marking the hotline's millionth call and commemorating the hotline's tremendous work to help America's families and make our streets safer.                          ____________________
