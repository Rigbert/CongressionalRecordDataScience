 President, I begin by paying my respects to those Senators who are departing this body. One of the great privileges for me has been to have worked with them. I think each in his own right has added considerably to the dimension of the Senate, and particularly one Senator, Nancy Kassebaum, I wish to salute her for her many additions. I have had the occasion to sit on the Foreign Relations Committee with her and to observe her and watch her and see her do her homework. For me as a woman this has been a very special experience. So I want to particularly salute her and also to thank the departing Senators for all of the courtesies they have extended to me and to the State of California.                          ____________________
