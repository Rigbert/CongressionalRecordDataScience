President.  This is a tough topic. I not only don't care to talk about intravenous drug injection, I can't stand watching it on television.  I find myself in the middle of a debate where you have to face the reality of what this is all about. The reality is that too many people in the District of Columbia--wait a minute--too many people in America have become IV drug users. We are trying to reduce that number, not only because addiction to drugs can ruin your life but also because there are other dangers associated with it, such as HIV and AIDS and hepatitis, and so many other things that cause problems.  I find it interesting that the Senator from Georgia, together, I understand, with the Senator from Missouri, comes here to try to stop the needle exchange program in the District of Columbia, because as we look at a map of the United States showing the States that have needle exchange programs, we see there is a needle exchange program in the home State of the Senator from Georgia and there is a needle exchange program in the home State of the Senator from Missouri.  As you look across the Nation, you see that many States are trying these programs. I am certain that the Senator from Georgia has spent a great deal of time trying to overturn the decision in his own State. That is probably why he comes here in this crusade against the D.C. needle exchange program.  But before we dismiss this as something that might encourage drug use, please, let's look at the facts.       The highest rate of new HIV infections is in [Washington,      DC.] AIDS kills in the District like no other cause of death      for residents between ages 30 and 44.  I am quoting from a July 1, 1999, Washington Post editorial. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, July 1, 1997]                       How to Spread HIV in D.C.       When the Senate takes up the District's fiscal year 2000      budget, a floor amendment may be offered to ban a needle-     exchange program in the city. A yes vote is a green light to      allow HIV to spread unimpeded among intravenous drug users.       The District has strong reason for an effective needle-     exchange program. The highest rate of new HIV infections is      in the nation's capital. AIDS kills in the District like no      other cause of death, for residents between ages 30 and 44.      The city has the distinction of     having an AIDS death rate seven times the national average.      As if this weren't tragic enough, the city also has to      contend with needle-exchange opponents attacking a program      that has--through the Whitman Walker Clinic--reduced the      spread of HIV by causing a 29 percent drop in the number of      drug injections.       Opponents will argue that needle-exchange programs promote      drug use. That has not been the District's experience. Nor      has it been the experience of more than 113 other state and      local government-supported programs across the nation. Maybe      that's why the American Medical Association, the National      Academy of Sciences, the American Bar Association and the      U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have thrown      their weight behind the program.       Last year Congress unwisely added to another District law a      prohibition on funding a needle-exchange program. In an act      of legislative overkill, it also required that private groups      spending their own money on such programs lose any federal      funds they might receive. That took the Whitman Walker Clinic      out of the picture. As a result, a local group receiving only      private funds is trying to fight the spread of HIV on a      shoestring budget. That's the wrong way to fight a killing      disease. The District should be able to spend its own money      on this lifesaving program.
