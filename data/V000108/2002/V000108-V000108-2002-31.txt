Speaker, Congressman Tim Roemer, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Select Education of the House Committee on Education and Workforce and proud member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, will be retiring after 12 years of dedicated service to his constituents in Northern Indiana and to our country.  I rise today to acknowledge and applaud the interests and service of Tim Roemer during his productive career in public service, and to wish him the very best in his future endeavors.  By way of background, Tim Roemer was first elected to Congress from the 3rd Congressional District of Indiana in 1990. Tim grew up in South Bend, and though he went to college in San Diego, he returned home and received a masters and Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame. He has dedicated his life to public service not only through his term as a U.S. Representative, but also through his time with former 3d District Representative John Brademas and Arizona Senator Dennis DeConcini.  In his tenure in Congress, Tim served as Co-Chairman of the New Democratic Coalition. While being a staunch believer in balancing the federal budget, he fought endlessly to support legislation that would improve the quality of education received by all children in our country. Tim was a strong advocate of federal special education funding and supported innovative programs like Ameri-Corp, Transition to Teaching, and charter schools. As a strong supporter of the war on terrorism, through his work on the Select Intelligence Committee, he called for efforts to better secure the American homeland and prevent future terrorist attacks.  I have had the pleasure and privilege of knowing and working with Tim for just over a decade. I do not expect his retirement from elective office to end either his public service or his significant contributions to our Nation. In fact, I have every expectation that Tim Roemer will continue to be an active, thoughtful, and valuable contributor to public debate on critical national issues. I wish him and his family the best.                          ____________________
