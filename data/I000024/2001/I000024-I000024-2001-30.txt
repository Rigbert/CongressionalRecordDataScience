President, I understand what the Senator from Nevada, the distinguished assistant majority leader, said. The problem is that we have been talking about this now--I personally, since the eighties when then-Secretary of the Interior Don Hodel and I would tour the Nation to explain to the Nation that our dependency on foreign sources of oil for our ability to fight a war was not an energy issue; it was a national security issue. At that time, we were 37-percent dependent on foreign sources of oil forour ability to fight a war. Now it is much more serious. We have gone through the 1990 Persian Gulf war. I think everyone realizes that.  The problem I have is the statement of the Senator from Nevada that nothing is going to happen, that this is merely a sense of the Senate. I know the Chair has ruled it is not germane. I will not challenge that and put in jeopardy the Defense authorization bill. I don't want to do that.  I only say this: Talk is cheap. We have been sitting around talking about it. The statement made by the Senator from Nevada is the same statement they made back in the 1980s and all during the 1990s. Every time we try to bring up an energy bill, they say: Yes, we all want it. Yet do they really want it?  We will continue in our efforts. I will continue in such a way as to not jeopardize in any way the Defense authorization bill.  I yield the floor.
