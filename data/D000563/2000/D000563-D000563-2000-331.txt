President, I am also concerned about another issue which has become very timely. It is related to recent statements by officials in Russia concerning Russia's view of the Baltic countries. I have a personal interest in this. My mother was born in Lithuania, an immigrant to the United States. Over the course of my public career, I have journeyed to the Baltic countries on several occasions and have witnessed the miracle of independence and democracy coming to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This was something that many of us had prayed for but never believed would happen in our lifetime; that the Soviet empire would come down and that these three countries, which had been subjugated to the Russians and Soviets in the early forties, would have a chance for their own independence and democracy.  In fact, I was able to be there on the day of the first democratic election in Lithuania. My mother was alive at the time, and she and I took great pride that the Lithuanian people had maintained their courage and dignity throughout the years of Soviet occupation and now would be given a chance to have their own country again.  I have met with the leaders of these countries. I am particularly close to the President of Lithuania, Valdas Adamkus. The story of Mr. Adamkus is amazing. He fought the Nazis in World War II and then fought the Soviets and finally decided he had to escape and came to the United States where he went to school and settled in Chicago, became an engineer, went to work for the Environmental Protection Agency, spent a lifetime of civil service, receiving awards from Presidents for his service to our country, and then at the time of his retirement announced that he was going to move back to Lithuania at the age of 70 and run for President. When Mr. Adamkus came to me and suggested that, I thought, well, it is a wonderful dream; surely, it is not going to happen. And he won, much to the surprise of everyone. He is currently the President of Lithuania; he is very popular. He believes, as I do, that the freedom in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is something that we in the West must carefully guard.  Those of us who for 50 years protested the Soviet takeover of these countries cannot ignore the fact they are still in a very vulnerable position. Not one of these countries has a standing army or anything like a missile arsenal or anything like a national defense. Yet they look across the borders to their neighbors in Russia and Belarus and see very highly armed situations--and in many cases very threatening.  That is why the recent statements by Vladimir Putin, the new President in Russia, are so troubling. According to the Washington Post on June 15, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a statement in which he said that fulfilling the aspirations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for NATO membership would be a reckless act that removed a key buffer zone and posed a major strategic challenge to Moscow that could, in his words, ``destabilize'' Europe.  The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on June 9 of this year that claimed that Lithuania's forceable annexation in 1940 was voluntary.  This is an outrageous rewrite of history. The Soviets were legendary for their rewrites. They would rewrite history and decide that they, in fact, had developed an airplane first, an automobile first, all these affirmations, and Stalin was, in fact, a benevolent leader and was not a ruthless dictator. All of these revisions were used to scoff at the West.  We thought that the end of the Russian empire would be the end of revisionist history. Unfortunately, Mr. Putin and his leadership in Moscow are starting to turn back to the same old ways. By the statements that they have made, they have said, if we went forward with allowing the Baltic States into NATO, it would be an explicit threat to the sovereignty of Russia. And they also go on to say it could destabilize Europe.  Such a threat by the Russian Federation against security in Europe cannot go unchallenged, and that is why I come to the Senate floor today. It is incredible that the Russian President would continue to call the Baltic countries ``buffer States'' that would presumably have no say in their own security in the future and could once again be subjugated with impunity. To suggest that the Baltic nations are somehow pawns to be moved back and forth across the board by leaders in Russia is totally unacceptable. It is unbelievable that the Russian Foreign Ministry could forget the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that carved up Eastern Europe between Hitler and Stalin, that moment in time when the Nazis and Communists in Russia were in alliance, in league with one another, and through respective foreign ministers basically gave away countries.  At that moment in time, the Baltic States were annexed into the Soviet Union against their will, and for more than 50 years we in the United States protested that. It was the so-called Captive Nations Day we celebrated on Capitol Hill and across America to remember that those Baltic States and so many other countries were brought into the Soviet empire against their will. Somehow, Mr. Putin in this new century is suggesting that we did not understand history; the Baltic nations really wanted to be part of the SovietUnion. That is a ridiculous statement, and it defies history and defies the facts that everyone knows. It is beyond belief that the Russian Foreign Minister would claim that the Red Army troops occupying the Baltic countries in June of 1940 were not the reason that these countries so-called ``joined'' the Soviet Union. Listen to the statement by the Russian Foreign Minister.       The August 3, 1940 decision of USSR Supreme Soviet to admit      Lithuania into the Soviet Union was preceded by corresponding      appeals from the highest representative bodies of the Baltic      States.       Therefore it would be wrong to interpret Lithuania's      admission to the USSR as a result of the latter's unilateral      actions. All assertions that Lithuanian was ``occupied'' and      ``annexed'' by the Soviet Union and related claims of any      kind of neglect, political, historical and legal realities      therefore are groundless.  This is the statement by the Russian Foreign Minister.  Let me tell you, he not only ignores the history of 1940 which is very clear, but he ignores the fact that in 1991 the Russian Foreign Ministry entered into a treaty with Lithuania in which Russia explicitly admitted that the 1940 Soviet annexation violated Lithuanian sovereignty and that Lithuania, they said, at the time was free to pursue its own security agreements and arrangements. So in 1991, in those enlightened moments as the Soviet empire came down and Russia became a new State with democratic elections, they entered into a treaty with Lithuania and acknowledged the reality that Lithuania was forcibly annexed into the Soviet Union. They said in 1991 Lithuania had the right, as the Baltic States do, to pursue their security arrangements.  Now, when Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia talk about membership in NATO, the Russian Foreign Minister and Russian President Putin come forward and say unacceptably, it would destabilize Europe; it would eliminate the so-called ``buffer States.'' They still view these countries as vassals, as pawns to be used. They will not acknowledge the sovereignty which should be acknowledged of these countries.  These disturbing statements show clearly why the Baltic countries must be admitted to NATO; that is, to show Russia and any neighboring country that it must give up its territorial ambitions against NATO membership for the Baltic countries, and it would make it critically clear that the West would never again accept ``buffer State'' subjugation of them. The idea that the three tiny Baltic States could threaten the enormous and powerful Russian Federation is laughable. If Russia has no design on the Baltic States, it has nothing to fear from their membership in NATO.                          ____________________
