 As with the experience of the young veteran I described, the GAO report found the recruiters overstated what it would cost to go to public college. On film, as you said--this is on videotape--when asked the cost, this recruiter from Westwood said: Well, it depends on the program. Usually with a bachelor's program, coming in with no college credits, this could be--it could range from $50,000 to $75,000, he said. Most schools, more traditional schools, you are looking at $100,000, $150,000, $200,000.  I might say to the Senator from Iowa, isn't it true that to obtain the same degree he was offering at Westwood from a public university degree in Texas would cost $36,000? Isn't that what the GAO came in and said?
