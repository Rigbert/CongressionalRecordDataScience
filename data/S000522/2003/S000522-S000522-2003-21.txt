Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 453) condemning the terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, expressing condolences to the families of the individuals murdered and expressing sympathies to the individuals injured in the terrorist attacks, and standing in solidarity with Turkey in the fight against terrorism, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:       Whereas in Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15, 2003, two      explosions, set off minutes apart during Sabbath morning      services, devastated Neve Shalom, the city's largest      synagogue, and the Beth Israel Synagogue, about three miles      away;       Whereas more than 20 people, both Muslims and Jews, were      killed, and more than 300 people, both Muslims and Jews, were      wounded, in the bombing attacks on the synagogues;       Whereas on November 20, 2003, two bombs exploded at the      Consulate of the United Kingdom in Istanbul and at the HSBC      Bank;       Whereas among the more than 25 killed and 450 wounded in      the November 20 bombing attacks on the consulate general and      commercial buildings were Muslims and Christians--Turks,      British diplomats, and visitors to the Turkish Republic;       Whereas the United Kingdom is an ally of the United States      and Turkey in the global war on terrorism;       Whereas the acts of murder committed on November 15 and 20,      2003, in Istanbul, Turkey, were cowardly and brutal      manifestations of international terrorism;       Whereas the Government of Turkey immediately condemned the      terrorist attacks in the strongest possible terms and has      vowed to bring the perpetrators to just at all costs;       Whereas the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey      equally abhor and denounce these hateful, repugnant, and      loathsome acts of terrorism;       Whereas with anti-Semitic activities escalating the safety      and security of Jewish people throughout the world is a      matter of serious concern;       Whereas since Turkey cherishes its traditions of      hospitality and religious tolerance and in particular its      history of more than five hundred years of good Jewish-Muslim      relations, the attacks on synagogues and consular premises      came as a special shock to the Turkish people and to their      friends throughout the world;       Whereas the United States and turkey are allied by shared      values and a common interest in building a stable, peaceful,      and prosperous world;       Whereas Turkey, a predominantly Muslim nation with a      secular government, has close relations with Israel and is      also the only predominantly Muslim member of the North      Atlantic Treaty Organization; and       Whereas as the acts of murder committed on November 15 and      20, 2003 show again that terrorism respects neither      boundaries nor borders:       Now, therefore, be it Resolved, That the House of      Representatives       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the terrorist      attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, on November 15 and 20, 2003;       (2) expresses its condolences to the families of the      individuals murdered in the terrorist attacks, expresses its      sympathies to the individuals injured in the attacks, and      conveys its hope for the rapid and complete recovery of all      such injured individuals;       (3) expresses its condolences to the people and government      of the Turkish Republic and of the United Kingdom over the      losses they have suffered; and       (4) expresses its solidarity with the United Kingdom, the      Turkish republic, and all other countries which stand united      against terrorism and which work together to bring to justice      the perpetrators of these and other terrorist attacks.
