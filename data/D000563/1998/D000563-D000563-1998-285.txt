President, today I introduce this legislation with my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Collins. Unfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. Those who perpetrate violence against their family members do not desist because the family member grows older. In fact, in some cases, the abuse may become more severe as the victim ages becoming more isolated from the community with their removal from the workforce. Other age-related factors such as increased frailty may increase a victim's vulnerability. It also is true that older victims' ability to report abuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser for care or housing. Every seven minutes in Illinois, thereis an incidence of elder abuse. Several research studies have shown that elder abuse is the most under reported familial crime. It is even more under reported than child abuse with only between one in eight and one in fourteen incidents estimated to be reported. Seniors who experience abuse worry they will be banished to a nursing home if they report abuse. They also must struggle with the ethical dilemma of reporting abuse by their children to the authorities and thus increasing their child's likelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear gag them so that they remain ``silent victims.''  Domestic violence programs have a moral and ethical responsibility to provide services to individuals of any age who are the victims of domestic abuse. Yet most domestic violence programs see only a few older women a year. That is not to say that the domestic violence service providers actively discriminate against older victims. Analysis of the few studies that do exist of elder domestic abuse indicate that the vast majority do not themselves seek to access existing services. There may be many reasons for this. The images portrayed in the media of the victims of domestic violence generally depict a young woman, with small children. Seniors suffering domestic abuse may not readily identify with these images and, therefore, may not see those services as being for them. Other cultural barriers may also exist. Many older women were raised to believe that family business is a private matter. Problems within families were not to be discussed with anyone, especially strangers or counselors. Only a handful of domestic abuse programs throughout the country are reaching out to older women.  This legislation seeks to improve current federal family violence programs, such as The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) and Family Violence Prevention Services Act (FVPSA), to make them more sensitive to the needs of the nations seniors. Title I of this bill promotes the inclusion of elder abuse cases in law school clinics and training for law enforcement in the identification and referral of older victims of domestic violence or elder abuse to services. Title II allows FVPSA grant funds to be used for outreach to older individuals. We know that great improvements have taken place since VAWA was first passed. One of the most successful programs is the law enforcement training program, which received $200 million in FY 1998. However, improvement can be made with respect to identifying abuse among all age groups. When the abuser is old, there may be a reticence on the part of law enforcement to deal with this person in the same way that they might deal with a younger person. Who wants to send an ``old guy'' to jail? However, lack of action jeopardizes the victim further because then the abuser has every reason to believe that there are no consequences for their actions. Another common problem is differentiating between injuries related to abuse and injuries arising from aging, frailty or illness. Too many older women's broken bones have been attributed to disorientation, osteoporosis or other age-related vulnerabilities without any questions being asked to make sure that they are not the result of abuse.  Title III reauthorizes the very important Elder Rights programs contained within the Older Americans Act. These programs provide seed money for state elder abuse programs. Included here is the Long-term-care Ombudsman program that monitors nursing homes and investigates reports of abuse in such institutions.  Most domestic abuse shelters are filled with young families. The staff and volunteers are predominantly younger than 50 years old. The recreation calendar has activities for young women and children. Discussions at support groups can be dominated by younger women talking about their children, child care and custody. Many domestic abuse shelters are not readily accessible to those who are less mobile. For instance, some may not be accessible via the ground floor. Moving from your home into a shelter is always a traumatic event. However, it may be even harder for those who find themselves in surroundings so unfamiliar and so totally oriented to a different age group. In my home state of Illinois, there are only two centers that focus on the shelter needs of seniors. One is the Center for Prevention of Abuse in Peoria, the other is the Swan center in Olney, which has a comprehensive elder protective services program. Title III seeks to address this shortage by encouraging expanded access to domestic violence shelters that cater to the needs of older individuals.  This bill seeks to help foster collaboration between the aging networks and domestic violence coalitions. Throughout the United States, through the Older Americans Act, a variety of programs seek to serve seniors in their communities. Home-delivered meals and other services provide an opportunity for seniors to interact with individuals outside their own homes. Increasing the knowledge of such care providers in how to identify and refer victims of domestic violence would likely provide much-needed relief to many of these individuals. Title III of this bill contains a ``Community Initiatives and Outreach'' grants program to help coordinate both public and private efforts in elder domestic abuse prevention and treatment. Fostering communication between these two groups has the potential of dramatically increasing the number of individuals that are sensitive to these issues of abuse and, also, to increase the number of individuals who are served by domestic violence programs generally.  Family violence is one of the most common causes of disease and distress seen by physicians. In spite of its existence as a pervasive and debilitating medical and social problem, many advocates in the domestic violence community believe that it receives insufficient attention in the curricula of most schools of medicine or other health professional training institutions. Dr. Jane Jackman, past president of the Illinois State Medical Society noted last year ``Doctors are finding that the problem is under-recognized. Elder abuse or maltreatment is growing in significance as a factor in trauma, hospital admissions, rising costs of long term care and, ultimately, deaths.'' Title III of this bill directs the Assistant Secretary of Aging to collaborate with other Departments of Health and Human Services and the National Institute of Aging to update and improve curricula for both training and retraining of health professionals and others in the area of elder domestic abuse. These curricula would be made available to educational institutions involved in training health professionals. Title IV would amend the Area Health Education Center and Geriatric Education Centers funded through the Health Professionals Education Act to allow them to use funds for training and retraining health professionals in elder domestic abuse.  The last title of the bill, Title V, examines the issue of financial exploitation of seniors. Take the case of Helen (not her real name) reported in the Chicago Tribune last year. Helen was a 66-year-old mother and grandmother from DuPage County. Early in 1997, Helen lost $90,000 and even access to her own kitchen due to the actions of her daughter. Helen describes how she felt like a P.O.W. Helen had agreed to pool resources with her daughter and son-in-law and buy a house where all of them would live; the deal seemed like a win-win proposition. Unbeknownst to Helen, most of the money went to pay off her son-in-law's debts. Soon the young couple asked Helen for thousands more and $300 in monthly rent. Shortly after this, her daughter had construction done on the house which put a new wall between Helen's bedroom and the kitchen, blocking her way to the kitchen and forcing her to prepare her food in the bathroom. Eventually, Helen found herself in a shelter. She now lives in a government subsidized apartment.  The Illinois Department of Aging and other elder abuse service providers will attest to the fact that Helen is not alone in experiencing such financial exploitation. Of the 5,833 reports of elder abuse in Illinois in 1997, nearly half (44.6%) were reports of financial exploitation. Statistics compiled by the Illinois Department on Aging show that the majority of financial abuse victims are female and that most have a functional impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease. For some, financial exploitation may at times be accompanied by physical abuse or the threat of physical abuse or other form of coercion. The states Attorneys General have efforts underway to examine this area and arecooperating in sharing information on how best to deal with such abuse. Financial exploitation is probably more complex and sometimes more difficult to detect than other forms of abuse. Therefore, we are proposing a study by experts in the field to more comprehensively analyze the problem and to make recommendations for future actions.  With the greying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in all its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we need to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence programs and ensure that these and other programs that serve seniors are sensitive and knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse. I am pleased that Senators Akaka, Moseley-Braun, Harkin, Mikulski, Wellstone, Dodd, Kohl, Warner, Boxer, Graham, Cleland, Landrieu, Reid, Torricelli and Faircloth have all joined Senator Collins and myself in introducing this bill, and I hope that many more will join us in this effort to focus attention on the needs of the ``forgotten older victims of domestic violence.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed the the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2114       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Study and report.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and      over who are victims of abuse each year, at least two-thirds      are women;       (2) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse      and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member and adult      children of the victims are the largest category of      perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of      perpetrators;       (3) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United      States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is      expected to continue growing;       (4) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's      elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the      rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;       (5) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5      cases being reported in 1980 and 1 in 8 cases being reported      today;       (6) based on site-specific information from the Indian      Health Service, the rate of trauma and violence faced by      Indian women could be considered to be epidemic;       (7) elder abuse takes on many forms, including physical      abuse, sexual abuse, psychological (emotional) abuse, neglect      (intended or unintended), and financial exploitation;       (8) many older persons, particularly women and minorities,      fail to report abuse because of shame or as a result of prior      unsatisfactory experiences with individual agencies or others      who lacked sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older      people;       (9) the lack of culturally relevant elder abuse services      for Indian women makes access to shelter and other services      difficult and often impossible for some Indian women;       (10) many older persons fail to report abuse because they      are dependent on their abusers and fear being abandoned or      institutionalized;       (11) the lack of access to telephones, law enforcement, and      health services in remote areas, including Indian      reservations, makes access to relief from elder abuse      particularly difficult for some populations;       (12) public and professional awareness and identification      of elder abuse is difficult because older persons are not      tied into many social networks (such as schools or jobs), and      may become isolated in their homes, which can increase the      risk of elder abuse;       (13) the Department of Justice does not include age as a      category for criminal statistics reporting;       (14)(A) there are relatively few statistics and research      studies regarding violence against older women, and even less      is known about the incidence of violence against Indian      women; and       (B) there is no national data base regarding violence      against Indian women; and       (15) older persons would greatly benefit from policies that      develop, strengthen, and implement programs for the      prevention of abuse, including neglect and exploitation, and      provide related assistance for victims.
