President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. I also had the good fortune to meet with the new interim President of Iraq. I actually asked him a similar question, and what the Senator from Massachusetts says is absolutely so. He said: Get it all out. He spoke of making it as transparent as possible. He said: The United States has always had a reputation of being honest, of being a democratic nation, of admitting our mistakes, and, of course, of being proud of those things we have accomplished that we can be so proud of. If we want to maintain that credibility, get it all out.  The Senator from Massachusetts said that in our system, nobody is above the law. I thank God that is so, that the Founders of this country were wise enough to set in place a system where nobody--nobody--was above the law. We have demonstrated this over and over again throughout our history as a nation. Anybody who has tried to step above it, the checks and balances stop that.  What the administration can do is so easy: Answer the questions. The Attorney General refused to answer our questions. But he did not do it on the basis of any of the very limited reasons that a question might be refused--either because the information being sought is classified, which requires us to go into closed session, or because the President has asserted executive privilege, which the President did not in this case.  They have sent up 3 of the 23 items we requested. Two of the 3 items were already on the Internet. But at least we are one item forward. Let's get the rest of the information and documents up here, and then let the Senate do what it should do: Let the various committees actually ask questions and seek answers.  Mr. President, I see my good friend from Pennsylvania on the floor seeking recognition, so I yield the floor.
