 President, I rise today in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by my colleague from Kansas.  I am most concerned with those that question the administration's authority to issue this Executive order. As the Federal Government's chief executive officer, the President has the responsibility by law to assure that taxpayers receive the goods and services they require from Federal contractors. These contractors must maintain stable and productive labor-management relationships if they are going to produce the products our Nation must depend upon.  The Executive order advances cooperative and stable labor-management relations, a central component of this administration's workplace agenda. The use of--or the threat to use--permanent replacement workers destroys the cooperative environment that this relationship must maintain.  The Executive order represents a lawful exercise of Presidential authority. The Federal Procurement Act, enacted by Congress in 1949, expressly authorizes the President to prescribe such policies and directives, not inconsistent with the provisions of this act, as he shall deem necessary to effectuate the provisions of said act.  Presidents since Franklin Roosevelt have issued Executive orders addressing the conduct of firms with which the Federal Government does business. Those orders to be challenged have been upheld.  In 1941, President Roosevelt issued an Executive order requiring defense contractors to refrain from racial discrimination. In 1951, after enactment of the Procurement Act, President Truman issued an Executive order extending the requirement to all Federal contractors. When both orders were issued, such discrimination was not unlawful [[Page S3801]] and, indeed, Congress had declined to enact an antidiscrimination law proposed by President Truman.  In 1964, President Johnson issued an Executive order prohibiting Federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of age. At the time, Federal law permitted such age discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 merely directed the President to study the issue.  In 1969, the Nixon administration expanded the antidiscrimination Executive order to encompass a requirement that all Federal contractors adopt affirmative action programs. This Executive order was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.  In 1978, President Carter issued an Executive order requiring all federal contractors to comply with certain guidelines limiting the amount of wage increases. The D.C. Circuit Court upheld President Carter's Executive order.  Finally, in 1992 President Bush issued an Executive order requiring unionized Federal contractors to notify their unionized employees of their right to refuse to pay union dues. The National Labor Relations Act contains no such requirement and legislation proposing this in the 101st Congress was not passed.  The economical and efficient administration and completion of Federal Government contracts requires a stable and productive labor-management environment. Strikes involving permanent replacements last seven times longer than strikes that do not involve permanent replacements.  Mr. President, my personal interest in this amendment is its impact on the most vulnerable and fastest growing segment of our work force--American women.  Over the last decade, women have assumed ever greater economic and family caretaking responsibilities. Everyone in this country should be unsettled by the fact that women and children are most likely to fall deeper into poverty and homelessness. One of three families headed by a women lives to or below the poverty line: Nearly 70 percent of all working women earned less than $20,000 a year, and 40 percent earned less than $10,000 annually. These workers need the ability to raise their standard of living in order to break the cycle of poverty and welfare dependence which many of them endure.  These women understand that they cannot bargain effectively unless they are assured that they do not risk losing their jobs permanently. They understand the serious implications of a strike. They understand, as I do, the fear of being one paycheck away from economic disaster.  Most of us have home mortgages, car payments, educational and medical needs for ourselves and our families. America's workers know striking is the option of last resort. This action is never taken lightly.  I urge my colleagues to maintain the delicate balance of collective bargaining. This Executive order shows that this great society values the individual, that it cares about women, and it recognizes those that built this Nation. Let us defeat this amendment and prove to America that Government does respect the needs of ordinary working people.  I thank the President. I yield the floor.                            ____________________
