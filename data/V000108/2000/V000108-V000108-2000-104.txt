Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Arthur and Ida Ander Friedman. On Sunday, September10, 2000, Art and Ida will be honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to Northwest Indiana and to the State of Israel. Their praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at the annual Northwest Indiana-Israel Dinner of State, as they receive the Jerusalem-City of Peace Award. The State of Israel Bond presents the City of Peace Award to worthy recipients who demonstrate their dedication and outstanding service to Israel and their community.  This year's recipients, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Ander Friedman, are two of the most caring, dedicated, and selfless citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. Art and Ida hail from Hammond, Indiana and Davenport, Iowa, respectively. Art is a World War II Veteran, and proudly served under General Patton in the European Theater. He is actively involved in several organizations, including B'nai B'rith, his Synagogue's Men's Club, and the Marcus-Wallack Heart Fund. Ida shares Art's dedication to Northwest Indiana and the Jewish community there, and invests extraordinary time and energy in important community and national groups. She has been active in Jewish Women International, the Synagogue's Sisterhood, Hadassah, and the Marcus-Wallack Heart Fund.  While serving the greater community has always been an extremely important part of the Friedmans' lives, their dedication to their family is unparalleled. Art and Ida have three wonderful, grown children, Gary, Richard, and Steven. Their four grandchildren are constant sources of pride and happiness.  The special guest at this gala event will be Mr. Morton Klein. Mr. Klein is the National President of the Zionist Organization of America. He is a strong defender of Israel and a respected leader in the American Jewish community.  Mr. Speaker., I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Art and Ida Friedman for their lifetime of service, success, and dedication to Indiana's First Congressional District and the State of Israel.                          ____________________
