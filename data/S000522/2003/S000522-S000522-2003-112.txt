Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation would restore the operation of the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program during the current fiscal year to the scope of that program as it was in effect on September 30, 2002.  The Native American Veteran Home Loan Program was established in 1992 as a 5-year pilot program, and Congress has extended it twice, most recently through 2005. This program is intended to assist eligible veterans living on trust or equivalent lands to secureloans at market rates to purchase, build or to renovate homes. VA has made over 300 home loans under this program. The Department of Veterans Affairs has stopped making loans under the Native American direct loan program because of a limitation contained in the 2003 Appropriations Act, which capped the amount of loans that can be made under this program to $5 million. This limitation was requested by the administration with the assumption that the limit would not be breached. VA advised us as of June 11 in a letter that it has already exceeded that limit.  Mr. Speaker, 47 loans have already been made during the fiscal year, many of them refinancing loans. The VA committee has been advised that construction of a number of homes has been suspended directly attributable to the imposition of this moratorium. Pending applications are also on hold. I see no reason, in effect, why our Native American veterans should lose access to home loans in this way. We should celebrate their success, not put an artificial cap on it, especially at a time when refinancing is a way to save veterans thousands of dollars each and every year. We need to end this moratorium as soon as possible, and that is the purpose of this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
