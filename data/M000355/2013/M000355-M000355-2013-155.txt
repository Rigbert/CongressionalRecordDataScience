 President, as I have talked about repeatedly over the last few weeks, there is a cloud hanging over the Senate, an unease throughout the Senate entirely on the Republican side and some on the Democratic side as well, and that is this: We had a discussion at the beginning of this Congress about what the rules of the Senate would be for this Congress this year and next year. After that bipartisan discussion, we passed two rules changes and two standing orders. The majority leader said we had determined what the rules of the Senate were going to be for the next 2 years. He gave his word that we would not break the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate--the so-called nuclear option. Yet he has continued to hint that maybe that was not what he had in mind.  So what my colleagues and I are asking the majority leader to do is tostand by his word. Your word is the currency of the realm here in the Senate. We expect the majority leader to keep his word. His word was given unequivocally in January of this year. In fact, it was given in January 2 years before that for the next two Congresses.  So it is time to lift this cloud which is hanging over the Senate so all the Members of the Senate can understand what the rules are for this Congress because we already made that decision back in January. We await the majority leader finally addressing the matter and making it clear that his word is good.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
