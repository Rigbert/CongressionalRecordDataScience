President, if the minority leader will yield again briefly, as someone who opposes assisted suicide--and I have talked to almost all of our colleagues--I know there is very strong feeling in the Chamber, just as the minority leader has said in his thoughtful statement. There ought to be a way to oppose assisted suicide without setting in place a Federal law enforcement regime that will harm pain management.  I ask the minority leader, as we go forward in this debate, because I intend to talk for a long time about this tomorrow, is it the Senator's desire that at least we could try tomorrow to have a discussion on this extraordinarily important social and ethical question?
