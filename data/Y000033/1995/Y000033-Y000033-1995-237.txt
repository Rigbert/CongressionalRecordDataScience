Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute Offered by Mr.      Young of Alaska: Strike all after the enacting clause and      insert the following:     SECTION 1. EXPORTS OF ALASKAN NORTH SLOPE OIL.       Section 28 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 185) is      amended by amending subsection (s) to read as follows:                  ``exports of alaskan north slope oil       ``(s)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (6) of this      subsection and notwithstanding any other provision of this      Act or any other provision of law (including any regulation)      applicable to the export of oil transported by pipeline over      right-of-way granted pursuant to section 203 of the Trans-     Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1652), such oil      may be exported unless the President finds that exportation      of this oil is not in the national interest. The President      shall make his national interest determination within five      months of the date of enactment of this subsection. In      evaluating whether exports of this oil are in the national      interest, the President shall at a minimum consider--       ``(A) whether exports of this oil would diminish the total      quantity or quality of petroleum available to the United      States;       ``(B) the results of an appropriate environmental review,      including consideration of appropriate measures to mitigate      any potential adverse effects of exports of this oil on the      environment, which shall be completed within four months of      the date of the enactment of this subsection; and       ``(C) whether exports of this oil are likely to cause      sustained material oil supply shortages or sustained oil      prices significantly above world market levels that would      cause sustained material adverse employment effects in the      United States or that would cause substantial harm to      consumers, including noncontiguous States and Pacific      territories.     If the President determines that exports of this oil are in      the national interest, he may impose such terms and      conditions (other than a volume limitation) as are necessary      or appropriate to ensure that such exports are consistent      with the national interest.       ``(2) Except in the case of oil exported to a country with      which the United States entered into a bilateral      international oil supply agreement before November 26, 1979,      or to a country pursuant to the International Emergency Oil      Sharing Plan of the International Energy Agency, any oil      transported by pipeline over right-of-way granted pursuant to      section 203 of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act      (43 U.S.C. 1652) shall, when exported, be transported by a      vessel documented under the laws of the United States and      owned by a citizen of the United States (as determined in      accordance with section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46      U.S.C. App. 802)).       ``(3) Nothing in this subsection shall restrict the      authority of the President under the Constitution, the      International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701      et seq.), or the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et      seq.) to prohibit exports of this oil or under Part B of      title II of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.      6271-76).       ``(4) The Secretary of Commerce shall issue any rules      necessary for implementation of the President's national      interest determination, including any licensing requirements      and conditions, within 30 days of the date of such      determination by the President. The Secretary of Commerce      shall consult with the Secretary of Energy in administering      the provisions of this subsection.       ``(5) If the Secretary of Commerce finds that exporting oil      under authority of this subsection has caused sustained      material oil supply shortages or sustained oil prices      significantly above world market levels and further finds      that these supply shortages or price increases have caused or      are likely to cause sustained material adverse employment      effects in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, in      consultation with the Secretary of Energy, may recommend, and      the President may take, appropriate action concerning exports      of this oil, which may include modifying or revoking      authority to export such oil.       ``(6) Administrative action under this subsection is not      subject to sections 551 and 553 through 559 of this title 5,      United States Code.''.     SEC. 2. GAO REPORT.       (a) Review.--The Comptroller General of the United States      shall conduct a review of energy production in California and      Alaska and the effects of Alaskan North Slope oil exports, if      any, on consumers, independent refiners, and shipbuilding and      ship repair yards on the West Coast and in Hawaii. The      Comptroller General shall commence this review two years      after the date of enactment of this Act and, within six      months after commencing the review, shall provide a report to      the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate      and the Committee on Resources and the Committee on Commerce      of the House of Representatives.       (b) Contents of Report.--The report shall contain a      statement of the principal findings of the review and      recommendations for Congress and the President to address job      loss in the shipbuilding and ship repair industry on the West      Coast, as well as adverse impacts on consumers and refiners      on the West Coast and in Hawaii, that the Comptroller General      attributes to Alaska North Slope oil exports.
