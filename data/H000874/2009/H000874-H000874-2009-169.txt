 My expectation is that it is quite possible that we would take off either a Monday that is now scheduled--or two, or three--or a Friday, one or the other. Given the flow of work, we did a lot of work, worked very hard, and we passed a lot of legislation, but obviously to complete that we need it to come back from the Senate, need to complete conference reports. So to some degree, the flow of work will dictate that schedule; but on the other hand, we want to give all the Members on both sides appropriate notice so they can utilize the time at home to be discussing with their constituents pending legislation, and particularly the health care bill.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Would the gentleman be able to tell early for at least September, knowing the Mondays and Fridays that we may be able to be working at home?
