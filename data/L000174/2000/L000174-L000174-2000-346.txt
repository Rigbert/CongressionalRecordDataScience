President, I am pleased that the sponsors of S.J. Res. 3 have decided to withdraw their proposal to amend the Constitution. One of the reasons they gave for their decision is that the many Senators who came to the floor to oppose their amendment have not, in their view, engaged on the merits of their specific language. Because of this, and because they have vowed to continue in their efforts to amend the Constitution to address victims' rights, I feel obliged to say a few words about some of the most glaring defects of S.J. Res. 3.  One of the most fundamental responsibilities of United States Senators is to make sure that we understand whatwe are enacting into law. That duty is heightened when we are considering a constitutional amendment. Justice John Marshall said that the Supreme Court ``must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.''  We, too, must never forget that it is a constitution--the Constitution of the United States of America--that we are being urged to amend.  I could speak for hours about the defects of this proposed amendment, but I trust that Senators have had an opportunity to consider the minority views in the Committee report that I submitted, along with Senators Kennedy, Kohl, and Feingold.  The minority views run about 40 pages, and identify several specific problems with the drafting of this amendment.  I would also direct Senators to the additional views to the Committee's 1998 report, submitted by our distinguished Chairman. Senator Hatch's views subject this amendment to penetrating criticism. He reiterated such concerns just yesterday in his statement to the Senate in which he indicated the following reservations about the proposed constitutional amendment:       Its scope: the amendment's protections apply only to      violent crimes;       Its vagueness: some of its definitions are unclear and will      be subject to too much judicial discretion; and       Its effects on principles of federalism: the proposed      amendment could pave the way for more federal control over      state legal proceedings.  For the moment, I will just focus on a few fundamental flaws.  Let us start with the first, and most important, seven words of the amendment. The amendment gives rights to ``a victim of a crime of violence.'' Supporters of this amendment have often compared it to the fifth and sixth amendments, which give rights to those accused of crimes. So let us compare them.  The most basic point about any constitutional right is, whose right is it? The fifth and sixth amendments are clear on that point: They give rights to people who have been charged with committing crimes, and we know who those people are. Of course, the other amendments to our present Constitution are no less clear, since they apply without exception to ``the people,'' or to ``citizens of the United States,'' or, in the case of the fourteenth amendment, to ``all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.'' But do we know who would have rights under the proposed victims' rights amendment?  The answer in the text of the amendment is ``a victim of a crime of violence.'' Who is that? Let us make it easy by taking the most obvious crime of violence--murder. Who is the victim of a murder? The last time I prosecuted a murder case, the victim was the dead person. But that answer, what Justice Scalia might call the plain language approach to interpretation, will not do here, unless the purpose of the amendment is to enable the corpse to attend the trial.  So who, if anyone, gets the benefit of the proposed constitutional rights in a murder case? Maybe nobody. Or maybe the reference in section 2 to ``the victim's lawful representative'' refers to the trustee of the victim's estate in a murder case, although I do not see what the trustee of a murder victim's estate would have to contribute to a bail or parole hearing. Or maybe the amendment's supporters are banking on what I believe are called ``activist judges'' to add words to the amendment that are not there and extend rights to a murder victim's family.  This would raise other questions, like what happens when members of the victim's family hold different views about parole, or each wants a share of the mandatory restitution order? Would unmarried couples, be they heterosexual or homosexual, count as families? Would the six-year-old son of a victim be entitled to make arguments in connection with a negotiated guilty plea?  Okay, you may say, so murder is a problem. What about other crimes of violence? Let us take robbery. Let us say there is an armed robbery of a bank. A gun is pointed at a lot of people, tellers and customers. A security guard is shot and injured. The bank loses a lot of money. A pretty simple factual story, and one that I know, from my time as a prosecutor, happens all too often.  Pretend I am the prosecutor in this bank robbery. Tell me who are the victims I have to notify. The security guard? The 20 customers who were uninjured but had a gun pointed at them? The 10 bank tellers? The CEO of the bank? And while you are at it, tell me who gets the mandatory restitution--the bank that lost the money, the security guard who was injured, or the customers and tellers who were scared, or the teams of plaintiffs'--or, I guess, victims'--lawyers who are fighting out these questions.  And who gets to reopen the restitution hearings? Or the bail hearings? Feel free to assume that I am a competent prosecutor who can figure out some administrative details. But, if you are going to pass this amendment, do not pass the buck to me to decide who has constitutional rights and who does not. That is your job if you want to be a Framer of the Constitution; it is not the job of individual courts and prosecutors.  I have talked about two of the most infamous crimes of violence, murder and robbery. Other crimes, such as compound crimes under the federal RICO statute that can include lots of different criminal acts, some violent and some non-violent, over an extended period of years, will involve even harder problems when we try to identify who is and who is not a ``victim of a crime of violence.'' But we should also consider the most common form of violence that afflicts our society, domestic violence.  Here is a typical scenario. The police get a call from neighbors who hear shouting and screaming and pots and pans being thrown. They reach the house and find the husband and wife hysterically angry at one another and a young child cowering in the corner. It is not entirely clear who attacked whom, but the husband is injured and the police arrest the wife and charge her with assault. The wife's bail hearing comes up, or maybe there are plea negotiations. The wife claims it was self-defense; the husband claims she attacked him without provocation.  The wife claims she is a victim of a crime of domestic violence; so does the husband. Maybe the child is too. The proposed amendment leaves us with no clue whether a witness to violence who is psychologically but not physically injured by the violence has the new constitutional status of ``victim''.  Under current law, it is up to the jury to determine who is the victim and who is the criminal in this sad domestic scenario, and the jury makes that determination after hearing all the evidence from both sides at trial. Under the proposed amendment, that determination must be made before the wife's bail hearing or plea negotiation. If the husband can persuade the prosecutor that he is the victim, and not the instigator of the violence, he gets the special new constitutional rights of a crime victim at the bail and plea bargaining stage, before the wife has even had a chance to present her evidence to the jury that the husband is really the guilty party.  Or maybe the wife can insist on extra-judicial proceedings to contest the husband's status as a victim--although I do not know how you would squeeze in extra proceedings before bail or indictment hearings.  Assuming that the husband is the ``victim'' for purposes of our new constitutional amendment, what does that get him? Maybe he will push for bail or for a plea with a minimum sentence conditioned on his getting custody of the child, perhaps accompanied by a new kind of child support called ``restitution.''  Or maybe the husband will be satisfied with his new constitutional right to notice of his wife's release from custody, which will help him track her down and exact revenge.  In some cases, the right end result may be reached. But the process that the proposed amendment seem to involve bypassing a trial on the merits and potentially bypassing family court. By creating pre-trial rights for an undefined category of victims, it requires someone--I guess the prosecutor--to decide who is the victim of a given crime, and who gets special constitutional rights before there has been a trial or even an indictment.  Deciding who has constitutional rights and who does not before there has been even an ex parte judicial proceeding is un-American. Doing so in acase, like a domestic violence case, where there are likely to be self-defense issues, risks giving special constitutional rights to the criminal instead of the victim.  One more comment on this half-baked, undefined term ``victim of a crime of violence.'' Thus far, I have discussed the easy cases in terms of what constitutes a ``crime of violence''--murder, robbery, and assault. But there are a lot of hard cases, too.  Is drunk driving a crime of violence if the driver physically injures a pedestrian? What if the driver runs over the pedestrian's dog, or crashes into a parked car? Can the same offense be a crime of violence if someone is physically injured, but not otherwise?  What about elder abuse or child abuse? We have all heard heart-breaking stories of seniors and disabled people who have suffered horrible abuse and neglect at the hands of their so-called care-givers, and of children locked up in squalid conditions and subjected to appalling psychological abuse by their parents.  Neglect of the weak and vulnerable in our society by those who have taken the responsibility of being their care-givers can cause as much harm as almost any violence, without a hand ever being lifted against them. But are neglect and non-physical abuse ``violence''? What about the horrifying slavery case involving more than 50 Mexican immigrants in New York a few years ago? Is enslavement a crime of violence? And what about kidnapping? If a parent who has been denied legal custody of a child kidnaps the child, is that a crime of violence, and if so, who is the victim, the child, the custodial parent or both?  The words of the proposed amendment do not answer these questions. The majority report suggests answers, some of which seem to stretch the concept of a ``crime of violence'' to the breaking point. It suggests, for example, as possible crimes of violence burglary, driving while intoxicated, espionage, stalking, and the unlawful displaying of a firearm--very serious crimes, but crimes that usually do not involve ``violence'' in the normal sense of the word.  Last year, Senator Hatch criticized the proposed amendment's reliance on the term ``crime of violence'' as ``arbitrary.'' I can do no better than to quote his language:       I believe we must tread carefully when assigning      constitutional rights on the arbitrary basis of whether the      legislature has classified a particular crime as ``violent''      or ``non-violent.'' Consider, for example, the relative      losses of two victims. First, consider the plight of an      elderly woman who is victimized by a fraudulent investment      scheme and loses her life's savings. Second, think of a      college student who happens to take a punch during a bar      fight which leaves him with a black eye for a couple of days.      I do not believe it to be clear that one of these victims is      more deserving of constitutional protection than the other.      While such distinctions are commonly made in criminal      statutes, the implications for placing such a disparity into      the text of the Constitution are far greater.  It is interesting to note that in their additional views in this year's Committee report, Senators Kyl and Feinstein do not in any way disagree that the scope of their proposed amendment is arbitrary. Instead, they explain it as a political compromise.  I do not recall Madison and Jefferson saying at the constitutional convention that the provisions they drafted were not great, but politics are politics and you should not expect too much. I believe that we owe the American people something more than arbitrary political compromises when we amend their Constitution.  For anyone who shares Senator Hatch's and my concerns about the arbitrariness of focusing on ``crimes of violence,'' there is, by the way, a solution at hand. Vote against the proposed constitutional amendment and, instead, pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act, which provides strong and effective rights for all crime victims.  I have said a lot about the first, and most important, seven words of the proposed amendment; and I could identify many more problems. But let us sum up where we are so far. We are not sure whether the amendment applies at all to the most obvious ``crime of violence,'' murder, and we have no idea who gets the new constitutional rights for ``victims'' in a murder case if it does. In other fairly common crimes of violence such as robbery, the amendment appears to apply, but even assuming clear and simple facts, we are not sure which type of person affected by the crime gets to exercise the ``victim's'' rights, and the answer may well be a large number of people affected in vastly different ways--some physically, some emotionally, and some financially--who have vastly different views and interests. In what is probably the most common violent crime scenario, domestic violence, the amendment appears to require the prosecutor to decide who is the criminal and who is the victim as a constitutional matter, without the benefit of evidence at trial and without participation of judge or jury. And then we have what perhaps we should call ``borderline crimes,'' a wide range of crimes that may or may not be classified as crimes of violence.  On the ``of violence'' issue, Senator Hatch has raised troubling concerns that it is arbitrary as a matter of principle. I agree, and add the further concern that it is yet another huge point of uncertainty as to the meaning of this amendment. On this and other points, the answer of the amendment's supporters appears to be ``don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.''  ``Don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.'' I think we can all agree that is not a principle that Congress should ever follow, especially not in the context of a constitutional amendment. Supporters of the amendment will no doubt contend that it is an unfair characterization of their position. Well, let us see what their amendment says.  The amendment seems quite candid in admitting that its central terms are yet to be defined. Section 1 says that the new constitutional rights created by the amendment go to ``A victim of a crime of violence, as these terms may be defined by law.'' I take it that ``these terms'' mean the two terms that we have identified as hopelessly vague: (1) ``victim'' and (2) ``crime of violence.''  The phrase ``as these terms may be defined by law'' is a new one for the United States Constitution. There is a reason for this. Our Constitution was conceived as, and is, ``the supreme Law of the Land.''  As Chief Justice John Marshall explained in Marbury versus Madison in 1803, our Constitution, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, is the law by which our other laws, State and Federal, are to be judged; it is not whatever our other laws, enacted by shifting political majorities from time to time, say it is.  Take, for example, the fourteenth amendment guarantee of equal protection of the laws. That does not mean equal protection ``as defined by law.'' If it did, the legislature and Governor of Arkansas might have been entitled to do what they did in 1957, when they ``defined'' the equal protection rights of public school students to be rights to a ``separate but equal,'' racially segregated education. But our Constitution has never worked that way, and in 1958, in Cooper versus Aaron, the Supreme Court rightly ruled that Arkansas' attempt to redefine the fourteenth amendment was unconstitutional, and desegregated Arkansas' schools.  Our Constitution has a provision, and a process, for defining new constitutional rights or for redefining existing constitutional rights. That provision, the amendment provision, is in Article V. Article V provides for two-thirds of the members of both Houses of Congress, plus three-fourths of the State legislatures, to amend the Constitution when ``necessary''. It does not provide for us to pass the buck to bare majorities in State legislatures or in a future Congress to define or redefine constitutional rights as we go along.  As a matter of principle, therefore, I believe that an ``as may be defined by law'' provision is an abdication of our duty, sitting as we do today as constitutional Framers, to provide clear constitutional standards against which other laws may be judged. In a constitutional democracy, the rule of law means that constitutional rights are to be found in the Constitution, not in ordinary statutes passed from time to time.  If we are going to pass the buck, we should at least be clear about who we are passing it to. Who gets to write the ``law'' that ``define[s]'' the critical terms of this constitutional amendment? This is yet another basic question that the amendment itself doesnot answer. So I have studied the Committee report for an answer.  In a statement that must be profoundly troubling to those Senators who complain regularly about ``activist judges'' making law, the report first says that ``[t]he `law' which will define a `victim' (as well as `crime of violence') will come from the courts interpreting the elements of criminal statutes until definitional statutes are passed explicating the term.'' This, I suppose, is the ``don't worry, the courts will figure it out'' theory. Anyone who subscribes to this theory should be prepared to confirm the most activist judges this country has ever seen, because that is certainly the vaguest, blankest check that has ever been written to the judiciary.  The Committee report ``anticipates'' that judicial law-making under this constitutional amendment may be short-lived--that Congress and the State legislatures would quickly step in and enact ``definitional laws'' for purposes of their own criminal systems.  It is worth pausing for a moment to consider what this means. One of the main arguments that we have heard in support of this amendment is that we need to eliminate the current ``patchwork'' of victims' rights.  We are told we need this amendment because even though all 50 States provide rights for victims, the rights vary from State to State. A constitutional amendment that may be defined differently from State to State would not correct this situation --it would simply replace one patchwork with another. The superficially simple concept of basic baseline rights for victims will fracture into more than 50 different schemes of rights. I do not think that there is anything wrong with such diversity; indeed, I believe that the present system of defining crimes and the rights of crime victims and enforcing criminal justice primarily at the State level has served this country well throughout our history. But I do object to a shell game that dresses up rights defined by State law as Federal constitutional rights, thus trivializing the United States Constitution and casting doubt on the rights that it currently protects.  Finally, I should note that the ``as these terms may be defined by law'' provision is not the only delegation in this proposed amendment. Section 3 provides that ``The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'' In their additional views, Senators Kyl and Feinstein note that they originally proposed to give enforcement power to the States as well as to Congress, but then reached another of this amendment's political compromises.  I am, however, mystified as to what function the section 3 enforcement power could possibly serve. Similar provisions are contained in the fourteenth amendment and in the various amendments that protect voting rights. In the fourteenth and voting rights amendments, the Federal enforcement power against the States was justified by the long history of resistance of certain States to the Federal constitutional mandates for equal protection of law and equal voting rights. But there is no such history of State abuses with respect to victims' rights. In fact, many States provide more protections for crime victims than Federal law provides.  The majority report alleges no conflict between States and the Federal Government that would necessitate a Federal enforcement power. Rather, the reason given by the amendment's principal sponsors for putting victims' right in the Federal Constitution at all is that the States supposedly need Federal help to protect them effectively. They claim that:       States have had difficulty extending rights to victims of      crime through State statutes and constitutional amendments      precisely because courts are used to considering, first and      foremost, Federal constitutional rights. By extending Federal      rights to victims throughout the States, it will then become      easier for State criminal justice systems to protect the      rights of victims.  I frankly do not understand this explanation. If you want to empower State courts to take State statutes and constitutional amendments seriously, the last thing you do, I would think, is impose a complex new Federal mandate on them. If you want to help willing States protect victims, the last thing you do, I would think, is to place their criminal justice systems under congressional supervision and subject them to Federal enforcement through the Federal courts.  We are left, therefore, with an enforcement provision that mimics other amendments, but without any suggestion of the need to coerce recalcitrant States that justified such provisions elsewhere. Coercing the States here because we have done it before in other contexts is harmful to State sovereignty. And empowering Congress to enforce against the States constitutional rights which it is up to the States to define is likely to be futile. If the goal is, as asserted, to help the States protect victims' rights, we should not be piling new constitutional duties on the States; we should be providing assistance. Instead of threatening them with the stick of federal enforcement, I believe that we should offer the States the carrot of funding for the protection of victims' rights. If you agree with me, you should reject this amendment and, instead, support the Crime Victims Assistance Act.  Senators Kyl and Feinstein urge us not to make perfect the enemy of the good. If this amendment responded to an urgent need that could not be met by statute, and if it were well-drafted but imperfect, I would give that argument serious consideration. I have explained before why I believe the goals of this amendment are not merely adequately served, but better served, by statute. But I want to highlight briefly the other problem with this amendment. Not only is it not perfect; it is not well-drafted. In fact, it is remarkably sloppy.  I have just discussed the two major problems with the text of the amendment. Section 1 creates a complex scheme of new federal constitutional rights without saying with any clarity who is entitled to those rights, then says ``don't worry; someone, somewhere, in a court or in Congress or in the States, will make a law that will identify who gets these rights.'' Section 3 then empowers Congress to enforce those rights on behalf of these yet-to-be-identified people against the States, not because the States are unwilling to recognize those rights, but because Congress has been empowered to enforce other constitutional rights in the past, so ``why not here.''  I do not want to skip section 2. Let me read you a sentence:       Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or      continue any trial, reopen any proceeding or invalidate any      ruling, except with respect to conditional release or      restitution or to provide rights guaranteed by this article      in future proceedings, without staying or continuing a trial.  Let us call that ``the tax lawyer's provision,'' since it is so obscure that I think only someone who has spent half their life plumbing the depths of the tax code could understand it. It would certainly be the first triple negative in the United States Constitution. I think that ``Nothing in this article shall provide grounds to stay or continue any trial'' should be a sentence on its own, since I do not think that this rule ends up being subject to the exception, in light of the exception to the exception, but frankly I am not sure.  I am also puzzled by the exception that appears to allow victims to reopen proceedings or invalidate rulings ``to provide rights guaranteed by this article in future proceedings.'' If the concern is with future proceedings, I see no need for the exception to allow the reopening of present proceedings. But maybe I missed a turn somewhere in the drafters' maze.  Regardless of how it is ultimately interpreted, this intricate web of exceptions is not the stuff of a Constitution. One of the great virtues of our Constitution is that it speaks with a clear voice, articulating principles of justice that ordinary Americans can understand. The proposed amendment fails to meet that standard.  Finally, let me say a few words about section 5, which states that the new constitutional rights for victims shall apply ``in Federal and State proceedings, including military proceedings to the extent that the Congress may provide by law, juvenile justice proceedings, and proceedings in the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.'' This section is truly an enigma. No provision of the current Federal Constitution goes into detail about its geographic scope. There is a reason for that.  The purpose of the Bill of Rights, as envisioned by the Framers, was to provide a fundamental uniform platform of rights enjoyed by all people throughout the United States. Of course every provision of the Constitution applies throughout the United States. The fact that the drafters of this amendment felt the need to state that here suggests a fundamental confusion about the nature of the Federal Constitution, which is, by definition, the supreme law of the land. It was, perhaps, that same confusion that led them to provide for the key phrase of this federal constitutional amendment, ``a victim of a crime of violence,'' to be defined by a patchwork of State and Federal statutes.  A degree of uncertainty at the margins on questions of law and fact may be inevitable in legislation. But, despite the fact that it would be one of the longest-ever amendment to the Constitution, the half-baked proposal before the Senate is hopelessly vague on the basics. I do not know from looking at this amendment and listening to its supporters when it applies and who it applies to, or how that will be figured out.  Senator Hatch has made many of the same points about this proposed constitutional amendment. At our last Committee markup in September 1999, however, the distinguished Senator from Utah said that he intended to vote for this amendment, even though he has ``real questions'' about it, ``because of the hard work that has been put into it.'' I cannot go along with that reasoning. I commend the efforts of those who have worked on this amendment, as I commend the efforts of Federal and State legislators across the country who have worked to provide rights for victims of crime.  But ``A'' for effort is not good enough if it means subjecting the American people to a ``C''-grade Constitution.  As a Senator, I believe I have a constitutional duty not to inflict on the American people and our busy courts a new constitutional provision when I and they have no idea what it means in the most obvious type of case to which it theoretically might apply. And I have a constitutional duty as a Senator not to pass the buck to the courts by saying, ``Here's a new constitutional provision that no one understands. Go make something up.''  When Madison, Jefferson and their compatriots wrote the original Constitution, they did not settle for ``don't worry, someone else will figure this out later.'' Nor should we.  I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record, a letter to me from the NAACP dated April 10, 2000, opposing the proposed constitutional amendment, and a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle dated April 19, 2000, from over 300 law professors opposing the proposed amendment as unnecessary and dangerous.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Washington Bureau--National Association for the            Advancement of Colored People,                                   Washington, DC, April 10, 2000.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Since this nation was first founded,      Americans of color have been the victims of all types of      crimes--both violent and non-violent--in disproportionately      high numbers. It is for this reason that the National      Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has      always had a keen interest in seeing that crime victims are      treated honorably, fairly and compassionately by the American      judicial system, and that in the end they feel that justice      has been served.       Yet people of color have also historically been wrongly      accused in this nation of crimes varying from the very minor      to the most heinous. It is for this reason that the NAACP has      also been a strong and steadfast supporter of the      Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the concept of due      process in the American judicial system. It is our deeply      held belief in the need to protect the innocent and allow      every American the right to a fair trial that leads us to      oppose S.J. Res. 3, the proposed constitutional amendment to      protect the rights of victims of crimes.       While we are very sympathetic to the rights and the needs      of crime victims throughout this nation, and while we agree      that victims are often not treated as compassionately as they      should be by the judicial system, the NAACP does not believe      that S.J. Res. 3 is the answer. Rather than expend the time      and energy necessary for the enactment of an amendment to the      Constitution, the NAACP urges you to work together and with      state legislatures to develop comprehensive packages of laws      that address the specific and diverse needs of crime victims.      The statutory route is preferable as it is easier to update      laws and to fit them to the changing yet very specific needs      of victims, and laws, as opposed to a broadly worded      constitutional amendment which is less likely to have long-     lasting negative repercussions on the rights of the accused.       The NAACP appreciates and commends the attempts of the      members of the Senate to improve the way in which the      American judicial system treats crime victims, and we agree      that we can and should do more to see that victims feel safe      and have closure after their ordeal. We support efforts to      pass laws that help victims of crimes, and we would like to      work with you to develop a more narrowly tailored and      effective package. Yet we cannot support S.J. Res. 3 for, as      well meaning as it is, we have grave concerns that the      negative effects this amendment would have on the rights of      the accused seeking a fair and impartial trial would outweigh      the benefits it bestows upon victims.       Thank you in advance for your attention to the concerns of      the NAACP. If you have any questions or comments, I hope that      you will feel free to contact me at (202) 638-2269. I look      forward to working with you on this serious and important      issue.           Sincerely,                                                Hilary O. Shelton,     Director.                                  ____                                                   April 19, 2000.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Senate Minority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: We are law professors and      practitioners who oppose adding a ``Victims' Rights      Amendment'' to the Constitution (S.J. Res. 3). Although we      commend and share the desire to help crime victims, amending      the Constitution to do so is both unnecessary and dangerous.      Indeed, ultimately the amendment is likely to be counter-     productive in that it could hinder effective prosecution and      put an enormous burden on state and federal law enforcement      agencies.       The Constitution has been amended only 17 times since      ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791. Amendments should      be added to our basic charter of government only when there      is a pressing need that cannot be addressed in any other way.      No such necessity exists in order to protect the rights of      crime victims. Virtually every right contained in the      proposed Victims' Rights Amendment can be safeguarded by      statute.       Thirty-three states have passed constitutional amendments      and every state has either a state constitutional amendment      or statute that protects victims' rights. Many of the rights      offered by the VRA are already protected by these laws. For      example, restitution for crime victims is required in federal      court by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of      1996 and in every state by statute or constitutional      amendment. Similarly, the right of victims to attend      proceedings can be protected by statute as shown by laws that      exist in many states and by the recent federal legislation      that mandates that victims be allowed to attend even if they      will be testifying during the sentencing phase of the      proceedings. Victim impact statements are now a routine part      of sentencing proceedings at both the federal and state      levels. There is every reason to believe that the legislative      process will continue to be responsive to protecting crime      victims so that there is simply no need to amend the      Constitution to accomplish this.       Not only is the VRA unnecessary, there are grave dangers in      amending the Constitution. The framers were aware of the      enormous power of the government to deprive a person of life,      liberty and property in criminal prosecutions. The      constitutional protections accorded criminal defendants are      among the most precious and essential liberties provided in      the Constitution. The VRA will undermine these basic      safeguards. For example, the proposed Amendment would give a      crime victim the right ``[t]o a final disposition of the      proceedings relating to the crime free from unreasonable      delay.'' Any victim of a violent crime has standing under      the Amendment to intervene and assert a constitutional      right for a faster disposition of the matter. This could      be used to deny defendants needed time to gather and      present evidence essential to prepare their defense,      resulting in innocent people being convicted. It could      also be used to force prosecutors to trial before they are      ready, leading to guilty people going free.       Section three of the proposed Amendment authorizes Congress      to enact legislation to enforce the Amendment. This authority      could be used to negate the rights of criminal defendants in      an effort to protect crime victims. Courts would then face      the enormously difficult task of determining the extent to      which legislation to implement the new Amendment can      undermine the rights of those accused of crimes.       Moreover, the Amendment is likely to be counter-productive      because it could hamper effective prosecutions and cripple      law enforcement by placing enormous new burdens on state and      federal law enforcement agencies. Prosecutions could be      hindered by the creation of an absolute right for crime      victims to attend and participate in criminal     proceedings. In many instances, the testimony of a      prosecutorial witness will be compromised if the person has      heard the testimony of other witnesses. Yet, the proposed      Amendment creates a constitutional right for a victim to be      present at criminal proceedings even over defense or      prosecution objections.       Prosecutorial efforts could also be hampered by the ability      of crime victims to ``submit a written statement . . . to      determine . . . an acceptance of a negotiated plea or      sentence.'' It is unclear how much weight judges will be      required to give to a crime victim's objection to a plea      bargain. Over 90 percent of all criminal cases do not go to      trial but are resolved through negotiation. Even a small      increase in the number of cases going to trial would unduly      burden prosecutors' offices. There are many reasons why      prosecutors enter into plea agreements such as allocating      scarce prosecutorial resources, concerns about weaknesses in      the evidence, or strategic choices to gain the cooperation of      one defendant to enhance the likelihood of convicting others.      Prosecutorial discretion would be seriously compromised if      crime victims could effectively obstruct plea agreements or      require prosecutors to disclose weaknesses in their case in      order to persuade a court to accept a plea.       The Amendment would impose tremendous financial costs on      state and federal law enforcement agencies. These departments      would be constitutionally required to make reasonable efforts      to find and notify crime victims every time a case went to      trial, every time a criminal case was resolved, and every      time a prisoner was released from custody. Additionally, the      Amendment can be interpreted as creating a duty for the      government to provide attorneys for crime victims. The term      ``victim's representative'' in section two might well be seen      as creating a right to counsel in order to adequately protect      these newly created rights. Criminal defendants do not      receive adequate counsel in many cases. Adding the financial      burden of providing counsel to victims will likely further      limit defendants' access to counsel.       Protecting crime victims by federal and state statutes      provides flexibility that is absent in a federal      constitutional amendment. Moreover, amending the Constitution      in this way changes basic principles that have been followed      throughout American history. Principles of federalism always      have allowed states to decide the nature of the protection of      victims in state courts. The ability of states to decide for      themselves is denied by this Amendment. Also, no longer would      protecting the rights of a person accused of crime be a      preeminent focus of a criminal trial.       Crime victims deserve protection, but that must not be      accomplished at the expense of the rights of the accused. As      law professors and practitioners we urge the rejection of the      proposed Victim's Rights Amendment as unnecessary and      dangerous.
