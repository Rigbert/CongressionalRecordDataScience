We are close, I believe, to working out an agreement for a vote on an amendment that was offered by Senator Paul earlier. It has to do with extending to executive branch officials the same kind of reporting requirement to ban insider trading that would apply to Members of Congress and their staffs. It is an amendment that enjoys the support of both managers and the principal authors of this bill.  We are trying to make sure, however, that we narrow the amendment so that it applies to top-level Federal employees and not to low-level Federal employees, who have no policy responsibilities. So we were looking at limiting it to Senate-confirmed positions. The problem with that is it brings in all of the military appointments that are Senate confirmed, so we want to make sure we exclude those individuals who are clearly not the target of the amendment.  We continue to work--the managers, the sponsors of the bill, and the sponsor of the amendment, Senator Paul--in order to refine his amendment. It is still our hope that we can reach that compromise and have a rollcall vote tonight. We will keep our colleagues informed about whether it will be possible to complete the drafting that would be needed to modify his amendment.                           Amendment No. 1490  In the meantime, I want to talk very briefly about an amendment Senator Paul filed, his amendment No. 1490. This is an amendment that would require former Members of Congress to forfeit their Federal retirement benefits if they work as a lobbyist or even engage in any lobbying activity--regardless, I might say, of whether they served 40 years in this body.  I also note that the language in this amendment is extraordinarily broad. For example, the definition of remuneration includes salaries, any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary, such as consulting fees, honoraria, and paid authorship. Think about that. As I read the language, a former Member of Congress who writes a book would be in danger of forfeiting his or her pension. In other words, this is going to apply to authors. It mentions honoraria, so if a former Member of Congress gives a speech and receives $1,000 for giving that speech, that former Member is going to forfeit his or her pension--earned pension?  I don't even know that this would pass constitutional muster. But there is certainly a fairness issue, it seems to me. I don't know if the intent of the Senator from Kentucky was to draft this as broadly as he did to include and define as remuneration paid authorship. In other words, if you wrote a book--and it would not even have to be a book; what if you wrote a newspaper article or an op-ed for the Washington Post and received $250 for that? Do you forfeit the Federal pension? What if you worked in the private sector for a number of years, worked in State government for a number of years, and then worked for a few years serving the people of this country in Congress? Would you then forfeit your pension if you provided some lobbying activities? If you wrote a book? If you gave a speech for money? This is extraordinarily broad.  I see the Senate majority leader is on the floor, so I will stop discussing this amendment. I did want our colleagues to actually read the text of this amendment before we ever vote on it.  It defines remuneration not just as salary or payment for services not otherwise identified as salary, but consulting fees, honoraria, and paid authorship. In other words, if after being in Congress you wrote a book or you wrote an op-ed for which you were paid, you forfeit your Federal pension because you did some lobbying activities? This strikes me as a very sweeping amendment that does not belong on this bill.
