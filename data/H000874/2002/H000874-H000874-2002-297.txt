Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) may control 5 minutes of the time allocated to me, and that he may yield such time as he determines.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Thornberry). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Maryland?  There was no objection.
