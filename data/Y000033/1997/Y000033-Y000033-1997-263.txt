Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing--along with our colleagues John Tanner, Cliff Stearns, John Dingell, and Curt Weldon--a new and improved Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act.  This legislation is a revised version of H.R. 741, which I introduced on February 12, 1997. It is the product of many months of extended discussions with a number of conservation and hunting groups.  This new legislation addresses concerns raised by the Clinton administration and other witnesses during the May 15 subcommittee hearing. For instance, the original bill codified the various prohibitions on the manner and methods of taking migratory birds that had been embodied in regulations over the years. During our hearing, both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Wildlife Federation testified that this provision would restrict the Service's ability to respond to changing conservation and management needs. The Service is now grappling with a huge population explosion of snow geese and their permanent destruction of thousands of acres of Arctic tundra. In the next few months, the Service may recommend ways to stop this destruction, and has indicated that it is considering the use of electronic calls, unplugged shotguns, and intentional baiting. Since it was not my intention to deny the Service the flexibility to respond to this type of emergency, I have deleted the codification of existing regulations from this revised bill.  Second, I have modified my solution to the problems caused by strict liability in baiting cases by establishing a knows or reasonably should have known standard that is reflected in the 1978 Federal District Court decision known as the Delahoussaye case.  Under current law, if you are hunting over a baited field, whether you know it or not, you are guilty. There is no defense and there is no opportunity to present evidence in your case. It does not matter whether there was a ton of grain or a few kernels, whether this feed served as an attraction to migratory birds, or even how far the bait is from the hunting site.  This interpretation--if you were there, you are guilty--is fundamentally wrong. It violates one of our most basic constitutional protections that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  The language in the bill is identical to the Delahoussaye case, it has been effectively utilized throughout the fifth circuit, it has not imperiled any migratory bird populations, and it has resulted in numerous baiting convictions. A representative of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service indicated earlier this year that the Service could support the statutory codification of the Delahoussaye decision.  This is not a radical proposal. Nevertheless, there will be a few Fish and Wildlife Service law enforcement agents who will oppose the elimination of strict liability. They will oppose it because currently there is nearly a 100-percent conviction rate in baiting cases since there is not an opportunity for the defendant to provide any evidence to oppose the charge. There is no need to provide intent or knowledge. If the bait is present and the hunter is there, guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt.  In addition, those who oppose the changes will suggest that the Fish and Wildlife Service will be unable to prosecute individuals for hunting over bait in the future, an assertion that is simply not true. If a preponderance of evidence so demonstrates, the defendant will be found guilty. This standard is far less stringent than beyond a reasonable doubt applied in all other criminal cases. Further, the Service has never challenged or attempted to overturn the Delahoussaye decision during the past 20 years.  Moreover, it shouldn't matter whether there are only a handful or hundreds of people who have been prosecuted for unknowingly hunting over a baited field. Frankly, I was angry when I heard the testimony of a retired Fish and Wildlife Service agent who responded to this question from the subcommittee chairman: ``Have I ever charged someone for hunting over bait and I truly believed they didn't know the area was baited? Yes, but they were very few and far between.'' Since this agent had the option of just issuing a warning to these individuals, I am aghast that he chose to cite them anyway.  Third, our bill includes a number of refinements and modifications dealing with soil stabilization practices, accepted agricultural operations and procedures, and the alteration of a crop or other feed for wildlife managementpurposes. In addition, the bill stipulates that the State fish and wildlife agencies will decide, in consultation with USDA State research, education, and extension services and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, what type of agricultural methods are accepted in a particular areaa. For instance, it may be appropriate to sow winter wheat for soil stabilization purposes in Maryland, but no one would suggest such a practice in Arizona. These recommendations, which are contained in section 3 of the bill, are the product of many months of careful deliberation by the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies' Ad Hoc Committee on Baiting. This committee has representatives from each of the migratory flyways, Ducks Unlimited, the National Wildlife Federation, and the North American Wildlife Enforcement Officers Association.  Finally, the revised bill deletes the section of H.R. 741 that would have required that all fines and penalties collected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act be deposited into the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. I have been persuaded to allow these moneys to remain in the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund so that they can be used to buy essential wetlands habitat in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It has been demonstrated to me that each dollar paid into this fund is matched with at least $3 of private donations.  In the past few weeks, I have shared copies of this legislation with a number of hunting and conservation groups. I am pleased to report that Ducks Unlimited, the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, the International Foundation for the Conservation of Natural Resources, the Izaak Walton League, the National Rifle Association, Safari Club International, the Wildlife Legislative Fund of America, and the Wildlife Management Institute all have indicated they support the fundamental objectives of this legislation. While several groups have indicated they would prefer that baiting problems be alleviated through a regulatory solution, there was a consensus that the Delahoussaye decision should be codified in law. I am hopeful that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will issue new proposed baiting regulations before the end of this year. Otherwise, I will vigorously pursue the passage of this bill.  Mr. Speaker, the fundamental purpose of this legislation is to provide clear guidance to hunters, landowners, law of enforcement officials, wildlife managers, and courts on what the restrictions are on the taking of migratory birds. This proposed legislation will not weaken the restrictions on the method and manner of taking migratory birds, nor will it weaken the protection of the resource. It will, however, allow individuals to have their day in court. It is patently wrong to convict hunters who do not know that a field or water is baited, for a few kernels of corn in a sunflower field, bait that is over a mile from the hunting site, or some grain found on the bottom of a pond or river.  I want to again thank my distinguished colleagues for joining with me in this effort, and I urge a careful review of the new Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act. It is a long overdue solution to a problem that regrettably continues to unfairly penalize law-abiding hunters in this country.                          ____________________
