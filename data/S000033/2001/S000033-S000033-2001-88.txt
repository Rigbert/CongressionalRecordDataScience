 Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, we have heard a lot from the other side of the aisle about the FDA is the gold standard. It is fool's gold. Guess what? U.S. drugs are manufactured mostly in Puerto Rico with major components imported from China and India with no mandatory testing. None.  This bill would impose mandatory testing, a whole new regime. The EU has been doing this for 25 years. What is the result, counterfeit drugs and people dying? No. The result is drugs are much cheaper in the European Union; and in Britain they are on average 36 percent cheaper, and there has not been a single incidence of all of these chimaeras that are raised.  What really happened was the pharmaceutical industry was caught napping last year. The seniors that I have seen divide their pills in half, against doctor's orders, and I have seen spouses that have to choose, one gets drugs and the other does not. We are doing nothing about that. We are supporting the profits of this industry. If the other side reverses their vote from last year,they will be held accountable by the tens of millions of Americans who cannot afford their pharmaceutical drugs. This is not about safety, it is about affordability, and it is about lives.
