Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Republicans launched a new ad campaign accusing the Democrats of dipping into the Social Security surplus.  In these ads, Republicans vowed to draw a line in the sand. It is time for the Republicans to get their heads out of the sand. Their own spending plan for next year takes $18 billion out of the Social Security surplus. Instead of running attack ads, it is time we start working together to pass a budget that addresses the needs of the American people.  The American people, working families, seniors, and children, are waiting for this Congress to stand up and do something. The truth will set us free. The truth will liberate us all. It is time for us all to put our cards on the table. It is time for the Republicans to tell the truth. Speak the truth to the American people. That is what the American people deserve. That is what they need and that is what they want.                          ____________________
