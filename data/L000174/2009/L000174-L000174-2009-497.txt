630 would require the Secretary of State to report on whether additional foreign military financing assistance provided for Egypt could be used to improve Egypt's efforts to counter illegal smuggling and intercept weapons into Gaza.  We all want Egypt to intercept those weapons. So on the face of it, it appears this amendment is very appealing. But I note for my friend from Arizona that the omnibus bill already explicitly authorizes the use of FMF assistance provided to Egypt ``for border security programs and activities in the Sinai.''  That was language put in by the distinguished ranking Republican member on the Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gregg, precisely for the purpose of the Kyl amendment--to enable those funds to be used to help police the border and reduce the smuggling into Gaza.  Now, I understand there is a concern about adding amendments to this bill and sending it back to the other body. All this does, if passed, is send the bill back to the other body because what the Senator from Arizona is asking for is already in the bill. Egypt is already cooperating with Israel and the United States to reduce smuggling of weapons into Gaza. We need Egypt's continued help.
