Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the time. I too rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary, the great vision of President and General Dwight David Eisenhower, in terms of the national highway system.  Fifty years. It is a long time. And now we need to look forward to the next half of the first century of the national highway system, and that is going to constitute quite a challenge. We, just after some lengthy struggle, finally reauthorized the highway program with SAFETEA-LU last summer.  But what we see looming before us is a system that is starting to show its age. The cracked bridge problem in Oregon, failing bridges that were constructed actually with 1950s technology, just before we moved to prestressed concrete, the cast-in-place bridges, and other places around the country. The system is showing its age, the wear and tear, it is showing in places that it is not up to the task of current traffic volumes, and we need to look to the future of this great artery of commerce and transportation and recreation transport for Americans, daily commutes to work, to long trips to far-away places within this wonderful country.  And that is a challenge that the chairman of the committee has begun to address with hearings to look at what the future sources of funding will be to meet even greater demands than the initial construction of this system.  So I rise today both to commemorate the 50th anniversary and the visionaries who gave us this great system, and to join with my colleagues here who I know will be part of the solution about how it is going to be celebrated yet another 50 years from today as still an essential artery for commerce and transportation in the United States, because visionaries in this and some near subsequent Congresses recognized the need to continue to invest, reinvest and enhance the system.
