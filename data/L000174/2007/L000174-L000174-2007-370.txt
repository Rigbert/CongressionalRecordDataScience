President, I thank the Presiding Officer. I want the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia to know that, of course, I will be supporting his nominee, Judge O'Grady. This is an example of how quickly we can move judges when Senators work together. In this case, one of the most distinguished Republican Senators,combined with a distinguished Democratic Member, helped move Judge O'Grady to the top of the list. I predict within the next hour or so he will be confirmed.
