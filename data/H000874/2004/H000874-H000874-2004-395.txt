Can the leader tell me whether or not there is an expectation that this will be, as we have had in the past, a 6-year reauthorization, or is it possible that there would be a shorter reauthorization, say, of 2 years, obviously focused on trying to build jobs and create jobs in the country?  Mr. DeLAY. It is a jobs bill, a very important jobs bill to all of us here in the House. We want to do what we can to create these jobs and get them going as fast as possible. To answer the gentleman's question about whether it is a 2-year bill, a 6-year bill, what is the amount here or there, I am not advised, quite frankly. There are discussions about all of that. I do not think any decision has been made along those lines. The gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) are still discussing that, but I am sure they soon will come to some sort of understanding as to how we will proceed.
