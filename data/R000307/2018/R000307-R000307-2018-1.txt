 That would be a Christmas present for not only you but for anybody who has heard the circumstances.  I, too, remember having the privilege of being in public service with President Reagan. He had a human quality that was second to none.  I thank you, Bill, for your service--we used to be on Armed Services together, fighting the battles--but more especially for being a friend. You always had a smile on your face. I probably didn't when we got on the elevators together.  You would say: Pat, what is wrong?  I wouldn't want to go into anything, but I would think, why am I so glum if Bill Nelson is stuck on ``happy'' all the time?  It was the Florida sunshine, I guess.  I thank you for the privilege of being in public service with you, sir. Best wishes for your future, which I know will be very good and very bright, and thank you for that story, which is a great Christmas story. Repeat it often, sir. Thank you.                          ____________________
