 Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the American Homemakers/Caregivers and Middle-Class Flexible Savings Act of 1995. This bill is being introduced by my colleague, Maurice Hinchey, on behalf of the Progressive Caucus as part of our 11-point alternative to the Republican Contract With America.  My constituents have impressed upon me the growing financial plight of many middle- and low-income working Americans. They are working harder and longer and finding it more difficult all of the time to make financial ends meet, let alone put any money into savings. This legislation will make it easier for middle- and low-income Americans who earn up to $75,000 to save more, while giving those Americans who are in an unforeseen financial pinch greater penalty-free access to their Individual Retirement Account [IRA] funds.  This Progressive Caucus bill will help middle- and low-income taxpayers in four fundamental ways.  First, it will substantially increase the level of contributions that they can deposit in an IRA. Since IRA's were first made possible in 1981, the contribution levels governing how much can be contributed annually and who can deduct their contributions, in sum or in part, have eroded due to inflation.  Our bill increases contribution levels to make up for inflation since 1981. It also indexes contribution levels yearly to keep pace with inflation.  Second, our bill authorizes higher IRA contribution levels for nonworking spouses in households with one or more children under the age of 6. That contribution level will also be indexed to keep pace with inflation.  This provision could be called the IRA homemaker provision. Arguably, those Americans who most need to save for retirement [[Page E777]]  are those who stay at home--women primarily--to nurture their children in their most important formative years. That financial sacrifice should be recognized and redressed by allowing nonworking spouses with young children to better save for later years.  Third, our bill will also allow middle-class taxpayers greater flexibility to withdraw their IRA funds without being subject to the 10 percent penalty in order to pay for expenses for higher or vocational education, to pay catastrophic medical expenses, to start a small business, to buy a first home, or to meet unemployment emergencies. Arguably, wealthier taxpayers don't have commensurate cashflow problems vis a vis their IRA's and should still be encouraged to keep their money in savings.  There is no question that more Americans are confronting daunting educational expenses. At the rate tuition costs continue to rise--at least twice the rate of inflation--4 years at a State university by the year 2000 may cost over $50,000. Also growing numbers of American workers are returning to classrooms to prepare for midcareer changes or to upgrade existing job skills. This legislation will permit withdrawals for higher education and/or vocational education for many of these Americans who are struggling to put themselves or their children through college.  With health care costs skyrocketing, we simply must find ways to help ease the burden of sudden medical expenses for American working families. A serious illness can be financially devastating to all but the very wealthy. Our bill will allow individuals and families to withdraw IRA funds penalty-free for catastrophic medical expenses during the taxable year to the degree that the amount of such expenses does not exceed 7\1/2\ percent of adjusted gross income--that is, the existing threshold for deductibility of medical expenses for itemizers. Individuals could draw upon their IRA's for themselves, spouses, children, and/or parents.  It is also true that most of the new jobs being created are to be found in America's small businesses. Therefore, it should be made easier for entrepreneurial Americans to amass startup capital when they decide to start a new business in midcareer or otherwise.  Finally, our bill also extends a helping hand to unemployed Americans as well as first-time homebuyers.  Let me conclude by underscoring that Progressive Caucus members believe if there is to be tax cut legislation enacted this year that tax relief should be focused upon middle- and low-income taxpayers. Well-to-do individuals and corporations already received disproportionate tax cuts throughout the 1980's.  It is fitting and proper that the tax relief to be provided under our bill is to be financed, at least in part, by taking a first step to cut tens of billions in corporate welfare in the Federal budget--the establishment of a minimum tax on the income of foreign-owned companies earned from business activities in the United States.                          ____________________
