 President, I rise to introduce a resolution recognizing--and commending--the Golden State Warriors for overcoming a battle-tested season to prevail as the 2017-2018 NBA World Champions.  After going 16 and 5 in the postseason and sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, the Warriors have become back-to-back champions for the first time in franchise history, and have won three championships in the past four years.  They are now appropriately considered an NBA dynasty, and can easily lay claim to being the team of this decade. They are also now recognized as one of the greatest teams ever assembled. And what is frightening for the rest of the league, is that it appears this team is far from finished.  These playoffs helped bring out the best in these Warriors. After a tough seven game series in the NBA Western Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, the team strung together a dominant performance in the Finals against the Cavaliers. Their brilliant performance in the finals was marked by just how beautiful this team plays. From the superstars on the team to the last person on the bench, the team exhibited dynamic teamwork, selflessness, and infectious joy.  Their on-court style, which I have come to enjoy so much, is a reflection of the entire organization. I want to commend everyone who is a part of the organization--the video interns, the training staff, the owners, the coaches, the players and fans. They all deserve a tremendous amount of credit for winning again this year with consistency and class.  Although at times it has appeared too easy for the Warriors, this season has been anything but easy. It was a season marked by constant struggle and obstacles. When starters were sidelined due to injury throughout the season and playoffs, bench players stepped in and stepped up, revealing, yet again, the team's depth and heart.  And when the Warriors were pushed to the brink of elimination, they pulled together as a team and strung together two gutsy wins to make it back to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight year.  It was indeed a grueling season. For four years now, they have been the ``hunted'' rather than the ``hunter,'' and absorbed the best shots from teams around the league. When things got tough throughout the season and the players and coaches could have pointed fingers at each other, this team never gave in. They kept fighting and fighting until they made it back to the mountain top, together.  What I am equally proud of about this team is that it has been a positive force within the Bay Area community since 2012. Over the past several years, the Warriors Foundation has awarded $6.2 million in grants to support educational initiatives in Alameda and San Francisco Counties. The Foundation, along with individual players, have also refurbished over 70 basketball courts throughout the Bay, creating safe and beautiful places for our young people to play. They are a team that not only plays the right way on the court, but they are also a team that makes the right impact off of the court.  So, to reigning two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Coach Steve Kerr, Coach Brown, Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Rick Welts, Bob Myers and all of the players, coaches, staff, family, friends and fans, I say, thank you.  Thank you for making California proud both on and off the court, and congratulations on a job well-done for a second year in a row.  The only question now is, ``can you make it three?''  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
