 I indicated that to the majority leader. To give the majority leader the benefit of the doubt, which I am prepared to do, I am not sure he understands how much support this has. When I indicated it should be freestanding, he cited other bills he thought were going to go through and they didn't go through and that was what he was worried about.  He had to leave here necessarily and so didn't hear my response, which is, this is not like any other bill. I have not heard of any problem. If any staff is listening--staffs of all one hundred Senators listen to proceedings. They are assigned to listen to them. I ask anybody in the Senate who has any problem with the Biden-Hatch bill to please come and let us know, to debate it. I do not know anybody who is even willing to debate it, to say they are not for it.  I would be dumbfounded, when in fact we bring this up, if we bring it up freestanding, if it didn't get everyone in the Senate voting for it. I would be astounded if it got fewer than 85 or 90votes. I would not at all be surprised if it got 100 votes. But I am not sure the majority leader understands that.  Frankly, what the Senator from California and I could do with Senators Hatch and Specter and others who are supportive of this bill--maybe we can go see the majority leader tomorrow and lay out for him why we are so certain he will not get himself in a traffic jam if he brings this bill up and why he doesn't need to attach it to anything else.
