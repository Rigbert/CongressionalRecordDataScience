Speaker, if only Republicans would take ``yes'' for an answer.  Their Tea Party faction has made clear where it stands. They don't like the Affordable Care Act--I don't think anybody doubts that--but the Affordable Care Act has been upheld by the Supreme Court and remains the law of our land.  Mr. Speaker, the Senate has now voted twice to send us a clean CR. Now it's time for the Speaker and the majority leader to put the Senate's clean compromise CR on this floor and, in their words, let the House work its will. Have the courage, Mr. Speaker, to have the majority party put on this floor a bill which will keep the government open and which the Senate will pass.  Mr. Speaker, have the Republican Party have the courage of its rhetoric and let the House work its will. I dare you to do that.  Let democracy work. Don't be dictating to America that they're going to shut down the government. Let's vote on it. Put a clean CR on this floor.
