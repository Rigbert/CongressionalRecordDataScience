I ask the Senator this: This country has seen, unfortunately, episodes of violence in schools. It is a national tragedy. Columbine High School transfixed America as we focused on safety in schools. We considered a juvenile justice bill on the floor of the Senate and passed it, thanks to the vote of Vice President Gore, which would move us forward toward making our society and our schools safer. It died hopelessly in the House. We are still waiting for any indication of life on this bill.  Is it not true that if the Republican budget cuts go through on education, we will not only be cutting the money for schools to use for safe and drug-free schools, but we also will be dramatically reducing afterschool program opportunities? We don't live in a society any longer of Ozzie and Harriet and the Brady Bunch. Kids get off school at 3 o'clock and nobody is home. Are they going to be supervised? Are they going to have a meaningful experience?  The President wanted 1.4 million more students in America to have an afterschool program. Across the State of Illinois--and I bet in South Dakota--that is an immensely popular idea. It is my understanding that the Republican House bill on education would cut existing afterschool programs and turn 50,000 kids loose at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with no supervision, no opportunity for doing homework or learning a new skill, or learning to use a musical instrument. How can we, on one hand, beat our breasts about what happens at Columbine High School, and then turn around in the budget and eliminate the resources needed so that kids can have a better and safer experience in school?
