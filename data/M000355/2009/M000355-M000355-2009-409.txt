 President, word has reached me that the health of Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has taken a turn for the worse and that the Burmese Government is not allowing her to get the medical attention she needs. I join the administration in calling for Burmese officials to allow her doctor the access he needs to treat her.
