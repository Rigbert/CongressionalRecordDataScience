Speaker, but, frankly, the American people ought not to be confused. There is a bipartisan agreement. We did not send, however, the bipartisan-agreed bill to the Senate.  We did, as we so often do, add to a bipartisan agreement something that does not have agreement, and that undermines the ability of this Congress to work on behalf of the American people in an effective way.  Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, the majority leader knows that. He knows it because I have had discussions with him. He knows it because, publicly, the President has said, Democrats have said: We don't agree with the provision you're adding to something that has been agreed upon in a bipartisan fashion by the Senate and by the House.  The majority leader knows full well that if we sent a clean bill that has already been agreed upon by the Appropriations Committee in the House, by the Appropriations Committee in the Senate, by Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee in the House and by Republicans and Democrats on the Appropriations Committee in the United States Senate, already agreed to--now, let me, Mr. Speaker, read you some comments by someone who I had a great opportunity to serve with in this Congress.  Secretary Tom Ridge--the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, a Republican--and Michael Chertoff, who was also a Republican Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, joined with Secretary--now president--Napolitano. The president wanted great educational institutions in our country; she was then Secretary and former Governor of Arizona.  All three of them said:       Funding for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy      by the debate about immigration.  Again, I remind you that this is Secretary Ridge, former Republican Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the former Republican Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; and Michael Chertoff, former Republican Secretary of the Homeland Security Department; as well as Secretary Napolitano.  They said:       It is imperative that we ensure that the Department of      Homeland Security is ready, willing, and able to protect the      American people. To that end, we urge you not to risk funding      for the operations that protect every American and pass a      clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill.  I agree with Secretary Ridge. I agree with Secretary Chertoff.  When my friend says, ``Oh, it's the Senate,'' I disagree with my friend. It is the Senate who has not passed a bill. Of course, complaining about the 60-vote requirement after having required the most number of cloture votes in history in the last Congress by the current majority leader of the United States Senate when he was minority leader is a little difficult to understand. I choose my words carefully on that.  The fact of the matter is we are putting at risk the security of the American people. We have seen in Canada, we have seen in France, and we have seen in the Middle East horrific terrorist acts. This Department was created to prevent such acts.  By God's grace and their work, America has been very fortunate since September 11, 2001.                              {time}  1200  The Secretaries are saying don't put that at risk.  So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge once again not only the majority leader but the majority party in this House to accept the fact that we do not have agreement on immigration.  I accept the fact that they believe the President has acted incorrectly. What I do not accept, Mr. Speaker, is that they are holding hostage the budget for the Department of Homeland Security in order to make their point on immigration. I would hope that the majority leader would urge his side of the aisle to not do that.  I close on this particular issue with this quote. When asked what was going to happen when time ran out on February 27 on this funding of the Department of Homeland Security, John McCain, former Presidential candidate on the Republican side of the aisle, former Republican Member of this body and now the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee in the United States Senate, said this when asked what was going to happen on February 27. He said: ``Your guess is as good as mine.''  What do you think our adversaries think when, on the Department of Homeland Security, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee says: ``Your guess is as good as mine''?  He goes on and says this: ``I believe in one fundamental principle; that is, we cannot shut down the Department of Homeland Security.''  Unfortunately, the Republican whip, my friend, observed that, well, we maybe just can do that.  Now, the theory is, Mr. Speaker, that because it is funded out of fees and because they are critically important employees, that we won't shut down the Department in one sense. But in another sense, we will preclude it from being empowered by the bipartisan bill passed out of the House Appropriations Committee and the Senate Appropriations Committee, and which we considered in December, to perform its duties.  I will yield to my friend, Mr. Speaker, if he wants to make an additional comment. If not, I will go on to some of the other legislation that needs discussion.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding because I listened a long time.
