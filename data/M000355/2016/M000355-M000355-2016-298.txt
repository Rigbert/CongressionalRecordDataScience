 President, we just had another good conversation on this side with our Members and are now prepared to proceed to the bill that we used as a shell for the CR-Zika legislation.  I might say to all of our Members that we continue to work toward an agreement on the legislation. We hope to have that completed and available for review very soon. With a little cooperation on both sides, I think we can get that finished and begin the debate.                             Cloture Motion
