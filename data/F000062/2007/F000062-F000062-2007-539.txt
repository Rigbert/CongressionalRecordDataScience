 President, if I may, I listened carefully to the remarks of the ranking member, a friend for whom I have great respect and with whom I hope to work very closely. I do disagree on this.  I have watched Senator Conrad, now, for more than a decade. He is usually armed with charts when he comes to the floor or a committee or a caucus. I have never ever found him to be wrong. I don't think there is any person in this body who knows better what he is doing than Senator Conrad. I have been just unusually proud of his leadership on the Budget Committee.  My objection to this amendment--and I agree with Senator Bennett; I was an original supporter of the line-item veto. This is a different day right now. It is a different situation. Different issues are at stake in a line-item veto. This is an ethics bill. We are talking about lobby reform and earmark reform and we want very much to have a bipartisan bill. We are not going to have a bipartisan bill if we get into campaign finance reform and line-item vetoes and a number of other issues that are beginning to percolate.  It is my hope that we could keep this bill restricted to ethics, restricted tolobby reform, earmark reform, those things that are properly before this body. That is the only way we are going to get a broad consensus that is going to survive a conference and come back with something all Members can support.  I am going to begin to move to table items that are outside of the germane issues of this bill in the hopes that we could keep this broad, bipartisan support.
