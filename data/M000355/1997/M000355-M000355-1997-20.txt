 We have 25 speakers in opposition to McCain-Feingold, and a growing number of our Members want to speak out in opposition to this piece of legislation.  I think a very encouraging thing happened this morning that I would like to report to my colleagues right before the vote.  I had an opportunity to attend an announcement of a new organization called the James Madison Center for Free Speech. What the James Madison Center for Free Speech is going to do is handle litigation all across the country in cases involving political speech. We have heard it announced that the forces of reform who want to shut Americans out of the political process and being frustrated in Washington are taking their cases out around America. There have been various State laws and referenda that have passed--all of them, so far, struck down in the Federal courts. But the James Madison Center is going to be there to represent litigants all across America who stand up for first amendment free speech.  I think that is an important announcement. The proponents of campaign finance reform have said they are not going to go away. The opponents are not going to go away. The James Madison Center is going to be there every time free speech is threatened anywhere in America.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call under rule XXII be waived.
