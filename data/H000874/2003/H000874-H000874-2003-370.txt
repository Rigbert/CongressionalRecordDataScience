Speaker, reclaiming my time, I tell the leader, on this side of the aisle regular order is a concept which we support, but it will not be of help to people if we do not act, and by May 31, you indicate 6 million, I am saying 3 million. I am not sure whether it is Federal-State, about a million are at risk on the State program, or maybe 2 million on State and 1 million on Federal. There is a total of 3 million at risk.  I tell the leader that it is my understanding in each of the recessions in the early 1980s and in 1990, we extended the existing program's coverage for substantially more weeks than we have done in this recession.  With 6 million people unemployed, with jobs difficult to find for those 6 million people, and, as the gentleman knows, under the program you cannot receive benefits unless you are, in fact, looking for a job, I would say that it would be appropriate for us to do this in the regular order. Of course, a suspension bill is in the regular order. As a matter of fact, we are going to do a number of suspension bills next week.  The leader pointed out correctly that we passed unemployment extension through the House last year in the fall on a largely, not largely, but a large bipartisan vote, so I think that could be done. But I thank the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would just yield further, I really do not want to tread in water that may get too deep for me, because, again, I am not an expert on this, but I understand in our looking through how we can accomplish what the gentleman may want or not want, it is my understanding that there is a significant amount of money left in the States at this moment, and that if the States themselves wanted to extend their unemployment benefits and it was in their best interests to do so, they could do it.                              {time}  1415  So I think it is a stretch to say that we are at a crisis point, that we have to move quickly and not deliberatively on this issue.  So we are looking at it. We are taking advice from Members. The Committee on Ways and Means is looking at opportunities to address this problem, and we will do it as soon as and as fast as we can.
