President, I have had very friendly conversations with Senator Reid and Senator McConnell during the past couple of days. Having served with both of them for a long time, I know that when an agreement is made, it is an agreement we will stick to. I am aware of the agreement. I compliment both the Democratic leader and the Republican leader for their help in moving this forward.
