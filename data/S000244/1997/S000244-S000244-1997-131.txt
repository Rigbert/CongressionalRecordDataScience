SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM.       With the year 2000 fast approaching, it is the sense of      Congress that the United States Fire Administration should--       (1) give high priority to correcting all 2-digit date-     related problems in its computer systems to ensure that those      systems continue to operate effectively in the year 2000 and      beyond;       (2) access immediately the extent of the risk to the      operations of the United States Fire Administration posed by      the problems referred to in paragraph (1), and plan and      budget for achieving Year 2000 compliance for all of its      mission-critical systems; and       (3) develop contingency plans for those systems that the      United States Fire Administration is unable to correct in      time.     SEC. 8. BUY AMERICAN.
