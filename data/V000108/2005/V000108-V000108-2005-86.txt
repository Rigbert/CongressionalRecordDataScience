Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mayor George Pabey for being honored as 2005 East Chicagoan of the Year. For sixteen years, Twin City Community Services in East Chicago, Indiana, has awarded this title to prominent members of the community who have greatly contributed to the city and people of East Chicago. This year's festivities will take place on Friday, August 5, 2005, at the Knights of Columbus Hall in East Chicago.  George is a native of East Chicago, Indiana. At a young age his parents taught him the importance of hard work, accountability, and community service. His strong family values set the tone for his life and career. These values paved the way for George's decision to serve the people of East Chicago. In 1972, he decided to become a police officer with the East Chicago Police Department. George quickly rose through the ranks and his hard work and dedication did not go unnoticed. He served in the Narcotics Unit and was instrumental in developing the city's Gang Unit. In 1990, he was appointed Chief of Police. After he retired from the East Chicago Police Department in 1997, he was appointed Director of Security for a nationally known casino located in East Chicago, Indiana.  George's political career began in 1999. After campaigning on a platform of providing safer streets, reinvigorating neighborhoods and empowering people, George was elected to East Chicago's Common Council. Throughout his career, he earned praise for his leadership and integrity. On October 26, 2004, George made history and became the first Hispanic democrat to rise to the standing of Democratic nominee for Mayor of the City of East Chicago.  The Knights of Columbus Hall will be filled Friday night with friends and family who have been blessed with the opportunity to know and work with George and who wish to celebrate with him as he receives his award. George's hard work and dedication, which have earned him the East Chicagoan of the Year award, have been improving the community and the lives of East Chicagoans for over twenty years. Though he is dedicated to his career and the community of East Chicago, he has never limited his time and love for his family. George and his wife, Hilda, have two children, Maria Lisete and Anthony, and two grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mayor George Pabey on being recognized as East Chicagoan of the Year. It is my privilege to extend my personal thanks to Mayor Pabey for his lifelong dedication to the citizens of the First Congressional District of Indiana.                          ____________________
