President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3300       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Vote by Mail Act of 2010''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds v. Sims that      ``[i]t has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified      voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote . . .      and to have their votes counted.''       (2) In recent presidential elections, voting technology      failures, procedural irregularities, and long lines for      polling places deprived some Americans of their fundamental      right to vote.       (3) Under the Oregon Vote by Mail system, election      officials mail ballots to all registered voters at least 2      weeks before election day. Voters mark their ballots, seal      the ballots in both unmarked secrecy envelopes and signed      return envelopes, and return the ballots by mail or to secure      drop boxes. Once a ballot is received, election officials      scan the bar code on the ballot envelope, which brings up the      voter's signature on a computer screen. The election official      compares the signature on the screen and the signature on the      ballot envelope. Only if the signature on the ballot envelope      is determined to be authentic is the ballot forwarded on to      be counted.       (4) Oregon's Vote by Mail system has deterred voter fraud      because the system includes numerous security measures such      as the signature authentication system. Potential misconduct      is also discouraged by the power of the State to punish those      who engage in voter fraud with up to 5 years in prison,      $100,000 in fines, and the loss of their vote.       (5) Oregon's Vote by Mail system promotes uniformity and      strict compliance with Federal and State voting laws because      ballot processing is centralized in county clerks' offices,      rather than at numerous polling places.       (6) Vote by Mail is 1 factor making voter turnout in Oregon      consistently higher than the average national voter turnout.      In the 2004 presidential election, for example, Oregon had a      turnout rate of 86.48 percent of registered voters, compared      to 69.96 percent turnout of registered voters nationally.       (7) Women, younger voters, and homemakers also report that      they vote more often using Vote by Mail.       (8) Vote by Mail reduces election costs by eliminating the      need to transport equipment to polling stations and to hire      and train poll workers. Oregon reduced its costs to      administer elections by nearly 30 percent after implementing      Vote by Mail. In Oregon's last polling place election in      1998, the cost per voter was $3.07. By 2004, the cost per      voter in Oregon had dropped to $2.21.       (9) Vote by Mail allows voters to educate themselves      because they receive ballots well before election day, which      provides them with ample time to research issues, study      ballots, and deliberate in a way that is not possible at a      polling place.       (10) Vote by Mail is accurate--at least 2 studies comparing      voting technologies show that absentee voting methods,      including Vote by Mail systems, result in a more accurate      vote count.       (11) Vote by Mail results in more up-to-date voter rolls,      since election officials use forwarding information from the      post office to update voter registration.       (12) Vote by Mail allows voters to visually verify that      their votes were cast correctly and produces a paper trail      for election recounts.       (13) In a survey taken 5 years after Oregon implemented the      Vote by Mail system, more than 8 in 10 Oregon voters said      they preferred voting by mail to traditional voting.       (14) Voters in other States are moving toward Vote by Mail      as well. In 2008, 89 percent of voters in Washington State      who cast ballots voted by mail, 64 percent of voters in      Colorado voted by mail, and 44 percent of voters in      California voted by mail.
