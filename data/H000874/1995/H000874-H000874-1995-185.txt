Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, the gentleman from New York. I want to say to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Owens] is one of the real fighters in this Congress in behalf of working men and women, the safety and welfare of our people, and I am privileged to be speaking with him. I think his point is well taken as well that the safety of young people and all workers is of paramount importance, I think, on both sides of the aisle.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1114, a bill to reform the Department of Labor's hazardous occupation order No. 12 and allow workers, age 16 and 17, to load paper balers and compactors.  This bill is a good compromise between both sides of the aisle, the grocers and the unions.  Several months ago, Mr. Speaker, I met with the grocers from Maryland and then visited a grocery store in my district to see a baler, first hand.  While I understood the inconvenience of minors being prohibited from loading the balers, I was very concerned about the union's objections and the safety of our Nation's young workers.  I was pleased to work with Members on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the final product that the House will vote on today embodied this approach.  The manager's amendment, offered by Mr. Goodling, will guarantee that every baler and compactor loaded by minors meets the most current ANSI standards.  Further, to ensure that minors will only be loading the balers, the machines must include an on-off switch with a key-lock system which will be maintained by employees over 18.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we can offer commonsense reform today to the grocers of America, while protecting the health and safety of our young workers. This is a good compromise which brought the grocers and the unions together to help craft a bill which protects everyone's interests and makes sense for America's businesses.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1114.
