Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the distinguished Democrat whip for his very kind remarks; but note that this has been a very strong bipartisan effort, and he has been very much a part of that Parliamentary Assembly.  When we first began to raise this issue, one of the focuses we brought to bear on the Parliamentary Assembly was the importance of Holocaust education. And I would ask every American when they visit Washington to go down to the Holocaust Museum and walk through that museum. Look at the pictures of the people doing the hail to Hitler, the Hail Hitler salute. Seemingly normal, everyday people who, whether they knew it or not, were buying into this extermination campaign that is the most horrific in all of human history.  We would hope that when the Parliamentary Assembly comes to Washington in July that the 220-plus members of Parliaments from each of the countries will spend at least half a day going through the Holocaust Museum to remember so that the past does not become prologue.  I would also point out to my colleagues that my own sense of Holocaust remembrance and education began when I was a young teenager, and a man who used to visit a store right next to my family's sporting goods store who was a survivor himself. I will never forget when he rolled up his sleeve one day and showed us that tattooed mark, the number. He was one of the lucky ones, like our good friend and colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), who survived this terrible time when hell was in session.  So, again, this is another one of those issues that we all are deeply concerned about. There is no division between Democrat or Republican. And again I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) for his leadership on this as well. It has been extraordinary.  Mr. Speaker, I submit herewith the ``Report on Global Anti-Semitism'' referred to earlier.                     Report on Global Anti-Semitism       July 1, 2003-December 15, 2004, submitted by the Department      of State to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the      Committee on International Relations in accordance with      Section 4 of PL 108-332, December 30, 2004. Released by the      Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, January 5,      2005.                           Executive Summary                            I. anti-Semitism       Anti-Semitism has plagued the world for centuries. Taken to      its most far-reaching and violent extreme, the Holocaust,      anti-Semitism resulted in the deaths of millions of Jews and      the suffering of countless others. Subtler, less vile forms      of anti-Semitism have disrupted lives, decimated religious      communities, created social and political cleavages, and      complicated relations between countries as well as the work      of international organizations. For an increasingly      interdependent world, anti-Semitism is an intolerable burden.       The increasing frequency and severity of anti-Semitic      incidents since the start of the 21st century, particularly      in Europe, has compelled the international community to focus      on anti-Semitism with renewed vigor. Attacks on individual      Jews and on Jewish properties occurred in the immediate post      World War II period, but decreased over time and were      primarily linked to vandalism and criminal activity. In      recent years, incidents have been more targeted in nature      with perpetrators appearing to have the specific intent to      attack Jews and Judaism. These attacks have disrupted the      sense of safety and well-being of Jewish communities.       The definition of anti-Semitism has been the focus of      innumerable discussions and     studies. While there is no universally accepted definition,      there is a generally clear understanding of what the term      encompasses.       For the purposes of this report, anti-Semitism is      considered to be hatred toward Jews--individually and as a      group--that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or      ethnicity. An important issue is the distinction between      legitimate criticism of policies and practices of the State      of Israel, and commentary that assumes an anti-Semitic      character. The demonization of Israel, or vilification of      Israeli leaders, sometimes through comparisons with Nazi      leaders, and through the use of Nazi symbols to caricature      them, indicates an anti-Semitic bias rather than a valid      criticism of policy concerning a controversial issue.       Global anti-Semitism in recent years has had four main      sources:       Traditional anti-Jewish prejudice that has pervaded Europe      and some countries in other parts of the world for centuries.      This includes ultra-nationalists and others who assert that      the Jewish community controls governments, the media,      international business, and the financial world.       Strong anti-Israel sentiment that crosses the line between      objective criticism of Israeli policies and anti-Semitism.       Anti-Jewish sentiment expressed by some in Europe's growing      Muslim population, based on longstanding antipathy toward      both Israel and Jews, as well as Muslim opposition to      developments in Israel and the occupied territories, and more      recently in Iraq.       Criticiam of both the United States and globalization that      spills over to Israel, and to Jews in general who are      identified with both.            II. harassment, vandalism and physical violence     Europe and Eurasia       Anti-Semitism in Europe increased significantly in recent      years. At the same time it should be noted that many European      countries have comprehensive reporting systems that record      incidents more completely than is possible in other      countries. Because of this significant difference in      reporting systems, it is not possible to make direct      comparisons between countries or geographic regions.      Beginning in 2000, verbal attacks directed against Jews      increased while incidents of vandalism (e.g. graffiti, fire      bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and      cemeteries) surged. Physical assaults including beatings,      stabbings and other violence against Jews in Europe increased      markedly, in a number of cases resulting in serious injury      and even death. Also troubling is a bias that spills over      into anti-Semitism in some of the left-of-center press and      among some intellectuals.       The disturbing rise of anti-Semitic intimidation and      incidents is widespread throughout Europe, although with      significant variations in the number of cases and the      accuracy of reporting. European governments in most countries      now view anti-Semitism as a serious problem for their      societies and demonstrate a greater willingness to address      the issue. The Vienna-based European Union Monitoring Center      (EUMC), for 2002 and 2003, identified France, Germany, the      United Kingdom, Belgium, and The Netherlands as EU member      countries with notable increases in incidents. As these      nations keep reliable and comprehensive statistics on anti-     Semitic acts, and are engaged in combating anti-Semitism,      their data was readily available to the EUMC. Governments and      leading public figures condemned the violence, passed new      legislation, and mounted positive law enforcement and      educational efforts.       In Western Europe, traditional far-right groups still      account for a significant proportion of the attacks against      Jews and Jewish properties; disadvantaged and disaffected      Muslim youths increasingly were responsible for most of the      other incidents. This trend appears likely to persist as the      number of Muslims in Europe continues to grow while their      level of education and economic prospects remain limited.       In Eastern Europe, with a much smaller Muslim population,      skinheads and other members of the radical political fringe      were responsible for most anti-Semitic incidents. Anti-     Semitism remained a serious problem in Russia and Belarus,      and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, with most incidents      carried out by ultra-nationalist and other far-right      elements. The stereotype of Jews as manipulators of the      global economy continues to provide fertile ground for anti-     Semitic aggression.       Holocaust and tolerance education as well as teacher      training provide a potential long-term solution to anti-     Semitism; however, the problem is still rapidly outpacing the      solution. At the end of 2003, and continuing into this year,      some Jews, especially in Europe, faced the dilemma either of      hiding their identity or facing harassment and sometimes even      serious bodily injury and death. The heavy psychological toll      in this increasingly difficult environment should not be      overlooked or underestimated.     Middle East       Jews left the countries of the Middle East and North Africa      in large numbers near the mid-point of the last century as      their situation became increasingly precarious. This trend      continues. Today few remain, and few incidents involving the      remaining members of the Jewish community have been reported.      Nonetheless, Syria condoned and, in some cases, even      supported through radio, television programming, news      articles, and other mass media the export of the virulent      domestic anti-Semitism. The official and state-supported      media's anti-Zionist propaganda frequently adopts the      terminology and symbols of the Holocaust to demonize      Israel and its leaders. This rhetoric often crosses the      line separating the legitimate criticism of Israel and its      policies to become anti-Semitic vilification posing as      legitimate political commentary. At the same time,      Holocaust denial and Holocaust minimization efforts find      increasingly overt acceptance as sanctioned historical      discourse in a number of Middle Eastern countries.     Other Regions       The problem of anti-Semitism is not only significant in      Europe and in the Middle East, but here are also worrying      expressions of it elsewhere. For example, in Pakistan, a      country without a Jewish community, anti-Semitic sentiment      fanned by anti-Semitic Articles in the press is widespread.      This reflects the more recent phenomenon of anti-Semitism      appearing in the countries where historically or currently      there are few or even no Jews.       Elsewhere, in Australia, the level of intimidation and      attacks against Jews and Jewish property and anti-Zionist and      anti-Semitic rhetoric decreased somewhat over the past year.      This year, New Zealand experienced several desecrations of      Jewish tombstones and other incidents. In the Americas, in      addition to manifestations of anti-Semitism in the United      States, Canada experienced a significant increase in attacks      against Jews and Jewish property. There were notable anti-     Semitic incidents in Argentina and isolated incidents in a      number of other Latin American countries.                               III. Media       The proliferation of media outlets (television, radio,      print media and the Internet) has vastly increased the      opportunity for purveyors of anti-Semitic material to spread      their propaganda unhindered. Anti-hater laws provide some      protection, but freedom of expression safeguards in many      western counties limited the preventive measures that      governments could take. Satellite television programming      easily shifts from one provider to another and Internet      offerings cross international borders with few or no      impediments.       In June, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in      Europe (OSCE) organized a separate meeting in Paris dealing      with intolerance on the Internet, and subsequently approved a      decision on ``Promoting Tolerance and Media Freedom on the      Internet.'' The decision is prescriptive in nature and      carefully caveated to avoid conflict with the varied legal      systems within the countries of the OSCE. It calls upon      Participating States to investigate and fully prosecute      criminal threats on violence based on anti-Semitic and other      intolerance on the Internet, as well as to establish programs      to educate children about hate speech and other forms of      bias.       Critics of Israel frequently use anti-Semitic cartoons      depicting anti-Jewish images and caricatures to attack the      State of Israel and its policies, as well as Jewish      communities and other who support Israel. These media attacks      can lack any pretext of balance or even factual basis and      focus on the demonization of Israel. The United States is      frequently included as a target of such attacks, which often      assert that U.S. foreign policy is made in Israel or that      Jews control the media and financial markets in the United      States and the rest of the world. During the 2004 United      States presidential campaign, the Arab press ran numerous      cartoons closely identifying both of the major American      political parties with Israel and with Israeli Prime Minister      Sharon.       ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' a text debunked      many years ago as a fraud perpetrated by Czarist intelligence      agents, continued to appear in the Middle East media, not as      a hoax, but as established fact. Government-sponsored      television in Syria ran lengthy serials based on the      Protocols. The representations emphasized blood libel and the      alleged control by the Jewish community of international      finance. The clear purpose of the programs was to incite      hatred of Jews and of Israel. Copies of the Protocols and      other similar anti-Semitic forgeries were readily available      in Middle Eastern countries, former Soviet republics and      elsewhere. Similarly, allegations that Jews were behind      the 9/11 attacks were widely disseminated.       In November 2004, Al-Manar, the Lebanon-based television      network controlled by Hizballah featuring blatantly anti-     Semitic material, obtained a limited 1-year satellite      broadcast license from the French authorities. This was      revoked shortly thereafter due to Al-Manar's continued      transmission of anti-Semitic material. Al-Manar is now off      the air in France. Other Middle East networks with      questionable content, such as Al-Jazeerah and Al-Arrabiya,      maintain their French broadcast licenses.                       IV. actions by governments       In Europe and other geographic regions, many governments      became increasingly aware of the threat presented by anti-     Semitism and spoke out against it. Some took effective      measures to combat it with several countries, including      France, Belgium, and Germany, now providing enhanced      protection for members of the Jewish community and Jewish      properties.       For the most part, the police response to anti-Semitic      incidents was uneven. Most law     enforcement officials are not specifically trained to deal      with hate crimes, particularly anti-Semitic hat crimes.      Police sometimes dismissed such crimes as hooliganism or      petty crime, rather than attacks against Jews because of      their ethnicity or religion, or because the assailants      identified the victims with the actions of the State of      Israel.       In countries where anti-Semitism is a serious problem,      specialized training for police and members of the judiciary      remains a pressing need. Many nations still do not have hate      crimes laws that address anti-Semitic and other intolerance-     related crimes. In some instances where such laws already      exist, stronger enforcement is needed.                         V. multilateral action       Anti-Semitism is a global problem that requires a      coordinated multinational approach. Thus far, the most      effective vehicle for international cooperation has been the      OSCE, comprised of 55 participating states from Europe,      Eurasia and North America plus Mediterranean and Asian      partners for cooperation. The OSCE organized two      groundbreaking conferences on anti-Semitism--in June 2003, in      Vienna and in April 2004, In Berlin. These were the first      international conferences to focus high-level political      attention solely on the problem of anti-Semitism. The Vienna      Conference identified anti-Semitism as a human rights issue.       OSCE Foreign Ministers gave further high-level political      acknowledgment to the seriousness of anti-Semitism at their      December 2003 meeting in Maastricht. There they took the      formal decision to spotlight the need to combat anti-Semitism      by deciding to task the OSCE's Office of Democratic      Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) to serve as a      collection point for hate crimes information. ODIHR is now      working with OSCE member states to collect information on      hate crimes legislation and to promote ``best practices'' in      the areas of law enforcement, combating hate crimes, and      education. ODIHR established a Program on Tolerance and Non-     Discrimination and now has an advisor to deal exclusively      with the issue.       At their December 2004 meeting in Sofia, OSCE Foreign      Ministers welcomed the Chair-in-Office's decision to appoint      three special representatives for tolerance issues, including      a special representative for anti-Semitism, to work with      member states on implementing specific commitments to fight      anti-Semitism. In addition, the Foreign Ministers accepted      the Spanish Government's offer to host a third anti-Semitism      conference in June 2005 in Cordoba.       The United Nations also took important measures in the      fight against anti-Semitism. One was a June 2004 seminar on      anti-Semitism hosted by Secretary General Kofi Annan. Another      measure was a resolution of the United Nations Third      Committee in November 2004, which called for the elimination      of all forms of religious intolerance, explicitly including      anti-Semitism.       Education remains a potentially potent antidote for anti-     Semitism and other forms of intolerance. Following the first      Stockholm Conference in 1998, convoked out of concern for the      decreasing level of knowledge of the Holocaust particularly      among the younger generation, Sweden, the United Kingdom and      the United States decided to address the issue      collaboratively. The Task Force for International Cooperation      on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research (ITF)      emerged from this initial effort.       Today the ITF, an informal international organization      operating on the basis of consensus, and without a      bureaucracy, consists of 20 countries. ITF member states      agree to commit themselves to the Declaration of the      Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust and to its      implementation. Current members of the ITF include Argentina,      Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary      Israel, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the      Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland,      United Kingdom, and the United States. In addition four other      countries (Croatia, Estonia, Greece, Slovakia) maintain a      liaison relationship with the ITF.    vi. U.S. Government Actions to Monitor and combat anti-semitism       The U.S. Government is committed to monitoring and      combating anti-Semitism throughout the world as an important      human rights and religious freedom issue. As President Bush      said when he signed the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act on      October 16, 2004, ``Defending freedom also means disrupting      the evil of anti-Semitism.''       Annually, the U.S. Department of State publishes the      International Religious Freedom Report and the Country      Reports on Human Rights Practices. Both detail incidents and      trends of anti-Semitism worldwide. The State Department's      instructions to U.S. Embassies for the 2004 Country Reports      on Human Rights Practices explicitly required them to      describe acts of violence against Jews and Jewish properties,      as well as actions governments are taking to prevent this      form of bigotry and prejudice.       In multilateral fora, the Department of State called for      recognition of the rise of anti-Semitism and the development      of specific measures to address it. The Department played a      leading role in reaching agreement in the OSCE to hold the      two conferences on combating anti-Semitism noted above in      Section V. Former New York City Mayors Rudolph Giuliani and      Edward Koch led the United States delegations to the      conferences in Vienna and Berlin, respectively. Each brought      a wealth of knowledge and experience in fostering respect for      minorities in multicultural communities. Key NGOs worked      productively with the Department to prepare for these      conferences. In his address to the Berlin Conference,      Secretary Powell said: `` We must not permit anti-Semitism      crimes to be shrugged off as inevitable side effects of      inter-ethnic conflicts. Political disagreements do not      justify physical assaults against Jews in our streets, the      destruction of Jewish schools, or the desecration of      synagogues and cemeteries. There is no justification for      anti-Semitism.'' At the United Nations, the United States has      supported resolutions condemning anti-Semitism both at the      General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights.       An important lesson of the Holocaust is that bigotry and      intolerance can lead to future atrocities and genocides if      not addressed forcefully by governments and other sectors of      society. The United States is committed to working      bilaterally to promote efforts with other governments to      arrest and roll back the increase in anti-Semitism. President      Bush affirmed that commitment during his visit to Auschwitz-     Birkenau in 2003, stating: ``This site is a sobering reminder      that when we find anti-Semitism, whether it be in Europe, in      America or anywhere else, mankind must come together to fight      such dark impulses.''       U.S. Embassies implement this commitment by speaking out      against anti-Semitic acts and hate crimes. Ambassadors and      other embassy officers work with local Jewish communities to      encourage prompt law enforcement action against hate crimes.      In Turkey, the U.S. Embassy worked closely with the Jewish      community following the November 2003 bombing of the Neve      Shalom Synagogue. In the Middle East, our embassies have      protested to host governments against practices that have      allowed their institutions to promote anti-Semitism, such as      the heavily watched television series Rider Without a Horse      and Diaspora that respectively promoted the canard of the      blood libel, and ``The Protocols of Elders of Zion.'' U.S.      bilateral demarches were effective in specific instances, but      more remains to be done to encourage national leaders to      speak out forcefully against anti-Semitism and in support of      respectful, tolerant societies.       Building on the success achieved to date, the Department of      State is accelerating its efforts with its partners globally      to improve both monitoring and combating anti-Semitism in      three specific areas: education, legislation, and law      enforcement. The Department will continue to promote the      development of Holocaust education curricula and teacher      training programs. A successful program in this area has been      summer teacher training partially funded through U.S.      Embassies in cooperation with the Association of American      Holocaust Organizations (AHO) and the United States Holocaust      Memorial Museum (USHMM). At the October 2004 OSCE Human      Dimension Meeting, the United States and France hosted a      seminar on methodologies for teaching the Holocaust in      multicultural societies. The United States also supports the      work of NGOs in promoting educational programs abroad, in      part based on successful seminars in the United States that      teach respect for individuals and minority groups.      Additionally, the U.S. State Department has supported efforts      to promote tolerance in the Saudi educational system      including by sponsoring the travel of religious educators to      the United States to examine interreligious education.       The roots of anti-Semitism run deep and the United States      does not underestimate the difficulty of reversing the recent      resurgence of this ancient scourge. The legislative and      executive branches, together with NGOs, constitute an      important partnership in continuing the vital effort to find      creative ways to monitor, contain, and finally stop anti-     Semitism.
