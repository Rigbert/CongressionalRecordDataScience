President, I rise today to call attention to the celebration of World Food Day on October 16th. I also rise to recognize the many successes achieved by the UN World Food Programme (WFP), the world's largest international food aid organization, over the past 18 years.  The WFP provides humanitarian relief to the world's poorest and most downtrodden people by distributing food to those individuals who are the most vulnerable to malnutrition and famine, particularly women and children. Last year alone, the WFP fed over 52.9 million people, by transporting food to needy and malnourished families in 84 countries. The WFP also provides much needed assistance to the tens of millions of victims world-wide who have suffered through natural disasters, such as earthquakes, severe floods and drought. Moreover, the WFP has committed itself to ensuring peace and stability around the world by providing food to people in war-torn countries like Sudan and Rwanda. Finally, the WFP uses donated food for development activities such as paying individuals that replant forests in Ethiopia and providing nourishment to workers repairing dikes in Vietnam. These activities help developing countries build strong infrastructures and promote economic stability.  With nowhere else to turn, the poorest of the world's poor have been able to find solace in the hard work and dedication of the WFP's many volunteers and employees.  American citizens have a particular reason to be proud on World Food Day. The United States has committed itself to be a world leader in the global battle against hunger. The U.S. was a primary founder of the WFP and has consistently been the world's single largest donor of food to the world's poor.  As World Food Day is celebrated this year, we can applaud the progress the U.N. World Food Programme has achieved and the compassion that has been shown. We all must be reminded, however, that substantial work remains to be undertaken and completed. In recognition of this special day, I ask that we all carry with us the vision of a new day when abundant food is available to each and every human being and that we renew our collective commitment to achieve that vision.                          ____________________
