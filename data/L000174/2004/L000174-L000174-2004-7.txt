President, soon after we return in January, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin consideration of the nomination of Alberto Gonzales for the position of Attorney General of the United States. I met with Judge Gonzales on November 17, soon after his designation as the President's nominee. I had that meeting in preparation for our hearings. I look forward to working with Senator Specter and the other members of the Judiciary Committee to assure a prompt and fair and thorough hearing on this important nomination in early January.  There is no secret that Judge Gonzales will be called upon to explain not only his vision of what the role of the Attorney General should be, but also how he would distinguish it from that of the White House Counsel. And he is also going to be asked about the role he has played in formulating the administration's policy on the treatment and interrogation of prisoners in U.S. custody overseas.  The scandal of Abu Ghraib, allegations of mistreatment in Guantanamo, investigations and charges from cases in Iraq and Afghanistan are serious matters. There are lingering questions. There is unresolved accountability left in their wake.  The Bush administration circled the wagons long ago. It has continually maintained that the abuses were simply the work of a few bad apples. But we know that the photos from Abu Ghraib do not depict an isolated incident. Abuses have occurred in many locations, including Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and in a number of other facilities within Iraq.  I have long said that somewhere in the upper reaches of the executive branch, a process was set in motion that rolled forward until it produced this scandal. Even without a truly independent investigation, we now know the responsibility for abuse runs very high into the chain of command. Senior officials in the White House, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon set in motion a systematic effort to minimize, distort, and even ignore laws, policies, and agreements on torture and the treatment of prisoners. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and later LTG Ricardo Sanchez authorized the use of techniques that were contrary to both U.S. military manuals and international law.  Former CIA Director Tenet requested, and Secretary Rumsfeld approved, the secret detention of a ghost detainee in Iraq so he could be hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross.  These issues, especially when they involve the greatest democracy history has known, are a significant concern. But there are also issues in which the administration has been far less than forthcoming. In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, long before the fall elections, long before the resignation of John Ashcroft, and long before he was designated by the President as nominee, I asked Judge Gonzales to describe his role in both the interpretation of the law and the development of policies that led to what I and many others considered to have been a disregard for the rule of law. Those letters of May 17 and June 15 remain unanswered as of today.  I have repeatedly emphasized to Judge Gonzales the need for responsiveness and accountability in these matters. Last Friday, I sent Judge Gonzales a letter reiterating my concerns. I emphasized the importance of full disclosure during this confirmation process.  I urge him to cooperate, to cooperate now with all members of the Judiciary Committee on both sides of the aisle on the full range of issues of oversight and accountability that come before us. That is something his predecessor did not do. That lack of oversight on the part of the Senate, the lack of accountability and lack of responsiveness on the part of the administration, should not continue.  I ask unanimous consent to have my December 3, 2004, letter to Judge Gonzales printed in the Record.  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2004.     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,     Counsel to the President, the White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Judge Gonzales: I enjoyed our preliminary meeting and      look forward to your confirmation hearings. In following up      on our meeting, and to give you and your staff ample      opportunity to prepare for the hearings, I write to reiterate      several concerns that I have raised in prior discussions and      correspondence. When we met on November 17, 2004, I said that      these issues will be raised, by myself and other members of      the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the upcoming hearings.      Based on our conversation, I am encourage by your willingness      to answer questions about you role and your views in these      matters.       Photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq and other      locations show an interrogation and detention system      operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. In      addition to the abhorrent images from the Abu Ghraib prison      that were published last spring, actions that have occurred      with Administration approval include the forcible rendition      of individuals to nations where they may face torture, and      the hiding of ``ghost detainees'' from the International      Committee of the Red Cross. Reports of abuse continue to      emerge. Just this week, The New York Times reported that the      Red Cross has charged U.S. military authorities with using      physical and psychological coercion ``tantamount to torture''      on prisoners at Guantamano Bay. The Washington Post is      reporting that in December 2003 Army generals in Iraq were      warned in a confidential report that members of an elite      military and CIA task force were abusing detainees. According      to The Post, the report concluded that certain arrest and      detention practices could be deemed to be ``technically''      illegal.       In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, I asked      you to describe your role in both the interpretation of the      law and the development of policies that led to what I and      many other consider to have been a disregard for the rule of      law. These letters remain unanswered.       My concerns regarding the abuse of prisoners in U.S.      custody did not begin with these letters. I have been seeking      answers from the Administration for well over a year, before      the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light. In a very few cases      my questions were answered, but with information that later      proved to be less than accurate. For example, in a news      conference on June 22, 2004, you stated, ``In Iraq, it has      always been U.S. position that Geneva applies. From the early      days of the conflict, both the White House and the      Department of Defense have been very public and clear      about that.''       However, an October 24, 2004, article in The Washington      Post revealed yet another Justice Department memo authorizing      actions that potentially violate the Geneva Conventions. The      draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, apparently was written to      authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for      interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva      Conventions. According to the memo's cover letter, it was      drafted at your request.       In another example, a June 25, 2003, letter from Department      of Defense General Counsel William Haynes stated that the      United States was adhering to its international obligations      including those under the Convention Against Torture. We      later learned of an August 1, 2002, Department of Justice      memorandum that twisted the definition of torture in      unrecognizable ways. That memo was addressed to your. We also      learned months     later of the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian citizen to Syria,      despite his fear of being tortured there, and despite the      Syrian government's well-documented history of torture.      Unnamed CIA officials told the press that this man was in      fact tortured in Syria.       The Committee and the Senate will want to know your role in      these situations and your views with regard to the      development of the legal justifications that appear to      underlie so many of these actions. You will be called upon to      explain in detail your role in developing policies related to      the interrogation and treatment of foreign prisoners. The      American public and the Senate that will be called upon to      confirm your appointment deserve to know how a potential      Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the      nation, will interpret and enforce the laws and how you will      develop policy.       We want to know what the current policy on torture is, but      since the Administration disavowed the August 1, 2002, memo,      no public statement of policy has replaced it. Questions      remain unanswered on a host of issues. Requests to the White      House and the Department of Justice for relevant documents--     including my requests to you in May and June of this year--     have been ignored or rejected. I urge you and the      Administration to provide the documents that have been      requested by myself and others without further delay so that      the hearings will be well informed.       Another key concern you will be called upon to discuss is      how you view the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney      General. As we discussed, I view the White House Counsel      position and that of the Attorney General as quite distinct.      You may well have viewed this President as your ``client''      while serving him at the White House, although the courts do      not recognize an attorney-client privilege in that setting.      We will want to know how differently you will act and view      your responsibilities as the Attorney General of the      United States.       Finally, I encourage you to commit to cooperating with all      members of the Judiciary Committee on issues of oversight and      accountability. In the 108th Congress, the Judiciary      Committee failed to fulfill its oversight responsibilities.      Accountability and improving government performance are sound      and long established purposes of congressional oversight, and      accountability has been lacking on these and other crucial      issues. With a new Congress, and a new Attorney General, I      expect a return to the diligent oversight envisioned by our      Founders to ensure that the Executive Branch remains      accountable to the American people.       Our meeting was a constructive beginning at the start of      the confirmation process, and I look forward to your hearing      early next month. In the meantime, Marcelle and I send our      best wishes to you and your family and hope that you have a      restful and rewarding holiday season.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                        Ranking Democratic Member.
