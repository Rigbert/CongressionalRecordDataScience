President, I listened with interest to the colloquy between my two friends, the distinguished majority and minority leaders. It is almost--and I think the American people see it as almost--a kabuki dance because the fact is, the majority leader is right to seek votes on these district court nominees. He seeks to secure Senate votes for 17 highly qualified Federal district court nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee.
