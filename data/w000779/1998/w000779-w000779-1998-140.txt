Domenici, in working with me on this matter. My purpose in offering the original amendment in Committee was truth in budgeting. The truth I am seeking has been masked by inflation. With inflation being lower than anticipated, the CBO and GAO estimate there is as much as a $3 billion inflationary windfall surplus in the budget for 1999, and as much as a $26 billion surplus over the next five years. My concern is the American taxpayer never sees this inflationary windfall and probably doesn't even know it exists. The money is not accounted for by the agencies and is not returned to the taxpayer. Unfortunately, the windfall appears to end up as walk-around money in the pockets of bureaucrats. That is why I am pleased that together with the Chairman of the Budget Committee we will request the General Accounting Office to tell Congress by May 15 the exact amount of the inflationary windfall for FY99, how the agencies intend to use the inflationary windfall and how CBO can go about making this calculation for future years. Our request will also direct the GAO by August 15 to develop for us a methodology for correctly calculating inflationary estimates that is applicable to both defense and non-defense spending and how the agencies expect to use the additional funds. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record the GAO's chart for FY99 Economic Adjustments as well as the CBO's March 24, 1998 letter to me on the inflationary windfall.  There being no objection, the material is ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1998.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget      Office (CBO) has estimated adjustments to budget authority      for defense programs, as allocated under last year's budget      resolution for the 1999-2002 period, that would preserve its      implied purchasing power for nonsalary expenses given the      changes in CBO's estimates of inflation. Specifically, you      asked us to adjust the year-by-year amounts in the budget      resolution using actual inflation during 1997 and new      estimates of inflation for the 1998-2002 period.       Last year's budget resolution called for defense budget      authority of $271.5 billion for 1999 and $289.6 billion for      2002. A year ago, CBO projected that the chain-type price      index for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow by an      average of 2.5 percent a year during the 1997-2002 period.      CBO currently projects that annual inflation, as measured by      the GDP index, will grow by an average of 2.2 percent over      that six-year period. Thus, the budget authority in last      year's budget resolution could be reduced and still maintain      the same inflation-adjusted levels.       Under its current inflation projection, CBO estimates that      lowering last year's budget resolution for defense      appropriations by $1.7 billion in 1999 and $9.8 billion over      the 1999-2002 period would provide about the same level of      real resources for nonsalary purchases as assumed a year ago      for that period. Similarly, we also calculated adjustments      for 2003 given the assumptions specified in your request. If      last year's defense budget authority for 2003 was pegged at      $297.8 billion, reducing that figure by $3.5 billion would      maintain the purchasing power for nonsalary expenses. The      enclosed table shows the adjustments to budget authority and      the corresponding changes in outlays for the five-year      period.       CBO does not attempt to forecast the prices of defense-     related goods and services. Instead, we follow the common      practice of using a general measure of inflation--The GDP      price index--to adjust purchasing power. The lower growth in      our inflation forecast stems from an unexpectedly rapid      decline in import and computer prices and slower growth in      medical care prices. Although these factors could affect      defense-related purchasing power, the changes in assumptions      for the growth in the GDP price index do not necessarily      indicate a commensurate change in purchasing power for the      defense budget.       If you have further questions, we will be pleased to answer      them. The CBO staff contacts are John Peterson, who can be      reached at 226-2753 for questions on price indexes, and Kent      Christensen, who can be reached at 226-2840 for questions      pertaining to their impact on the defense budget.           Sincerely,                                                  June E. O'Neill,     Director.                                  ____                         INFLATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR BUDGET FUNCTION 050, NATIONAL DEFENSE                                    [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   1999       2000       2001       2002     \2\ 2003    Total----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1998 Budget Resolution:    Budget Authority \1\......................      271.5      275.4      281.8      289.6      297.8    1,416.1    Outlays...................................      266.5      269.0      270.7      273.1      280.8    1,360.1Adjustments to Reflect Current Inflation Projections:\3\    Budget Authority..........................       -1.7       -2.3       -2.7       -3.1       -3.5      -13.4    Outlays...................................       -0.8       -1.6       -2.2       -2.7       -2.9      -10.2Adjusted Levels:    Budget Authority \1\......................      269.8      273.1      279.1      286.5      294.3    1,402.7    Outlays...................................      265.7      267.4      268.5      270.4      277.9   1,349.9----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ These figures represent funding for discretionary defense programs.\2\ The 1998 budget resolution contained budget authority and outlay levels through 2002.
