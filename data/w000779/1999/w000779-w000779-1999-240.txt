President, Senator Lautenberg, the Senator from New Jersey, is interested in speaking on this as well. He is not here at this time.  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of our time be allowed to go to Senator Lautenberg. I believe it is just under 5 minutes. It is my understanding there will be a vote on this measure at 2 o'clock or sometime in that time vicinity, so he would have to get here, obviously, fairly soon. But I ask unanimous consent the remainder of our time be allocated to Senator Lautenberg.
