Speaker, tonight I want to discuss an important issue that is significantly impacting our economy but has not received nearly enough attention and action by the administration and this Congress. If the issue is not addressed, it will continue to drag down and harm our already shaky national economy.  I am referring to the deterioration of the commercial real estate sector. Now, when I speak of commercial real estate, I am talking about properties that can be found in every community in America: retail properties, office space, industrial facilities, hotels, and apartments. Similar to the residential real estate crisis we experienced, the commercial real estate market faces significant strains as a result of declining property values, refinancing difficulties, and economic uncertainty.  Commercial real estate values throughout the United States are collapsing, going down as much as 40 to 50 percent in some regions. We have seen this happen in parts of southern California, in my own congressional district. I know we have seen it in many other parts of the country from New York to Idaho and Nevada to Florida. Most experts predict that the declining trend in commercial real estate values will continue through 2011 and 2012.  Many economists are concerned by this trend because the health of our commercial real estate market has a direct and lasting impact on the stability of thousands of small businesses, and small and midsize banks, which could result in significant job losses across the country. The commercial real estate sector provides more than 9 million jobs and generates billions of dollars in Federal, State, and local tax revenue.  Additionally, many property owners are underwater. An analysis by Deutsch Bank indicates that of the almost $1.4 trillion in commercial real estate loans that will mature over the next 4 years, as many as 65 percent will struggle with refinancing, even if they are performing loans with payments being made on time.  The Congressional Oversight Panel, created by Congress in 2008 to review the current state of our Nation's financial markets and regulatory system, dedicated an entire report to the commercial real estate liquidity crisis, entitled ``Commercial Real Estate Losses and the Risk to Financial Stability,'' which was released on February 11 of this year. The report estimates that bank losses alone could range as high as $200 billion to $300 billion. The panel wrote, ``A significant wave of commercial mortgage defaults would trigger economic damage that could touch the lives of nearly every American.''  This week and next, many of my fellow colleagues in Congress will be visited by members of the National Association of Realtors as part of their annual meeting in Washington, D.C. They will talk about how the commercial real estate market is in the midst of a serious financial crisis and share stories of how small businesses across the country continue to suffer. Many of my colleagues and economic experts agree that the continuing crisis in the commercial real estate market could lead to a double-dip recession.  Due to the growing economic threat of the faltering commercial real estate market, I spearheaded a bipartisan effort with my friend from Pennsylvania, Congressman Paul Kanjorski, to raise these concerns to Secretary Tim Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on January 29 of this year. The letter, signed by 77 of our colleagues, called for the establishment of a clear method for measuring the effectiveness of recently announced commercial real estate loan modification guidance. Furthermore, the letter called on Secretary Geithner and Chairman Bernanke to institute metrics that will allow banks to more clearly differentiate performing versus nonperforming loans in order to treat them appropriately.  On February 17 of this year, I once again joined Mr. Kanjorski to author a letter addressed to the heads of the FDIC, OTC, OCC, and NCUA to bring to their attention our concerns and highlight the findings of the February 11 Congressional Oversight Panel report on ``Commercial Real Estate Losses and the Risk to Financial Stability.'' The letter ``urged the regulators to work together and work with the Treasury and the Fed to minimize the impact this problem will have to our economy.''  On March 16 Secretary Geithner testified before the House Appropriations Committee regarding the fiscal year 2011 budget and economic outlook. At the hearing I asked the Secretary directly what steps he intended to take to address the liquidity problems in thecommercial real estate sector. Secretary Geithner's response was, ``We have a ways to go to get through the broader adjustment in the commercial real estate that is still ahead of us.''                              {time}  1615  The administration must take deliberate action to enhance liquidity in the commercial real estate market to avoid the derailment of our economic recovery. Congress can play a role in advancing solutions by closely examining the current status of commercial mortgage market liquidity through oversight hearings with Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and other regulators. I call on the Financial Services Committee to hold such a hearing by the summer to reveal the true state of this sector of our economy and discuss regulatory and legislative fixes. The upcoming field hearing on May 17 in Chicago is a good start, but more attention needs to be made. The spotlight of oversight is all Congress needs to do at this time--the power to do something about this problem is in the administration's hands already.  In closing, I truly hope the administration will take the necessary steps to prevent further economic damage and provide a fix for commercial real estate.                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 2010.     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,     Secretary, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.     Hon. Ben S. Bernanke,     Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Geithner and Chairman Bernanke: As you know,      the financial crisis continues to have a dampening effect      throughout the credit markets. The commercial real estate      (CRE) market, in particular, continues to experience      difficult credit accessibility conditions. Moreover, the      scarcity of credit in the $63 trillion CRE sector poses a      dangerous threat to our financial system just as our economy      has begun to show signs of recovery.       Earlier this month real estate data provider Trepp      announced that the delinquency rate for loans underlying      commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) ballooned 500      percent in 2009, surpassing 6 percent in December for the      first time. Additionally, the CMBS market has all but shut      down over the past year making it more difficult for CRE      owners to sell or refinance.       We appreciate the acknowledgement by federal regulators of      this situation in October, when the Board of Governors of the      Federal Reserve System, along with the Federal Deposit      Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the      Currency, the National Credit Union Administration, and the      Office of Thrift Supervision, issued a policy statement      advising financial institutions to extend and/or restructure      loans backed by income-producing and/or development      properties whenever possible in order to minimize losses as      well as to stabilize overall asset values in the communities      they serve.       While the regulatory guidance is a relatively recent      occurrence, we remain concerned by early indications that it      may not yet be having the desired impact in stabilizing the      CRE market. While some properties are in desperate need of      modification due to the economic downturn, we are not      convinced these loans are being serviced properly or in an      efficient manner. Of even more concern, anecdotal evidence      suggests that regulators continue to encourage lenders to      write down the value of performing loans, whose payments may      well be current and, in some instance, even call the loan.      This further exacerbates the crisis by creating defaults in      properties that were able to meet their debt servicing.       To ensure the recent CRE loan modification guidance will      have a positive and stabilizing effect, and to protect the      broader economy from further disruptions, we urge you to      establish a clear method for measuring and evaluating its      effectiveness. Furthermore, we encourage you to institute      metrics to more clearly differentiate performing versus non-     performing loans as well as any other steps that provide      lending institutions with more confidence in assessing CRE      loans. We also call upon you to make clear public statements      encouraging lenders to continue to make credit available for      performing assets as a means of restoring confidence and      long-term value in the CRE market.       In sum, we strongly believe that regulators must take      continued steps to mitigate ongoing turmoil in the CRE sector      before it becomes a full-fledged crisis, forestalls our      economic recovery, and possibly requires additional taxpayer-     funded capital injections. Consistent with all applicable law      and regulation, thank you for the consideration of our views      and your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,         Paul E.

Hon. Sheila C. Bair,     Chairman, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington,          DC.     Hon. John C. Dugan,     Comptroller of the Currency, Office of the Comptroller of the          Currency, Washington, DC.     Mr. John E. Bowman,     Acting Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Deborah Matz,     Chairman of the Board, National Credit Union Association,          Alexandria, VA.       Dear Chairman Bair, Comptroller Dugan, Acting Director      Bowman, and Chairman Matz: As you are aware, the commercial      real estate market continues to face significant strains as a      result of declining property values, refinancing      difficulties, and economic uncertainty. Some have predicted      that these problems have the potential to cause hundreds of      billions of dollars in losses as loans come due in the next      few years.       We now write to bring your attention to a recent report by      the Congressional Oversight Panel, entitled ``Commercial Real      Estate Losses and the Risk to Financial Stability,'' released      on February 11, 2010. The report indicates that about $1.4      trillion in commercial real estate loans will reach the end      of their terms between now and 2014 and that nearly half of      these mortgages are currently underwater as property values      have declined and continue to do so. The report estimates      that losses at banks alone could range as high as $200      billion to $300 billion.       Moreover, the Congressional Oversight Panel found that the      impact of massive commercial mortgage defaults could be far      reaching:       ``A significant wave of commercial mortgage defaults would      trigger economic damage that could touch the lives of nearly      every American. Empty office complexes, hotels, and retail      stores could lead directly to lost jobs. Foreclosures on      apartment complexes could push families out of their      residences, even if they had never missed a rent payment.      Banks that suffer, or are afraid of suffering, commercial      mortgage losses could grow even more reluctant to lend, which      could in turn further reduce access to credit for more      businesses and families and accelerate a negative economic      cycle.''       The full report can be found online at http://cop.senate.gov/reports/library/report-021110-cop.cfm.       The findings of the Congressional Oversight Panel have only      heightened our concerns about the need for the government and      regulators to act to mitigate a serious problem before it      becomes a major drag on our financial system. Joined by 77 of      our House colleagues, we recently sent to Treasury Secretary      Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke      the enclosed letter about the impending troubles in the      commercial real estate sector. We called upon them to take      action to address this problem, and we urge each of you to      work together and with them to minimize the impact this      problem will have on our economy.       In sum, thank you for your consideration of our concerns.      Please also continue keep us regularly advised of your      progress in addressing this serious problem.           Sincerely,     Paul Kanjorski,       Member of Congress.
