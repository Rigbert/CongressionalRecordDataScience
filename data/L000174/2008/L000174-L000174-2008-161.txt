.  Sixteen years ago, University of Vermont basketball coach Tom Brennan made a guest radio appearance on Steve Cormier's radio show. The two of them hit it off, not only as a duo, but with listeners. What started as a guest spot ended up becoming an extremely popular morning radio show for 16 years.  Recently, Coach Brennan decided to go out on top, as he did when he retired from the University of Vermont following three consecutive America East Conference championships. ``Corm & the Coach'' will air for the final time on Wednesday, July 2, 2008. Fortunately for Vermonters, Corm will remain on the air, continuing to keep us both entertained and informed, and Coach Brennan will continue to provide expert college basketball analysis on ESPN.  I have had the good fortune to appear on ``Corm & the Coach'' many times, and thought it important to take this opportunity to extend my appreciation to both of them. In honor of a great 16 years of ``Corm & the Coach,'' I ask unanimous consent that the article by Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press, Corm To Carry On, Without The Coach, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in The Record as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, June 11, 2008]                  Corm To Carry on, Without the Coach                           (By Mike Donoghue)       ``Corm and the Coach,'' the popular morning drive-time      radio show that helped thousands of Champlain Valley      listeners wake up for almost 16 years, will sign off July 2.       Tom Brennan, who retired as the University of Vermont men's      basketball coach in 2005, plans to leave local radio next      month, he and co-host Steve Cormier said Tuesday.       ``I'm just really tired. I just don't want to turn into a      cranky old man,'' Brennan said.       ``I tried to make things better for people,'' he said. ``I      just knew it was time for me to pack it in. I'm very      appreciative of the faithful listeners. It was really nice      when you would hear from them that we had helped make their      day,'' he said.       Cormier, who is also program director at WCPV-FM, will      continue to do the morning show.       Cormier said more details will be released this morning on      the ``Corm and the Coach'' show, which airs Monday through      Friday from 5 to 9 a.m. on Champ 101.3 (WCPV-FM) in      Colchester and 102.1 in Randolph. ``The Best of Corm and the      Coach'' is part of the Saturday morning broadcasts.       Brennan will continue to work as an in-studio basketball      analyst for ESPN, which he joined in 2005.       Cormier said Brennan's departure has nothing to do with the      pending sale of the station by Clear Channel to Vox      Communications this summer. The sale is expected to be      completed by midsummer, Cormier said.       ``He's just tired. Tom said if it was an afternoon show, it      would be fine, but getting up at 4 a.m. is not,'' Cormier      said. ``I got him 10 more years than I thought I would.''       ``Corm and the Coach'' began with Brennan stopping by to do      morning sports reports, but blossomed into one of the highest      rated local shows through the years.       During the show, Brennan has enjoyed providing wake-up      calls to bleary-eyed opposing coaches, members of the media      and other newsmakers. He read his poetry about current events      over the airwaves and is in demand as a public speaker and      master of ceremonies. The show has supported a number of      charities, including its own golf tournament.       Brennan coached the Catamounts for 19 years. The team won      the America East championships and made NCAA tournament      appearances in his final three seasons. The highlight of his      career was UVM's upset of Syracuse in the 2005 NCAAs.       Cormier said the initial game plan is to continue the show      with producer Carolyn ``Burkie'' Lloyd until the new owners      take over, at which time discussions will be held. He said      guest celebrities might be asked to co-host.       ``All good things must come to an end,'' Cormier said.                          ____________________
