 President, as previously ordered, the vote on the conference report will now occur on Tuesday at 2:25 p.m. I announce to the membership that the vote scheduled for Monday, April 27, at 5:30 p.m. now be postponed until 6 p.m. on Monday, and will be on an executive matter to be determined on Friday, April 24, by the majority leader after consultation with the Democratic leader. Also, under the previous order, when the Senate reconvenes on Monday and following morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the NATO treaty. It is hoped that there will be good debate on the treaty and that Members who wish to offer amendments will come to the floor to do so. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes during Friday's session, and the next rollcall vote will occur on Monday, April 27, at 6 p.m.                          ____________________
