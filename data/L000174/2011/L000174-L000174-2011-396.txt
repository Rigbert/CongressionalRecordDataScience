On May 4, the National Inventors Hall of Fame, in partnership with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, will hold its 39th Annual National Inventors Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.  Our Nation's inventors are the catalyst of our economy. Their inventions, when protected by a strong, efficient, and balanced patent system lead to new products and processes for American consumers and new jobs for American workers.  Earlier this year, the United States Senate passed overwhelmingly the America Invents Act, to ensure that our Nation's inventors and innovators have a 21st Century patent system that speeds high quality patents to market. The United States House Committee on the Judiciary recently voted to approve a very similar version of this legislation on a strong bipartisan vote. I look forward to working together to get the America Invents Act to the President's desk and providing our inventors with the legal landscape they need to flourish.  I appreciate the efforts of Inventors Digest Magazine and others who have promoted National Inventors Month.                          ____________________
