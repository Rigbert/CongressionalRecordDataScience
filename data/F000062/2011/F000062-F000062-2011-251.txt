 President, I don't often agree with the organization Gun Owners of America, a group that thinks the National Rifle Association is too liberal. But I do agree with them on this issue. They are part of a coalition of 23 conservative organizations that wrote to the leaders about this, arguing: ``Our competitors should have to `harmonize up' to our superior intellectual property regime, rather than our having to weaken our patent system and `harmonize down' to their levels.'' Other signatories on this letter include Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum; Edwin Meese III, former Attorney General under President Reagan; the American Conservative Union; and the Christian Coalition.  I think this is really a battle between the small inventors beginning in the garage, like those who developed the Apple computer that was nowhere, and who, through the first-to-invent system, were able to create one of the greatest companies in the world. America's great strength is the cutting-edge of innovation. The first-to-invent system has served us well. If it is not broke, don't fix it. I don't really believe it is broke.  I am delighted to see that my cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from California, is also on the floor on this matter, and I welcome her support.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                                     June 1, 2010.     Re Effective repeal of the one-year ``grace period'' under S.          515, the Patent Reform Act of 2010.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators, on behalf of the undersigned companies and      organizations whose survival and new job creations depend on      patent protection, we are writing regarding the patent reform      legislation, S. 515. We write today to draw renewed attention      to a proposed rewrite of 35 U.S.C. Sec. 102, which      effectively eliminates the American one-year grace period      during which current law permits an inventor to test and vet      an invention, publically demonstrate it to obtain advance      sales revenue and seek investors before filing the patent      application. No representatives of small business were called      to testify during five years of Senate hearings on patent      legislation. This issue has been overshadowed by the debate      on other provisions of S. 515, but it is no less disruptive      to the technology investments fostered by the patent system.      The proposed sweeping changes in Sec. 102 is another issue      where some large, incumbent firms are seeking a change to the      detriment of small companies, new entrants, startup      innovators, independent inventors, and future businesses.       U.S. patent law has long allowed inventors a one-year      ``grace period,'' so that they can develop, vet, and perfect      their invention, begin commercialization, advance sales, seek      investors and business partners, and obtain sufficient funds      to prosecute the patent application. During the grace period,      many inventors learn about starting a technology-based      business for the first time. They must obtain investment      capital and often must learn from outside patent counsel (at      considerable expense) about patenting and related deadlines      and how to set up confidentiality agreements. Many startups      or small businesses are in a race against insolvency during      this early stage. The grace period protects them during this      period from loss of patent rights due to any activities,      information leaks or inadvertent unprotected disclosures      prior to filing their patent applications.       Small businesses and startups are significantly more      exposed than large firms in this regard because they must      rely on far greater and earlier private disclosure of the      invention to outside parties. This is often required for      raising investment capital and for establishing strategic      marketing partnerships, licensing and distribution channels.      In contrast, large established firms have substantial      patenting experience, often have in-house patent attorneys      and often use internal R&D investment funds. They can also      use their own marketing, sales and distribution chains.      Therefore, they seldom need early disclosure of their      inventions to outside parties.       S. 515 amends Sec. 102 to confer the patent right to the      first-inventor-to-file as opposed to the first-to-invent as      provided under current law. This change is purportedly made      for the purpose of eliminating costly contests among near-     simultaneous inventors claiming the same subject matter,      called ``interferences.'' The goal of eliminating      interferences is achievable by simple amendment of only      Sec. 102(g) to a first-inventor-to-file criterion. However,      under the heading of First-Inventor-To-File, S. 515 does far      more, it changes all of Sec. 102, redefining the prior art      and practically gutting the American one-year grace period.       Without the grace period, the patent system would become      far more expensive and less effective for small companies. It      would create the need to ``race to the patent office'' more      frequently and at great expense before every new idea is      fully developed or vetted. The pressure for more filings will      affect all American inventors--not only a few that end up in      interferences under current law. Because filing decisions      must be made based on information that will be preliminary      and immature, the bill forces poor patenting decisions.      Applicants will skip patent protection for some ultimately      valuable inventions, and will bear great costs for      applications for inventions that (with the additional      information that is developed during the grace period year of      current law) prove to be useless, and subsequently abandoned.      The evidence for this high abandonment trend under systems      having no grace period is readily available from European      application statistics.       The proponents of S. 515 suggest that the harm of the weak      grace period of proposed Sec. 102(b) can be overcome if an      inventor publishes a description of the invention, allowing      filing within a year following such publication. Underlying      this suggestion are two errors. First, no business willingly      publishes complete technical disclosures that will tip off      all competitors to a company's technological direction. We      generally do not, and will not, publish our inventions right      when we make them, some 2.5 years before the 18-month      publication or 5-7 years before the patent grant.      Confidentiality is crucial to small companies.       Second, even if we were to avail ourselves of such      conditional grace period by publishing first before filing,      we would instantly forfeit all foreign patent rights because      such publication would be deemed prior art under foreign      patent law. No patent attorney will advise their client to      publish every good idea they conceive in order to gain the      grace period of S. 515. The publication-conditioned ``grace      period'' in S. 515 is a useless construct proposed by parties      intent on compelling American inventors to ``harmonize'' de      facto with national patent systems that lack grace periods.      S. 515 forces U.S. inventors to make the ``Hobson's Choice''      of losing their foreign patent rights or losing the American      grace period. It should be clear that the only way for      American inventors to continue to benefit from a grace period      and be able to obtain foreign patent rights, is to keep      intact the current secret grace period that relies on      invention date and a diligent reduction to practice.       The American grace period of current law ensures that new      inventions originating in American small companies and      startups--the sector of the economy that creates the largest      number of new jobs--receive patent protection essential for      survival and that American small businesses' access to      foreign markets is not destroyed. We urge you to amend S. 515      so that Sec. 102 remains intact in order to preserve the      American grace period in its full scope and force.       Thank you for your consideration of our views and concerns.           Sincerely,                                        (Signed by 108 Companies).
