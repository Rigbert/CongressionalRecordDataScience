  Just like the Defense and Energy and Water bills, these bills were crafted in a bipartisan way. Yet some of my Democratic colleagues threatened to amend these bills with abortion-related poison pills.  Poison pills, as we all know--just like restrictions on transfer authority--are expressly--expressly--prohibited by the terms of the budget deal that we all agreed to just a few weeks ago. Again, both parties agreed to those terms.  Regardless, I am interested in moving the appropriations process forward, and I believe Senator Leahy is too. I am interested in doing so consistent with the budget agreement we agreed to.  That is why the chairman of the Labor-HHS and Senate Foreign Operations Subcommittees, Senator Blunt and Senator Graham, have released the versions of these bills that the Appropriations Committee intended to consider last week.  Both bills were crafted with bipartisan input, and both are free of poison pills. We are proud of the work that went into those bills and want to be transparent about how we intend to proceed, but before we vote on cloture, I want to remind my colleagues of our shared success last year and our common interest in moving the process forward this year.  In fiscal year 2019--last year--we achieved more success in passing appropriations bills than we had done in 20 years. The linchpin of that success was an agreement between me and Senator Leahy, the vice chairman of the committee, to ban poison pills from appropriation bills. Both sides upheld that agreement right here on the floor, and we funded 75 percent of the government on time.  That is the framework the bipartisan budget deal was modeled after so we could replicate what we did last year. The purpose of the budget agreement is to replicate the success we had last year, as I just said, to ensure that we do not revert to the dysfunctional appropriations process of years past. That is why it is so important that we adhere to it now. I think the American people want us to do it and do it now.  It is all the more important considering what we are trying to fund with this package. It contains critical investments, not just in health, education and energy projects but in national security, our military.  I believe the situation unfolding in Saudi Arabia should serve as a grave reminder to all of us that we must set aside partisan politics and do our job to provide our military the resources it needs to keep America safe. It should also remind us that our main adversaries--China and Russia--never relent in their efforts to destabilize us anywhere in the world. That is why we must do our part to ensure that they fail. We cannot do that without stable funding for our military and for certainty for our soldiers.  Failure to prioritize funding for our national defense would undermine the Pentagon's planning process, hinder our commanders' ability to counter threats to America, and threaten the safety of our Nation. That is unacceptable.  We have the opportunity today to move forward together to bolster our national security. We have a framework for success that we have used last year. Let's use it now.  I hope my Democratic colleagues will recommit to the terms of the budget deal that they agreed to in spirit and in fact. I hope they will set aside partisan politics and do right by our military, the numerous agencies that would receive funding in this package, and our constituents--the American people--and let us get on with the business of the people.  Again, this afternoon I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture.                             Cloture Motion
