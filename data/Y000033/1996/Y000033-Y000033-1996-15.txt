Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California [Mr. McKeon].  (Mr. McKEON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bill, and I commend the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young] and the gentleman from Utah [Mr. Hansen] for their leadership in bringing it to the floor.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the conference report on the Omnibus Parks and Public Land Management Act.  This legislation is important for numerous reasons; many of which impact California. For example, this conference report creates a public-private Presidio Trust to manage hundreds of historical buildings which cover more than 1,400 scenic acres at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Both residents of my district and throughout the State of California have visited this site and enjoyed its beauty. With passage of this bill, that will continue to happen for years to come.  Additionally, this conference report also contains a provision which I have worked hard for in behalf of my constituents in the Santa Clarita Valley. I have included language which protects a pristine canyon contained in the Angeles National Forest. For many years, some have wanted to destroy this beautiful treasure by constructing a 190-million ton landfill.  Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to announce today that the Omnibus Parks bill will preserve and protect Elsmere Canyon and prevent its destruction; not only for the residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, but for all residents of southern California.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this historic, environmental legislation. It truly reflects a commitment to preserve our natural resources both today and in the future.
