 It is essentially about jobs. After looking at this very carefully and talking with independent oil producers and the Department of Energy, I believe that this legislation will, as the Senators from Alaska have stated on the floor earlier, be helpful in producing jobs in the State of California.  The Department of Energy has some very generous estimates in their report. I am not sure I believe the totality of this, but suffice it to say that they predict 5,000 to 15,000 new jobs very quickly and as many as 10,000 to 25,000 jobs by the decade end, most of which they identify as taking place in Kern County, CA.  I ask the Senator from Alaska if he concurs with this energy observation and would he agree that this would be job-producing for the State of California?
