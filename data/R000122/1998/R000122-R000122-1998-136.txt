President, ten years ago the Rams of the University of Rhode Island, shocked sports fans throughout the country when they beat the #3 seeded Orangemen of Syracuse and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA men's basketball tournament.  It took a few years, but the giant slayers from little Rhody are back. Last weekend, the Rams shocked the basketball world again, defeating the indomitable, #1 seeded Jayhawks of Kansas. With a win tonight over Valparaiso, URI will advance to the Elite Eight.  But, Mr. President, don't sell this team short. They may be smaller than their opponents. They readily admit that. But they know how to win, just ask anyone from Lawrence, Kansas.  I should add, Mr. President, with regard to tonight's game, that beyond the match-ups on the floor, there will be a contest on the sidelines. As many have commented, URI Coach Jim Harrick will do battle with his son, Jim Jr., an assistant coach at Valparaiso. At stake will be family bragging rights that will last a very long time. In this game, however, I'd bet on the elder Coach Harrick. Indeed, Mr. President, I expect to be back on the Senate floor next week to talk about the Rams and the Final Four.                          ____________________
