I appreciate the information.  I understand he anticipates a substantive resolution on the Solomon amendment and the court ruling thereon. But can I ask you, is it your understanding that a resolution regarding the recent Palestinian elections will come to the floor next week as well? Is that possible?  Mr. DeLAY. I know that you and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) are working on this bill and will continue to work on it. It has every possibility if it is done, maybe we could do it next week.
