 President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his observations. He certainly makes the point well that what we are asking here in the underlying bill--insisted upon by Senator Bond--is not at all unreasonable.  I heard the Senator from Oregon talk about the failure to pass this amendment being a poison pill. Let's make it clear what the poison pill is. The poison pill is passing this amendment, which unravels the core bill that was negotiated over a lengthy, and sometimes painful, process of many months. If the motion to table the Schumer amendment is not agreed to, then I fear passage of this bill is seriously in question.  As the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Montana have pointed out, requiring identification is not unusual. I thought I heard the Senator from Oregon talk only about photo ID, and I will defer to my friend from Missouri. Is the Senator from Kentucky correct that a photo ID is only one of a number of different options that could satisfy the antifraud provisionsinsisted upon, and agreed to, in the underlying bill?
