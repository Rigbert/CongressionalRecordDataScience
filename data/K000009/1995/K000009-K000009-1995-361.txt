Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding podiatric medical physician, Dr. Marvin Shapiro of Sylvania, OH, who has been a leader and an advocate of podiatric medicine for 63 years. Although he officially retired in 1984, Dr. Shapiro, now 85, has remained a strong voice for his profession, serving this year as the only podiatrist-delegate to the White House Conference on Aging.  In 1959, Dr. Shapiro was president of his professional organization, the American Podiatric Medical Association [APMA]. A gifted speaker and lecturer, he earned the title of ``Foot Ambassador'' during his term as president when he represented America's podiatric physicians as part of the State Department's People-to-People Program in England, France, and the USSR. Later, in 1963, he visited Poland, Turkey, the USSR, Israel, and Malta under the same program.  This morning I had the pleasure of hosting a breakfast at which Dr. Shapiro presented to the National Library of Medicine a rare and wonderful book he received as a gift while participating in the People-to-People program. The book, ``De Calceis Hebraeorum,'' by Antoniii Baynaei, catalogues every reference to the foot found in the Old Testament. Each verse is published in Latin, Hebrew, and Greek. The volume is beautifully illustrated with both medical and artistic drawings of the human foot. The book was written in 1715. I am very happy that this treasure has found a home at the National Library of Medicine.  Dr. Shapiro was also responsible for the first joint meeting between the American Podiatric Medical Association and the American Medical Association in 1959, which did much to enhance mutual understanding between the two health care professions.  To help educate other physicians and the public about podiatric medicine and the importance of foot care, Dr. Shapiro instituted the audiovisual department at the APMA nearly 60 years ago, and he has produced many exhibits and countless slides and videos. His name is also on the APMA's Marvin Shapiro Audiovisual Achievement Award, an international competition for long-term medical contributions in the field.  His outstanding career began as a premedical student at the University of Toledo in 1927, and he was graduated from the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine in 1932. Dr. Shapiro founded the podiatry department at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Toledo and has received many awards and honors from this respected institution. In 1980, Dr. Shapiro received the APMA's highest honor, the Distinguished Service Citation.  I applaud Dr. Shapiro on his magnificent career and his life-long efforts to keep Americans walking and to advance the study of therapeutic medical treatment for the foot and human health. It is a delight to have this leader as a constituent.                          ____________________
