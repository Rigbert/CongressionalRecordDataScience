 President, I rise today to voice my concern about the efforts to expand the Visa Waiver Program in the 9/11 commission report bill and to offer an amendment that will cap the unlimited expansion of this program.  I believe the bill as offered on the floor will make us less safe, not more safe with respect to this huge program called Visa Waiver.  The bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to expand the Visa Waiver Program without limits. My amendment would limit this discretion based on a 10 percent visa refusal rate or on the actual visa overstay rate.  The Visa Waiver Program provides an extraordinary exception to our immigration laws. It allows the citizens of 27 nations to visit this country by merely showing up on the day of departure with a passport from their home country. In 2004, the State Department reported that 15.6 million people came to this country as part of this program. I am told that in 2005, unofficially, the number was at least 15.5 million and in 2006, the number was at least 15.6 million.  We have no way of knowing how many left because we do not have an exit system.  The bill on the floor today changes the Visa Waiver Program in a number of key ways.  First, it adds some good security measures, such as the expedited reporting of lost and stolen travel documents; and the exchange of information on terrorist watchlist. It also authorizes the Department of Homeland Security to develop an electronic travel authorization program so that all persons entering the U.S. will have to apply for clearance to enter the U.S. in advance of their trip. And it requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop a system to track all the foreign visitors who leave the U.S. via our airports--but not our seaports or land ports. This has been an unmet goal, however, year after year.  I welcome and support the enhanced security measures included in the bill. They are long overdue.  Second--and here is the problem--the bill allows the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to fundamentally change the way countries are admitted into the visa waiver program, and thus, who can come into the U.S. without getting a visa.  Under current law, a country is eligible for this program so long as the vast majority--at least 97 percent--of its nationals can get a visa when they apply for one. The percentage of people who are rejected when they apply for a visa is called the ``visa refusal rate'' and that percentage must be under 3 percent for a country to participate in the program.  The rationale is that if the overwhelming majority of visitors satisfy requirements for a U.S. visa when they apply, we should not waste our resources and the time of U.S. consular officers to evaluate every single visa application. The 3 percent rate means that 97 percent of these applicants will return to their home country for one reason or another. They have family and earn a satisfactory living.  But even with a 3 percent rejection rate, the Visa Waiver Program is a security problem.  Convicted terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui from France and ``shoe-bomber'' Richard Reid from Great Britain both boarded flights to the United States with passports issued by Visa Waiver Program countries.  On August 10 of this past year, British police charged 17 suspects with a terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives carried on board several airliners traveling from the United Kingdom to the United States. The key suspects were reported to be British-born Muslims, eligible to travel to the U.S. with just a passport in hand.  For that reason, I believe that the current Visa Waiver Program is the soft underbelly of our national security.  But this bill undermines even the scant protection afforded by our current laws in that it allows the administration to admit new countries into the program with complete disregard for how many people were previously rejected when they applied for a U.S. visa. My amendment would provide a meaningful limit to that discretion.  This bill does not affect just a handful of countries. It would affect anyand every country whose nationals travel to the United States.  As a matter of fact, the ``roadmap'' countries--or countries that the administration is currently talking to about inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program--total 19. So the Departments of State and Homeland Security are actively talking with 19 countries for acceptance into this Program.  A significant number of these 19 countries have visa rejection rates that are well above 3 percent. They are marked with an asterisk, and total 13 of the 19. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart showing by country the rejection rates.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Country Name                        2006 Refusal Rate (Percent)Argentina*..........................................................6.7Brazil*............................................................13.2Bulgaria*..........................................................17.5Cyprus..............................................................2.2Czech Republic*.....................................................9.4Estonia*............................................................7.1Greece..............................................................2.2Hungary*...........................................................12.7Israel..............................................................4.2Korea, South........................................................3.6Latvia*............................................................21.6Lithuania*.........................................................27.7Malta...............................................................2.8Poland*............................................................26.2Romania*...........................................................34.1Slovakia*..........................................................16.0Taiwan..............................................................3.1Turkey*............................................................15.4Uruguay*...........................................................12.6
