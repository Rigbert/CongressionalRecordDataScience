 President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I rise to oppose this Graham-Bumpers formula. I must say--and I say it respectfully--this formula is sudden death for California. It will cost California about $1 billion. It is enormous in its impact.  There is no fiscal year in which California comes close to what is offered in the Dole bill, and I think the Dole bill formula is bad for California. So that is why I say this is sudden death.  Frankly, I respect the Senator from Arkansas very much, but how a formula can be justified, which essentially says we will reward States who do very little for their poor people and we will seriously disadvantage States that are willing to do more for their poor people, I have a hard time understanding that logic.  This is a Government that has practiced devolution. This is a Government that has said more and more that it is the responsibility of the State. Yet, in this bill, they seek to punish those who have a high maintenance of effort.  For California, over the 5-year period, this bill will cost $1 billion. The impact is enormous. There is no amendment that has been proposed that has a greater negative impact on the State of California than does this.  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.
