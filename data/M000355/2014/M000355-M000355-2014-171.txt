 President, I rise today to honor an accomplished educator from my home State, the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Lewis D. Carter Jr. will retire from his position of superintendent of the Monroe Country Schools on July 1--nearly 40 years after beginning his career in education.  An intense passion for education runs throughout the Carter family. Lewis's grandfather was the first in the family to hold the post of superintendent of the Monroe County Schools in the early 1900s. His father also held the position for 28 years until his retirement in 1980, and his great-aunt and his great-uncle held the same position near the time of his grandfather. For Carter, teaching the next generation of children might as well be ingrained in his DNA.  Carter got his start in 1975 teaching health and PE. Since then, he has held positions across the education field. In 1991, he was made principal of Tompkinsville Elementary School. In 1994, he began 10 years as the director of adult education, in addition to coordinating the School to Work program. More recently he served as the deputy executive director of the Kentucky Education Cabinet--an assignment that immediately preceded his current position.  Carter will have plenty to keep him busy in retirement. In addition to his large family he and his wife of 42 years, Sheila, have two children and six grandchildren--Lewis will let you know that he has a ``hunting, fishing and golfing list'' that requires his attention.  While Lewis can look forward to some much deserved fun in his retirement, he will be sorely missed in the Monroe County School System. Lewis's big heart and passion for education serve as an example for us all. I ask that my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in honoring this exemplary citizen.  Mr. President, The Daily Times recently published an article chronicling Lewis D. Carter Jr.'s career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:                 [From the Daily Times, April 11, 2014]                           Carter Will Retire                           (By Gina Kinslow)       After five years as superintendent of Monroe County      schools, Lewis Carter is stepping down.       Carter announced his retirement Thursday night during the      Monroe County Board of Education meeting. It becomes      effective July 1.       After making his announcement, staff members and others      present for the meeting, applauded and gave him a standing      ovation.       Carter cited his age as one reason for retiring. He is 62.      ``I think it's time [to retire],'' he said. ``I feel like      it's time.''       Another reason for retiring is the success the school      system has achieved in the last five years.       ``I want to make sure when I retire that everything is      good,'' he said.       Carter read a lengthy list of accomplishments for the      school district before announcing his retirement.       ``When I first came here, we set goals as the whole      administrative staff,'' he said. ``We met every single goal      without exception. When our team met the last goal, I said to      myself, `That's good.' That was in December.''       That last goal was seeing Monroe County High School become      a high-achieving school and being listed in the 94.6      percentile.       ``When I came here, we were like in the 28 percentile,'' he      said.       Carter pointed out successes achieved by other schools in      the district, including Monroe County Middle School becoming      a national school to watch and being named one of the top-10      achieving middle schools in the state.       He noted Tompkinsville Elementary has been named a Blue      Ribbon School nominee and Gamaliel Elementary won the      Winners' Circle Choice Award in the Kentucky Tell Survey. GES      was also recognized by the Kentucky Department of Education      as an honor school two years in a row.       Joe Harrison Carter Elementary was named the overall winner      of the Governor's Cup academic competition and has been      recognized as K-PREP [Kentucky Performance Rating for      Educational Progress] progressing school.       Toby Chapman, school board chairman, learned of Carter's      retirement plans on Tuesday and said the news came as a      shock.       ``He had another year on his contract. I thought he was      going to stay, but evidently he's ready to go,'' Chapman      said.       Carter had a two-year contract with the school board to      serve as superintendent.       Chapman praised Carter for the good job he has done as      superintendent.       ``I won't say we've always seen eye-to-eye on everything,      but we've always worked out what was best for the kids,''      Chapman said.       Carter succeeded Rachel Ford and Liz Willett, who served as      interim superintendents, following the resignation of George      Wilson as superintendent.       Prior to becoming superintendent of Monroe County schools,      Carter served as deputy executive director of the Kentucky      Workforce and Education Cabinet. He also served in many roles      for the Monroe County school system during his career,      including as assistant principal and then principal of      Tompkinsville Elementary.       He began his career in education in 1975 teaching health      and physical education, as well as coaching school athletic      teams.       As for his retirement plans, Carter said, ``I have a      hunting, fishing and golfing list. I plan to have fun.''       Dr. Michael Carter, school board member, said he will miss      Carter.       ``Lewis has always been a great spokesman for our school      and I know he truly cares about our schools and our      children,'' he said. ``I don't think we will find anybody who      cares more than Mr. Carter does.''       Eddie Proffitt, also a school board member, said Carter has      done a lot for the school system.       ``He was a good superintendent. He will be hard to      replace,'' Proffitt said.       The search for a replacement will begin as soon as      possible.       ``e're going to meet with Lewis tomorrow. We are going to      call a lawyer and get the ball rolling, so probably in the      next couple of weeks we'll be advertising for applications,''      Chapman said.       He hopes to have a new superintendent hired by the first of      June, so they can spend a month working with Carter, since      his last day will be June 30.                          ____________________
