Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I can agree with the gentleman. As the gentleman knows, we have to deal with what we have, and we will try to make this a little less painful tonight and, as I hope will happen on Thursday, so we can pass this legislation and have it on the President's desk before we go home for the August break.
