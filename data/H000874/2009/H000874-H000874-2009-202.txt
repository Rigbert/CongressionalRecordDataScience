 Mr. McCAUL. Reclaiming my time, they say a picture speaks a thousand words. Well, look at this picture right here because it says it all.  This is a picture of Larry Summers, the President's top economic adviser. Look at him. He's not creating jobs. He is asleep. Mr. Speaker, I would submit to you, this administration is asleep at the wheel.  The Vice President recently said that we can spend our way out of bankruptcy. What? Really? Spend our way out of bankruptcy? What happened to Economics 101? I think the American people are smarter than that.  Instead of cutting taxes and spending, which has historically worked, instead, we are enacting policies thatwill devastate our economy; a national energy tax that will kill 2.5 million jobs and, according to the President, skyrocket energy prices. A health care bill that, according to the CBO, will spend over $1 trillion and kill 4.7 million jobs.  It is time, Mr. Speaker, for the American people to wake up.                          ____________________
