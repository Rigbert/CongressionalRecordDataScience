That is the largest active DMZ that is out there now--160 miles long, 2 miles wide. Even at that time, we were talking about the necessity of immediately getting sanctions in there to stop the threats. Because our intelligence--while it can be good and it cannot be so good, still there is speculation that they had that capability, and that capability has to be stopped.  I applaud the Senator and his team for moving forward with this issue.
