The budget process is for us, the Budget Committee of the House, the Budget Committee of the other body. We do our budget, we get our allocations. What I do not understand, nobody has been able to explain to me in 2 days, if you do not agree with the budget allocations that have been given, why do you not go back and do the budget?  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Armey), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), they were out here yesterday, they voted with the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn) on the amendments that he brought up. And I am standing here thinking, ``Wait a minute, they gave us the budget marks that we used in our committee, so now why are they voting against their own marks?'' I do not understand. What is not working? Which committee is not working over there? The Budget Committee? They already did the work. They gave us the marks. How do we avoid what is going on here?  Does the gentleman understand my question?
