And I would ask that he be given a round of applause.  I want to thank the members of the subcommittee and the staff. And I would also want to thank four young people who've worked in our offices this summer for all of their efforts on our behalf: Craig, Morgan, Deepa, and Matt.  Finally, I want to thank all of my colleagues. We did work our way through 100 amendments. From my perspective, this is exactly how this institution should work, to have issues and disagreement, to have discussions, to have votes, and to have a conclusion to the process, and to report a bill.  So, again, I thank my colleagues, and I thank the chair and the colleagues I work with every day on the Defense Subcommittee.  I yield back the balance of my time.
