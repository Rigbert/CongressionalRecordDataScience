President, I am pleased to introduce today the Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act. This legislation will help bring recognition to New England's largest river ecosystem and one of our Nation's fourteen American Heritage Rivers.  The purpose of this legislation is to help the communities along the river protect and enhance their rich cultural history, economic vitality, and the environmental integrity of the river.  From its origin in the mountains of northern New Hampshire, the Connecticut River runs over 400 miles and eventually empties into Long Island Sound. The river forms a natural boundary between my home state of Vermont and New Hampshire, and travels through the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The river and surrounding valley have long shaped and influenced development in the New England region. This river is one of America's earliest developed rivers, with European settlements going back over 350 years. The industrial revolution blossomed in the Connecticut River Valley, supported by new technologies such as canals and mills run by hydropower.  I am pleased that the entire Senate delegations from Vermont and New Hampshire have cosponsored this bill. For years, our offices and our States have worked together to help communities on both sides of the river develop local partnerships to protect the Connecticut River valley of Vermont and New Hampshire. And, while great improvements have been made to the river, its overall health remains threatened by water and air pollution, habitat loss, hydroelectric dams, and invasive species such as the zebra mussel.  Historically, the people throughout the Upper Connecticut River Valley have functioned cooperatively and the river serves to unite Vermont and New Hampshire communities economically, culturally and environmentally.  Citizens on both sides of the river know just how special this region is and have worked side by side for years to protect it. Efforts have been underway for some time to restore the Atlantic salmon fishery, protect threatened and endangered species, and support urban riverfront revitalization  In 1993, Vermont and New Hampshire came together to create the Connecticut River Joint Commissions--a unique partnership between the states, local businesses, all levels of government within the two states and citizens from all walks of life. This partnership helps coordinate the efforts of towns, watershed managers and other local groups to implement the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. This Plan has become the blueprint for how communities along the river can work with one another with Vermont and New Hampshire and withthe federal government to protect the river's resources.  The Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act would help carry out the recommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, which was developed under New Hampshire law with the active participation of Vermont citizens and communities.  This Act would also provide the Secretary of the Interior with the ability to assist the States of New Hampshire and Vermont with technical and financial aid for the Upper Connecticut River Valley through the Connecticut River Joint Commissions. The Act would also assist local communities with cultural heritage outreach and education programs while enriching the recreational activities already active in the Connecticut River Watershed of Vermont and New Hampshire.  Lastly, the bill will require that the Secretary of the Interior establish a Connecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program to help local community groups develop new projects as well as build on existing ones to enhance the river basin.  Over the next few years, I hope this bill will help bring renewed recognition and increased efforts to conserve the Connecticut River as one of our nation's great natural and economic resources.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 301       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
