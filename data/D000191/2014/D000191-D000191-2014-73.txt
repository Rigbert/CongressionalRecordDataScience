Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  The text of the amendment is as follows:       Page 10, after line 12, insert the following:       (5) Whether such trading increases market volatility,      including short term market swings.  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 629, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, the ranking member mentioned earlier that there is a section in the bill of merit which would require four studies: whether the technology and personnel needed to monitor the effect of high-frequency trading are accurate; the role it plays in providing liquidity; whether it creates discrepancies between market participants--I would recommend people read ``Flash Boys'' if they want the answer to that question--and whether the CFTC's existing authority is sufficient with regard to high-frequency trading.  Those all have great merit. We should have the answers, but I have one additional request, which would be to examine whether high-frequency trading increases market volatility. CFTC already did one study. They found that there were 27,000 contracts traded during a 14-second period during the flash crash, but they came to no conclusion regarding how or what role they may have played in the flash crash. I think that we should further investigate this.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
