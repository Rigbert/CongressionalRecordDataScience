It is, you know, how the money flows in Washington, DC, how the influence flows in Washington, DC. As my colleague knows, in the office of the special trade representative, a study I saw said that 74 to 75 percent of the people who worked in the President's Office of the special Trade Representative have become foreign agents; that is, they are now representing foreign nations against the interests of the United States in trade and economic policy. You know we have got to close these revolving doors. We have got to reform campaign finance. We have got to reform the gift rule. But somehow it did not fit into the Republican Contract on America. No gift reform, no campaign finance reform; those things got left out, to be done later, of course.
