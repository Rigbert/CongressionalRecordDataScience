 President, when the great-great granddaughter of U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall established a safe place for Louisville's troubled and indigent children in 1910, few perhaps could have imagined the impact her actions would make a century later. Yet as The Cabbage Patch Settlement House celebrates its centennial year, the contributions of its alumni to our community and Nation will stand as Louise Marshall's legacy for another 100 years.  Named after the 1901 best-selling novel, ``Mrs. Wiggs and the Cabbage Patch,'' which was written by fellow Louisvillian Alice Hegan Rice, The Patch now serves 1,100 children and their families through a variety of education and counseling programs. Included among its alumni are: an NFL Super Bowl coach, public officials and community leaders, military officers, teachers, coaches, firefighters, and police officers. Thousands of alumni credit their involvement with The Cabbage Patch as a critical factor in their development of strong values and strong faith.  The Louisville Courier-Journal recently recounted the impact this institution has had on my home city, and I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Louisville Courier-Journal,                              Feb. 15, 2010]               The Cabbage Patch: A Beacon for 100 Years                          (By Larry Muhammad)       Sherman Lewis won Super Bowl rings coaching for the San      Francisco 49ers and Green Bay Packers, was a college football      All-American at Michigan State University and finished third      in the balloting for the Heisman Trophy in 1963.       The duPont Manual High School graduate partly credits his      career success to the character-building sportsmanship he      learned as a teenager at Cabbage Patch Settlement House,      which is celebrating its 100th anniversary.       ``My first year there, in the ninth grade, I even won a      turkey trot,'' said Lewis, most     recently an offensive consultant for the Washington Redskins.      ``They had a big turkey in a crate, and you had to run to get      it, but I won that race going away. I had never run that fast      in my life, but we had a lot of mouths to feed in our family      and nobody was going to catch me.       ``And Cabbage Patch was the first time I ever played on an      integrated team,'' he said. ``They had great coaches there,      great role models, and I think that's part of the reason I      went into coaching. I owe that place a lot.''       Founded in 1910 to help troubled and indigent children, the      nonprofit Christian agency now serves 1,100 children and      their families through recreation, education and counseling      programs. It recently launched a yearlong birthday observance      that includes an alumni reunion (date and place yet to be      announced).       ``We are having a series of birthday parties with some of      our partner churches this spring,'' said Cabbage Patch      spokeswoman Angela Hagan. ``We had one at Highland      Presbyterian Jan. 10. We will be at Southeast Christian Feb.      21, and several others are scheduled. Our golf fundraiser at      Valhalla (Golf Club) on July 12 will have a 1910 twist--think      attire, for one example--and our auction event Sept. 23 at      the Muhammad Ali Center will be a big birthday party. On      Sept. 25 we celebrate in our own neighborhood (1413 S. Sixth      St., Old Louisville) as a beneficiary of the St. James Art      Show Gala.''       A function of the art show's philanthropic arm, the St.      James Court Charitable Foundation, the gala previously has      benefited Kosair Charities and the Louisville Orchestra.       ``This year, we decided to do the Cabbage Patch,'' said Don      Keeling, the Louisville businessman and president of the St.      James Court Association who, as a youth, played after-school      sports there. ``They raised a substantial amount of money for      their renovation, but they still have more to go so we're      going to help them retire some of that debt.''       The centennial year of The Patch, as it has become known      over the years, happily coincides with completion of the      $7.5-million structural upgrade to its Sixth Street      facilities, including a renovated gymnasium, kitchen and      classrooms, plus 19,000 square feet of new construction      adding a glass breezeway between buildings and a two-story      carriage house.       Also, starting Friday, Blue Sky Kentucky, the nonprofit      group promoting appreciation of American roots music, is      launching an education component that ties into ongoing music      instruction at The Patch. ``Our objective is to bring the art      and business end of music directly to the kids,'' said Greg      Handy, a Blue Sky Kentucky founder. ``Once a month, artists      will come give a brief performance, talk to the kids about      what it means to be a professional, working musician, and how      they got where they are now. We've developed a syllabus that      covers the art of songwriting and also the business of      music.''       Formerly an 8th Ward alderman who grew up in Old      Louisville, Handy remembers hanging out at The Patch, he      says, ``probably starting at 8 or 9 years old until the time      I got my driver's license. I would meet friends there after      school, and actually played a little softball for them. Our      family was a lot more fortunate than others in the      neighborhood. And The Patch was a place where children could      go, be safe and learn life's lessons--just a great place.''       For as long as anyone can remember, Cabbage Patch      Settlement House has been a beacon of hope to inner-city kids      and their families.       During the 1937 flood, when the Ohio River submerged 70      percent of Louisville and forced 175,000 people from their      homes, The Patch, which was situated on the edge of an      irregularly shaped dry area, became a refuge for dislocated      residents and a clearinghouse for food, clothes and other      necessities. It underwent a major program expansion after      World War II, adding a game room, various athletic programs,      adult activities, and dances. During the 1950s it began one      of Louisville's first private desegregation initiatives that      by 1963 encompassed the entire operation.       During its early years, founder Louise Marshall often      scoured the surrounding neighborhood for troubled and less      fortunate children, promoting the value of education and      inviting them to the Patch. Although from a well-to-do      family--her great-great grandfather was U.S. Chief Justice      John Marshall--Marshall as a young woman taught a      neighborhood Bible school class, felt compelled to help the      poor and was influenced by the success of places like      Chicago's Hull House to help the less fortunate. She based      Cabbage Patch's founding principles on the biblical      injunction for charity in the Book of Matthew: ``For I was      hungry and you gave me something to eat: I was thirsty and      you gave me something to drink; I was a stranger and you      invited me in; I was naked and you clothed me.''       The agency was named for a neighborhood running along      tracks of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, inhabited by      L&N workers and truck gardeners growing cabbages--thus the      Cabbage Patch. The area was immortalized in a sentimental      best-selling 1901 novel, ``Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,''      by Louisville writer Alice Hegan Rice.       Today, it has the legacy of Marshall, who died in 1981, and      the example of dedication set by the late Roosevelt Chin,      longtime family services director, whose ashes are buried at      center court in the renovated gym named in his honor.       It has programs like the vegetable-growing and cooking      initiative From Seed to Table, begun by Kathy Cary, chef/     owner of Lilly's Bistro. It consistently turns out winning      produce at the Kentucky State Fair, taking second place last      year for Roma tomatoes, cabbage and corn, and 10 first-place      ribbons in 2000, including best hot pepper collection.       It has volunteers extraordinaire such as Lea Fischbach, who      in 2007 received the President's Volunteer Service Award from      President George W. Bush for her 11 years and more than 4,000      hours of charity work.       ``Those who participated in our programs tell the story of      our mission,'' the agency's executive director, the Rev.      Tracy Holladay, said in a statement. ``When we celebrate 100      years of service, we're celebrating the hope and potential of      all those who have come through our doors, past and present,      and those who will come in the next 100 years.''                          ____________________
