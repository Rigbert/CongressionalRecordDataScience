Speaker, I have heard a lot of criticism tonight about this drug bill; and I want to remind all of us as we go back to our districts, as we have heard for so many years at our town meetings and so many events, America wants and needs a prescription drug program for our seniors. I remind all of our colleagues here tonight that this program is voluntary. You do not have to participate if you do not want to, but for many Americans they will want to participate. They are going to participate.  Mr. Speaker, I want to relate a little story that happened to me in my district last summer. I was at my son's little league game. A woman ran up to me as I was getting in my car and packing up the gear. She said, My mom just had a stroke. It will cost her $600 a month to survive. We never had that in our budget. We cannot afford it. Is the plan that you passed last week, this was last year, is that going to help my mom? I put my hands on her shoulders and I said, Yes, I believe that it will. She will be able to benefit from this plan. You will be able to use the assets that you have and to have her survive in a meaningful way.  Yet, the other body never came back. The other body never came back with a plan and, in fact, that woman and her family were very distraught.  This is a plan tonight that can pass with bipartisan support, not only in this Chamber but the other Chamber on the other side of the Capitol. The President will sign this bill. It is within the budget. No, it is not perfect. But we can take a step to help the woman that I had talked to last year as well as the thousands of people that have come to our town meetings over the course of the last number of years.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the Democratic substitute and, yes, support this plan that we take up a little bit later this morning.
