 We are continuing to hotline this to see if there are any amendments other than the ones that I am aware of.  I doubt whether we can get an agreement on a final passage time. But I would suggest that if we can get narrowed down time agreements tomorrow on each of the amendments, we should do all we can to lock it in. I thank the leader for honoring his commitment to bring this up. It was a bit beyond his control, having 50 some votes in the last 2 days. To the best of my knowledge, the House has not acted on this at all. Even if we passed a bill tonight, we are not in a position to be able to send it to the President or even go to conference. I do not think there is any damage done by not doing that.
