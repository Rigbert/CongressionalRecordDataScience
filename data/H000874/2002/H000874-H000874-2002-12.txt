Speaker, one of the interesting aspects of this homeland security bill of which we speak is that if we ask the American people, what are the two agencies most responsible for homeland security, one looking overseas at terrorists and one looking at terrorists here in America, they would respond overwhelmingly: the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The irony is neither one of those agencies is included in this reorganization, neither are included in this department, and, therefore, will not be affected in any way by the passage or failure of this particular piece of legislation. I thank the gentleman.
