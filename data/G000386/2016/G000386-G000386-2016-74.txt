 It is shocking that the only answer the FBI can come up with to these allegations is silence. Burying our heads in the sand does not make the issue go away.  If our government is assisting in paying ransom money to terrorists, Congress needs to know, the public needs to know.  The government officials involved need to be accountable. The facts cannot be hidden from the FBI's oversight committee. The policies implementing our laws on this topic cannot be kept secret from the FBI's oversight committee.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
