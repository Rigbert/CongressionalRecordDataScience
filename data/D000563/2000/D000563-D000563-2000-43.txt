 million active and reserve personnel.  The hardships suffered by our men and women in uniform are painfully real and should not be understated. I salute the sacrifices our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are making everyday to defend our national security. Many of these hardships have arisen because the world has changed drastically and so has our military.  Our military has changed from a post-World War II forward-based force to much more of a projection force. When we talk about deployments going up, we are talking about times when we send our forces away from their home bases and their families. After World War II, we had a half million troops stationed in Europe, but with their families, if they had families. Those troops were not considered ``deployed,'' because they were based there. So when people talk about a massive increase in deployments, they are generally not counting those who are stationed in overseas bases.  That is how having 10,500 soldiers in the Balkans today can be considered and counted as a major deployment, but stationing a half million troops in Europe from the end of World War II through the 1980s is not even counted as a deployment by classic definition.  Our military has also changed drastically. It used to be a force of mainly single, young men. Today, our forces are filled with married men and women, many of whom also have children. So deploying them on repeated missions overseas, along with frequent job changes, as well as being over-worked at their home bases, creates serious hardships for family life.  I submit today that many of the problems encountered by our men and women in uniform are related to the ways our military is organized and managed, based on the assumptions developed following our experience in World War II. I recommend to my colleagues an excellent, thoughtful paper, entitled ``It's The Personnel System,'' by John C. F. Tillson of the Institute for Defense Analysis. His paper explores the personnel and organizational assumptions that underlie the military, as well as the intersection of deployment tempo, personnel, or job-changing tempo, and operating tempo at home bases.  These are complex problems that require serious thought. I think it is very sad that these issues would be reduced to a conclusion that the United States must pull out of our leadership role in the world instead of addressing those problems head-on.  What are those unending missions that the Clinton Administration has gotten us into? Most of them were inherited from the Bush administration or Ronald Reagan's administration, or even earlier ones.  Of the 100,000 troops currently deployed long-term away from home, only 10,500 or a little over 10 percent are deployed by the Clinton Administration--to the Balkans. The rest of the major long-term deployments were inherited, including deployments in Japan, the Korean peninsula, the Persian Gulf, and Navy deployments in the Western Pacific and the Mediterranean, as well as the mission that went wrong in Somalia. The only other major mission that the Clinton Administration took on that it did not inherit was to Haiti; and contrary to what Governor Bush said during the second Presidential debate, that mission is over.  I have seen many figures bandied about claiming that the Clinton Administration has used force at a much greater pace than Presidents Bush and Reagan before him. Where do these claims come from?  For example, an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on October 18th by Mackubin Thomas Owens from the Naval War College and the Lexington Institute, says that:       Deployments have increased three-fold during the Clinton      years.  He further stated:       These deployments have included some combat missions, but      have consisted primarily of open-ended peacekeeping and      humanitarian operations--48 missions, to be precise, from      1992 to 1999.  Apparently, a 1999 Congressional Research Service report, Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798--1999, was used to substantiate these claims. Specifically, the CRS report shows that during the Reagan and Bush administrations there were 17 and 16 uses of force overseas respectively. This compares to 49 uses of force overseas during the first 7 years of the Clinton administration.  Unfortunately, reading the CRS report this way is a gross misrepresentation of the facts and an absurd misuse of the CRS report, which was intendedonly to be a compendium or rough survey of the range of uses of force. CRS and its fine analysts should not be blamed for the poor analysis of others who used the report as a source.  For instances of use of force in recent years, the CRS report is just a list of times when the President and Defense Secretary reported to Congress consistent with the 1973 War Powers Resolution, and the report notes that the instances of use of force listed vary greatly in size and significance. The degree to which each President reports to and consults with Congress on war powers matters varies greatly. The Clinton Administration has reported to Congress diligently. To simply add up each instance without reading and analyzing them inevitably leads to a gross misinterpretation of the facts and to conclusions that cannot survive serious scrutiny.  Let me provide that scrutiny using CRS' numbers.  Of the 49 instances of use of force cited in the CRS report, 14 were either evacuations of U.S. citizens from Third World countries or minor increases in security at U.S. embassies. This is hardly the troop deployment depicted by the critics of the Clinton administration. Moreover, 24 other uses of force were merely continuing operations or simply status reports about continuing operations, 5 of those separate entries for status reports on peacekeeping operations in the Balkans.  There are 7 separate citations regarding air attacks on Iraqi ground targets after the gulf war.  The analysis suggests the numbers have been misused. Frankly, it raises a question of whether or not the military has been used effectively over the past 8 years. I certainly think it has.  There were 4 entries regarding the deployment of troops in Haiti--3 of which were reporting on the number of troops coming home! But those ``counted'' as uses of force by the Clinton Administration. So did reductions in US forces from Bosnia.  The largest deployment under President Clinton--some 30,000 troops to Bosnia for peacekeeping missions--is dwarfed by the 600,000+ troops sent to the Persian Gulf during Desert Shield/Storm under President Bush, yet the deployment to Bosnia counts for 15 entries in the CRS report, and the entire Gulf War, only one. The invasion of Grenada with 8,800 US troops has but a single entry.  The entries for the Clinton years included many instances of rescuing American citizens or humanitarian aid. Yet there were very few such instances for the Reagan-Bush years. It seems unlikely that hardly any U.S. citizens needed rescuing during those years, so I suspect such entries are simply missing.  How do we make sense of these numbers?  If we sort out all the multiple entries for the same deployment, as well as the minor deployments for embassy security and evacuations, it becomes clear that the number of distinct uses of force by the Clinton Administration is not that different from the Bush or Reagan years.  Deconstructing the CRS instances of use of force to include only distinct uses of force, we find that: over 8 years, there were 16 distinct uses of force by President Reagan, the major one the invasion of Grenada; 13 uses of force over the 4 years of the Bush Administration, the major ones being Panama, the Persian Gulf, and Somalia; and 13 uses of force for 7 years of the Clinton Administration, the major ones being Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo.  The misuse of the CRS report was an egregious distortion of the Clinton Administration's record. To set the record straight, I asked the Defense Department what its numbers show.  First, I should note that there is no uniform method for counting deployments at the Defense Department; some count training and exercises as deployments, and some count domestic missions, like fighting the fires in the West or helping with Hurricane Andrew clean-up.  In March 1999, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen sent a report to Congress entitled, ``U.S. Military Involvement in Major Smaller-Scale Contingencies Since the Persian Gulf War.'' In that report, Secretary Cohen notes that:       . . . since the end of the Persian Gulf War in February      1991, U.S. military forces have conducted or participated in      approximately 50 named, overseas SSCs [small-scale      contingencies] involving the deployment of 500 or more      military personnel at any one time. This includes three      crisis response/show of force operations, three limited      strike operations, ten noncombatant evacuation operations,      four no-fly zone enforcement operations, three maritime      sanctions enforcement operations, six migrant operations, ten      peace operations, ten humanitarian assistance operations, and      one operation to provide emergency overseas assistance to      other U.S. government agencies.  I asked the Defense Department for more detail, so DoD also sent me supporting data for the Secretary's report, showing 60 contingencies from 1980-1999--26 from 1980-1992, the Reagan-Bush years, and 34 during the Clinton Administration. Instead of 50 since February 1991 mentioned in the Secretary's report, it lists 44 contingencies since then.  The 34 contingencies during the Clinton Administration are those missions that have a ``name,'' like ``Avid Response'' or ``Sustain Hope.'' The sources of this information are the reports to Congress consistent with the War Powers Resolution, just like the CRS report. However, the data doesn't suffer from repetition, since it only uses named missions, so multiple reports were consolidated. These contingencies also include many instances of rescuing Americans or humanitarian aid missions.  However, almost all the data from 1980-1991 uses that same CRS report, Instances of Use of United States Armed Forces Abroad, 1798-1999, as its source, which may suffer from undercounting smaller deployments for that time period. I would like to ask the Defense Department today to look at its own internal data for the period on which it relied on the CRS report.  I also asked the Army to provide me with deployment data, which I would like to submit for the Record. The Army lists 38 deployments since 1989, including humanitarian assistance, noncombatant evacuations, and domestic disaster relief in Florida, Hawaii, California, Midwest floods, and Western fire-fighting.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a document entitled ``Major Overseas Smaller-Scale Contingency Operations'' and another entitled ``Operational Deployments'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:           MAJOR OVERSEAS SMALLER-SCALE CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS [Involving the deployment of 500 or more U.S. Armed Forces personnel--                        March 1991-February 1999]------------------------------------------------------------------------            Location                   Operation             Dates------------------------------------------------------------------------                      CRISIS RESPONSE/SHOW OF FORCE Kuwait..........................
