Leader. In a serious vein, the minority on the Committee on Ways and Means would love to participate in the process. I would tell the leader, with all due respect and very sincerely, the minority in the Committee on Ways and Means does not believe it is included in the process; and that is of concern to us.  If perhaps you could talk with the chairman, with your persuasive powers, perhaps, in fact, we could participate in the process and perhaps we would be able to offer such an amendment; and, clearly, if that would happen, we would offer such an amendment, I assure the leader. So if he could help us with the chairman of thecommittee, that would be greatly appreciated.  Medicare prescription drugs, Mr. Leader, what can you tell us about when we can expect to see Medicare prescription drug legislation considered in the committees of jurisdiction and then on the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. As previously announced, we had tried to get Medicare modernization onto the floor before the Memorial Day break. Obviously, there was a tremendous amount of work that needed to be done, and we had to postpone that goal. We have set a new goal, and we hope that we can have Medicare modernization to the floor before the July 4 break. The Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and Commerce are working hard to develop a proposal that would modernize and preserve the Medicare program and provide needy citizens with life-saving drugs. But while the complexity of this issue means that our staffs and committees need to be working and they are working very hard, we still hope to have a bill for the House to consider before the end of the month.
