It was signed into law in the Higher Education Reauthorization Act signed by President Ronald Reagan, President George Herbert Walker Bush, and President George W. Bush.  The DeMint amendment is opposed by the Jesuit universities. We have struck a balance here helping religious schools on buildings that are not primarily for religious functions. We will continue doing that and continue honoring our Constitution's establishment clause.  I hope everyone will support me in opposing the DeMint amendment and stand by the language that has been time tested and approved by the Supreme Court in three separate decisions.  Mr. DeMINT. May I correct a mischaracterization?
