 President, I rise to express my opposition to the Smith Amendment to the Commerce-Justice-State Authorization.  I do not do so because I think that the lawsuits filed against the Japanese corporations by the former Prisoners of War who were used as slave labor during World War II should not go forward--just the opposite--but because I believe that this Amendment takes the wrong approach to this issue.  I strongly support the right of the POWs to file lawsuits against the Japanese corporations. The POWs and veterans are only seeking justice from the private companies that enslaved them, and these claims should be allowed to move forward.  In fact, Senator Hatch and I introduced legislation earlier this year, S. 1272, the POW Assistance Act of 2001, precisely because I believe that it is important for those POWs who were used as slave labor during World War II to have their day in court, and an opportunity to press their claims for remuneration and compensation.  There are serious questions about whether the 1951 Treaty between Japan and the United States has settled these claims, and these questions should be dealt with seriously. But as these lawsuits go forward, I do not think that it is right and proper to enjoin the Department of State and the Department of Justice from offering the court their opinion on the meaning and interpretation of the 1951 Treaty. That opinion--which may ultimately be determined to be incorrect--is a perfectly legitimate part of the proceedings.  I strongly support the right of the POWs to seek justice. This is a matter that belongs before the courts. But I do not think that the Smith Amendment is the right way to go, and I urge my colleague to oppose its passage.
