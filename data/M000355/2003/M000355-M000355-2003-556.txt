 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a legend, Kentucky's Historian Laureate Dr. Thomas D. Clark. On July 14, 2003, Dr. Clark turned 100 years old.  Dr. Clark has been described as a ``State treasure.'' A native of Mississippi, Dr. Clark stumbled upon Kentucky as he sought to further his education. He earned a scholarship to the University of Kentucky where he received a master's in history in 1929. From there, he went on to Duke University, where he obtained a Ph.D. In true Kentucky style, Dr. Clark returned to the Commonwealth and began researching its rich past. He has written more than 32 books including, ``A History in Kentucky,'' and served in the University of Kentucky's Department of History for nearly a quarter of a century. One of the State's leading scholars, he proudly calls Kentucky home.  Dr. Clark's service to my great State has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated. In 1969, the University of Kentucky presented Dr. Clark with an honorary doctorate for the way he touched so many Kentuckians during his teaching career. Over his 100 years, he has received many awards and honors, including the University of Kentucky Library Medallion for Intellectual Achievement and the Commonwealth Historian Laureate for life. Dr. Clark also has a building and a foundation named in his honor by the University Press of Kentucky.  Kentuckians admire Dr. Clark for his patriotism to the State, his adept knowledge of our history, and most importantly, his zest for life. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Clark and congratulating him on his Centenarian status.                          ____________________
