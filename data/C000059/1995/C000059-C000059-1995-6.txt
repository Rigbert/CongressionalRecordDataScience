Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to welcome my dear friend, Rev. Lou Sheldon. We are all very blessed to have Reverend Sheldon with us today.  I want to thank him for his uplifting words of prayer for today's session. Indeed, we must pray each day for the strength to uphold the spiritual and moral principles that have guided our great Nation.  Since his ordination, Reverend Sheldon has pastored churches for more than 20 years. Today, he works tirelessly to educate and inform the 31,000 churches with whom he is affiliated. He has been a wise counselor and good friend to me.  His dedication to the Almighty and his strong moral convictions are an inspiration to us all. All of us are grateful for your good work and dedication to the Almighty.                          ____________________
