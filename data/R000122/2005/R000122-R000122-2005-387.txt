My understanding is that the production cycle for the system, these interceptors, is 12 per year. Yet the budget is asking for more than that. So I don't think taking $50 million--as I understand the amendment, $30 million taken from long-lead, ground-based interceptors--taking $30 million away I do not think would upset the production line schedule. There is no intent to do that, and I think the effect would not be to do that also.  With respect to your point, which I think is well taken, about the buildup in funds in the comprehensive threat reduction, some of that--we will check more dutifully--but some of that to my knowledge is the result of the inability to agree on a way to deal with some of these sites. We hope that difficulty has been substantially reduced by President Bush and President Putin's discussion in Bratislava. Now that they have agreed on a framework, they can start applying this money.  Also, again, I think this money would be well spent, would not disrupt the production of the missile systems, and just the sheer scale--this is $50 million total, $30 million from the ground-based interceptors, $20 million for initial construction of silos and housing for the interceptors--again, this is truly long-lead procurement. We have, in my view, and I believe that of Senator Levin, much more of a problem in the site in Russia that contains the nuclear materials.  We have all heard the horror stories of people being able to walk in, walk around, and walk out of these sites without anybody interfering with them--no electronic equipment or sensors that would detect or report their presence to anyone's attention. So our view--my view, speaking for myself--is that this money could be much better spent, without disrupting the missile defense program, by applying it to comprehensive threat reduction.  Frankly, $500 million is an impressive amount of money that has not yet been spent, but we all recognize, if any of this material made its way outside these sites and got into the hands of irresponsible people, it would be serious.
