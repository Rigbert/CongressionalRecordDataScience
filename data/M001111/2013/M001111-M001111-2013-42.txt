 President, the Senator from Vermont is correct. It is my intent that existing contracts to use the services of not-for-profit servicers are not terminated by this bill and that they will be permitted to compete with the Department of Education's title IV servicers for additional accounts. I know several of my colleagues also feel strongly about this issue. I would like to recognize the following Senators to also join in on the colloquy: Senators Leahy, Harkin, Alexander, Hatch, Shaheen, Begich, Grassley, King, Baucus, Tester, and Murkowski.
