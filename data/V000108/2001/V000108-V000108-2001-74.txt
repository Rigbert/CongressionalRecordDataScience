Speaker, on May 23, 2001, I was unavoidably absent due to my attendance at a funeral in my district for Ms. Helen Savinski, a very dear and personal friend.  Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall votes 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 144, 145, 146 and 147, and voted ``nay'' on rollcall votes 135, 136, 137 and 143.                          ____________________
