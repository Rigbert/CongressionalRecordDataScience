President, I am lifting my hold on the nomination of Mr. Jason Klitenic to be General Counsel of the Office of Director of National Intelligence. Senator Grassley and I have received a response to our March 6, 2018, letter regarding the Intelligence Community Office of Inspector General, OIG, and the termination of its Executive Director of Intelligence Community Whistleblowing and Source Protection, ``Executive Director.'' In addition, I have been provided access to documents related to the Executive Director's termination. I remain concerned about the circumstances surrounding that termination and look forward to reviewing them further, even as I work with my colleagues to strengthen protection for intelligence community whistleblowers. My hold on the nomination of Mr. Klitenic was based on these concerns and not on the qualifications of the nominee.                          ____________________
