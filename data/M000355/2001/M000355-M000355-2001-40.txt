 President, I offer this amendment along with Senators Helms and Leahy out of concern with the continued detention of political prisoners in Serb jails. Our amendment is simple and straightforward: It makes absolutely clear that among the certification requirements contained in section 575 of this bill is the release of these prisoners. I urge the democrats and reformers in Belgrade to take notice of our actions, and to release the political prisoners immediately. I yield the floor to my friend from North Carolina.
