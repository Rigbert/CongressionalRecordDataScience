 President, I rise today to speak in support of legislation that I am introducing which is intended to prevent foreign nationals from making financial contributions to federal elections.  Last October, in the trial of Charlie Trie, Judge Paul L. Friedman ruled that the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) does not prohibit foreigners from making campaign donations to political parties or Congressional Campaign Committees. The holding of this case is based on an extremely narrow reading of the language of the FECA. Judge Friedman ruled that because the FECA specifically prohibits foreign nationals from making direct contributions to the campaigns of candidates for federal office but does not specifically prohibit donations, or ``soft money'' expenditures to the parties, such donations are not prohibited by the FECA. While we can argue the merits of this decision and question whether it merely tracks the letter rather than the entire spirit of the FECA, it is quite clear that this ruling opens up our system of federal elections to the possibility of foreign influence.  My bill clarifies the law by amending the FECA to prohibit donations by foreign nationals to ``a national committee of a political party or a Senatorial or Congressional Campaign Committee of a national political party for any purpose.'' This new provision along with the existing prohibition of direct contributions by foreign nationals, will provide the Federal Election Commission with the ability to prosecute those who illegally attempt to influence federal elections. Ultimately, my bill will get us closer to achieving the desired effect originally contemplated by the FECA--ensuring that federal campaigns are free of foreign money.  Mr. President, regardless of any member's views concerning the direction that campaign finance reform should take, I believe that amending the FECA to prohibit foreign influence in federal campaigns requires swift action.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Conrad):  S. 299. A bill to elevate the position of Director of the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services to Assistant Secretary for Indian Health, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.           assistant secretary for indian health act of 1999 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will establish the Director of the Indian Health Service within the Department of Health and Human Services as an Assistant Secretary for Indian Health. My colleagues, Senators Inouye and Conrad, are joining me in this effort as original co-sponsors. I am pleased to note that Congressman Nethercutt from Washington introduced companion legislation on the House side.  Last year, we came very close to successful passage of this same bill, but the legislative clock expired. It is our hope that we can move this legislation forward expeditiously this year as this bill enjoys widespread support from Indian tribes nationwide and the Administration.  The history of this legislation spans back several years. Every year, the Congress deliberates on how best to raise the standard of health care for all Americans. Yet, in nearly every debate, the health care needs of Indian people are either marginalized or ignored. The need for this legislation arose out of the continuing frustration expressed by the tribes that their health concerns were not adequately addressed under the existing administrative policy and budgetary processes.  As the primary health care delivery system, the Indian Health Service is the principal advocate for Indian health care needs, both on the reservation level and for urban populations. More than 1.3 million Indian people are served every year by the IHS. At its current capacity, the IHS estimates that it can only meet 62 percent of tribal health care needs. The IHS will continue to be challenged by a growing Indian population as well as an increasing disparity between the health status of Indian people as compared to other Americans. Thousands of Indian people continue to suffer from the worst imaginable health care conditions in Indian country--from diabetes to cancer to infant mortality. In nearly every category, the health status of Native Americans falls far below the national standard.  The purpose of this bill can be simplified to three primary needs. Indian people desire a stronger leadership and policy role within the primary health care agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. The Assistant Secretary for Indian Health will ensure that critical policy and budgetary decisions will be made with the full involvement and consultation of not only the Indian Health Service, but also the direct involvement of the Tribal governments.  Second, the enactment of this legislation is consistent with the unique government-to-government relationship between federally recognized Indian tribes and the federal government. This legislation is long overdue in bringing focus and national attention to the health care status of Indian people and fulfilling the federal trust responsibility toward Indian tribes.  Finally, passage of this legislation is critical as the Congress is set to deliberate several pieces of Indian health policy. Reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and development of legislation to permanently extend tribal self-governance authority to tribes will be vital components of Indian health care in the future. Implementation of this bill is intended to support the long-standing policies of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance and assist Indian tribes who are making positive strides in providing direct health care to their own communities.  At this critical time, the IHS is in dire need of a senior policy official who is knowledgeable about the programs administered by the IHS and who can provide the leadership for the health care needs of American Indians and Alaska Natives. We continue to pursue passage of this legislation as many believe that the priority of Indian health issues within the Department should be raised to the highest levels within our federal government.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure prompt passage of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text and section-by-section analysis of this bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 299       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
