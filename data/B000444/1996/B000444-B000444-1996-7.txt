 President, today I proudly join with the distinguished ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Baucus, to correct a serious accounting error that will cost my home State of Delaware millions of dollars in badly needed Federal highway assistance.  Federal-aid highway funds are for the creation and maintenance of our Nation's interstate highways--literally the lifelines of our economy. The east coast's largest, most important interstate, I-95, runs through the northernmost part of Delaware, carrying hundreds of millions of tons of goods and products from Maine to Florida and beyond. Tens of thousands of Delawareans commute daily on I-95.  In fact, the Delaware Department of Transportation is just now beginning a massive, $73 million project to repave and resurface key parts of I-95. This undertaking is vitally important not only to the people of Delaware, but to commuters and businesses across America.  Yet, next fiscal year, Delaware--partly because of a 1994 bureaucratic snafu--is going to receive approximately $8.2 million less than it received in 1996. That is an 11-percent cut.  This will occur even though the Federal Government will spend a record $18 billion on Federal highway assistance--roughly $455 million more than the current year.  During consideration of the Transportation Appropriations bill this past July, Senator Baucus successfully offered an amendment that I supported to correct this miscalculation and restore the needed funding. Yet despite the strong vote in support, and the best efforts of Senator Lautenberg, conferees dropped the Baucus amendment, thus preserving the slip-up and cutting funding to 28 States.  Because of this fundamental unfairness, and the egregious, short-sighted cuts in Amtrak funding, I voted against the Transportation Appropriations conference report.  The legislation introduced by Senator Baucus that I am cosponsoring today, the Highway Funding Fairness Act of 1996, corrects the 1994 highway fund credit mistake and gives the 28 affected States their rightful allocations.  This 1994 accounting error skims the surface of the issue, however. The root cause of the $8 million cut in funding to Delaware is the skewed allocation formula put in place by the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA], which fails to accurately reflect highway needs. This formula, particularly the so-called 90 percent of payments guarantee, unfairly rewards selected States at the expense of smaller, less populated States, such as Delaware.  I intend to work hard next year during consideration of the ISTEA reauthorization bill to correct this fundamental unfairness, and ensure that States, like Delaware, receive their proper share of highway funds.  I hope my colleagues representing the other 27 affected States will seriously consider cosponsoring the Highway Funding Fairness Act of 1996, and I commend and thank Senator Baucus for all of his work.                          ____________________
