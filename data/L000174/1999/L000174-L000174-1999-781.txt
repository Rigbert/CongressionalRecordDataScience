President, today I am re-introducing the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999,'' a bill that I originally introduced during the 105th Congress. I am pleased that Senator Snowe has agreed to co-sponsor the bill.  As United States Senators, we all have a responsibility as stewards for the nation and society we will be entrusting to our children and grandchildren. I became a grandfather for the first time a little over a year ago, and this duty has never been more real for me. The ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act of 1999'' is a comprehensive plan to eliminate mercury--one of the last remaining poisons without a specific control strategy--from our air, our waters and our forests. By eliminating mercury pollution from our natural resources, we will protect our nation's most important resource: the young Americans of today and tomorrow.  As we learned from the campaign to eliminate lead, our children are at the greatest risk from these poisons. How many future scientists, doctors, poets, and inspiring teachers have we lost in the last generation because of the toxics they have been exposed to in the womb or in early childhood? Just as with lead, we know that mercury has much graver effects on children at very low levels than it does on adults. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe today is one-tenth what it was a decade ago. That figure by itself is a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act. We should strive to achieve no less with mercury.  Mercury is toxic in every known form and has utterly no nutritional value. At high enough levels it poisons its victims in terribly tragic ways. In Japan, victims of mercury poisoning came to be known as suffering from Minimata Disease, which took its name from the small Minimata Bay in which they caught fish for their food.  For years, the Chisso Company, a chlor-alkali facility that manufactured chlorine, discharged mercury contaminated pollution in the bay, which was consumed by fish and then by people. Their disease was terribly painful, causing tremors and paralysis, and sometimes leading to death. Thankfully, wholesale discharges of mercury like those in Minimata Bay have been eliminated. But a torrent of air pollution still needlessly dumps this heavy metal into the air of North America, poisoning lakes and streams, forests and fields and--most importantly--our children. Mercury control needs to be a priority now because of the neurological damage it causes.  This is not to say that men, women and children are doubled over in agony as they were three decades ago in Japan. Mercury pollution today is more subtle, but it is no less insidious. Wildlife are also being harmed. Endangered Florida panthers have been fatally poisoned by mercury. Loons are endangered as well. In Lake Champlain we have fish advisories for walleye, trout and bass even though we have relatively few mercury emissions within our own state borders. There are now 40 states that have issued fishing advisories for mercury; Vermont's and those of 10 other states cover all of the water bodies in these states. Nearly 1,800 water bodies nationwide have mercury fishing advisories posted. The number of water bodies with mercury advisories has doubled since 1993.  My fellow Vermonters are exposed to mercury and other pollutants that blow across Lake Champlain and the Green Mountains every day from other regions of the country. The waste incinerators and coal-fired power plants are not accountable to the people of Vermont, and therefore a federal role is needed to control the pollution.  That is part of the reason voters send us here. They expect Members of the Congress to determine what is necessary to protect the public health and the environment nationally, then to take the appropriate action. And in many cases, perhaps most, we have done that. But not when it comes to mercury.  Mr. President, what I propose is that we put a stop to this poisoning of America. It is unnecessary, and it is wrong. Mercury can be removed from manufactured products, and much of that has been done. Mercury can be removed from coal-fired powerplants, and now that should be done. With states deregulating their utility industries, this is the right moment and the best opportunity we will have for a generation to make sure powerplants begin to internalize the costs of their pollution. We cannot afford to give them a free ride into the next century at the expense of our children's health.  So, too, should mercury be purged from other known sources such as chlor-alkali plants, medical waste incinerators, municipal combustion facilities, large industrial boilers, landfills, and lighting fixtures.  My bill directs EPA to set mercury emission standards for the largest sources of mercury emissions. The bill requires reducing emissions by 95 percent, but it also lets companies choose the best approach to meet the standard at their facility whether through the use of better technology, cleaner fuels, process changes, or product switching.  The bill also gives people the right-to-know about mercury emissions from the largest sources. That should be the public's right. To facilitate the public's right-to-know and getting mercury containing items out of the waste streams that feed municipal combustion facilities, it also requires labeling of mercury containing items such as fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, pharmaceuticals. The bill also begins a phaseout of mercury from products, with exceptions possible for demonstrated essential uses.  We will hear a lot of rhetoric about how much implementing mercury reduction steps will cost. In advance of those complaints I want to make two points. First, when we were debating controls for acid rain we heard a lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulphur dioxide. But what we learned from the acid rain program is that when you give industry a financial incentive to clean up its act, they will find the cheapest way. More often than not, assertions about the cost of controlling pollution grossly overestimate and distort reality. If you look at electricity prices of major utilities since the acid rain program was implemented, their rates have remained below the national average and some have actually decreased--even without adjusting for inflation. The mercury controls on coal-fired power plants contained in my bill may add a little over $2 dollars per month to the electric bill of the average residential consumer who receives power from a coal-fired plant. So, for the monthly cost of a slice of pizza or a hamburger and fries we can rein in the more than 50 tons of mercury that are being pumped into our air from power plants.  Secondly, and most importantly, the bottom line here should not be the cost of controlling mercury emissions, but the cost of not controlling mercury. While we may not be able to calculate how many Einstein's we have lost, if we lose one the price has been too high.  Let us make controlling mercury pollution one of our first environmental legacies of the 21st Century.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and anoverview of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 673       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) on the basis of available scientific and medical      evidence, exposure to mercury and mercury compounds      (collectively referred to in this Act as ``mercury'') is of      concern to human health and the environment;       (2) pregnant women and their fetuses, women of childbearing      age, children, and individuals who subsist primarily on fish,      are most at risk for mercury-related health impacts such as      neurotoxicity;       (3) although exposure to mercury occurs most frequently      through consumption of mercury-contaminated fish, such      exposure can also occur through--       (A) ingestion of drinking water, and food sources other      than fish, that are contaminated with methyl mercury;       (B) dermal uptake through soil and water; and       (C) inhalation of contaminated air;       (4) on the basis of the report entitled ``Mercury Study      Report to Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental      Protection Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air      Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), the major sources of mercury      emissions in the United States are, in descending order of      volume of emissions--       (A) fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating      units;       (B) solid waste incineration units;       (C) coal- and oil-fired commercial and industrial boiler      units;       (D) medical waste incinerators;       (E) hazardous waste combustors;       (F) chlor-alkali plants; and       (G) Portland cement plants;       (5)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report described      in paragraph (4), in conjunction with available scientific      knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury      emissions from anthropogenic combustion and industrial      sources and mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and      sediments;       (B) the Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that      the geographical areas that have the highest annual rate of      deposition of mercury in all forms are--       (i) the southern Great Lakes and Ohio River Valley;       (ii) the Northeast and southern New England; and       (iii) scattered areas in the South, with the most elevated      deposition occurring in the Miami and Tampa areas and 2 areas      in northeast Texas; and       (C) analysis conducted before the date of the Environmental      Protection Agency report demonstrates that mercury is being      deposited into the waters of Canada;       (6)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report described      in paragraph (4) supports a plausible link between mercury      emissions from anthropogenic combustion and industrial      sources and concentrations of methyl mercury in freshwater      fish;       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned      the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared      to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993;       (C) the total number of mercury advisories increased from      899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent; and       (D) the United States and Canada have agreed on a goal of      virtual elimination of mercury from the transboundary waters      of the 2 countries;       (7) the presence of mercury in consumer products is of      concern in light of the health consequences associated with      exposure to mercury;       (8) the presence of mercury in certain batteries and      fluorescent light bulbs is of special concern, particularly      in light of the substantial quantities of used batteries and      fluorescent light bulbs that are discarded annually in the      solid waste stream and the potential for environmental and      health consequences associated with land disposal,      composting, or incineration of the batteries and light bulbs;      and       (9) a comprehensive study of the use of mercury by the      Department of Defense would significantly further the goal of      reducing mercury pollution.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to greatly reduce the quantity of mercury entering the      environment by controlling air emissions of mercury from      fossil fuel-fired electric utility steam generating units,      coal- and oil-fired commercial and industrial boiler units,      solid waste incineration units, medical waste incinerators,      hazardous waste combustors, chlor-alkali plants, and Portland      cement plants;       (2) to reduce the quantity of mercury entering solid waste      landfills, incinerators, and composting facilities by      promoting recycling or proper disposal of used batteries,      fluorescent light bulbs, and other products containing      mercury;       (3) to increase the understanding of the volume and sources      of mercury emissions throughout North America;       (4) to promote efficient and cost-effective methods of      controlling mercury emissions;       (5) to promote permanent, safe, and stable disposal of      mercury recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control      systems, and other methods of mercury pollution control;       (6) to reduce the use of mercury in cases in which      technologically and economically feasible alternatives are      available;       (7) to educate the public concerning the collection,      recycling, and proper disposal of mercury-containing      products;       (8) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury      exposure and the threat to public health, particularly the      threat to the health of pregnant women and their fetuses,      women of childbearing age, children, and individuals who      subsist primarily on fish;       (9) to significantly decrease the threat to human health      and the environment posed by mercury; and       (10) to ensure that the health of sensitive populations,      whether in the United States, Canada, or Mexico, is      protected, with an adequate margin of safety, against adverse      health effects caused by mercury.     SEC. 3. MERCURY EMISSION STANDARDS FOR FOSSIL FUEL-FIRED                    ELECTRIC UTILITY STEAM GENERATING UNITS.       Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412) is      amended--       (1) by redesignating subsection (s) as subsection (x); and       (2) by inserting after subsection (r) the following:       ``(s) Mercury Emission Standards for Electric Utility Steam      Generating Units.--       ``(1) In general.--       ``(A) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date      of enactment of this subparagraph, the Administrator shall      promulgate regulations to establish standards for the      emission of mercury and mercury compounds (collectively      referred to in this subsection as `mercury') applicable to      existing and new electric utility steam generating units.       ``(B) Permit requirement.--Not later than 2 years after the      date of enactment of this subparagraph, each electric utility      steam generating unit shall have an enforceable permit issued      under title V that complies with this subsection.       ``(C) Procedures and schedules for compliance with      standards.--Each electric utility steam generating unit shall      achieve compliance with the mercury emission standards      established under subparagraph (A) in accordance with the      procedures and schedules established under subsection (i).       ``(2) Standards and methods.--       ``(A) Minimum required emission reduction.--Subject to      subparagraph (C), the emission standards established under      paragraph (1)(A) shall require that each electric utility      steam generating unit reduce its annual poundage of mercury      emitted, as calculated under subparagraph (B), below its      mercury emission baseline, as calculated under paragraph      (3)(D), by not less than 95 percent.       ``(B) Calculation of annual poundage of mercury emitted.--       ``(i) In general.--For each electric utility steam      generating unit (referred to in this subparagraph as a      `unit') and each calendar year, the Administrator shall      calculate the poundage of mercury emitted per unit for the      calendar year, which shall be equal to the product obtained      by multiplying--       ``(I) the fuel consumption determined under clause (ii) for      the unit for the calendar year;

Senator Leahy's concerns about the current and long-term      environmental and health consequences in the United States      resulting from the discharge of toxic chemicals into the      environment are lonstanding. He is particularly concerned      about the effects of mercury. He is also concerned about      transport of air pollution from other parts of the nation to      the lakes, rivers, forests, and agricultural lands of      Vermont.       EPA's ``Mercury Study Report to Congress,'' mandated by the      1990 Clean Air Act, documents mercury pollution sources and      troubling trends in mercury pollution in the United States.       Mercury is one of the last major pollutants without an      overall pollution control strategy, and as a result it      remains largely uncontrolled.     What are the key findings of the ``Mercury Study Report to          Congress''?       Scientific and medical evidence show that exposure to      mercury and mercury compounds is harmful to human health, and      concentrations of it in the environment are arising (e.g., in      lake and river sediments).       Pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of      child-bearing age, and children under the age of 8 are most      at risk for mercury-related health effects such as      neurotoxicity.       Neurotoxicity symptoms include impaired vision, speech,      hearing, and walking; sensory disturbances; incoordination of      movements; nervous system damage very similar to congenital      cerebal palsy; mental disturbances; and, in some cases,      death.       Exposure to mercury and mercury compounds occurs most      frequently through consumption of mercury-contaminated fish      but can also occur through ingestion of methyl-mercury      contaminated drinking water and food sources other than fish,      and dermal uptake through soil and water.       The major sources of mercury emissions in the United States      are coal-fired electrical utility steam generating units,      solid waste combustors, commercial and industrial boilers,      medical waste incinerators, hazardous waste combustors,      chlor-alkali plants (which manufacture chlorine and sodium      hydroxide), and Portland cement plants.       EPA's analysis of mercury deposits and transport, in      conjunction with available scientific knowledge, supports a      plausible link between mercury emissions from combustion and      industrial sources and mercury concentrations in air, soil,      water, and sediments.       The following geographical areas have the highest annual      rate of deposition of mercury in all forms: the southern      Great Lakes and Ohio River Valley; the Northeast and      southern  New England; and scattered areas in the South,      with the most elevated deposition occurring in the Miami      and Tampa areas and in two areas in northeast Texas.       The analysis of mercury deposits and transport supports a      plausible link between mercury emissions from combustion and      industrial sources and methyl mercury concentrations in      freshwater fish. In 1997, 40 states have issued health      advisories warning the public about consuming mercury-tainted      fish, compared to 27 states in 1993. Eleven states have      issued state-wide advisories, and 5 states have issued      advisories for coastal waters. Mercury advisories have      increased 98 percent from 899 in 1993 to 1,782 in 1998.       The presence of mercury in consumer products is of concern      in light of the health consequences associated with exposure      to mercury.       The presence of mercury in certain batteries and      fluorescent light bulbs is of special concern, particularly      given the substantial quantities of used batteries and      fluorescent light bulbs that are discarded annually in the      solid waste stream and the potential for environmental and      health consequences associated with land disposal,      composting, or municipal waste incineration.     Estimates of U.S. Annual Mercury Emissions Rates for the          Largest Emitting Source Categories Source of Data:          Mercury Study Report to Congress, December 1997     Coal Fired Utility Boilers: 52 tons per year     Solid Waste Combustors: 30 tons per year     Commercial/Industrial Boilers: 29 tons per year     Medical Waste Incinerators: 16 tons per year     Hazardous Waste Combustors: 7 tons per year     Chlor-Alkali Plants: 7 tons per year     Portland Cement Plants: 5 tons per year     Key features of the ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act          of 1999''       Directs EPA to promulgate mercury emissions standards and      regulatory strategies for the largest emitting source      categories: fossil-fuel fired electric utility steam      generating units; fossil-fuel fired commercial and industrial      boilers; solid waste combustors; chlor-alkali plants; and      Portland cement plants.       Requires Reports to Congress: By EPA on progress in      implementing mercury emission reductions for medical waste      incinerators pursuant to existing regulations; by EPA on      progress in implementing mercury emission reductions for      hazardous waste combustors pursuant to existing regulations;      by the Department of Defense on the use of mercury and      mercury compounds by DoD.     Other features of ``Omnibus Mercury Emissions Reduction Act          of 1999''       Directs EPA to work with Canada and Mexico to inventory the      sources and pathways of mercury air and water pollution      within North America, and recommend options and strategies to      greatly reduce transboundary atmospheric and surface water      mercury pollution in North America.       Expanded research into characterizing the health effects of      mercury pollution to critical populations (i.e., pregnant      women and their fetuses, women of child bearing age, and      children).       Requires safe disposal of mercury recovered through coal      cleaning, flue gas control systems, and other pollution      control systems so that the hazards emanating from mercury      are not merely transferred from one environmental medium to      another.       Requires annual public reporting (hardcopy publication and      Internet) of facility-specific emissions of mercury and      mercury compounds;       Requires labeling of mercury containing items such as      fluorescent light bulbs, batteries, pharmaceuticals,      laboratory chemicals and reagents, electrical devices such as      thermostats, relays, and switches, and medical and scientific      equipment.       Begins a phase out of mercury from products. Exceptions may      be made for essential uses.       Implementation of public awareness and prevention programs.       More consistent state-by-state information on mercury-     related fish consumption advisories.       Expanded characterization of mercury sedimentation trends      and effects in Lake Champlain, the Great Lakes, the      Chesapeake Bay, the finger lakes region of upstate New York,      Tampa Bay, and other major water bodies.                                 ______                                       By
