Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Kasich-Dellums amendment.  We should not spend money we don't have on planes we do not need. Twenty more B-2 bombers will not help our children, our sick, our elderly, or national security. Buying more will not make our world a safer place.  President Eisenhower warned us of this day. He said: ``every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.''  This is the choice we make today. The time must come for a great nation to have the courage, the raw courage, not to spend millions and billions of dollars on weapons of mass destruction.  The time has come. Look in our hearts. Gather the courage to do what is right. Say ``no'' to more B-2's. Say ``yes'' to our children, our people, our future.
