Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Domestic Violence Awareness Month. Violent attacks are the No. 1 health threat to women in this country. In fact, women are at greater risk of injury from violent attacks than they are from cancer or heart attacks; or auto accidents, plane crashes, AIDS, or drowning.  Since coming to Congress, I have actively supported legislation to prevent violence against women. Unfortunately, the strides we made in the last Congress through passage of the Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] are being threatened by legislation this Congress which decreases levels of funding for essential programs.  My home State of Rhode Island is fortunate to have excellent resources for women who are victims of violence. I have had the opportunity to work with many of the people who have dedicated their lives to helping these victims, and I am well aware of the important and necessary work that they are doing. But we must continue to support these efforts. Much more remains to be done. Last year in Rhode Island more than 4,100 people asked the district and family courts for protection from abuse; 14,120 calls for help were answered on our State's seven domestic abuse hotlines; 854 abused women and children found safety and support in Rhode Island's six domestic violence shelters; 8,752 clients received advocacy and assistance from Rhode Island's domestic violence shelters and advocacy programs; and at least 12 people died in Rhode Island as a result of domestic violence, more than twice the number in 1993.  These numbers clearly illustrate the need for funding VAWA programs and strong laws to curb and prevent domestic violence. I will continue to work to strengthen laws, support legislation, and ensure Federal support for programs aimed at combating violence against women. I urge my colleagues to continue to raise awareness of this issue, and to support legislation aimed at solving this national crisis.                          ____________________
