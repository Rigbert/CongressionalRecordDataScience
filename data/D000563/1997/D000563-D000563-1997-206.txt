President, our friend and former colleague in this body, Paul Simon, has always been outspoken in his leadership on national issues. He continues to contribute to the national debate as the director of the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.  Paul recently gathered together a number of former Senators to consider the issue of Social Security. The group developed a Social Security proposal which they believe will provide a solvent Social Security system for the next 75 years.  I ask that the letter I received from this group be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:         Public Policy Institute, Southern Illinois University at            Carbondale,                                     Carbondale, IL, May 28, 1997.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Friend: Four of us--your former colleagues, two      Republicans and two Democrats--who will not be seeking office      again recently met to discuss an issue of great importance to      the nation: the future of Social Security's retirement trust      fund.       If this problem is not addressed immediately, the      difficulties will mount and the long-run picture for both the      fund and the confidence in our system of government is grim.      The sooner you address this problem, the easier it will be to      resolve. Postponing responsible action may be temporarily      politically attractive, but history will be harsh on those      who ducked when action was needed.       We believe that salvaging Social Security requires these      two fundamental changes:       1. Congress should act to correct the Consumer Price Index      to reflect reality.       2. Congress should remove the cap on the taxable amount of      income covered by Social Security.       The fundamental decisions on the future of Social Security      should not be in the hands of technicians, but in the hands      of those who are elected by the people to reflect the values      of this nation and to make fundamental decisions.       If you accept the recommendations we make, you will provide      the nation with a solvent Social Security retirement system,      along with a much healthier fiscal base.       If the sacrifices that we call upon people to make are      accepted, the trust fund should be secure for the lifetime of      our children and grandchildren. That is no small gift to the      future of our nation. You are in a position to make that      contribution.       This is a time that calls for your leadership. We      respectfully ask you to meet this challenge.     John Danforth.     Paul Simon.     David Pryor.     Alan Simpson.                          ____________________
