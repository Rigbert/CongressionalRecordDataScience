Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon). I happen to be one of the last remaining sponsors of IGRA, and believe, in fact, that the bill has worked very well; the act has worked very well.  As we know, the States have to enter into compacts with the tribes that apply for gambling activity within that State. It has worked well in almost all States of the Union and, in fact, has given the American Indian tribes an opportunity to be economically advanced and has done a very good job in doing so.  Unfortunately, some of those States that have existing gambling have gotten involved in denying the tribal entities to have the right to enter into these compacts, in fact stonewalled them. As the Secretary has informed the chairman, that he is not going to issue any more regulatory actions or suggestions until the court makes that decision. So this amendment is unnecessary.  I believe, in fact, it impugns upon the sovereignty of the American Indians, which we granted them. I, for one, as an author of the original bill with Mr. Mo Udall, do take homage to the fact that we are trying to undo that act and unfortunately I understand the gentleman's desires but I think it does a disservice to the American Indians and to the act itself.  Now I will say that I am willing to go through the court process. I hope it does go through the process, and I think we will be found in favor of IGRA and the results will be the continuation where the Secretary can, in fact, force a State to do it, if they do not negotiate in good faith.  So I do rise in strong opposition to this amendment, suggesting it is unnecessary and unwarranted at this time.
