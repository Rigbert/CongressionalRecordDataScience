  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have discovered the crisis in Medicare. We did not hear much about it last year when they stonewalled health care reform. We did not hear a thing about it during the contract in the first 100 days of the Congress or during the elections.  Suddenly they have discovered it. We have got to cut $270 billion out of Medicare. That is the bottom line, they tell us. And these cuts are to be revealed on the 22d of September, not before, and adopted on the 1st of October; 8 or 9 days for debate, discussion, hearings. The largest changes ever in Medicare, in 8 days.  Why 8 days? I think it is because what they are proposing. Beneficiaries who want to enroll in MediGap plans, they are going to penalize them. They are going to make them pay more for Medicare. They do not think you should have MediGap insurance, and the rich people do not need it, so why should average Americans?  MediGap coverages would be prohibited from covering part B expenses. They would increase premiums for Medicare recipients, impose a 20-percent coinsurance on home health services, a 20-percent coinsurance on skilled nursing, a 20-percent coinsurance on clinical laboratory.  This is what they are going to sneak through in 8 days. And now they are trying to cover their fannies.                          ____________________
