Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a great Alaskan, Mr. Gary Kurpius, who was recently elected Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Nation's largest association of combat veterans. Gary Kurpius was elected to his position on August 31, 2006, at the VFW's 10th National Convention, in Reno, Nevada. Gary Kurpius is the first Alaskan to hold this tremendously important position.  During the Vietnam War Gary Kurpius served with the Army's 541st Transportation Company providing vital convoy security throughout the central highlands, an extremely treacherous area. He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal with four bronze service stars and the Republic of Vietnam Service Medal, for his endeavors during the conflict. In addition to the medals received during Vietnam, Gary Kurpius was selected Vietnam Veteran of the Year for St. Louis County, Minnesota by President Jimmy Carter.  After the war, Gary Kurpius continued his unremitting passion for public service. This led him to join VFW Post 1539 in Babbitt, Minnesota in 1970, where he became a life member. He earned the title of All American Post Commander in 1977 and in 1983 was named All American District Commander. Gary then transferred to VFW Post 9785 in Eagle River, Alaska in 1985. Currently Gary is a Life Member of VFW Post 9365 in Wasilla, Alaska, near to where he currently resides with his wife Nancy, in the beautiful city of Anchorage.  Gary has served diligently in the Department of Alaska service office for the last 19 years and as Department Adjutant for the past 17 years. Then in 2001, Gary was elected Department Commander and earned All-American Department Commander status. Most recently Gary completed a two-year term as Governor Tony Knowles' appointee to the Alaska Veterans Advisory Council.  Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Gary Kurpius, is also a member of the Military Order of the Cootie, American Legion and Vietnam Veterans of America. In 1999, he received the Alaska Community Service Medal. Few men have had such a dedicated and lengthy history of service and I know that Gary Kurpius will continue to serve with the same dedication and fortitude, meeting all the challenges he is presented with.  On behalf of The United States of America, I extend my thanks and appreciation to Commander-in-Chief Gary Kurpius, for his dedication and service to American Servicemen, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and to the people of the Great State of Alaska.                          ____________________
