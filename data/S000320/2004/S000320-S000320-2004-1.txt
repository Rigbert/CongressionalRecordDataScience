 President, I want to mention a staffer of mine. She is not a Senator but she is very important in my office, Vicki Lee Cox; Vicki Lee, as she was when she came to work with me in 1978 when I was elected to the House of Representatives. Her father was a naval officer in the Naval Academy. She lived around the world. She was born in Pensacola, FL, grew up part of her life in the San Diego area, the San Francisco area, and in Newport, RI. I have worked with her for 26 years, day in and day out. I tried to get her not to retire because these are very important employees. They make your office go. They make us look better than we should, day to day. They make things work in the office.  Vicki, we will miss you in the office. We hope you will not be far off because we might need to bring you back to help us out from time to time as we get in a bind.  We wish you and your husband Dale the very best, but we have a job opening for you if you want to change your mind. God bless you, and we enjoyed the 26 years.                          ____________________
