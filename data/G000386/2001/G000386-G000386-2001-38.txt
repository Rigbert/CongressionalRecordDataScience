 President, I want our colleagues to know that what this amendment does is exactly the same as we are doing in the case of car dealerships. We have a bill, S. 1140, which has 47 cosponsors. I am not going to read the names of the cosponsors, but it is a very bipartisan group of people, Democrats and Republicans. I hope that staff listening to this debate or Members listening to this debate will look at S. 1140 and remind their Members, or the Members themselves will be reminded, that they are cosponsoring legislation that does away with arbitration in car dealership contracts with major manufacturers. If it is OK for nonagricultural businesses, it even has to be better for the family farmer that we don't have these sorts of requirements in these contracts. I ask my colleagues to take a look at S. 1140.
