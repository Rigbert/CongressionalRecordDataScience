 First, in a very short response to your question, I do not expect the legislation dealing with stem cells to be coming to the floor next week.  I do, however, respond to the gentleman that we are considering bringing to the floor legislation, similar, in terms of specifics, very similar, if not the same, as the bill that passed this House on a bipartisan vote in the last Congress.  We believe that that will be consistent with the President's action this week dealing with the executive order on stem-cell research.  We believe this research provides real hope for some of mankind's most difficult diseases and afflictions and challenges. We think the research is promising.  On the other hand, we want to make sure that it does, in fact, do what we say we want to do. As you know, when we passed legislation like that before, we made it very clear that human cloning was not something that the Congress supported and that we were specifically prohibiting that.  So in answer to your question, I would think the legislation would be very much along those same lines. But we do not expect it to be here this week. I want to tell the gentleman it may be, however, on the floor prior to our leaving for the recess.
