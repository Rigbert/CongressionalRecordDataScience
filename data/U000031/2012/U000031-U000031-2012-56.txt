Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Waxman, Chairman Harkin, Senator Enzi, and Members on both sides of the aisle in both the House and the Senate who played a role in this process. S. 3187 is a reflection of the hard work put in by both Members and staff, and of everyone's willingness to put partisanship aside to look at the issues together. Because of that outstanding dedication, we have a bill today that will make a real difference in the lives of so many patients and provide much-needed support for innovators across our great country.  At the outset of this Congress, I set a goal of enacting this bill by the end of June--and here we are, well before the clock expires for this month--in order to provide certainty for American patients and innovators. I never lost confidence that we could deliver the bipartisan reforms we needed, and I am so proud that we will accomplish that goal.  Mr. Speaker, this is a jobs bill, and it's a medical innovation bill. And as we put this package together, our goal was to improve the predictability, consistency, transparency, and efficiency of FDA regulation. These reforms will help get new treatments to patients more quickly. They will help us not only keep jobs in Michigan and all across the country, but also to create new ones. In order to get it right, we turned to patients, innovators, and job creators who provided firsthand experience of how the current system is broken. And we included many of their suggestions in the bill.  This bill includes significant accountability and reform measures designed to hold the FDA responsible for its performance. The measure includes independent assessments of FDA's drug and device review process. It also includes requiring quarterly reporting from the device center so we don't have to wait a year to find out FDA's progress. The bill is about patients, and that's why so many patient advocates have spoken out in support of these reforms. Whether it is steps that we took to support treatments for rare diseases or mitigate drug shortages or speed up the approval of devices that will improve a patient's quality of life, these are steps that will make a real and significant difference.                              {time}  1430  They're going to keep the U.S. at the forefront of medical innovation where we belong.  This bill is just the first step. This bill provides the resources and the game plans so that FDA can improve its performance.
