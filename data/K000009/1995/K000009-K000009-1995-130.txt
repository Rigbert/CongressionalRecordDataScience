Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I want to rise in very strong support of the Sanders amendment.  To my good friend, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Leach], I would say what is going on has nothing to do with sniping, it has nothing to do with a new President, nothing to do with a new leadership in the Congress. It has everything to do with the establishment of precedent in a republic that is over 200 years old.  I want to commend the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] for forcing us to meet our constitutional responsibilities. If any Member believes it is wrong that the Government of the United States, by the agreement of perhaps six men, decided to send billions of dollars to Mexico to bail out their investments, without a vote of Congress, without a vote of Congress, if members believe that was wrong, as I do, they will support the Sanders amendment.  The backdoor use of an obscure fund in the Treasury called the Economic Stabilization Fund, a fund that the Clinton administration essentially raided, with the collusion of about four leaders in this House and a few over in the Senate, is unprecedented in both magnitude of the dollars involved, the purposes for which the fund was originally established several decades ago, and also the duration and risk attached to what has been done.  Mr. Chairman, I really respect my colleague, the gentleman from Iowa, as a staunch defender of our Constitution. Thus, it surprises me a bit to hear him argue in the way he has argued this afternoon. Our country has never extended loans to a foreign country on a medium- or long-term basis from this fund, never $20 billion and more of commitment. This particular commitment was 20 times as large as any prior use of this fund. Never has it been the will of this Congress to provide the executive branch with unlimited authority of this sort.
