 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, next week the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour debates and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of this week. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday.  For Wednesday and the balance of the week, we plan to consider several bills that address the impact of health care costs and American job creation and economic prosperity: H.R. 7249, flexible spending accounts; H.R. 4280, medical liability reform; and H.R. 4281, association health plans.  In addition, we will also consider H.R. 4275, which would permanently extend the 10 percent individual income tax bracket.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that we do expect to have votes next Friday, May 14.  Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to answer any questions.
