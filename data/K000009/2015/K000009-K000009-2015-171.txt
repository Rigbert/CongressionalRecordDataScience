Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a landmark business in Toledo, Ohio. Red Wells Roast Beef restaurant closed its doors this month after nearly 100 years of serving its traditional hot roast beef sandwich. As he retires, owner Richard Wells does not wish to sell the restaurant and its homemade offerings.  Legendary in West Toledo, Red Wells officially began in 1894 when Allen and Eva Wells served food in their hotels, boarding houses and saloons. After he returned from service in World War 1, their son Clark Wells--nicknamed ``Red''--partnered with his father to open up a restaurant serving signature hot roast beef sandwiches. The restaurant grew quickly and in 1930 the family opened up two restaurants in downtown Toledo, one of which was the first restaurant in the city to be electrified. Richard Wells started in the family business in 1946. He persuaded the family to open up its current location on Sylvania Avenue in West Toledo in 1957.  The business continued to do well offering a menu of items first cooked by Eva Wells: in addition to the most luscious hot roast beef sandwiches anywhere in the world, the restaurant also served such comfort food as mashed potatoes and Red Wells' famous gravy, a hot turkey sandwich, green beans, corn, pies and pudding. Richard Wells also grew the business to other locations, but it was the Sylvania Avenue restaurant that was the business' mainstay.  A gathering place for friends and family, both the regular and occasional diners of Red Wells will surely miss its homey cafeteria atmosphere, friendly staff and hearty food. Just as the restaurant was generational, so too were the diners. Patrons passed their love of Red Wells down through their children. On its last day there were so many people the restaurant could not serve them all.  As Richard Wells eases into retirement, we wish him much enjoyment spending time doing what he wishes and being with those for whom he cares. May he know that the legend that became Red Wells Roast Beef restaurant will live on in Toledo memory.                          ____________________
