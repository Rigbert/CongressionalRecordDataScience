 President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. There are currently two LIHEAP amendments pending to the bill, as well as the bipartisan ethanol amendment. At this time, I urge any Member who wishes to offer an amendment to contact the chairman or ranking member of the Energy Committee so that time can be scheduled for the consideration of such amendments.  Members should expect rollcall votes during today's session. It is anticipated that we will be able to dispose of several energy amendments later today. Members will be notified, of course, when the first vote is scheduled.  For the remainder of the week, the Senate will continue the consideration of the Energy bill and wrap up action on the Department of Defense authorization bill. Rollcall votes are therefore expected each day during this week.                          ____________________
