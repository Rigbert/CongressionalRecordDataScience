Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that clarification.  Given the issue of why, especially for teenagers, cash assistance is in their best interests, we are hoping to keep our young people in school. One of the costs associated with that goal is baby-sitting. A voucher, as best I can read it, is not going to accommodate that, so I would hope that that issue would be revisited, as well.  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. Bunn] for his leadership. It is very much appreciated, I think, by everyone who cares deeply, as we all do, about the plight of these teenagers. The gentleman needs to be congratulated.
