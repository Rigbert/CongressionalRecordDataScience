 President, I come to the floor today to congratulate a constituent and a great friend of mine, Katie Roth of West Des Moines. This summer Katie was named the 2015 Woman Business Owner of the Year, presented by the Business Record.  In the spring of 2005, Katie, who is never shy to take on a challenge, opened her own staffing agency and has built it from the ground up. Ten years later, Portico Staffing has thrived under her exceptional leadership, business savvy, and highly regarded reputation as a people person. Katie knows how to build relationships and find opportunities needed to grow a business. Along the way, she has helped countless Iowa employers and job-seekers find one another. You might say she is a perfect matchmaker. For the last decade, Katie has worked hard to carve out a slice of the American dream by owning and growing her own business. She knows it comes with sacrifice and risk. And she has worked hard to make her dream come true. Katie is a great mentor and role model for the next generation. She shows that perseverance and persistence pay off. Always on the job, whether networking in the community or listening to her clients, Katie makes good connections happen. And that is a good thing for job seekers and employers looking to hire and grow their business.  Katie was nominated by her peers for consideration of this prestigious award. It is no surprise to me that my fellow Iowans would sing her praises. Without hesitation, I endorse Katie's selection as the 2015 Business Owner of the Year. I have had the pleasure of knowing Katie Roth since 1980 when she joined my first campaign for the U.S. Senate. Always a tireless worker, I have enjoyed watching Katie thrive and succeed throughout the years. A loving wife and mother, Katie is fiercely loyal and Barbara and I hold her in our highest regard.  Barbara and I extend our congratulations to Katie Roth for this well-deserved honor. We wish her the very best as she blazes the trail for many years to come.                          ____________________
