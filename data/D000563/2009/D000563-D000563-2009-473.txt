We are not sure if that will be the exact number, but take it as an example. We are talking about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. If you accumulate the cost of health care in America over the next 10 years, starting this year at $2.5 trillion, and assuming it goes up to at least $3 trillion, maybe $3.5 trillion, it seems to me we are dealing, over that period of time, with an accumulated cost of health care in America over 10 years of $30 to $35 trillion, I think, is probably a fair estimate.
