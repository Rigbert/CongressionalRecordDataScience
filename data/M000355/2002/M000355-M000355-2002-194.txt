 I recounted all the meetings he and I and our staffs had had, and I was exasperated that we seemed to have gotten so close and not been able to complete it. I confirm what the Senator from Arizona said, that we have reached an agreement among the three of us on this technical package. We would like to be able to move it, and we would plead with our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give us a chance. I don't think there are three Members of the Senate who know any more about the subject than we do. Our positions are pretty well established. We have actually reached agreement, and we would hope that the Senate would let us act on it in some kind of consent arrangement sometime tomorrow.
