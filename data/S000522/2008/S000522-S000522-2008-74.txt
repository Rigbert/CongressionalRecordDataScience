I thank my good friend for yielding.  Madam Chairman, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Berman.  I would note there are two versions of the committee report for H.R. 5501 designated as part 1 and part 2. I wish to clarify that the definitive version that applies for purposes of the legislative history of this bill is part 2.  Is that the understanding of the chairman?
