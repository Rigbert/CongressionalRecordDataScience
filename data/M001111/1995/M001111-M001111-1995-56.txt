 President, I rise in support of the asset sale scoring prohibition amendment jointly offered by Senators Bumpers, Bradley, and me.  The budget resolution before us has been termed an historic document. It certainly is. For the last decade, the Congress of the United States has recognized that our public lands and other Federal assets were too precious to sell or lease unless Congress or the Administration decided that so doing was in the best interest of the public. That is good policy and one that traditionally has enjoyed strong bi-partisan support.  But it is a new day. Today, we may well vote to sell our children's heritage to pay our debts. I reject this approach to debt reduction and I reject this approach to disposition of our Federal assets.  While this bill only puts up for sale the rights to develop oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, these wilderness lands are only the beginning. Other public lands, national treasures and assets are being proposed for sale in the House budget reconciliation bill and more likely will be targeted next year and the year after. Henceforth, unless this amendment is adopted, any public lands or Federal assets can be sold for the quick cash and political capital gained from balancing the budget in a given year. It is a dangerous, bad precedent.  Mr. President, our assets should not be sold simply to reduce the deficit. Instead, our Federal assets should be sold only when, after reasoned debate and a full public airing, we decide their sale is in the best interest not only of our generation--but of every generation that follows. We owe our children much more than a balanced budget. We owe them their heritage.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support our important amendment and thwart efforts to sell our heritage for quick cash.
