 President, I want to address two aspects of this legislation because they are necessarily connected. One is, obviously, the increase in the minimum wage. The other one is the small business tax provisions that have come out of the committee Senator Baucus chairs and on which I am the ranking member, the Finance Committee. I want to deal with the minimum wage part of this issue first.  Popular support for raising the minimum wage is based on a number of widely held beliefs: First, that no one can support a family at $5.15 an hour; second, minimum wage earners will not get a pay raise unless Congress gives them one; and third, raising the minimum wage helps millions of poor workers and hurts no one.  Unfortunately, these popular beliefs are in some cases misleading and in some cases outright wrong. First, minimum wage earners are not trying to support a family--or you might argue a small percentage of them are trying to support a family, but I want to say why most are not. Those who are, of course, can get additional benefits through Government programs to supplement family income; thus, no one has to rely solely on the minimum wage to support a family.  Second, minimum wage jobs are generally entry level jobs. Most workers who start at the minimum wage quickly earn more. Few workers remain stuck at the minimum wage for very long and, unfortunately, those who do are most at risk of losing their jobs from a minimum wage increase.  Third, the benefits of a minimum wage increase do not go exclusively to poor families. Only 15 percent of the proposed minimum wage increase would go to those living below the poverty level, as an example. Increasing the minimum wage would result in higher prices for consumers of minimum wage products, higher unemployment among the least skilled minimum wage workers--and that particularly affects minority groups within our country--increased poverty among minimum wage families, and in some cases it could be a combination of these three things I mentioned.  Much of the popular support for the minimum wage is based on a fallacy, that the Government can help the poor without hurting anyone else. But if the Government can increase wages with no ill effects, then why stop at $7.25, as is currently proposed? Why not make it $10.25? Why not make it $20.25, or even more? The fact is, this does have limited impact and it does have some negative consequences, so that is why these occasional increases are justified.  Popular support for increasing the minimum wage is tempered by the fact that virtually everyone agrees that there is some level at which the minimum wage would produce obvious negative effects. In the past, policymakers have attempted to mitigate any negative effects by limiting the size of the minimum wage increase, providing tax credits to employers who hire at-risk workers, and providing tax or regulatory relief to business generally, particularly small businesses.  However, additional research in recent years has cast some doubt on the effectiveness of these previous efforts. First, research suggests raising the minimum wage does not reduce poverty among minimum wage earners. Instead, it most likely increases poverty.  Second, legislative action by various States to adopt their own higher minimum wage has led to significant differences within our 50 States.  Third, research shows that the earned income tax credit could provide a cost-effective way to help poorest workers and be more effective than even increasing the minimum wage.  I am pleased that over the last few years we have enhanced the earned income credit for many families by making the child tax credit refundable. That is through the work of the Senate Finance Committee.  Before I go on to my next point I would say parenthetically there are studies that have been updated quite frequently over the last 20 or 25 years, where economists have followed people in quintiles: the lowest, the second, you know, for five quintiles from the lowest income up to the highest income. Following people over a period of years, they have been able to study the mobility of the American worker. In other words, once you are in the workforce, most people work themselves up the economic ladder--some way up, some part way up. But we find that only about 2 percent of our population seems to be stuck in the lowest quintile of income for long periods of time--a very small percentage. But other people go from the second quintile--from the first to the second to the third, and we also find that there is a larger percentage of our population that moves up from the lower two quintiles into the third or the fourth quintiles--a lot more rapidly and with a lot more mobility than we find people moving from the fourth to the top. While there are some people moving down from the highest to a lower quintile, history proves the mobility of the workforce in America is very much upward.  Despite some serious policy concerns, public support for increasing the minimum wage remains strong. That is why the Senate is taking up a minimum wage increase. The political reality is a majority of Senators support a minimum wage increase.  So a lot of economists would make an argument that you should not have any increase in the minimum wage at all and that the mistakes, going back to the 1930s, were mistakes; that you should not interfere with the marketplace. But Congress has decided for 70 years to do that. We are in the process for doing it. Regardless of the economic arguments, as long as this is apolitical issue, without a doubt, from time to time it is going to be raised and I suppose you could make an argument that, as long as it is political it ought to be raised, or else you should not even have a minimum wage.  Now I would go to the tax incentive portions we hope stay in this bill when it goes to the other body. Tax incentives targeted to small business and other businesses impacted by a minimum wage increase have been linked to the minimum wage legislation. We have done this in the past decade. Democrats have at times joined Republicans supporting this language.  I would quote from two former chairmen on this committee in their opening remarks on the conference agreement on the last piece of legislation that went through this body to raise the minimum wage. Senator Roth, then the chairman of the committee, described taxes as the sand that grinds the gears of small business. So he saw merit in small business tax relief as a separate matter. Senator Roth went on to say:       [We will] proceed to the legislation on the minimum wage      and small business taxes. We're anxious to move ahead on the      small business tax legislation.  Senator Moynihan, who at times was chairman of the committee and at times the ranking Democrat, said, at the same time Senator Roth was speaking:       My distinguished chairman, as always, has so stated the      facts. But there is a small semantic issue here. Some call      this a small business relief act; others on this side call it      the minimum wage bill. But we will not resolve that tonight,      nor need we.  Now, the next time the Senate deals with this, about 8 or 9 years since we last dealt with it, it is still the same issue. Senators Roth and Moynihan were right then, and if they were still living today, I would tell them they are right now.  To different groups of Senators, these topics carry their own benefits or burdens. Many on my side don't like the idea of second-guessing the labor market with a federally mandated minimum wage. I pointed out some of the related issues that should give us pause, arguments put forth by economists when considering this legislation, that it is not all positive.  Many on the Democratic side want a straight minimum wage hike and refuse to consider the burden that policy puts on employers and workers. Those Members do not want any linkage between the minimum wage policy and small business tax relief. As Senator Moynihan said, however, we don't have to agree now whether the upcoming legislation will be a minimum wage or a small business tax relief bill.  Some, mostly Democrats, will call it a minimum wage bill. Some, mostly Republicans, will call it a small business tax relief bill. Still others will call it both a minimum wage and small business tax relief bill. President Bush, like President Clinton, the last President who signed an increase in the minimum wage bill years ago, will recognize both parts of the package. If my friends on the other side review the statement made by President Clinton, they will see that he saw merit in small business tax relief.  Our Committee on Finance chairman, Senator Baucus, recognizes the linkage. I told him Republicans will insist on a small business tax relief package. He, in his cooperative way, as I hope I have been cooperative with him in the past, has heard us. Some in his caucus, their labor union friends and sympathetic ears of the east coast media, attacked Senator Baucus--which I don't understand--for recognizing a basic reality, as Senator Moynihan and Senator Roth worked together a decade ago to do, to see that there is some negative impact on small business from an increase in the minimum wage so you ought to offset that with some benefit to small business through the tax portions of the legislation.  Those folks who are criticizing Senator Baucus don't have the responsibility to find the middle ground and evidently think we can get a bill through the Senate that can get the votes without finding the middle ground. It can't be done.  Now, if I were chairman--and I am not chairman, and I am not crying about that--I would have tilted this package a little bit more toward the depreciation incentive and less toward the work opportunity tax credits. The reality is, Republicans don't have a majority on the Committee on Finance or in the full Senate, so chairman Baucus has struck a balance between majority Democrats and minority Republicans.  I will assist Senator Baucus in defending the tax relief package that goes for the offsets and the revenue-losing provisions. We should not disturb the core structure of this package. I am hopeful, however, that we will improve the package by enhancing the package on the depreciation side, as Senator Kyl has suggested. It is important these incentives coincide with the time when the minimum wage increase will take effect. In seeking this objective we will need to find appropriate offsets, obviously. There may be other improvements.  The bottom line is the Committee on Finance package is a well-known set of small business tax relief measures, things we have done before--extending, mostly. These proposals have merit by themselves, but a minimum wage increase is not likely to pass the Senate without them. I hope everyone understands that.  As many know, I am a working family farmer. For farmers, fields look familiar because we work our fields every year. This linkage, then, to put a commonsense touch on it, is that the linkage between minimum wage and small business relief is a familiar feel. I can quote Roth and Moynihan ad infinitum to prove it. It is not something new that is coming up with Baucus and Grassley. We have plowed this ground before. This is well-known common ground.  I referred to President Clinton in a signing ceremony about 10 years ago. That legislation was founded on a small business tax relief package twice this size. I emphasize it was twice the size of what people are complaining about now that we are presenting to the Senate. It was supported at that time by many seeking cloture on the bill that is before the Senate.  President Clinton singled out the work opportunity tax credit and the depreciation proposals in his remarks. My friend, Senator Kennedy, attended the signing ceremony and was recognized by President Clinton for the great product they brought to President Clinton. And John Sweeney was recognized, the head of the AFL-CIO.  I ask unanimous consent the remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  The White House,                                Office of the Press Secretary,                                                  August 20, 1996.     Remarks by the President at signing of the Small Business Job                          Protection Act of 1996       The President: Thank you very much. Cathy, it may be your      birthday, but I would say that everybody feels that you have      given us a great gift today by reminding us about what this      is all about. And we wish you and your fine children well.      And I don't think being in the band will hurt them a bit. I'm      glad you're going to do that. (Laughter.)       I want to thank the members of our administration who are      here--Secretary Reich, Small Business Administrator Phil      Lader and others. I want to thank all the members of Congress      who are here, especially Senator Kennedy who, himself,      probably broke the wage in hour laws by working so hard to      pass this bill. If we'd been paying him by the hour we'd be      underpaying him in the last year. Thank you very much.      (Applause.)       There are a lot of people who worked hard on this bill who      aren't here--Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt,      Congressman Bonior, Congressman Clay, in particular did. I      want to join with others and thank the countless labor unions      who have championed this bill, led by the truly tireless John      Sweeney. (Applause.)       I'd like to remind the American people of something,      because sometimes our unions are criticized for looking out      for their members too much. There are very few unions in      America that have minimum wage workers. Most of these unions      did this because they thought it was the right thing to do.      They spent their time and their money and their energy trying      to help other people who do not belong to their organization,      and I thank you for that. (Applause.)       I'd like to thank the religious groups, the economists, the      business people who have made this their cause of concern.      Again, I thank the members, including members of both      parties, who supported this legislation.       I'll say more in a moment about the rest of the bill, but      let me just begin by saying this is a truly remarkable piece      of legislation. It is pro-work, pro-business and pro-family;      it raises the minimum wage; it helps small businesses in a      number of ways that I will     explain in a moment, including retirement and incentive to      invest; and it promotes adoption in two very sweeping ways      that have long needed to be done in the United States. This      is a cause for celebration for all Americans of all parties,      all walks of life, all faiths. This bill represents the very      best in our country.       It will give 10 million Americans, as Cathy said, a chance      to raise stronger families and build better futures. By      coming together across lines that have too often divided us      and finding common ground, we have made this a real season of      achievement for the people of America.       At its heart, this bill does reaffirm our most profoundly      American values--offering opportunity to all, demanding      responsibility from all, and coming together as a community      to do the right thing. This bill says to the working people      of America: If you're willing to take responsibility and go      to work, your work will be honored. We're going to honor your      commitment to your family, we're going to recognize that      $4.25 an hour is not enough to raise a family.       It's harder and harder to raise children today and harder      and harder for people to succeed at home and at work. And I      have said repeatedly, over and over again to the American      people: We must not force our families to make a choice. Most      parents have to work. We have a national interest in seeing      that our people can succeed at home where it counts the most      in raising their children, and succeed at work so they'll      have enough income to be able to succeed at home. We must do      both, and this bill helps us achieve that goal. (Applause.)       These 10 million Americans will become part of America's      economic success story. A success story that in the last four      years has led us to 900,000 new construction jobs; a record      number of new businesses started, including those owned by      women and minorities; a deficit that is the smallest it's      been since 1981, and 60 percent less than it was when I took      office; 10 million new jobs; 12 million American families who      have been able to take advantage of Family and Medical Leave;      almost 4.5 million new homeowners and 10 million other      Americans who refinanced their homes at lower mortgage rates.      And, most importantly of all, perhaps, real hourly wages,      which fell for a decade, have finally begun to rise again.      America is on the move. (Applause.)       But our challenge, my fellow Americans, is to make sure      that every American can reap the rewards of a growing      economy, every American has the tools to make the most of his      or her own life, to build those strong families and to      succeed at home and at work. As the Vice President said, the      first step was taken in 1993 with the passage of the Family      and Medical Leave Law and with the Earned Income Tax Credit,      which cut taxes for 15 million working families. Today, that      earned income tax credit is worth about $1,000 to a family of      four with an income under $28,000 a year.       Well, today, we complete the second half of that effort.      Together with our tax cut for working families, this bill      ensures that a parent working full-time at the minimum wage      can lift himself or herself and their children out of      poverty. Nobody who works full-time with kids in the home      should be in poverty. If we want to really revolutionize      America's welfare system and move people from welfare to work      and reward work, that is the first, ultimate test we all have      to meet. If you get up every day and you go to work, and you      put in your time and you have kids in your home, you and your      children will not be in poverty. (Applause.)       We have some hard working minimum wage people here today      supporting Cathy. Let me tell you about them. Seventy percent      of them are adults, six of 10 are working women, and for      them, work is about more than a paycheck, it's about pride.      They want a wage they can raise their families on. By raising      the minimum wage by 90 cents, this bill, over two years, will      give those families an additional $1,800 a year in income--     enough to buy seven months of groceries, several months of      rent, or child care. Or, as Cathy said, to pay all of the      bills from the utilities in the same month.       For many, this bill will make the difference between their      ability to keep their families together and their failure to      do so. These people reflect America's values, and it's a lot      harder for them than it is for most of us to go around living      what they say they believe in. It's about time they got a      reward and, today, they'll get it. (Applause.)       I would also like to say a very special word of thanks to      the business owners, especially the small business owners who      supported this bill. Many of the minimum wage employers I      talk to wanted to pay their employees more than $4.25 an hour      and would be happy to do so as long as they can do it without      hurting their businesses, and that means their competitors      have to do the same thing. This bill will allow them to      complete and win, to have happier, more productive employees,      and to know they're doing the right thing. For all of those      small businesses, I am very, very appreciative. (Applause.)       I would also like to say that this bill does a remarkable      number of things for small businesses. In each of the last      three years, our nation has set a new record in each      succeeding year in the number of new businesses stated. And      we know that most of the new jobs in America are being      created by small- and medium-sized businesses. In 1993, I      proposed a $15,000 increase in the amount of capital a small      business can expense, to spark the kind of investment that      they need to create jobs. Well, in 1993 we only won half that      increase, but today I'll get to sign the second half into      law, and I thank the Congress for passing that, as well.      (Applause.)       As the Vice President said, this bill also includes a Work      Opportunity Tax Credit to provide jobs for the most      economically disadvantaged working Americans, including      people who want to move from welfare to work. Now, there will      be a tightly drawn economic incentive for people to hire      those folks and give them a chance to enter the workforce, as      well. It extends the research tax credit to help businesses      stay competitive in the global economy. It extends a tax      incentive for businesses to train and educate their      employees. That's good news for people who need those skills,      and it's good news for America because we have to have the      best educated workforce in the world in the 21st century.       This legislation does even more to strengthen small      business by strengthening the families that make them up. It      helps millions of more Americans to save for their own      retirement. It makes it much easier for small businesses to      offer pension plans by creating a new small business 401(k)      plan. It also lets more Americans keep their pensions when      they change jobs without having to wait a year before they      can start saving at their new jobs. As many as 10 million      Americans without pensions today could now earn them as a      result of this bill.       I'm delighted we are joined today, among others, by Shawn      Marcell, the CEO of Prima Facie, a fast-growing video      monitoring company in Pennsylvania, which now has just 17      employees--but that's a lot more than he started with. He      stood with me in April and promised that if we kept our word      and made pensions easier and cheaper for small businesses      like his, he'd give pensions to all of his employees. Today,      he has told us he's making good on that pledge. I'd like him      to stand up, and say I predict that thousands more will      follow Shawn's lead. Thank you, Shawn. Please stand up. Let's      give him a hand. God bless you, sir. Thank you. (Applause.)       I'd also like to say a special word of thanks to our SBA      Administrator, Phil Lader, and to the White House Conference      on Small Business. When the White House Conference on Small      Business met, they said one of their top priorities was      increasing the availability and the security of pensions for      small business owners in America. This is a good thing. It is      also pro-work, pro-family and pro-business.       Finally, this bill does something else that is especially      important to me and to Hillary--and I'm glad she's here with      us today. It breaks down the financial and bureaucratic      barriers to adoption, giving more children what every child      needs and deserves--loving parents and a strong, stable home.      (Applause.)       Two weeks ago, we had a celebration for the American      athletes who made us so proud in Atlanta at the Centennial      Olympics. Millions of Americans now know that one of them--     the Decathlon Gold medalist, Dan O'Brien--speaks movingly      about having been an adopted child and how much the support      of his family meant in his life. Right now, there are tens of      thousands of children waiting for the kind of family that      helped to make Dan O'Brien an Olympic champion. At the same      time, there are thousands of middle class families that want      to bring children into their homes but cannot afford it.      We're offering a $5,000 tax credit to help bring them      together. It gives even more help to families that will adopt      children with disabilities or take in two siblings, rather      than seeing them split up.       And, lastly, this bill ends the long-standing bias against      interracial adoption which has too often meant an endless,      needless wait for America's children. (Applause.)       You know, as much as we talk about strong, loving families,      it's not every day that we here in Washington get to enact a      law that literally creates them or helps them stay together.      This is such a day. Although he can't be with us today, I      also want to thank Dave Thomas, himself adopted, who went on      to found Wendy's and do so much for our country. Perhaps more      than any other American citizen, he has made these adoption      provisions possible, and we thank him.       Lastly, I'd like to point out that we do have some      significant number of adoptive families here with us today,      including some who are on the stage. And so I'd just like to      acknowledge the Weeks (ph.) family, the Wolfington (ph.)      family, the Outlaw (ph.) family, the Fitzwater (ph.) family,      and ask them and anyone else here from the adoptive family      community to stand up who'd like to stand. We'd like to      recognize you and thank you for being here. Thank you all for      being here. Thank you. (Applause.)       Beside me, or in front of me now, is the desk used by      Frances Perkins--Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary and the      very first woman ever to serve in the Cabinet. She was one of      our greatest labor secretaries. It was from her desk that      many of America's pioneering wage, hour and workplace laws      originated--including the very first 25 cent an hour minimum      wage signed into law by President Roosevelt in 1938.       Secretary Perkins understood that a living wage was about      more than feeding a family or shelter from a storm. A living      wage makes it possible to participate in what she called the      culture of community--to take part in the family, the      community, the religious life we all cherish. Confident in      our ability to     provide for ourselves and for our children, secure in the      knowledge that hard work does pay. A minimum wage increase,      portable health care, pension security, welfare to work      opportunities--that's a plan that's putting America on the      right track.       Now, we have to press forward, giving tax cuts for      education and child-rearing and child care, buying a first      home, finishing that job of balancing the budget without      violating our obligations to our parents and our children and      the disabled and health care, to education and the      environment and to our future. That's a plan that will keep      America on the right track, building strong families and      strong futures by working together.       For everyone here who played a role in this happy day, I      thank you, America thanks you, and our country is better      because of your endeavors. God bless you. Thank you.      (Applause.)       (The bill is signed.) (Applause.)
