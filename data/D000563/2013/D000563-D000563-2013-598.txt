President, I just want to make one postscript. When Paul Ryan, the Republican candidate for Vice President and the chairman of the House Republican Budget Committee, wrote his 2011 budget, he included the very fund which the Senator from Pennsylvania refers to as the Canadian invasion fund. So it was a good idea when Paul Ryan had to write a budget. It is a bad idea when we are trying to avoid the pain of sequestration.
