Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I want to say to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton), and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), and others who have worked on this case, that this is a compelling case. There is no doubt about it. And I have spent substantial time talking about it. I have in turned talked with the Treasury Department about it tonight very briefly, and not fully, but I want to say that we are all agreed that this is a compelling case. And although the language is not finally in the Senate yet, it is in the committee reported bill.  There are some other issues involved. However, I am hopeful, and I have talked to the chairman about this, I am hopeful that we can, as the gentleman from New York said, and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) said, and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Saxton) said, resolve this so that the family, who has been grievously injured, will have redress of that grievance. And I look forward to working with the gentlemen from New Jersey over the next few weeks and the gentleman from New York and the chairman toward that end.
