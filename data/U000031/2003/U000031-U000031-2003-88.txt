Speaker, I commend my colleagues for this needed legislation, which ensures the federal government's deep commitment to a highly trained, diverse workforce. But we should go even further. In order to best maximize federal government resources, we should encourage competition in all aspects of the student loan program, including consolidation loans.  In order to instill such competition, we will need to make sure that during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, which is currently moving through the Education and the Workforce Committee, we repeal the single holder rule. I want to thank Chairman Boehner and Congressman McKeon, for their efforts to keep college costs under control during consideration of this important legislation. It will be part of my commitment to them as well as Federal agencies, students and families everywhere that they can have the benefit of competition from the more than one thousand qualified lenders in the program when they consolidate their loans and, thus, allow them to take advantage of historically low fixed interest rates.                          ____________________
