 President, last week, in yet another remarkable act of courage, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi announced her party, the National League for Democracy, will not participate in the constitutional convention called by the State Law and Order Restoration Council, SLORC.  As many who have followed Burma in recent years know, remaining true to the people who elected her and the NLD in 1990, Suu Kyi declared,       A country which is drawing up a constitution that will      decide the future of the state should have the confidence of      the people.a standard SLORC clearly does not and cannot meet.  In fact, SLORC has already stacked the constitutional deck against the NLD and Suu Kyi. Convention participants have been forced to accept guidelines that will preserve a leading role for the military in Burma's political life and would exclude anyone married to a foreigner from assuming the office of president. As we all know, this would prevent Suu Kyi from assuming the position she was elected in 1990 to fulfill since she is married to a British scholar.  Mr. President, at the end of my comments, I will insert two articles which appeared on November 30 in the Washington Post and the New York Times regarding the current situation in Burma--there is no question that the decision to boycott has increased the level of tension in Rangoon. SLORC has now charged Suu Kyi and her supporters as engaging in confrontational politics, but, as Suu Kyi is quick to point out:       What they have termed confrontational is that we have asked      for dialogue, which we want in order to prevent      confrontation. To silence the views of people whose opinions      are different by putting them in prison is far more      confrontational.  Let me assure my colleagues that Suu Kyi's understanding of the deteriorating situation in Burma is not a lonely minority view. Last week the United Nations, once again, took up the question of Burma's political and human rights record. Once again, the Special Rapporteur, Dr. Yokota, issued a report which few may actually read, but it is a powerful voice for the thousands and thousands of Burmese citizens who continue to suffer at the hands of SLORC.  Let me briefly tick off the observations made in the report.  In describing the constitutional convention, Dr. Yokota noted that in spite of his efforts to meet privately with political leaders who still planned to participate in the process, SLORC would only permit visits supervised by SLORC officials. He stated in unequivocal terms, the National Convention ``is not heading toward restoration of democracy.''  While the Special Rapporteur welcomed the release of Suu Kyi and three other senior officials, he criticized the continued imprisonment of several hundred political prisoners and the complex array of security laws allowing SLORC sweeping powers of arbitrary arrest and detention--authority that they continue to use--I might argue abuse--weekly.  Yokota also condemned the severity of court sentences without regard to fair trials, access to defense lawyers or any consideration of proportionality between offense and punishment. After sentencing, he drew attention to the fact that conditions in prisons are impossible to monitor because SLORC continues to stonewall the International Red Cross Committee and its request for access to detention sites.  In his March 1995 report, Dr. Yokota confirmed that military officials have carried out arbitrary killings, rape, torture, forced portage, forced labor, forced relocation, and confiscation of private property--each and every act a violation of international law. In this month's report he indicates that the pattern continues and as before, takes place most frequently in border areas where the Army is engaged in military operations or where regional development projects are taking place. He added:       Many of the victims of such atrocious acts belong to ethnic      national populations, especially women, peasants, daily wage      earners and other peaceful civilians who do not have enough      money to avoid mistreatment by bribing officials.  Dr. Yokota paints a grim portrait of Burma today--a picture which stands at odds with the one the international business community would have us see.  A few months ago, in my office, I listened as the chairman of a large American oil company eager to do business with SLORC denounced as rumors and gossip the idea that the SLORC was engaged in any forced relocations related to his project. I respectfully suggest this month's U.N. report rises above the gossip standard.  Mr. President, I share the concerns raised by the U.N. Rapporteur. Let me stress to my colleagues that he is not reporting on a situation that has changed for the better since Suu Kyi's release, but one which is growing progressively worse.  Mr. President, I have taken the time to come to the floor to discuss these events because I am deeply disturbed by twin developments--a major campaign by American companies to enhance the political legitimacy of SLORC even as SLORC attempts to crush the fledgling democracy movement inside Burma.  In recent weeks, many United States businesses have engaged in an aggressive campaign to persuade the public that SLORC is worth doing business with because like Vietnam and China, Burma can be improved through economic engagement.  I think it is important to draw a key distinction. Unlike China and Vietnam, Burma held legitimate elections and chose a leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. The elections by all accounts were free, fair, and 7 million people made their views absolutely clear.  I must confess, I was appalled by a recent study produced by the National Bureau for Asian Research which suggested these results were essentially irrelevant. The report said, Suu Kyi was:       Obviously sincere, but it remains to be seen how successful      she will be in her attempts and whether her supporters are      helping her attain a position of leadership.  Insult was added to injury when the report stated:       Even assuming the time may come when she does have a say in      how the country is governed, it is an open question of how      well equipped she is for such responsibilities, and to what      extent she would be able to rely on experienced technocrats      and administrators.  These assertions are outrageously offensive. To imply she is incapable of leading her nation offends every citizen who voted for her and more importantly stands in stark contrast to her record. Suu Kyi has conducted herself with dignity and courage uncommon in this century.  The Burmese people voted--they, like Suu Kyi, have earned our respect and support. The fact that the results were rejected by a handful of ruthless, self serving generals does not undermine the validity of the elections or the outcome.  When recently pressed by a representative of the U.N. Secretary General to engage in a dialog with Suu Kyi, SLORC officials dismissed the request point out, Suu Kyi was now:       An ordinary citizen, that in 1990 there were as many as 230      political parties with which it would be impossible to      establish dialogue and it would thus not be even handed to      single out any one of them.  Well, she is the one they elected.  Two hundred and thirty political parties did not carry the elections--the National League for Democracy and Suu Kyi did. She has earned the right to negotiate a timetable for the restoration of democracy for her people. It is her right and our obligation as the beacon of democracy to support that effort.  To make the argument that the United States should resign itself to dealing with SLORC to bring about change, compromises the very core of beliefs that define our history and guide this Nation.  We do not yield to vicious dictators--we do not abandon those who strain against the barbed wire shackles of repression.  It absolutely sickens me that any respectable academic organization--for that matter any American company--would suggest that economic opportunity and political expediency should impel the United States to accept SLORC as the representatives of the Burmese people.  It is not just the campaign that is being waged here at home to enhance SLORC's political credentials that has brought me to the floor of the Senate. I am also concerned about recent events in Burma.  Not only has SLORC repeatedly and publicly rejected Suu Kyi's call for a dialog on national reconciliation, last week a senior official threatened to annihilate anyone who attempted to endanger the military's rule. This week, the noose tightened a little more and Suu Kyi was directly threatened. The official military newspaper called Suu Kyi a traitor who should be annihilated.  Rhetoric has been matched by an increased willingness to restrict Suu Kyi's role. In October, the National Democracy League voted to reinstate Suu Kyi as General Secretary along with a slate of other officials. In yet another effort to work peacefully with SLORC, the NLD submitted the leadership list to the junta for approval.  SLORC rejected the results as illegal and refused to recognize Suu Kyi's position. Is it any wonder her party has decided they cannot participate in the constitutional convention process?  Last week--like every week since her release--thousands of people gathered outside Suu Kyi's home to listen to her speak. Each Saturday and Sunday spontaneous crowds have made the pilgrimage to her compound and left inspired by her courage, her confidence, and her commitment to their freedom and future. It is a crowd described in the U.N. report and in news accounts as large and peaceful with a sense of purpose and discipline.  Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago, there was a sharp change in the SLORC's tolerance for these gatherings. In an apparent attempt to restrict access to Suu Kyi, police began to erect barricades around her home. I understand three young student supporters were arrested when they tried to intervene. According to Dr. Yokota's report, corroborated by newspaper stories, the three were charged and sentenced 2 days later to 2 years imprisonment.  These arrests were followed by another ominous development. When the NLD announced it would not participate in the constitutional convention, the party's senior officials woke up to find their homes surrounded by armed soldiers.  Democracy activists are not suffering in Burma alone. Last week nine members of the New Era newspaper staff were detained in Thailand. The New Era is an underground newspaper with wide circulation inside Burma--apparently being caught with a copy results in immediate arrest. Bowing to pressure from SLORC, in anticipation of an upcoming visit by a senior junta official, Khin Nyunt, Thai officials apparently have detained the New Era journalists--including a 71-year-old editor and his 65-year-old wife.  Reports from activists inside and outside Burma suggest a broad crack down on democratic activists is imminent. I hope this is not true and urge the administration to make clear United States opposition to any such actions. However, the evidence suggests there is credible reason to be concerned.  It is clear that the fledgling democracy movement in Burma is under siege. I find the words of Suu Kyi's fellow democrat, NLD Vice Chairman U Tin O, chilling. On Wednesday night, after the boycott announcement, six soldiers surrounded his home and another soldier now follows him everywhere.  A political prisoner for years, the 68-year-old vice chairman said with a wan smile, ``We have no worries at all. I have been in prison before. They can detain me, do whatever they want. This is not a democratic country. We have to face some costs for the legitimate rights of a democracy.''  It is my hope he, Suu Kyi and the NLD will not bear the costs alone or for long.  Mr. President, in the near future the United Nations will take up a resolution regarding Burma. I have been advised that the United Nations will, once again, condemn the human rights and political situation in clear and compelling terms. I commend Ambassador Albright for her efforts to assure our support for Suu Kyi and democracy in Burma are spelled out in the resolution.  However, for more than a year the administration has argued Burma and SLORC has a choice--they must immediately improve their human rights record and move promptly to open the political process or they will face further international isolation. I agree, but my definition of prompt and immediate seems to differ with theirs.  I think we have given SLORC ample time to make a decision. Given recent events, it is clear they have no intention to relax their ruthless grip on power.  So in conjunction with the U.N. resolution it is my intention to introduce bipartisan sanctions legislation. I encourage my colleagues to support this effort as I see no other way to support Suu Kyi and the restoration of democracy in Burma.  There is no question that sanctions and further isolation of SLORC is an initiative she supports. Indeed, once again this week Suu Kyi denounced the increase in foreign investment and urged companies to wait until democracy has been restored before bringing business to Burma.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article, which included her remarks, be printed in the Record and that the Yokota report and Amnesty International report on the current situation be printed along with that.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 30, 1995]            Burmese Opposition To Boycott Junta's Convention                           (By Philip Shenon)       Rangoon, Burma.--Defying the military government, Aung San      Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition leader, announced Wednesday      that her political party would boycott a military-run      convention to draw up a new constitution for Burma.       The move was Mrs. Suu Kyi's most direct challenge to the      junta since she was freed in July after spending nearly six      years under house arrest.       ``The people of Burma are very united in thinking that the      national convention is not heading toward democracy,'' the      Nobel Peace Prize winner said in announcing the boycott. ``I      do not think there is as yet any evidence that the people of      Burma support this national convention.''       In a letter delivered Tuesday, the party informed the      government of its decision to boycott the convention, which      reopened this week after a seven-month recess, in protest      over the junta's refusal to open negotiations with the party      over Burma's political future.       In a response published Wednesday in a government-run      newspaper, the junta accused the leaders of the party, the      National League for Democracy, of trying to disrupt the      national convention in hopes of replacing it ``with a      convention they would be able to dominate as they like.''       The party's decision to boycott the constitutional      convention was ``totally forsaking and going against the      national interests,'' the military statement warned.       The government also deployed uniformed soldiers to the      homes of three senior party members. The soldiers allowed      residents of the houses to come and go, but foreign diplomats      reported widespread rumors that a wing of Insein Prison, the      local penitentiary used to hold political prisoners, had been      cleared out in recent days to make space for many of Mrs. Suu      Kyi's followers.       The boycott by Mrs. Suu Kyi and her party removes any      veneer of legitimacy from the convention, which was organized      by the military two years ago to enshrine its political role      in the Burmese government.       The junta, which calls itself the State Law and Order      Restoration Council, has refused to honor the results of      elections in 1990 won overwhelmingly by the National League      for Democracy. Mrs. Suu Kyi, the Oxford-educated daughter of      Burma's independence hero, Gen. Aung San, was under house      arrest at the time of the voting.       Since her release in July, Mrs. Suu Kyi has called      repeatedly for negotiations with the junta, saying she is      anxious to avoid any possibility of a repetition of the      violence that occurred in 1988, when thousands of her      supporters were gunned down in a military crackdown that led      to her house arrest the next year.       ``We do not want to call the people onto the streets, and      we have no intention of calling the people into the      streets,'' she said at a news conference Wednesday in her      lakeside garden. ``We have always said that we are prepared      to have dialogue at any time.''       But the generals have not responded to her pleas, pushing      ahead instead with a stage-managed constitutional convention      in which delegates, mostly handpicked by the military, are      drafting a constitution that guarantees the military a      permanent role in Burmese politics.       As a result of her boycott, the 86 seats allotted to the      National League for Democracy were empty in the convention      hall Wednesday, the second day of the current session.       ``The authorities did not at any time show any willingness      to talk to the National League for Democracy as the winning      party of the 1990 elections,'' Mrs. Suu Kyi said. ``They keep      saying that the national convention is a substitute for      dialogue. I do no think they can say that any longer.''       Plainclothes soldiers have been stationed outside Mrs. Suu      Kyi's house since her release--and at her request, which is      seen by diplomats as a clever move since it allows Mrs. Suu      Kyi to blame the military if a public disturbance outside her      home should get out of hand.       But there was no request by the party for the uniformed      soldiers who suddenly appeared outside the homes of three of      her senior party colleagues on Tuesday night, hours after the      National League for Democracy informed the government of its      boycott.       Western diplomats said they feared that the junta might try      to arrest some of the party's senior members on charges of      inciting public disorder because of the boycott.       The party's vice chairman and one of its founders, U Tin      Oo, said in an interview that six uniformed soldiers had      appeared outside his home Tuesday night, and that he had been      tailed by another soldier as he traveled through the city      Wednesday.       ``But we have no worries at all,'' he insisted with a      confident smile. ``I have been in prison before. They can      detain me, do whatever they want. This is not a democratic      country. We have to face some costs for the restoration of      the legitimate rights of a democracy.''                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 30, 1995]       Burmese Opposition Leader Snubs Junta's Constitution Talks                             (By Doug Fine)       Rangoon, Burma.--Using the backdrop of a government-     sponsored constitutional convention as a forum for stepping      up opposition to the country's military rules, Nobel Prize-     winning opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi said today that      Burma is not headed on the path of democracy.       Four and half months after her release from house arrest by      the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council, Aung San      Suu Kyi addresses increasingly large crowds each weekend      afternoon from the gate of her home near Rangoon University.       But in a news conference and talk today at her fenced-in      compound, she revealed that her National League for      Democracy, which overwhelmingly won elections in 1990 that      the military refused to recognize, has notified government      officials that the party would not participate in the      constitutional deliberations. The military government hopes      the convention will legitimize its rule by forging an      ``enduring state constitution.''       Insisting that the military first open a dialogue with her      party, which it has refused to do, Aung San Suu Kyi said, ``A      country which is drawing up a constitution that will decide      the future of a state should have the confidence of the      people.       Her party's boycott has resulted in a palpable increase in      tension in Rangoon. Party leaders discovered security forces      stationed outside their homes when they awoke today, a day      after the convention opened.       Despite the tense atmosphere and the chaotic presence at      her house of dozens of convention delegates barred from      attending the convention, Aung San Suu Kyi took time to      outline her views on democracy, the goal of her political      movement, which has taken on new life since her release.       ``With 7 million votes for the party in 1990,'' she said,      ``the views of the people are very clear. They want a      constitution that will defend their basic rights.''       Despite considerable corruption and a thriving black      market, Aung San Suu Kyi insisted that Burma is adequately      prepared for democracy and maintained that its absence is      responsible for the corruption.       ``This country was a democracy once from independence in      1948 until a 1962 military coup, and our situation then was      very much better than it is now,'' she said. ``The Burmese      people are disciplined and receptive if you explain what is      wanted of them and why.''       Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest in 1989, a      year after the military instituted a crackdown on her      supporters that resulted in thousands of deaths. Many of her      associates are still in prison. She won the Nobel Peace Prize      in 1991 for her democracy campaign. Since her release from      confinement in July, she has repeatedly called for      reconciliation and dialogue among democratic forces, ethnic      groups and her military foes.       Reponding to the military's charges that her party's      methods are confrontational, Aung San Suu Kyi reacted      angrily. ``What they have termed `confrontational' is that we      have asked for a dialogue, which we want in order to prevent      confrontation. To silence the views of people whose opinions      are different by putting them in prison is far more      confrontational.       Yet the move to boycott the constitutional convention is      likely to be viewed as a provocation by the regime, which      observers said      could widen the gulf between government and opposition. The regime says      Burma will become a multi-party democracy after the new      constitution is drafted, but it has not provided a timetable.       Aung San Suu Kyi, however, said the boycott was necessary.      ``They won't even talk to us,'' she said with a laugh. ``How      could the gulf be widened? It can only be narrowed.''       As for the military's intentions in convening the      constitutional convention, one Western embassy official,      reflecting a widely held view, said, ``The path which seems      to be one chosen would lead to the drafting of a constitution      which calls for transition that ensures civilian rule on the      front end, with continued real authority being held      indefinitely by the military.''       One of the guidelines for the proposed constitution      guarantees a ``leading role'' for the military in politics,      and another bans anyone married to a foreigner from assuming      the office of president. Aung San Suu Kyi is married to      Michael Aris, a British academic.       She has continued to talk of compromise. ``We have always      said we want to talk over our differences to find an answer      that's acceptable to everyone,'' she said. ``We have never      closed any doors and are open to any discussions which might      result in what's best for Burma's people.''       Aung San Suu Kyi insists that her party has no timetable      for transition to democracy, and she avoids being locked into      any one scenario by saying that the situation is so prone to      change.       But Burma is very much at a crossroads now. After years of      sealed borders and international ostracism, the government is      actively seeking investment, tourism and political      legitimacy.       Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been outspoken in urging foreign      investors to ``jolly well wait'' before bringing business      into the country, said, ``Luxury hotels do not mean a      developed Burma.''       Her photogenic presence, Oxford education, revered      lineage--her father was the hero of Burma's independence--and      her absence from Burma during the 1970s and '80s, which      distanced her from factional infighting within the democrats'      diverse coalition, make her a magnet for Burma's      discontented.       Encounters in Burma's remote interior confirm her      widespread support. A shop owner in Yaunghwe, in Shan State,      made sure the coast was clear and proudly showed off a T-     shirt picturing Aung San Suu Kyi with her quote, ``Fear is a      habit. I am not afraid,'' on the back. A Buddhist monk in      Mandalay, flipping through an English guidebook, came across      her photo and exclaimed, ``Do you know who this is? Do you?      This is our national heroine.''                                                                    ____ Statement of Mr. Yozo Yokota, Special Rapporteur of the Commission on     Human Rights on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar to the                 Fiftieth Session of the General Assembly       Mr. President, I am here before you for the fourth time      since the creation of my mandate by the Commission on Human      Rights in March 1992. And, for the fourth time, I have the      duty to bring to your attention any progress made toward the      restoration of democracy and protection of human rights in      Myanmar.       Mr. President, in the interim report which is brought      before your Assembly, I provided on the basis of the      information received a summary of allegations reported to      have occurred in Myanmar during this last year. This include;      summary executions, arbitrary detention, torture and forced      labour. On purpose, I did not draw any conclusions or      recommendations in my interim report. To do so, I found it      necessary, in accordance with Commission on Human Rights and      General Assembly resolutions, to establish or continue direct      contact with the Government and people of Myanmar in order to      verify the information received and to analyze its content.      To my regret, however, such direct contacts in the form of a      visit to Myanmar and Thailand were not possible before the      deadline for the submission of the interim report.       Mr. President, at the invitation of the Government of      Myanmar by a letter of the Minister for Foreign Affairs dated      28 September 1995, I undertook a visit to the Union of      Myanmar from 8 to 17 October 1995. From 17 to 20 October      1995, I visited and met with some Myanmar ethnic minorities      in Thailand, along the Thai/Myanmar border, to ascertain the      situation of human rights within Myanmar for these ethnic      minorities namely: Karenni, Shan and Karen.       While in Yangon, my office, accommodation and local      transport were provided by the UNDP Office in Myanmar, to      which I wish to express my deep gratitude.       Mr. President, I wish to note with special gratitude that      the Government of Myanmar facilitated the visit, including      the travel within Myanmar to Kachin State in Myitkyina and      Eastern Shan State in Kyaingtone and to Myitkina and Insein      prisons, and extended me many courtesies.       During this visit, I was received by a number of high-level      government officials including Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt,      Secretary One of the State Law and Order Restoration Council      (SLORC), the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Chief      Justice, the Minister for Information, the Minister for      National Planning and Economic Development, the Minister for      Home Affairs and other high level authorities.       During my stay in Yangon, I also had the opportunity to      meet twice with Dow Jung San Suu Kyi at her private home.      Former NLD Chairmen U Kyi Maung and U Tin Oo, the actual      Chairman and other NLD representatives were also present.       During these meetings, I enjoyed a frank, open and lengthy      exchange of views which touched upon most issues of concern      for restoration of democracy and respect of human rights in      Myanmar. I was informed about the new composition of the      Executive Committee of the National League for Democracy      which is as follow: U Aung Shwe as Chairman; U Kyi Maung and      U Tin Oo as Deputy Chairmen, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi as General-     Secretary and U Lwin as Secretary.       According to NLD leaders only peace, public order and      dialogue may lead to democratization. Therefore, as a mature      political party, NLD does not want to return to the situation      which was prevailing in 1988 or to act in vengeance. As a      responsible political party, NLD is able to control its      supporters. Their only aim is to promote a genuine dialogue      with the Government of Myanmar.       While in Myanmar, I also had the opportunity to see the      representatives of the three political parties participating      in the National Convention, namely, the Union Kayene League,      the National League for Democracy and the National Unity      Party. In spite of my strong and repeated requests to meet      with them in private at my office in the UNDP compound in      Yangon. I regret to say that, this year again, the meetings      with these political leaders were arranged to take place at a      Government guest house. The location and atmosphere were not      conducive to a free and unencumbered exchange of views.       With regard to the detention of political prisoners, I must      express my disappointment that this year, despite a formal      written request before going to Myanmar and despite my      repeated requests while in Myanmar, I was not permitted to      see any such prisoner neither in Isein prison nor in Myitkina      Jail.       With regard to the National Convention. I was not able to      observe its meetings because it was not in session when I      visited Myanmar this time. However, information from reliable      sources indicates that it is not heading towards restoration      of democracy, I am particularly disappointed to learn that      the Government has not yet distributed the Myanmar language      version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to all      delegates to the National Convention.       At the completion of my visit to Myanmar, I proceeded from      17 to 20 October 1995, to Thailand, to visit displaced      persons from Myanmar in the area of Mae Hong Son and Mae      Sariang, where, I established or continued contact with the      people of Myanmar living in camps. Let me also take this      opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the Government of      Thailand who facilitated my visit to the camps.       Mr. President, I now wish to summarize my observations on      the human rights situation in Myanmar on the basis of the      allegations received, my recent visit to that country and      Thailand and of the information received from various      sources, including the Government officials and people of      Myanmar, staff members of the United Nations and other      specialised agencies, staff members of active human rights      and humanitarian non-governmental organizations, foreign      government officials, journalists, scholars and students.       Since there has been no time to study carefully the      information and documents collected during my visits to      Myanmar and Thailand, these observations will have to be      still preliminary in nature. The full account of my findings,      observations and recommendations will be reflected in my      final report to the Commission on Human Rights, which I      intend to submit at the beginning of next year.                        preliminary observations       First of all, there are some developments which may lead to      improvements in human rights situation in that country.       a. The Government of Myanmar continued to release political      prisoners in 1995 although the exact number could not be      verified. I was particularly pleased to note that among these      released detainees were two prominent political party leaders      from the National League for Democracy, U Kyi Maung and U Tin      Oo, the latter of whom I met in Insein Prison in 1993 and      1994.       I have also welcomed with great satisfaction the      announcement, made on 10 July 1995, that restrictions on Daw      Aung San Suu Kyi were lifted by the Government of Myanmar and      that she has been released. I am particularly pleased to note      that she was released without conditions and is now free to      meet with people and free to travel within the country.       b. Since the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a crowd of      two to three thousand people is gathering every weekend,      Saturdays and Sundays, outside the gate of her residence to      hear what Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other leaders say. During      my visit to Myanmar, I witnessed personally one of these      gatherings. The atmosphere was peaceful and the crowd of      supporters were disciplined. To my knowledge none of these      meetings had disorder. To my knowledge none of the supporters      was threatened or arrested for having attended such meetings.       Yet, I have to state that last week, on Saturday 18      November among the crowd which gathered that day to listen to      Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's speech, I have been informed by      reliable sources that three NLD members were arrested for      having intervened with the police who was erecting barricades      in front of her house. According to the information      received, the three persons were charged with assaulting a police      officer and were reportedly sentenced two days later to two      years imprisonment. Although I have no details of the trial      proceedings, it would appear that the accused could      not possibly mount an effective defense with regard to the      legal and factual basis for the arrest and incarceration      in such a short period of time.       c. Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High      Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is continuing and more than      190,000 Myanmar refugees out of estimated total of about      250,000 have so far been repatriated from neighbouring      Bangladesh.       d. The Government is expanding cooperation with various      other United Nations bodies and specialised agencies such as      UNDP, UNICEF and UNDCP. Year after year, the work of the      humanitarian non-governmental organizations is slowly      expanding. Now, these organisations are allowed to implement      programmes outside Yangon and able to reach out grass-root      people who suffer from shortage or lack of food, safe water,      medicine, medical care and proper education.       e. In cities like Yangon, Myitkyina and Kyaningtone, I      observed that there were visible signs of relaxation of      tension in the life of the people. It seems that people      generally enjoy normal life. There were many consumer goods      in market places where many shoppers crowded. Physical      developments in the construction or improvement of roads,      bridges, buildings and railways are taking place throughout      the country and in some border areas. However, just as last      year, I was informed that only a small portion of the      population enjoy the improved life and the majority who were      poor rather suffered from higher prices of basic necessity      goods such as rice and medicine.       f. On the particular question of forced labour, I was      informed during my recent mission to Myanmar that the SLORC      had issued a ``secret directive'' to discourage the practice      of forced labour. I am hopeful that this directive would be      implemented rigorously.       g. As Special Rapporteur, I welcome the signature of      several cease-fire agreements between the Government of      Myanmar and different ethnic minorities. This is without      doubt a positive step towards peace. Needless to say, such      agreements should be faithfully respected by both parties.       Mr. President, in spite of these developments. I have the      duty to state that there are still many restrictions on      fundamental freedoms and serious violations of human rights      continuing in Myanmar.       a. As mentioned above, I welcome the recent release of a      number of political prisoners. However, I remain concerned      about the fact that there are still more than several hundred      persons imprisoned or detained for reasons of political      activities. I am also concerned about the prevalence of a      complex array of security laws which allow the Government      sweeping powers of arbitrary arrest and detention These laws      include the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act, the 1975 State      Protection Law, the 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration      Law, the 1923 Official Secrets Act and the 1908 Unlawful      Association Act.       Various articles in these laws continue to be used in      combination to prosecute a number of individuals who were      exercising their rights to freedom of expression and      association. The combination of charges under these laws      included ones such as writing and distributing what were      described as ``illegal leaflets, spreading false information      injurious to the state'' and ``contact with illegal      organisations''. I understand that due to such laws and other      SLORC orders, the activities of the political parties,      particularly the NLD, are severely restricted.       b. Severe court sentences for some political leaders have      been reported and confirmed. Information from reliable      sources indicates that there are problems in the field of the      administration of justice with regard to fair trials, free      access to defense lawyers, proportionality between the acts      committed and the punishment applied and time for careful      examination of the case by courts.       c. The non-acceptance by Myanmar of ICRC's customary      procedures for visits for places of detention is a negative      step towards amelioration of their conditions.       d. There are still cases of torture, arbitrary killings,      rapes, and confiscation of private property according to      testimony and evidence acquired by me. They seem to be taking      place most frequently in border areas by military soldiers in      the course of military operations, forced relocations and      development projects. Many of the victims of such atrocious      acts belong to ethnic national populations, especially women,      peasants, daily wage earners and other peaceful civilians who      do not have enough money to avoid mistreatment by bribing.       e. I am gravely concerned at the continued reports of      forced porterage, forced labour, forced relocation which are      still occurring in border areas where the Army is engaged in      military operations or where ``regional development      projects'' are taking place.                      preliminary recommendations       a. As Special Rapporteur, I urge the Government of Myanmar      to sign and ratify the Covenants on Civil and Political      Rights and Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional      Protocol to the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as      well as the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,      Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the      Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination      against Women.       b. The Government of Myanmar should comply with the      obligations under the International Labour Organization (ILO)      Convention No. 29 prohibiting the practice of forced      portering and other forced labour.       c. Myanmar law should be brought into line with accepted      international standards regarding protection of the physical      integrity rights. Among these international standards are the      right to life, prohibition of torture, providing humane      conditions for all persons under detention and insurance of      the minimum standards of judicial guarantees.       d. The Government of Myanmar should take steps to      facilitate and guarantee enjoyment of the freedoms of      opinions, expression and association, in particular by      decriminalizing the expression of oppositional views,      relinquishing government control over the media and literary      and artistic community, and permitting the formation of      independently organized trade unions.       e. All persons including elected political representatives,      students, workers, peasants, monks and others arrested or      detained under martial law after the 1988 and 1990      demonstrations or as a result of the National Convention,      should be tried by a properly constituted and independent      civilian court in an open and internationally accessible      judicial process. If found guilty in such judicial      proceedings, they should be given a just sentence;      alternatively, they should be immediately released and the      Government refrain from all acts of intimidation, threats or      reprisals against them or their families.       f. As Special Rapporteur. I recommend the Government of      Myanmar to repeal or amend as appropriate the relevant      provisions which at present prevent the ICRC from carrying      out its humanitarian activities as regards the prison visits.      In this regard, I encourage the Government of Myanmar, in a      spirit of humanitarian goodwill, to re-invite the presence in      Myanmar of the International Committee of the Red Cross in      order to carry out their purely humanitarian tasks.       g. The Government of Myanmar should publicize the ``secret      directive'' which discourage the practice of forced labour.      This will indicate and the will of the Government of Myanmar      to effectively prohibit and suppress forced labour. Moreover,      wide dissemination of the existence of the directive would      promote awareness that forced labour is neither condoned nor      tolerated.       h. The Government of Myanmar should without delay resume      its dialogue with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.       i. As Special Rapporteur. I call upon the Government of      Myanmar to resolve peacefully its difficulties with ethnic      minorities and to take all appropriate measures to ensure      respect for human rights and humanitarian obligations in the      situation of armed conflicts between the Myanmar Army and the      armed ethnic groups.       j. The Government of Myanmar should distribute copies of      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Myanmar language      to all delegates to National Convention which is to be      reconvened tomorrow. 28 November 1995. Such action would      indicate to the international community the willingness of      the Government to bring the relevant provisions of the      domestic laws, in particular the new Constitution to be      eventually enacted into conformity with international human      rights standards.       Mr. President, I have analyzed these allegations and have      made some recommendations strictly in terms of the      international human rights obligations which Myanmar has      freely undertaken. I am particularly thinking of the fact      that Myanmar is a Member of the United Nations and is      therefore bound to respect the human rights standards      emanating from the United Nations Charter. I believe the      Government of Myanmar should, and has the ability, to fulfill      in good faith the obligations it has assumed.                          ____________________
