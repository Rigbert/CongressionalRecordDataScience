 I must say to my friend on the other side of the aisle, I believe it's never the wrong time to do the right thing, and this is the right thing.  My friend mentions trial lawyers. Trial lawyers are in the business of redressing grievances. Juries and judges are in the business of deciding whether the grievance deserves redress, not trial lawyers. Trial lawyers raise the issue. Judgments are not given by trial lawyers, but by judges and juries.  Equal pay for equal work. When we put the principle as bluntly as that, I doubt that anyone in America would disagree. It's a basic ideal of fairness. Is there a woman on this floor that believes they ought to be paid less than the men that do exactly the same kind of work? And I would suggest the answer to that is no, whether they're staffers or Members. I hope there is not a female page who watches these proceedings that believes that they are less valuable than the male pages that serve this House. They are equally valued, irrespective of gender.  The value of work lies in a job well done, not in the gender of the worker; but within my lifetime, it was a radical notion. For decades, it was perfectly acceptable for women to earn less simply because they were women.  We celebrated the 60th anniversary of the integration of the Armed Forces just a few days ago. Colin Powell spoke, and he indicated that he was too small to really remember the ramifications of that executive order, but he said to himself, how strange it would seem today to think that men and women would be segregated by unit and by housing because of the color of their skin. It is equally wrong to make distinctions of gender in payment for services.  Thanks to the hard work of generations of women advocates, we've closed that gap from 61 cents back in 1963 to 77 cents on the dollar today. Being 77 percent right is not enough, we need to be 100 percent right. We need to pay dollar for dollar for work performed.  In fact, it depends on staying hidden, it depends on keeping women in the dark. Because, of course, it's against the law not to pay equally, but if you don't know that you're being discriminated against, how can your grievances be redressed? In fact, the Constitution of the United States says, as all of us know, that Americans are guaranteed the right to petition the Congress of the United States for redress of grievances, and yet we keep people in the dark as to whether or not, in fact, they are aggrieved.  By now, we have all heard about the Lilly Ledbetter case. Ms. Ledbetter was a supervisor at a tire plant in Alabama, and for years she was paid less than her male coworker. I would be interested if any Member of this House is prepared to come to this well or stand at one of these microphones and say it was right to pay a supervisor that was a woman less than a supervisor who was a man. And if you do come to this well and say that, I look forward to debating you on that issue.  But Lilly Ledbetter had no way of knowing that she was being paid differently. She didn't know the truth. And by the time she found out, years after the discrimination began, the court said it was too late, time had run, statute of limitations gone, insurance run out. She didn't have the right to redress her justifiable grievance.  Her case is hardly unique. Justice Ginsburg has written that ``comparative pay information is often hidden from the employee's view.'' In many workplaces, merely asking a coworker about his or her pay is a firing offense. Far from protecting privacy, rules like that can protect an employer's power to discriminate.  And should we say, well, I know the employer discriminated, but we don't want to have a lawyer take that case because, after all, we don't like lawyers, they bring to our attention wrongdoing, they ask for redress of grievances, they petition the jury and the court; this is wrong. You know, a famous individual from my State, Justice Thurgood Marshall, did that. He was a trial lawyer. And he petitioned the court and said, it is wrong to segregate blacks and whites, it is wrong to give secondary education to African Americans, just as lawyers come and say it's wrong to discriminate on gender as opposed to quality of work.  In many workplaces, as I've said, merely asking a coworker about his or her pay is a firing offense. That's why this bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, is so necessary. It is time to do the right thing. It may be too late for some, but it's the right time for many.  It amends the Equal Pay Act to bar retaliation against employees who share or inquire about pay information. It strengthens sanctions against discriminatory employers--which have not been adjusted for 17 years. It clarifies acceptable reasons for differences in pay related to factors other than gender. And it authorizes additional training for Equal Employment Opportunity Commission staff to better identify and handle wage disputes.                              {time}  1630  I want to recognize my colleague Congresswoman DeLauro for working so hard for so long and so passionately to bring this bill to the floor.  I urge all of my colleagues to support it. It's the right time. It's the right place. It's the right time.  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My good friend the majority leader mentioned trial lawyers. I'm not a lawyer. I know we have a lot of them here in the House, and I am not particularly against lawyers. I think they perform a good service.  One of the things that we did in subcommittee is we thought maybe we should be able to limit trial lawyers' pay when they take some of these claims, and we even had an amendment that we presented that we would limit the trial lawyers to $2,000 an hour. We thought maybe that would be reasonable. Every Democrat voted against that. And when we took it to the Rules Committee to bring it here to the floor, we were denied the opportunity of discussing that here on the floor. So maybe that's why the other side feels that we are against trial lawyers, because we wanted to limit their pay to $2,000 an hour. Anyway, we were not able to discuss that here and we won't be able to have that amendment here today.  Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 3 minutes at this time to the ranking member on the subcommittee over this issue, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).
