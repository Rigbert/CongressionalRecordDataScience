Lantos, and I want to thank my friend Mr. Smith as well. Mr. Smith and I had the honor of co-chairing, he was in the minority at that point in time and I was chairing the Helsinki Commission, but there was no distinction in terms of party. Mr. Smith has been a strong and compelling voice on human rights.  Mr. Lantos, my friend of over a quarter of a century, has been a giant on behalf of peace and security and human rights, and I am honored to support his resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the bill before us offered by my good friend, the ranking Democrat on the International Relations Committee. It calls on the President to take immediate steps to improve the security situation in Darfur, Sudan.  Mr. Speaker, for 3 years the world has turned effectively a blind eye to the genocide in Darfur, the vast region in Western Sudan; a blind eye not because we did not hear and not because we did not see, but because we have not acted.  Already more than 200,000 civilians have died and more than 2.5 million have been driven from their homes as a result of violent warfare between the government-sanctioned Janjaweed and the disparate rebel groups. Frighteningly, Mr. Speaker, a report in the Washington Post just 2 weeks ago suggested these numbers could indeed be higher, maybe even double the figures I have just cited.  Did we not learn anything from the lessons of Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda and other places in Africa? Did we not learn the consequences of our negligence in the 1930s? We watched in horror as troops in blue helmets in Bosnia stood by and witnessed the rape, murder and displacement of thousands.  I don't know how many people, Mr. Speaker, saw Hotel Rwanda. Nick Nolte played the colonel. As Rwanda was imploding and thousands were being murdered, the manager of the Hotel appealed to Nick Nolte, the colonel, in charge of the UN troops, ``Do something.'' And his sad response was, ``My duty is to watch and report. I neither have the troops nor the power to intervene.''  Clearly, Mr. Speaker, the situation in Darfur is the world's worst current human rights crisis. There are others, of course, of significant magnitude, but this clearly is currently the worst.  We must do more to stem the violence. The measure offered by Mr. Lantos as well as those offered by Chairman Hyde and Congressman Wolf are a good start. Mr. Smith's leadership on these three bills is appreciated by all.  Chairman Hyde's bill is the long-awaited Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, which already passed this Chamber once with my support; and I am pleased to support it again. The bill includes key sanctions, provisions and authorizes the support for an expanded African Union mission in Sudan.  A year-and-a-half ago, maybe 2 years ago now, I had a discussion with Secretary Powell about supporting the contingent from the African Union. In fact, we have done that. Moneys have been made available, as has equipment.  H.R. 723, introduced by Congressman Lantos, goes even further, insisting that the President do more to improve the security situation in Darfur by calling for an interim NATO civilian protection force. That was similar to what we did in Bosnia.  Finally, we are considering here H. Res. 992, calling on the President to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. Recognizing that the President appointed former USAID Administrator Andrew Natsios to the job last week, I nevertheless intend to support the resolution. By doing so, I believe we send astrong message to the President that he should have long ago designated such an envoy, and I applaud him for doing so now. It is never too late to do the right thing.  July, 2004, this Chamber voted unanimously to declare the crisis in Darfur a genocide. July, 2004. July, 2004. Twenty-seven months later, thousands of souls murdered, hundreds of thousands ripped from their home and their security.                              {time}  1930  And we continue to talk. For more than 2 years we have stood by as the situation deteriorated and ignored the mounting casualty and dislocation rates.  Sadly, Mr. Speaker, the case of Darfur is yet another demonstration of the international community's collective lack of will to confront those who would commit such horrific acts of cowardice.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that the world needs the United Nations. I believe that we need a collective organ for international security and stability. But if that organ cannot act either because the Security Council permanent members veto such action or because of the lack of will of that body, then others must act. If morality plays any part in the consideration of the policies of this country and the civilized countries of this world, there is no course but to act.  I congratulate my friend and a great leader of this House, the gentleman from California, Mr. Lantos, for his leadership on this critically important issue.
