President, I would like to pay tribute to Frances Williams Preston, a trailblazing businesswoman, a dedicated humanitarian, a mother, a grandmother, a great-grandmother, and a friend. I was saddened when she passed away on June 13.  Frances began her career as a receptionist at a radio station in Nashville, TN. She quickly moved up within the music community, and in 1958 she was hired to open a regional office for Broadcast Music Inc., BMI, in Nashville, representing songwriters and composers. Glass ceilings had no chance at constraining Frances. In 1964, she became Vice President of BMI, reportedly making her the first woman corporate executive in Tennessee. In 1986, she became CEO and remained CEO of BMI until 2004.  Her work at BMI transformed not only the company, but also the hundreds of thousands of songwriters and composers BMI represents. She tripled the revenues at BMI and advocated for strong copyright protections to benefit artists. BMI under her tenure also helped the city of Nashville to blossom into the leading center for songwriters and the arts that it is today.  Frances's dedication to the songwriters and her industry, and her passion for ensuring they could make a living in their chosen profession, was unrivaled. Kris Kristofferson famously dubbed her the ``songwriter's guardian angel.''  I worked closely with Frances and the songwriting community to ensure that the rights of composers are protected, but I will remember her most for her humanitarian efforts. She was president of the T.J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS research, and her name precedes the research laboratories at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center.  I could go on at length about the various music and humanitarian awards and honors Frances has received, from being inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1992 to twice receiving the Humanitarian Award from the International Achievement in Arts.  The current president of BMI probably best captured her essence by simply describing Frances as ``a force of nature.'' She will be missed by those who knew her, and remembered always by those whom she nurtured as songwriters and composers.  The music industry has lost a legend and I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal article ``From Receptionist to Music-Royalty Guarantor'' by Stephen Miller be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 14, 2012]              From Receptionist to Music-Royalty Guarantor                          (By Stephen Miller)       Frances Preston rose from radio-station receptionist to      chief executive of Broadcast Music Inc., a performing-rights      group that helps guarantee that songwriters and music      publishers get paid when their songs are played on the radio      or in places like restaurants.       Ms. Preston, who died Wednesday at the age of 83, founded      BMI's Nashville, Tenn., office and signed up thousands of      artists, many of whose careers she shepherded personally.       The deals she struck helped nurture country, rock 'n' roll      and jazz, emerging genres that the American Society of      Composers, Authors and Publishers, BMI's older rival, had      neglected in favor of traditional pop music.       By the time Ms. Preston retired in 2004, BMI represented      300,000 music composers and copyright owners and disbursed      more than a half-billion dollars to them annually.       ``They never paid royalties to the songwriters for      performances until Frances Preston came along,'' country star      Eddy Arnold told The Wall Street Journal in 2004. ``She put      the hammer on!''       ``A lot of them didn't realize that they could get paid for      having their music played,'' Ms. Preston told Amusement      Business magazine in 1991. She built a fanatical following      among Nashville's performing elite.       Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson, whom Ms. Preston      signed to a $1 million songwriting deal in the 1970s, once      called her ``our guardian angel.''       Raised in Nashville, Ms. Preston studied at George Peabody      College for Teachers. But shortly before taking a classroom      job, she went to work at WSM, the radio home of the Grand Ole      Opry, where her duties included answering Hank Williams's      mail. She moved on to running the station's promotions      department and got to know the country stars of the era.       In 1958, she founded BMI's Nashville office--at first in      her parents' garage. A few years later she opened a new      office on fledgling Music Row. Thanks in part to BMI's      presence, it soon became the home to recording studios and      music publishers and the hub of the Nashville country scene.       Ms. Preston moved to BMI's home office in New York City,      where she became chief executive in 1986. She oversaw the      transition to the digital age as complex new media like the      Internet and ringtones joined radio and television as major      sources of revenue. She also lobbied Congress as copyright      laws were changed.       ``It's a constant fight to educate those people [that]      music is not just out there in the air for you to pick out      for free, because if the creator isn't compensated, there's      not going to be that music,'' she told Billboard in 2004.       Ms. Preston was lionized in Nashville, where she was a      glamorous personification of the business side of the music      industry. When she was inducted into the Country Music Hall      of Fame in 1992, it dubbed her ``the most influential      country-music executive of her generation.''       Always one to keep things in sensible perspective, Ms.      Preston was proud to be remembered as the author of a      Nashville motto: ``It all begins with a song.''                          ____________________
