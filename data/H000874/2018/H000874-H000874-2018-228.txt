Speaker, we want to address other urgent health priorities as well. You want to pass CHIP, but you do not want to pass the community health centers. My colleague Betty McCollum told us about that. Many CHIP children will have no place to go--you pass the bill, but no place to go. So why don't Republicans sit down and reach agreement?  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle, don't shut down the government. I implore them. Use your majority not to delay but to govern. And I tell them, Democrats are still ready to work with you, as we havebeen throughout, to sit down and reach bipartisan compromise on our most pressing challenges. We voted to give you 120 days to do that; now you want some more time.  You come to the door and ask for some cake, and your neighbor says, ``Come back tomorrow,'' and you come back tomorrow and you ask for the same thing, and he says, ``Come back tomorrow,'' and you go back the next day, and he says the same thing, ``Come back tomorrow.'' That is what the Republicans are saying, ``come back tomorrow,'' ``come back tomorrow,'' ``come back tomorrow,'' but there has been no tomorrow.  Vote against this CR.
