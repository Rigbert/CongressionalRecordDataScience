 President, let me say that the Senator from California never ceases to amaze me. I say that with genuine respect. When she zeroed in on this problem when Senator Kennedy came to the hearing and presented a 60-, 70-, 80-page document--I forget how long it was--of information that the staff had pulled off the Internet for him on how to do these things, one of the things that I admire most about her is her incredible common sense.  I remember her sitting there looking at us and saying, ``You mean you can do this? I mean, why are we allowing this?'' All of us who were supposedly hopefully good lawyers all looked and said, ``First amendment problem, Senator.'' And we all did say that. We all knew because of our reverence for the first amendment. Those of us who are conservative, liberal, and moderate alike all said, ``First amendment problem.'' We all kind of went on to other things.  As she always does, she went back to her office, and I am sure she turned to that able staff member next to her and said, ``Wait a minute, there has to be a way to do this. There has to be an answer to this.'' As usual, her instinct is almost always right. And when I have dealt with her, it has been unerring. Not being a lawyer, she went out and got some fine lawyers and said, ``How can I write this thing because I, Dianne Feinstein, don't want to amend the first amendment either, but I do want to deal with this foolishness.'' [[Page S7687]]   She did it. I compliment her. And remind me, if I ever forget, never to underestimate her. She always gets it done. We are all better for it. I again congratulate her.  We have no other amendment on the floor at the moment. What I would like to do, unless someone wishes to bring up an amendment, I would like to because I was not here when the Senator from California spoke on her first amendment, the taggants amendment, and I would like to take a moment.                           Amendment No. 1202  If anyone has any other thing to bring up, I would be happy to yield. I rise at this moment to support the amendment of my friend from California on taggants, if I may, because we are going to be voting on that I think around 6 o'clock.  One area we did not address in the legislation before us was the issue of taggants. The President wanted to see it addressed, and I did as well and spoke very briefly with my friend from California and encouraged her to move the amendment on taggants.  I feel it is very important in the battle against terrorism to enhance our ability to identify, following detonation, the source or origin of the explosives used in an act of violence against our fellow Americans. Key Federal law enforcement officials recognize that to provide for enhanced tracing capabilities is a logical and, I would argue, overdue response. The administration included a tracing provision in their antiterrorism proposal, and it was section 803 of S. 761.  Now, I want to make it clear to those of our colleagues who may be listening in their offices, I am not inadvertently substituting the word ``tracing'' for ``taggant'' because that is what this is all about. We want to be able to trace the manufacture of the material used, not for purposes of prosecuting the manufacturer, unless the manufacturer violated the law intentionally in to whom they sold the material, but in order to be able to trace the person who purchased the material which would enhance our ability to find out who detonated the bomb.  The provision authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to promulgate regulations requiring taggants to be added to explosive materials. Now, the Republican bill, however, omits this key provision. Instead, the Republican bill calls for no action, only more study. I would also note that not only does the Republican bill choose study over action but, even worse, their bill calls on the Justice Department to study this issue.  Now, we all know that jurisdiction over these issues and the real expertise related thereto is in the Treasury Department. Let us not duplicate effort. Let us not duplicate bureaucracy. Let us think of the taxpayers, not the pet peeves of some special interest group because they do not like the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department is the outfit that has been dealing with this issue and explosives for time immemorial. The Justice Department is not. It does not have the expertise. So I would suggest that is not the place we should look.  Now, taggants are tiny plastic, as they are referred, sandwiches with different color stripes that are added to explosives during the manufacturing process. Because these taggants are left after the explosion, they can be used to identify the source of an explosion. And that is the source of the material--where it was purchased. In other words, these identifiers, these little plastic sandwiches, as they are called, different colored stripes are put into the explosive when it is being manufactured, legitimately manufactured. We are not talking about some back-room operation. These are legitimate explosives. These are legitimate materials made by legitimate companies for legitimate purposes. You add at the time of their manufacture these little colored strips so that when the explosion goes off, you are able to go into the area where the explosion took place and by use of detection means find these taggants.  These taggants--this is my phrase; I have never heard anyone else use this--are a little bit like that little bar code on the bottom of everything you buy in the grocery store. The checker just runs it through a scanner. They can identify what stock it was, what date it was made, where it came from, what part of the store it was in, how much it cost.  It is the same principle here. We want to be able to essentially run the residue of that explosive material through a scanner, in effect. And you are able to say OK, the material used in this bomb was manufactured at such and such a time, such and such a batch, et cetera, and work your way back with the intention of not going after the manufacturer but going after the person who purchased it.  Now, it may be the person legitimately purchased it, and we find out it was purchased for a construction operation and it was put in, properly stored in a locked vault and that you find out the vault was not broken into but that on the job it turned out a couple pieces were missing. Well, then you have the investigative tool to narrow it down. Maybe then you look at the people who took the explosive out and were legitimately working on the job. Maybe it turns out to be one of them. It was not them. They may say, well, it was only 20 minutes it was not here. And there was a guy wearing a red cap that came by. It is investigative work. It merely gives, but significantly gives, an opportunity to law enforcement agencies to begin to trace, backtrack, until hopefully you find the person who was the person who purchased and used this material.  Now, to use a practical example of how even small pieces of evidence are vital, consider that the vehicle identification number on the exploded remains of a rental truck that was used to blow up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City was the critical piece of evidence that gave Federal law enforcement a critical lead on the bombing suspects.  There was a taggant in effect on that vehicle in an ID number on it. Where would we be if we had not required an ID number on that vehicle? We would be nowhere. You would not have been able to go back to find out from where that vehicle was rented, who walked in and rented it, what they looked like, what their description was and then trace it back to the guy who gets arrested almost incidentally on a highway going out of Oklahoma City the day of the bombing.  Very important material, a tiny little thing. You would say, well, wait a minute. That truck was blown to smithereens. This just goes to show you the investigative capability of the people there. The axle--I believe it was an axle--on which this identification number existed was found. They knew to go and look at that ID number.  Once they found it, they could begin the tracing process. In fact, it was the employees of the rental agency they traced this back to who provided much of the information necessary to create the composite sketch of the suspect initially known as John Doe 1, whom we now know as Timothy McVeigh.  Now, taggants work much in the same way. The taggants would give an indication where the explosives were purchased. Not only does that lead law enforcement to a sales clerk who might have provided a description of the terrorist, but this information may also be key, and perhaps the only physical evidence that a prosecutor can use, to nail the defendant to the crime. If there were taggants in the explosives that were used, you would be able to do the same thing--and they were recovered. You might be able to go back and find where the material that blew up the--and that was fertilizer added with some chemicals and the like. You may be able to go back and find out where that fertilizer was sold and you may find the very same thing. The clerk says I remember selling that fertilizer to the following person, and you do a composite sketch. Again, it is a strong piece of evidence.  Now, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue that we should study this issue more closely. But that means only one thing: More needless delay. The potential effect of taggants has been highlighted in a study that was conducted in the late 1970's when the ATF seeded a very small portion of explosives, 10,000 pounds, with taggants.  We had this debate, I might add, when I first came to the Senate in the 1970's, and we were told, no, it may be a destabilizing element in the manufacture of the material; it may be used for purposes on the part of law enforcement to do bad things, et cetera. But we agreed that Alcohol, Tobacco, and [[Page S7688]] Firearms could do an experiment. So they went to a manufacturing site, and they tagged 10,000 pounds of explosives. They put in one of these little colored strips, these sandwiches.  Now, despite this relatively small amount--and that probably represented less than--I will not even guess--one one-hundredth percent of all the explosives sold that year. It was infinitesimally small in this little experiment compared to the universe of all explosives sold that year. For example, my staff is telling me 4 billion pounds of explosives are sold per year--4 billion pounds. This was 10,000 pounds that was tagged as an experiment. Now, notwithstanding that, that one experiment back in 1978--and the Senator from California knows this--was very instrumental and effective in helping solve a bombing incident in the State of Maryland. Now, the idea that we did this one experiment--and it was just pure luck, I suspect, that that 10,000 pounds was purchased. But what happened was there was a car bombing, and but for the fact that the explosive used was part of that 10,000-pound batch that was the only batch out of four billion pounds sold that year, the perpetrator of the act was unlucky enough to purchase something from that batch. And that was the thing that led to the identification and conviction of that individual, with little or no possibility of their ever having found him but for the taggants.  I suggest that the study by the Office of Technology Assessment on taggants is also a key source of the safety and efficacy of taggants. There was this experiment and the study by the Office of Technology Assessment. The Office of Technology Assessment found that ``identification taggants would facilitate the investigation of almost all significant criminal bombings in which commercial explosives were used.''  Now, safety tests performed by the Office of Technology Assessment found taggants to be compatible with the explosives covered by this amendment. By compatible, I mean they did not diminish the efficacy of the explosives, No. 1. So it blew up just as big as it would have blown up without the taggant. It did not diminish its capacity.  Second, it did nothing to destabilize the explosive. It made it no more or less dangerous to deal with that explosive. One of the arguments we will hear used is that if you add these taggants, they will have the effect of destabilizing this explosive material, making it more dangerous to handle. There is no evidence of that, according to the Office of Technology Assessment.  Third, they also found that it did not, in any way, affect the manufacturer of that material. That is, placing the taggants in the material as it is manufactured did not diminish safety in the production of that material.  For 15 years, law enforcement in Switzerland have recognized taggants as an important piece of the puzzle in solving crimes involving illegally used explosives. Under this amendment, the Secretary of the Treasury will determine how we can best utilize this technology. Then we will move forward and use the taggants after that assessment has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury. And that is key. We should move forward in this area now, and we should do so without further delay.  Now, a study on common and precursor chemicals, another aspect of the amendment I want to touch on briefly, is the requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury study and make recommendations regarding: First, the ability and feasibility of rendering inert those common chemicals used to manufacture explosive materials and, second, the ability to impose controls on those precursor chemicals used to manufacture explosive materials.  Let me make it clear, this is a separate issue. There are two issues here that the Senator from California has pursued that were in the President's legislation. One, this notion of, in effect, seeding an explosive with a color-stripped material so that when the explosive goes off, you can find the material and trace back the place where it was manufactured and sold. That is the taggant.  Now, there is a second issue, and that is chemicals which are sold--I will use this phrase--over the counter. These are chemicals you can go and buy, but they can be used for destructive purposes, although their intention is for constructive purposes. Fertilizer is to help things grow, not kill things or kill people.  Now, I said this before, and I say it to my friend from California here. I was at a conference with a group of U.S. Senators, Congresspersons, and officials from the United Nations the day this god-awful explosion in Oklahoma occurred, and we literally interrupted the conference. One of the conferees was Gen. Michael Rose, a general in the British Army, who was the UNPROFOR Commander of Forces in Bosnia up until about 3 months ago. General Rose and I were sitting next to one another discussing the situation in Bosnia. What happened was that we adjourned when we heard this horrible news and went to the nearest television. The first scene all of us saw--a dozen of us Congressmen, Senators and generals--was a visual image of the Federal building and the confusion surrounding it. You could see how the Federal building was not only blown up, but it looked like it was cut away in the front. I was sitting next to General Rose. I could not hear what was on the television in this hotel lobby. We just saw the picture. He looked at me and he said, ``That bomb is a fertilizer bomb. That is what destroyed that building.'' My staffer reminded me that he looked and he said, ``That is an ANFO bomb.'' I wondered, what in the devil is he talking about? How does he know this? All we can see is this picture on television. He had not heard any more about this than I did. We just walked out of this conference. He went on to explain to me how when ammonium nitrate is added to fertilizer in a certain formula and way, it produces an explosion whose fingerprints or characteristics are like the one we saw. I was amazed. I was complimenting him, because about 3 minutes later a reporter comes on and says, ``We have just learned that this was a fertilizer bomb.'' I did not know how he knew this. He went on to explain to us that it was his experience when he was a commander in Northern Ireland with the use of fertilizer bombs by the IRA. He went on to point out that England had changed the law relative to the sale of fertilizer to Ireland and the type of fertilizer and the amount of nitrate that could be in the fertilizer, and he went on and on about it. And he said something fascinating. He said that it has had three interesting effects. First, the environment is cleaner. There is not as much nitrates left over in the environment when it is applied to the soil. The water is cleaner and the bombs are fewer.  So that is when I became interested in how do you take these materials that seem to me to be totally innocent in terms of the ability to cause damage and render them inert--inert in the sense that they can only do the thing for which they were manufactured, which is to help things grow, as opposed to kill people. One of the ways to do that is to look at it and study it and make recommendations regarding the feasibility of adding materials to the manufacture of these chemicals and precursor chemicals that will not diminish the effectiveness of the chemical but render them incapable of generating the explosion.  The purpose of this provision is very simple, and it should be clear to every American in the wake of the Oklahoma City tragedy. What has become evident in the past weeks is that in America today, nearly anyone, as our friend from California has pointed out, can acquire the ingredients, all of which have other legitimate uses, and build a bomb.  The bomb in Oklahoma was a mixture of ammonium nitrate fertilizer and diesel fuel. Ammonium nitrate can be purchased at almost any garden supply or hardware store, and when mixed with a fuel, it can be classified as a high explosive. One way to desensitize ammonium nitrate while still preserving its effectiveness for its intended use would be to mix a nonexplosive chemical such as lime, calcium carbonate, into the product, to render it inefficient for use as an explosive.  Now, I think it makes overwhelming sense to suggest that a feasibility study be done and recommendations made as to whether or not, for example, lime can be added to ammonium nitrate, allowing the fertilizer to be as potent as it was before for the purposes of encouraging growth in the soil, yet rendering it incapable of being used as [[Page S7689]] a bomb when mixed with a fuel supply. This type of desensitizing is currently employed in England, as I said.  Let me be clear, all this amendment does with regard to this point, all it does is require the Secretary to study the feasibility of such a policy being implemented in the United States.  It is an unfortunate reality that individuals would take seemingly harmless--I might add, legal--products and devices and turn them into weapons capable of exacting the devastation and loss of life that we all saw in Oklahoma City. However unfortunate that may be, it is a reality nonetheless. The amendment of my friend from California is an effort to curtail the availability of products which can be used in this manner.  Mr. President, I would like to make as a concluding point that I understand negotiations between Senator Feinstein and other interested parties on the other side are proceeding. Of course, I hope these discussions will be successful, but I strongly urge that the Senator from California not relent on the two essential aspects of her amendment.  One, the taggants be able to be placed, by recommendation from the Secretary of Treasury, in explosives; and, two, that the study be undertaken that would determine whether there are ways that we can feasibly render inert the destructive capability of otherwise totally constructive precursor chemicals.  I see the Senator from California is on the floor and seeking recognition. I yield the floor.
