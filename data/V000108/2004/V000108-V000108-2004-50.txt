Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mr. John Daniel Artis for being selected as the East Chicagoan of the Year. For fifteen years, the Twin City Community Services in East Chicago, Indiana, has awarded this title to prominent members of the community who have greatly contributed to the city and people of East Chicago. This year's festivities will take place Friday, August 20, at the Knights of Columbus Hall in East Chicago. During this prestigious event, John's friends and family will accompany him in a roast held in his honor.  Throughout his education and career, John D. Artis has accomplished many admirable goals. He graduated from Tennessee State University in Nashville, Tennessee, with a Bachelor of the Arts in political science and history and later received his masters in public administration from Indiana University Northwest's School of Public and Environmental Affairs.  After finishing his undergraduate education, John selflessly devoted two years to working as a caseworker for the Crippled Children Division of Gary's Department of Public Works. John then served as the Assistant Director of the Cooperative Area Manpower Planning Agency followed by a two year term as the Supervisor of Relocation for the Department of Redevelopment. As a hardworking, disciplined, and dedicated leader, John was promoted to Deputy Director of Redevelopment in 1975 and to Director of Housing and Redevelopment in 1978, a position he continues to hold. John has been an integral part of several programs that have bettered the lives of those in his community: he aided in designing The Project 10 Program for rehabilitating multi-family buildings and created the First Time Homeownership Program and the Planned United Development to expand public housing. Through these and other projects, John has been spotlighted as an accomplished citizen devoted to providing affordable housing to his fellow man.  Beyond his full and active career, John has also held several positions in an effort to further serve East Chicago. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Community Reinvestment Project, St. Catherine's Hospital, the Healthy East Chicago Board, and the Enterprise Development and Management Corporation. He is also a board member of the Northwest Indiana Urban League, the Quality of Life Council of Northwest Indiana, the Lake County Integrated Services Delivery Board, the Northwest Indiana Discovery Center, and the National City Community Development Foundation. Additionally, John is President of the Partners in Contracting Board of Directors, Treasurer of the Urban Enterprise Association, and a Member of the Gary, Hammond, East Chicago Empowerment Zone Oversight Committee. John's list of memberships continues and includes several other committees that strive to improve East Chicago, illustrating that John has dedicated his life, his time, and his energy to improving the housing, health care, and economic future of East Chicago.  The Knights of Columbus Hall will be filled Friday night with friends and family who have been blessed with the opportunity to know and work with John and who wish to celebrate with him as he receives his award. John's work, which has earned him East Chicagoan of the Year, has been improving his community and the lives of East Chicagoans for over thirty years. Though John is dedicated to his career and the community of East Chicago, he has never limited his time and love for his family. John and his wife, Karen, have been happily married for over thirty years and have one son, Christopher.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Mr. John Daniel Artis on being recognized as the East Chicagoan of the Year. It is my privilege to extend my personal thanks to Mr. Artis for his lifelong dedication to the citizens of the First Congressional District of Indiana. I confidently await Mr. Artis' future contributions to society and wish him continued personal and professional success.                          ____________________
