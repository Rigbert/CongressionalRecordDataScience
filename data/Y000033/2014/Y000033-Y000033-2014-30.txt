Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, enacted in 1950, Public Law 81-629 permitted the National Park Service to convey property, formerly part of Acadia National Park, to the town of Tremont, Maine, to build a new school.  In 1951, the Secretary of the Interior completed the conveyance of approximately 8 acres with a clause that specified the land would revert back to the United States if it was not used exclusively for school purposes.  Tremont is now consolidating schools with a nearby town, and the property will no longer be used for the original intended purpose. However, Tremont would like to retain ownership and continue to use the developed property in the best interest of the community.  H.R. 4527 removes the requirement that the land be used exclusively and perpetually for school purposes, allowing Tremont to use the property to the maximum benefit of its residents.  The Natural Resources Committee has consistently sought to assist local communities in gaining control of property within their boundaries by freeing them from Federal interference. Communities around the country would benefit significantly and immediately if the example of H.R. 4527 was replicated by Congress.  I reserve the balance of my time.
