Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 91) recognizing the 60th anniversary of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H.J. Res. 91       Whereas on June 22, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt      signed into law the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944,      commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights;       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights provided education and      training benefits to more than 7,800,000 United States      veterans and subsequent Acts have provided those benefits to      more than 21,500,000 United States veterans;       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights provided unemployment      benefits, small business loans, and job counseling services      to assist veterans with the transition from military service      to civilian employment;       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights is credited with contributing      to the robust recovery of the United States post-World War II      economy, and is largely recognized as one of the most      successful domestic programs of the United States;       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights, and subsequent Acts,      established home loan programs for United States veterans      which, since 1944, have guaranteed more than 17,500,000      loans, totaling aggregate loan amounts of more than      $800,000,000,000, providing home ownership opportunities to      millions of United States veterans and their families; and       Whereas the GI Bill of Rights, and subsequent Acts, have      been recognized by political, business, sociocultural, and      educational leaders as landmark pieces of legislation which      have collectively contributed to the development of the      United States middle class: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That      Congress--       (1) supports the recognition of the 60th anniversary of the      Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, and       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling      on the people of the United States to observe the 60th      anniversary of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 with      appropriate ceremonies and activities.
