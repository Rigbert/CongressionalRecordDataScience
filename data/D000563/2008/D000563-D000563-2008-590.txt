President, can I propound one unanimous consent request, please. I am sorry. If the Senator from New Mexico will allow me, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be allocated 5 minutes each from the majority's time after the Senator from New Mexico speaks: Senators Kennedy, Dorgan, and Bingaman.
