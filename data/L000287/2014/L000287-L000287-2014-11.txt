Speaker, I rise today to applaud the National Park Service's continuous effort to protect the legacy of my dear friend and brother, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In particular, the NPS's current effort to re-designate the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site into a National Historic Park is of great significance.  Dr. King helped lead a nonviolent revolution, a revolution of values, a revolution of ideas. He inspired an entire generation to find a way to get in the way, to find a way to get in trouble--good trouble, necessary trouble. Through his actions, speeches, and writings, he helped create the climate for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Re-categorizing this site as a park better reflects the truly monumental spirit of the area and its complexity. The area not only includes Dr. King's gravesite and birth home, which the National Park Service preserves, maintains and educates visitors about via tours, but it also stretches to contain the Historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. King, his father and his grandfather served as pastors. It also includes the entire block where Dr. King's birth home is located and contains the first integrated and longest active fire station in Atlanta, which Dr. King frequently visited as a boy. The block also consists of more than 20 historic properties, including Victorian homes, apartments and shotgun houses that were all restored to their 1930 appearances.  Last year, over 700,000 people traveled worldwide to visit the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site. Re-designating it as a National Historic Park would better reflect the complexity of the area and would have minimal associated costs, only changing signage and printed materials. I applaud the National Park Service for making this a priority, and I ask my colleagues to support this legislation to preserve Dr King's life and legacy.                          ____________________
