 President, it is my understanding that I have 15 minutes, and if I need 5 minutes off of the leader's time, I could have it. Would you please inform me when my 15 minutes are up, and if I need a little bit more time, without asking unanimous consent at that time, to take it off of leader time. Does the Chair understand what I am talking about?
