Speaker, I rise today to introduce the ``Expressing the Sense of Congress that the Supreme Court Misinterpreted the First Amendment to the Constitution in the Case of Buckley v. Valeo'' Resolution, an important bill to promote and preserve free speech.  The landmark Supreme Court case Buckley v. Valeo was decided over forty years ago. Justice Byron White called the decision ``a mortal danger against which effective preventive and curative steps must be taken.''  In the wake of a Presidential election where spending approached $5 billion, we see the influence of wealthy donors. They are granted an inordinate amount of influence over the politicians they elect. True to form, it appears to have endowed donors with an unusually high number of Cabinet positions in the Trump Administration. Nearly 38 percent of President Trump's high-level government posts were given to campaign donors.  Congress must end the current practice of allowing elections to be bought by the highest bidder. If money equals free speech, then lack of money equals lack of free speech.  We must ensure that our campaigns are reflective of the people's voices, not those of Wall Street and corporations. Buckley v. Valeo took this inviolate First Amendment right away from the people. In order to secure free speech as a right of ``we the people,'' this misinterpretation must be readdressed.                          ____________________
