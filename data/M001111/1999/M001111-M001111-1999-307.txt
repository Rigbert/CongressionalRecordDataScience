 When we passed this last October, Republicans and Democrats stood up, stood together, and said: This is a commitment from the Federal Government. No additional redtape, no bureaucracy, the money is going to go out there to those local schools to hire teachers to reduce class size. We stood together, shoulder to shoulder.  I am having a difficult time going home now, talking to school board members and my friends who are teachers--many of whom are Republicans--and saying, well, gee, now maybe they might not support us.  They don't understand that because they are putting together a budget right now. They need to hire those teachers. They need to make a commitment to that teacher, to that class, to those parents who are enrolling their kids, that they are going to continue to do this. They need us in that partnership. They don't want political maneuvers. They don't understand why Ed-Flex is a bill we can't do this on. We are talking about education. The time is right. It was bipartisan before. They want us to give that commitment now, and that is why I came to the floor today to offer this amendment.
