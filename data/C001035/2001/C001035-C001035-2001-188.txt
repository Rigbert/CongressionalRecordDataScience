President, I am delighted to join the Senator from Oregon in sponsoring this important legislation.  The premise of our amendment is clear. Candidates who run negative television and radio ads against their opponents should have to stand by their ads. That is the premise of our amendment.  The Wyden-Collins amendment would require the candidate to clearly identify himself or herself as the sponsor of the ad. No more stealth campaign negative ads.  There are many legitimate policy disputes between candidates and certainly an ad airing these differences is perfectly legitimate and, indeed, contributes to the political debate.  But when a candidate launches an ad that talks about his opponent--whether it is a high-minded discussion of policy differences or a vicious attack on an opponent's character--a candidate should be required to own up to its sponsorship.  The public should not have to guess or decipher as to who is the sponsor of the ad. The candidate's sponsorship should be absolutely clear. Our amendment would accomplish that goal by requiring a clearly identifiable picture of the candidate and statement of sponsorship for the TV ad. The statement would require the candidate to say that he or she has approved the broadcast.  Similarly, for radio, the candidate would have to identify himself, the office he is seeking, and state that he has approved the radio broadcast.  We recognize that our amendment tackles only part of the problem of the deluge of negative attack ads since so many of them are sponsored not just by candidates but by outside special interest groups. Nevertheless, the Wyden-Collins amendment is an important first step. It would help curb the abuse of self-negative ads sponsored by candidates, and it would strengthen the underlying McCain-Feingold bill.  I hope it will be approved. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.
