Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 3135, the Private Property Protection Act.  On June 23, the Supreme Court, in a 5 to 4 decision in Kelo v. City of New London, held that ``economic development'' can be a ``public use'' under the Fifth Amendment's Takings II Clause. In doing so, the Supreme Court allowed the government to take private property from one small homeowner and give it to a large corporation for a private research facility.  As the dissent in that case pointed out, under the majority's opinion, ``Any property may now be taken for the benefit of another private party . . . [T]he government now has license to transfer property from those with fewer resources to those with more. The Founders cannot have intended this perverse result.''  In 1795, a Supreme Court more in touch with the true meaning of the Constitution declared ``possessing property, and having it protected, is one of the natural, inherent, and unalienable rights of man . . . No man would become a member of a community, in which he `` could not enjoy the fruits of his honest labour and industry. The preservation of property then is a primary object of the social compact. . .''  And Abraham Lincoln often spoke of how at the heart of the evil practice of slavery was a denial of property rights: ``It is the same tyrannical principle,'' he said. ``It is the same spirit that says, `You work and toil and earn bread, and I'll eat it. ' ''  Sadly, the Supreme Court imposed such a tyranny on all Americans on June 23.  Today I am introducing the Private Property Rights Protection Act to restore the property rights of all Americans the Supreme Court took away last week. This legislation will prevent the Federal government from using economic development as a justification for taking privately owned property. It will also prohibit any State or municipality from doing the same thing whenever Federal funds would be involved with the project. Federal taxpayers should not be forced to contribute in any way to the abuse of government power.  The NAACP and the AARP have said, ``The takings that result [from the Court's decision] will disproportionately affect and harm the economically disadvantaged and, in particular, racial and ethnic minorities and the elderly.''  The American Farm Bureau Federation stated ``each of our members is threatened by the decision . . . with the loss of productive farm and ranch land solely to allow someone else to put it to a different private use . . .''  And the representatives of religious organizations have stated that the Supreme Court's decision will ``grant municipalities a special license to invade the autonomy of and take the property of religious institutions. Houses of worship and other religious institutions are, by their very nature, non-profit and almost universally tax-exempt. These fundamental characteristics of religious institutions render their property singularly vulnerable to being taken under the rationale approved by the [Supreme] court.''  I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation, and to ensure that churches, homes, farms, and other private property cannot be bulldozed in abusive land grabs that redound to the sole benefit of other private individuals whose only claim to that land is that their greater wealth will increase tax revenues.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1426]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION ACT                                 ______                                                     HON.
