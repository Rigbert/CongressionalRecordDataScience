 President, there is a new drug on the scene--Ecstasy, a synthetic stimulant and hallucinogen. It belongs to a group of drugs referred toas ``club drugs'' because they are associated with all-night dance parties known as ``raves.''  There is a widespread misconception that Ecstasy is not a dangerous drug--that it is ``no big deal.'' I am here to tell you that Ecstasy is a very big deal. The drug depletes the brain of serotonin, the chemical responsible for mood, thought, and memory. Studies show that Ecstasy use can reduce serotonin levels by up to 90 percent for at least two weeks after use and can cause brain damage.  If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is.  A few months ago we got a significant warning sign that Ecstasy use is becoming a real problem. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future survey, a national survey measuring drug use among students, reported that while overall levels of drug use had not increased, past month use of Ecstasy among high school seniors increased more than 66 percent.  The survey showed that nearly six percent of high school seniors have used Ecstasy in the past year. This may sound like a small number, so let me put it in perspective--it is just slightly less than the percentage of seniors who used cocaine and it is five times the number of seniors who used heroin.  And with the supply of Ecstasy increasing as rapidly as it is, the number of kids using this drug is only likely to increase. By April of this year, the Customs Service had already seized 4 million Ecstasy pills--greater than the total amount seized in all of 1999 and more than five times the amount seized in all of 1998.  Though New York is the East Coast hub for this drug, it is spreading quickly throughout the country. Last July, in my home state of Delaware, law enforcement officials seized 900 Ecstasy pills in Rehoboth Beach. There are also reports of an Ecstasy problem in Newark among students at the University of Delaware.  We need to address this problem now, before it gets any worse. That is why I am pleased to join Senators Graham, Grassley and Thomas to introduce the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000'' today. The legislation takes the steps--both in terms of law enforcement and prevention--to address this problem in a serious way before it gets any worse.  The legislation directs the federal Sentencing Commission to increase the recommended penalties for manufacturing, importing, exporting or trafficking Ecstasy. Though Ecstasy is a Schedule I drug--and therefore subject to the most stringent federal penalties--not all Schedule I drugs are treated the same in our sentencing guidelines. For example, selling a kilogram of marijuana is not as serious an offense as selling a kilogram of heroin. The sentencing guidelines differentiate between the severity of drugs--as they should.  But the current sentencing guidelines do not recognize how dangerous Ecstasy really is.  Under current federal sentencing guidelines, one gram of Ecstasy is treated like 35 grams of marijuana. Under the ``Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act'', one gram of Ecstasy would be treated like 2 kilograms of marijuana. This would make the penalties for Ecstasy similar to those for methamphetamine.  The legislation also authorizes a major prevention campaign in schools, communities and over the airwaves to make sure that everyone--kids, adults, parents, teachers, cops, clergy, etc. --know just how dangerous this drug really is. We need to dispel the myth that Ecstasy is not a dangerous drug because, as I stated earlier, this is a substance that can cause brain damage and can even result in death. We need to spread the message so that kids know the risk involved with taking Ecstasy, what it can do to their bodies, their brains, their futures. Adults also need to be taught about this drug--what it looks like, what someone high on Ecstasy looks like, and what to do if they discover that someone they know is using it.  Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the United States Senate on numerous occasions to state what I view as the most effective way to prevent a drug epidemic. My philosophy is simple: the best time to crack down on a drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before the abuse of the drug has become rampant. The advantages of doing so are clear--there are fewer pushers trafficking in the drug and, most important, fewer lives and fewer families will have suffered from the abuse of the drug.  It is clear that Ecstasy use is on the rise. Now is the time to act before Ecstasy use becomes our next drug epidemic. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and passing it quickly so that we can address the escalating problem of Ecstasy use before it gets any worse.                                 ______                                       By
