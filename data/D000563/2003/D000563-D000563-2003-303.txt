I said, if late in a pregnancy a woman who is carrying a fetus is in danger of a grievous physical health risk, verified by two doctors--not just a doctor performing the procedure but another doctor, for a second opinion, has to verify it--then it would be allowed. That was defeated on the floor. What I tried to do was to narrow the exception, even probably more narrow than the Supreme Court said so my colleagues would give a doctor, in an extraordinary emergency situation, not life or death but one equally serious, at least in terms of the woman's future health. As the Senator from California probably will recall, that was defeated on the floor.  I ask the Senator from California this: If the Supreme Court has already said, don't send us a statute, don't send us a proposal that doesn't protect the health of the mother when there is a significant health risk late in the pregnancy because that violates what we found to be the right of privacy under Roe v. Wade, why are we now considering S. 3, this bill, which defies the Supreme Court and says to them, we know better, we are going to change your mind, we are going to send you something that doesn't meet the test in light of the Nebraska statute? Can the Senator from California explain why we are going through this?
