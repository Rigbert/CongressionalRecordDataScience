President, I thank Senator Lugar, as well as Senator Nickles and Senator Conrad. What we achieved with the Lugar-Durbin amendment is this: We will increase the funding to fight global AIDS by almost $500 million. We are still short of what we need to meet our promised goals when the President made a historic commitment for the United States to deal with this war on AIDS. But we are moving closer.  The bipartisan cooperation this evening with Senator Lugar has allowed us to move closer to that moment, and it is equally good news for Members gathered here. It eliminates a need for me calling up my amendment and a vote.  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as cosponsors of Senator Lugar's amendment. These were sponsors of my amendment. Senators Bingaman, Lautenberg, Schumer, Stabenow, Clinton, Feinstein, Kerry, Kohl, Levin, and Murray.
