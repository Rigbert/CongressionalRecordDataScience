 With these confirmations the Senate will have confirmed 18 judicial nominees of President Bush so far this year and 118 overall.  During the entire four years of President Clinton's second term as President, Republicans never, not once, allowed the number of vacancies to dip below 50. The last time vacancies hit 49 was 7 years ago.  So far this year we have confirmed more judicial nominees of President Bush than the Republican majority was willing to confirm in the entire 1996 session when President Clinton was in the White House. That entire year only 17 judges were confirmed all year and that included none to the circuit courts, not one. In contrast, already this session two highly controversial circuit court nominees have already been confirmed among the 18 judges the Senate has approved to date. Those confirmations, including one that had more negative votes than the required number of be filibustered but who was not filibustered, never get acknowledged in partisan Republican talking points.  We are also ahead of the pace the Republican majority set in 1999 when it was considered President Clinton's judicial nominees--almost 6 months ahead. It was not until October that the Senate confirmed as many as 18 judicial nominees in 1999.  In the prior 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee, we were able to confirm 100 judges and vastly reduce the judicial vacancies that Republicans had stored up by refusing to allow scores of judicial nominees of President Clinton to be considered. We were able to do so despite the White House's refusal to consult with Democrats on circuit court vacancies and many district court vacancies.  There is no doubt that the judicial nominees of this President are conservatives, many of them quite to the right of the mainstream. Many of these nominees have been active in conservative political causes or groups. Democrats moved fairly and expeditiously on as many as we could consistent with our obligations to evaluate carefully and thoroughly these nominees to lifetime seats in the Federal courts. And we continue to do so.  Unfortunately, many of this President's judicial nominees have proven to be quite controversial and we have had serious concerns about whether they would be fair judges if confirmed to lifetime positions. Those controversial judges take more time and raise more concerns.  So, despite the fact that we are considering more controversial nominees from this President than with President Clinton, and despite the progress we have made in reducing judicial vacancies to the lowest level ever attained while President Clinton was in office and despite the pace of the lowest level ever attained while President Clinton was in office and despite the pace of confirmations, which exceeds that maintained by the Republican majority in 1999, Republicans still do nothing but criticize and castigate Senators if every judicial nominee is not confirmed by the Senate after a short debate.  The question I have been asking and the American people should ask is why are the Senate Republicans picking fights rather than working with us to make additional progress. The best example of that is the Republican insistence on seeking to proceed on the most controversial among the President's nominees instead of the circuit court nominations that Democratic Senators have supported and will support to the Fifth Circuit, the nomination of Judge Edward Prado of Texas. Judge Prado's nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee. To date, there has been no effort by the Republican leadership to allow the Senate to consider and vote on that nomination. I do not believe the cynical comments of some that Republicans will not allows us to turn to the Prado nomination because he is Hispanic and when the Senate confirms him it would demonstrate yet again that the outrageous charges of anti-Hispanic sentiment that Republicans have tried to make against Democrats were and are ridiculous.  When Senator Hatch was chairman of the Committee and a Democratic President occupied the White House, Senator Hatch denied that even 100 vacancies was a vacancies crisis, according to a column he wrote for the September 5, 1997 edition of USA Today. During the Clinton administration, Senator Hatch repeatedly said that 67 vacancies was the equivalent of ``full employment'' in the Federal judiciary. As of these confirmations, there are not 49 judicial vacancies.  By Senator Hatch's standards we have reached well beyond ``full employment'' on the Federal bench.  Vacancies have dropped to this level in large part because during 17 months of Democratic control of the Senate, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees, even though Republicans averaged only 38 confirmations per year during their prior 6\1/2\ years of control of the Senate. We inherited 110 vacancies by the time the committeewas permitted to reorganize in the summer of 2001, and we confirmed 100 judicial nominees.  This historic number of confirmations in less than a year and a half, cut the number of vacancies to 60. There were 40 new retirements in this period. Chairman Hatch never acted as quickly on Clinton nominees.  The Democratic leadership also moved to confirm 17 circuit court nominees, some of them quite controversial, in those 17 months, even though Chairman Hatch averaged only 7 circuit court confirmations per year during the Clinton administration. This year, two more circuit nominees of President Bush have been confirmed, although other controversial ones have not.  These 19 confirmations of Bush circuit court nominees have reduced the number of circuit vacancies to 23. During the Clinton administration, Chairman Hatch and Senate Republicans blocked the confirmation of 22 circuit court nominees through anonymous holds, blue slips, and other procedures. Had those nominees been confirmed, and had Bush won the confirmation of 19 circuit nominees to vacancies that arose during his Presidency, the current number of circuit vacancies would be 1.  Republicans caused what they call the circuit vacancy crisis. The number of circuit vacancies more than doubled from 16 in January 1995 when Republicans took over the Senate to 33 in the summer of 2001, when the committee was permitted to reorganize under Democratic control. Still, the Senate has already confirmed 19 of his circuit court nominees in less than 2 years. By comparison, President Reagan had 19 circuit nominees confirmed in his first 2 years in office as did President Clinton. The difference is that in both of those administrations, the Presidents were working with Senate majorities of the same political party.  Lately I have heard Republicans complaining that not all of this President's circuit nominees have yet been confirmed, but he has had so many vacancies due to the massive obstruction of circuit seats by Republicans in the Clinton administration, doubling the number of circuit vacancies, as opposed to keeping the rate of vacancies steady or reducing them. Republicans now can be heard to complain that some circuit court nominees did not get a vote in 1992, but that situation does not compare to the long stall of Clinton's circuit court nominees, and her is why:  Only 10 of the circuit nominees of President George H.W. Bush did not get a vote by the committee. Twenty-two of Clinton's circuit nominees did not get votes by the committee during Republican control. That is more than twice as many. Additionally, President George H.W. Bush won the confirmation of 67 percent of his circuit nominees between 1991 and 1992, a Presidential election year, which was consistent with prior Presidential election year congresses for President Reagan. In contrast, President Clinton won confirmation of only 15 of 34 circuit nominees in 1999-2000, about 44 percent.  Thus, because of the Republican success in blocking appellate judges, President Clinton's circuit court nominees were actually more likely than not to not be confirmed, an indignity not suffered by Bush's nominees. This was nothing compared to 1996, the first election year in modern history and recollection in which not a single circuit nominee was confirmed all year, with Republicans in charge. Plus, I would note that 6 of President Clinton's circuit nominees in 1999-2000 were actually re-nominees, like Judge Richard Paez who even Chairman Hatch admitted was ``filibustered'' in 2000 and who waited more than 1,500 days to be confirmed.  In fact, when you look at the actual percent of confirmations by session rather than the combined figure for two years, the percent of Clinton nominees blocked by Republicans is even more shocking. During 1999, only 7 of 25 Clinton circuit nominees were confirmed, or 28 percent, and 1999 was not a Presidential election year. In contrast, in 1991, the first President Bush won the confirmation of 9 of 17 nominees, or 53 percent. In 2000, Clinton won confirmation of 8 out of 25 nominees, including those not acted on in 1999, or 32 percent. In contrast in 1992, Bush won the confirmation of 11 of 21 circuit nominees, including those not acted on in 1991, which again was more than 52 percent.  Despite the wide-scale obstruction or filibustering of Clinton circuit vacancies--filibustering after all comes from the Dutch word for piracy or taking things that do not belong to you--Democrats worked hard to turn the other cheek and fill vacancies that were allowed to go unfilled due to Republican holds.  For example, under Democratic leadership, the Senate held the first hearing for a nominee to the Fourth Circuit in 3 years and confirmed him and another most controversial nominee, even though seven of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit never received hearings from Republicans. We proceed with the first hearing for a nominee to the Fifth Circuit in 7 years and confirmed her, even though three of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit never received hearings. In fact, we held hearings for all three of President Bush's nominees to that circuit even though three of President Clinton's nominees, Enrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel, and Alston Johnson, were never allowed hearings by Republicans.  We proceeded with the first hearing on a nominee to the Sixth Circuit in almost 5 years and confirmed her and another controversial nominee to that circuit even though three of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit never received a hearing. We proceeded with the first hearing on a nominee to the Tenth Circuit in 6 years and confirmed three, even though two of President Clinton's nominees to that circuit were never allowed hearings. With the confirmation of the controversial Tim Tymkovich to the Tenth Circuit last week we have now filled a total of four vacancies on that court. The seat to which he was nominated had been vacant for more than 4 years despite President Clinton having nominated two qualified nominees, neither of whom was ever accorded a hearing.  Had President Clinton's circuit court nominees been confirmed, the circuit courts would have been evenly balanced, with six circuits with a majority of Democratic appointees and six circuits with a majority of Republican appointees and one circuit with an even number of Democratic and Republican appointees.  If President Bush succeeds in winning the confirmation of nominees to every circuit vacancy he inherited plus the ones that have arisen since then, only two circuits will have a majority of Democratic appointees and 11 will have a majority of Republican appointees. In many of those circuits, the Republican appointees will have at least a 2-1 majority on every panel on average. More than 67 percent of the appointments to those courts will be by Republicans.  It is also important to remember when comparing what Republicans did to President Clinton's circuit nominees to what happened in 1992 that Chairman Biden moved through 66 of President Bush's judicial nominees in 1992, President George H.W. Bush's best year for confirmations, despite it being a Presidential election year. However, the Senate could not get through all of the nominees following the bipartisan judgeship bill of 1990 which increased the size of the Federal courts by more than 100 seats.  In the 102nd Congress, Chairman Biden got through 124 of President George H.W. Bush's nominees, including his nominee to the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas. In fact, the Republicans did not allow President Clinton to win the confirmation of a many judges in 1999 and 2000 combined as Chairman Biden got through for President Bush in 1992 alone.  Finally, I would note that Chairman Biden moved through 20 circuit court nominees for President Bush in the 102nd Congress. As a consequence, the first President Bush was able to appoint 42 circuit judges in his one term as a President. Because of Republicans' blockade of any circuit court nominee to be confirmed in 1996, President Clinton was able to appoint only 30 circuit judges in his first term, more than 25 percent fewer than his predecessor, President George H.W. Bush, who had a Democratic Senate during his entire Presidency. In President Clinton's two full terms, Republican obstruction limited him to 65 circuit court appointment in those 8 years.  In contrast, President George W. Bush has already appointed 19 circuitjudges and, as I have indicated, the 20th confirmation, that of Judge Prado is stalled only because Republicans have refused to proceed to his consideration.  President Bush is poised to appoint at least one-quarter of Federal appellate courts in just one term, due to the large number of circuit court vacancies he inherited from President Clinton which were the result of widespread Republican obstruction.  The solution to the current logjam over circuit court judges is not to move them through more quickly with less scrutiny. The solution is for this President to consult with Senators from both parties in finding mainstream, consensus nominees, rather than this parade of activists and extremists that we have witnessed over these past few months. This President wants a clean slate on judicial nominees, but he refuses to do any of the work necessary to clean that slate. Instead of being a uniter in his judicial choices, he has divided this Senate and the American people by deferring to the far right wing of his party in the only lifetimes appointments in our entire government.  The Senate Judiciary Committee has been ridiculed, and I am sad to say, rightly so, for becoming a rubberstamp, an assembly line for these important nominations to the second highest courts in our Federal Government. The solution is genuine consultation and accommodation rather than this race to pack the courts and tip the balance with nominees who have shown a lack of respect for individual rights.  I am pleased to say, however, that not all of his nominees have been extremists. Particularly for the district court nominees when there has been bipartisan consultation, some of the judicial nominees have been conservative but within the mainstream.  Since the Republican majority will not allow the Senate to consider Judge Prado, let me turn briefly to the nominees before the Senate. Mr. Drell has been a lawyer's lawyer, rather than a political or judicial activist as so many of President Bush's circuit nominees are. Dr. Drell has been a member and a leader of numerous State and Local bar associations. He served on the State Committee or Post-Conviction Representation for 5 years and assisted the State bar with attorney disciplinary matters. Dr. Drell has been active in the Family Mediation Council of Louisiana, where he served as a board member from 1986 to 1992.  He also served as board member of the Rapides Parish Indigent Defender Board from 1987 to 1994. He served on the Louisiana Task Force on Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.  Mr. Drell has also devoted a considerable amount of time to helping individuals suffering with AIDS on a pro bono basis. He is directly involved as volunteer counsel for Central Louisiana AIDS Support Services and AIDSLaw of Louisiana, Inc. These two organizations provide services to persons with AIDS and AIDS-related complex. He has also devoted time to the Delta Region AIDS Education and Training Center. In 1997, he received the Pro Bono Publico Award in 1997 from AIDSLaw of Louisiana.  Mr. Drell ha a record of accomplishment and compassion as a lawyer of which we can all be proud. He has the full support of both of his home-State Senators. His record has generated no controversy or criticism. If only, our circuit court nominees had records such as his. This nomination is a good example of the kind of candidate who engenders bipartisan support.  I congratulate Mr. Drell, his family and the Senators from Louisiana on his nomination and confirmation.  The other nominee confirmed today is Richard Bennett of Maryland. There is no doubt that Mr. Bennett is a conservative and a Republican, yet he has the support of his home-State Senators and the support of Senate Democrats.  In 1991, Mr. Bennett was chosen by President George H.W. Bush to be the United States Attorney for the District of Maryland and the Senate confirmed him without dissent. He has also run for State office as a Republican. He has litigated more than 100 cases, civil and criminal, most of which were in the Federal court to which he is nominated.  He has received an AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell, been selected to The Best Lawyers in America, and also received a meritorious service medal for his work in the military as a staff judge advocate.  Mr. Bennett served as special counsel to the Government Reform and Oversight Committee in 1997 and 1998 with Republican U.S. Representative Dan Burton, who was investigating campaign contributions during the 1996 election. He heads the Miles & Stockbrige Foundation, a charitable foundation.  I congratulate Mr. Bennett and his family on his confirmation.                          ____________________
