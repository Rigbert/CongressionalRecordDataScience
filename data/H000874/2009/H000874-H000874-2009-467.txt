 There are few people who have served on my staff who know my position on issues better than David does.  At a going-away luncheon for David, I told the assembled staff that I needed them to step up as David had, and to give me their best advice and counsel--even if that meant that on occasion they might be disagreeing with me or other staff. As a good lawyer, David clearly appreciates the importance of making a compelling argument. But he also recognizes the necessity of anticipating and considering opposing points of view and policy positions.  This approach not only has made David a valued member of my staff, but also has enabled me to better serve my constituents in Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, this great institution and our Nation.  During his more than 9 years on my staff, David demonstrated that he is a team player and problem solver who has exceptional analytical, writing, and communication skills. Over that period, he drafted everything from short statements, to countless Floor statements, to major speeches, to substantive policy documents, to advocacy materials for members of the Democratic Caucus.  While I am certainly sad to lose a trusted, valued member of my staff, I am very pleased that David has joined such a great law firm--McDermott Will & Emery, one of the top law firms in America. There's no question that his insight into the congressional leadership and the Members who serve here will be of great value to McDermott Will & Emery's clients.  I wish David and his family--his wife, Lori, and two children--all the best in the future, and again thank him for his efforts on my behalf.                          ____________________
