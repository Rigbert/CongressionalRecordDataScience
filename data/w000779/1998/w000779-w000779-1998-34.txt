The fact is the grandfathering provision and the moratorium really are linked, and I think that the Senator has been very fair to both sides with respect to this discussion, and to the extent that there are greater protections for grandfathering and more jurisdiction protected that obviously affects the discussion about the length of the moratorium. I think the Senator struck a fair balance, and I think it would be helpful if the Senator could take the Senate through those discussions a bit.  I thank the Senator for yielding me some time.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Oregon.  The reality is that the original legislation as proposed by the Senator from Oregon had no grandfathering. It had no time limit. This legislation received overwhelming support both in the committee and, very frankly, throughout the country, and gradually, interestingly enough, many Governors who would experience, in the view of some, a loss of revenue came on board this legislation--the Governor of California, the Governor of Texas, the Governor of New York, and many other Governors, but practically every Governor of every major State.  Along those lines, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the distinguished Governor of Virginia, Mr. Gilmore, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Commonwealth of Virginia                                 Richmond, VA, September 25, 1998.     Hon. John McCain,     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,          U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McCain: I am very pleased the Senate will soon      vote on the Internet Tax Freedom Act (S. 442).       Since its introduction last year, I have been--and continue      to be--in strong support of the Internet Tax Freedom Act.      Your work on this important legislation goes hand in hand      with the compromise agreement reached by the Commerce and      Judiciary Committees in the House of Representatives. Both      Committees as well as the full House passed the bill      unanimously after well reasoned compromise from all those      concerned.       As you know, the Internet is one of our most valuable and      fastest-growing resources, presenting enormous potential to      revolutionize both global and domestic commerce. But this      incredible tool currently faces some significant obstacles      with respect to state and local taxation. With more than      30,000 state and local taxing jurisdictions in the United      States, Internet development is in danger of being stifled by      a maze of inconsistent, unfair, and burdensome taxing      regimes.       There are currently thousands of Internet companies, which      can be found in every state in the nation. They are small but      important vehicles of economic development and are unfairly      assessed taxes based on interpretations of existing tax law      written well before the establishment of the Internet.      Because of the importance of these businesses, the substance      of the act should do what its title suggests.       The Internet Tax Freedom Act is important to our state      economies, to online consumers, and to the future success of      electronic commerce. This legislation places a temporary      moratorium on certain taxes so that an appropriate, non-     discriminatory Internet tax policy can be developed and      implemented by policymakers at all levels.       For these reasons, I urge the enactment of the Internet Tax      Freedom Act this year and look forward to working with you      and the Congress to ensure our nation remains the undisputed      leader in cutting edge technology industries.           Very truly yours,                                             James S. Gilmore III,                                             Governor of Virginia.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. Gilmore says:       I am very pleased the Senate will soon vote on the Internet      Tax Reform Act, S. 442.  Not as pleased as I am. He says in his concluding paragraph:       For these reasons, I urge the enactment of the Internet Tax      Freedom Act this year and look forward to working with you      and the Congress to ensure our Nation remains the undisputed      leader in cutting edge technology industries.  So another Governor and a very important one, the Governor of Virginia, has weighed in in favor of this legislation.  I believe the fact that we were willing to agree to certain grandfathering provisions was very helpful in moving this process forward, but I also think that it made an argument for a 4-year moratorium. Again, when it came out of the committee, it was 6 years originally and now the Finance Committee reduced it to 2. We think that 4 years is obviously a reasonable compromise.  So again I urge the 3-year moratorium advocates to come to the floor so we could have vigorous debate on that issue and a vote sometime around 4:45, with the agreement of the majority leader.                           Amendment No. 3727 (Purpose: To include legislative recommendations in the commission's                                 report.)  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know of no opposition to the amendment 3727 by Senator Enzi, and I therefore call up the amendment and ask that it be adopted.
