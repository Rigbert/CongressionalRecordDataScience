Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of a great Alaskan and someone I am honored and privileged to call my friend, Mr. Jack Coghill. Without Jack, I would not be here today as the Congressman for all Alaska; I might very well be retired or even buried near the banks of the Yukon River.   Jack's commitment to public service goes back long before Alaska statehood. He served as the Mayor of Nenana for 22 years, served in the Territorial House from 1952 to 1956 and was a State Senator for the first three Legislatures. He rounded out his time in elected office as Alaska's sixth Lieutenant Governor from 1990 to 1994.   Beyond his elected political career, Jack--dubbed ``Mr. Republican''--has had a profound impact upon all of Alaska as one of the 55 framers of the state constitution.   On a very personal note, in 1972 Jack was one of the few people who believed in me enough to encourage me to run for Congress. Jack not only encouraged my run but worked tirelessly in his support of my candidacy. None of us knew at that time there would be a horrific accident in which Congressman Nick Begich and House Majority Leader Hal Boggs would be lost in a flight from Anchorage to Juneau. Due to this loss, it was up to the Republican State Central Committee to appoint a Republican candidate for the Special election rather than go through a formal primary process. Despite many other qualified candidates, Jack stood by me and convinced his colleagues on the Central Committee to vote in my favor. I am forever thankful for his role in shaping the path that has led me to serve as the Congressman for all Alaska these past 42 years.                          ____________________
