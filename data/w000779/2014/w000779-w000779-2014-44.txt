President, I would like to honor the centennial of a unique historical landmark in my home State. The Pittock Mansion in Portland, OR, educates Oregonians and tourists from around the world about the city's history and the legacy of the family who once owned it.  When Henry Pittock completed construction of the large 46-room house in the West Hills of Portland in 1914, there was nothing like it in the region--and arguably, there still isn't. Henry came to Oregon by covered wagon with little in his pocket but grew to become a respected local businessman and the owner of our State newspaper, the Oregonian. His wife Georgiana was a philanthropist who was known for serving the needs of the elderly, women and children, and for her famous rose garden. Georgiana often hosted garden parties where she would showcase her famous roses and is credited with kick-starting the first Portland Rose Society and the tradition of the Portland Rose Festival, which now draws thousands of people from around the world each summer.  When Henry and Georgiana built their mansion, they hired Oregon craftsman and artisans and used northwest materials, helping their community and contributing to the bourgeoning city in a variety of ways. They lived a long, happy life together and had 6 children and 18 grandchildren, including some who lived in the mansion up until it was put up for sale in 1958.  Today, the mansion serves as a historical museum. The interior of the house and the surrounding property are publicly owned and preserved by dedicated staff and volunteers. Tourists, locals, and schoolchildren are often seen wandering through the home and along the paths around the large property learning about the historic significance of the mansion and of Portland. The house represents an era of growth that was occurring throughout the Pacific Northwest at the time of its construction.  For its symbolism, history, and meaning, today we recognize the Pittock Mansion's Centennial Year. May it continue to serve as a place to learn and enjoy for many years to come.                          ____________________
