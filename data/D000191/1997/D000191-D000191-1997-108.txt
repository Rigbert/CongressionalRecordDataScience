Speaker, I recommend that all my colleagues read the article reprinted below from the Washington Times by Charles McMillion for an objective assessment of the true impacts of NAFTA on the U.S. economy.               [From the Washington Times, Sept, 1, 1997]   U.S. Should Slow Down and Think Before Racing Ahead on Fast Track                       (By Charles W. McMillion)       There are few things more important to our local and      national economy today than global investment and trade. With      our terrific new technologies and more than 1 billion (one in      three) of the world's workers unemployed, what policies work      best in driving growth and prosperity?       Unfortunately, this is not the high-minded debate we will      hear this week as Congress begins discussions on renewing      ``fast-track'' negotiating authority for President Clinton to      expand the North American Free Trade Agreement south of      Mexico.       Instead, brace yourself for an awesome display of big-money      arrogance and raw public relations power by the few dozen      largest corporations and financial institutions that dominate      discourse on these vital concerns.       Speaking for these powerful special interests--and key      campaign contributors--President Clinton declared again last      week: ``Already, over the last four years more than 25      percent of our economic growth has come from overseas      trade.''       This statement may be true for the small group of private      interests. But it is pure nonsense for the U.S. economy. The      United States must borrow from abroad or sell assets worth $3      billion each week to pay for our trade losses. Workers and      firms throughout the country have taken cuts in pay and      profits to avoid becoming a trade statistic.       Yet global trade is one of the four defining elements of      our nation's gross domestic product. The others are consumer      spending, private investment and government spending.       U.S. economic losses from trade, large when Mr. Clinton      came into office, have grown each year, setting world      records. Trade has sharply reduced the U.S. economy. It is      one of the reasons that growth has been slower and the U.S.      dollar far weaker in the current recovery than in any other      similar period on record.       Beyond the simple arithmetic, U.S. trade losses are now      compounded by the composition of trade. Unlike a generation      ago, when oil and basic commodities accounted for most U.S.      trade losses, today's losses are dominated by autos and high-     tech electronics. Global commerce, dominated by a few      transnational companies, is now largely a tool that      undermines domestic producers and living standards.       While the Dow Jones industrial average has soared more than      150 percent the past five years, average salaries, health      care and retirement benefits have declined.       But despite these facts, a ``globaloney'' PR campaign will      promote the benefits of expanding NAFTA.       NAFTA, ratified four years ago, was sold by the business      and political elite as a precedent-setting investment and      trade pact among the sleeping giant of Mexico, with its      population of 93 million, the United States (population 260      million) and Canada (population 29 million). But the      administration and big-business lobby have recently been      forced to wildly spin NAFTA's effects.       Several no-longer (if ever) independent ``think tanks''      funded by transnationals, their foundations and the      government, from Brookings to Heritage, have put out reports      using remarkably similar and inappropriate assumptions to      reach the conclusion that NAFTA has had a slight but positive      effect on both the United States and Mexico.       Yet under NAFTA Mexico has suffered its worst depression      since the 1930s, with incomes still 15 percent to 20 percent      below 1993 levels.       Gone is any reference to Mexico's population, three times      the size of Canada's, or to its young and well-educated labor      force, which is growing by more than 1 million per year. Now      Mexico is presented as an almost insignificant little place      with an economy only one-twenty-eighth the size of the U.S.      economy. This to pretend that Mexico can have very little      effect on U.S. workers or firms.                               __________                                      Gone also is any mention of the post-NAFTA $50 billion      package of stabilization loans that the administration      insisted two years ago was essential to head off economic      collapse in Mexico. This omission is particularly odd because      it was the equivalent of a $1.4 trillion loan, had it been      made to the United States.       Now the spin is that ``opponents can't dispute'' the claim      that NAFTA greatly cushioned the impact of Mexico's economic      crisis. Of course, if there were any ``cushioning'' effect on      U.S.-Mexico trade, this massive U.S. loan--not NAFTA--would      deserve the, well, credit.       And what, exactly, is the extent of this supposed      cushioning on U.S. trade? On a balance-of-payments basis, the      worst previous U.S. trade losses with Mexico were in 1983 and      1984, when they reached $7.5 billion and $6.1 billion,      respectively, and were concentrated in oil and simple      commodities. By contrast, U.S. trade losses soared to $16.6      billion and $18.4 billion in 1995 and 1996, respectively.      U.S. trade losses to Mexico are concentrated now in high-     wage, highly productive manufacturing industries such as      autos and electronics.       By contrast, the rest of the world continues to enjoy large      trade surpluses with Mexico.       Peso devaluations have been a common occurrence in Mexico      for a generation. The 47 percent devaluation in 1995 was less      severe than devaluations in 1982, 1983, 1986 and 1987 and      barely worse than those in 1984, 1985 and 1988. It is not      politically correct to ask the obvious question: Why are the      effects of the post-NAFTA devaluation so much worse than      those that came before?       The answer points to the failed elements of NAFTA and to      the debate that is needed before repeating mistakes that are      already costly to most citizens, even as they enrich a      powerful few.       NAFTA has far more to do with providing new powers to      investors and speculators than with tariff reduction. Tariffs      now amount to no more that a few percentage points and are      insignificant in the face of 10-to-1 or 20-to-1 differentials      in production costs between the United States and Mexico for      many industries.       These new private powers give investors, for example, the      standing to sue governments directly in international      tribunals over a wide range of ill-defined regulatory      matters. These powers are what suddenly catapulted $60      billion in global hot money into Mexico as NAFTA took shape,      turning it briefly into the fast-buck capital of the world.       As the International Monetary Fund and others have noted,      these massive capital flows leave countries highly vulnerable      to worldwide events, dramatically increase investors'      influence and leave governments little room to manuever in      time of crisis.       NAFTA's investors and trade provisions have clearly failed      the vast majority of Americans and Mexicans. To ignore this      experience and lurch ahead could be a fast track to deep      trouble.                               ____________________
