Speaker, at this point I would yield 2 minutes to the vice chair of the Health Subcommittee, the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Burgess, and when he concludes speaking, I ask unanimous consent that the rest of my time be controlled by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), the chair of the Health Subcommittee.
