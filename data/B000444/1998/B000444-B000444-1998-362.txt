 President, I am not one for shilling for books, but for those of you who are interested in this subject and the religious and ethnic conflicts that have erupted after the mailed fist of communism has been lifted in Central and Eastern Europe, I strongly recommend--and I mean this sincerely--Senator Moynihan's book entitled ``Pandaemonium.'' It is worth, as they say, the read, and is incredibly instructive. I mean it sincerely. It is incredibly insightful, and those of you who have an interest should take a look at it.  I yield the floor and yield the time, and I am ready to vote.
