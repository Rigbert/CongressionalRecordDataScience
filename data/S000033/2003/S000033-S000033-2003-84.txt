 Speaker, I am not really a Blue Dog.  Mr. Speaker, the Republican proposal ignores the most important prescription drug issue facing our country: cost containment and the need to end the national disgrace by which our citizens are forced to pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. If we do not pass this motion to recommit, the pharmaceutical industry will have succeeded in keeping prices high and their profits high.  This motion to recommit removes the poison pill in H.R. 1, the so-called Cochran amendment, and establishes a real prescription drug reimportation program with Canada. This provision alone, without costing the taxpayers one penny, will do more to help seniors and all Americans get affordable drugs than the $400 billion being spent by the Republicans.
