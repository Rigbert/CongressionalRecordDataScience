And I mention this one. I am pleased that when you voted it down yesterday that you are willing to vote it up today when you bring it up. That is OK. I will support a number of those things that come back. But that is what we have to avoid.  I think, frankly, one way out of this--I just suggest it and I have suggested it to others--is that we debate the Craig-Hatch amendment, and the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer is going to have--we debate those as the Members want, set that vote for an early hour tomorrow morning, and when that debate is finished, let the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont stay here and try to get through as many amendments either on the Republican or on the Democratic side that can be handled by voice vote, even if we have to stay here all night long to do that, so we then have a very clear shot of finishing.  It is one suggestion.
