Chairman, I regret that I have not had the opportunity to talk to the gentlewoman from Miami, Florida (Mrs. Meek) who is my great friend and whom I deeply respect. I had understood that this question had been discussed with the committee and did not know about this particular problem.  I would assure the gentlewoman as a strong supporter of this amendment, which I think is an important amendment, that I will work strenuously to make sure that we protect each and every community. Because my own community, Prince George's County, obviously cares a great deal about the CDBG and the integrity of its provisions. What this amendment does, it provides a portion of what the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) has been working on very, very hard, as well as the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith), the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews), and others on behalf of the fire fighters of America, both paid and volunteer.  This money will be also used for burn victims, $10 million of it will be for victims of fire and fire research. Frankly, I regret that I did not know of the concern of the gentlewoman from Florida until just now. I was surprised. But at some point in time I would like to have the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who is really the author of much of this, have some time.
