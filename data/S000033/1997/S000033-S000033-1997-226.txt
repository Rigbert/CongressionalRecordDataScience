 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Canaan High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Inkel: Good morning, Congressman Sanders. We would like      to bring your attention to the issue of child abuse. Child      abuse is a serious problem in today's society. We need to      focus on it and we need to fight it.       One specific thing that we feel needs to be done is to      start a child safety network. This is sort of like a criminal      network. As of right now when there is a complaint of child      abuse to Child Protective Services, a case is opened and an      investigation is begun. If this family moves to another State      the case is closed. The former State can warn the new State,      but because of confidentiality, the case stays closed. This      means that the abuse will most likely continue.       We feel that all the States should work as one to unite to      fight this problem. Across the United States why cannot we      unite to fight this problem.       Ms. Rice: In order to start this child safety network we      need to come up with something for funding. We suggest that      we increase alcohol, tobacco and other consumption-based      taxes by about 0.5 percent. The money generated from these      taxes would be used to start up a child safety network.       If this program were started the lives of many innocent      children would be saved. We understand that a few people will      lose their incentive to buy, but there are still many other      users willing to buy at any cost. Therefore, we believe that      there will still be left money earned to go into a      desperately needed program, one that protects the wellbeing      of children.       Child abuse is wrong and it is a disgrace that so many      cases go undetected and unpunished. It is time that the      government do something about this atrocious problem.       Child abuse is a very serious problem. Last year there were      200,000 cases of child abuse reported. One female in every      three or four is likely to be sexually victimized before she      is 18 years old. Data for males is more scarce and less      reliable, but it is 1 in 10 and 1 in 6, and 2 percent of      Americans will be sexually victimized in childhood; child      abuse is one of the most unreported of all crimes.       It is a problem everywhere. There is child abuse in every      State, and what we really want to--first of all, we need more      money because there are some caseworkers that are getting 50      or 60 kids a week to have to take care of and that doesn't      give them much time to actually sit down and work with these      kids, so more money needs to be put to that. And we wanted      money for this program of the child safety network because of      these families who are just moving out of the State and the      cases are just being closed because they cannot say anything      because of confidentiality and these kids are just going to      be moved everywhere and nothing is being done about what is      going on.       Ms. Inkel: I have no idea really why someone would ever      imagine hitting a child. Some say it is because they were      abused when they were younger, some blame it on alcohol and      drugs,                               ____________________
