 President, if there is no further business to come before the Senate, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous order.  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:27 p.m., adjourned until Friday, April 24, 1998, at 10 a.m.                          ____________________
