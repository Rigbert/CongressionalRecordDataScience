 President, today I am pleased to introduce on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, ``The Spokane Tribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable Compensation Act.'' This bill will provide a settlement of the claims of the Spokane Tribe for its contribution to the production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam.  The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete dam in the world, the largest electricity producer in the United States, and the third largest electricity producer in the world. Grand Coulee is one mile in width; its spillway is twice the height of Niagara Falls. It provides electricity and water to one of the world's largest irrigation projects, the one million acre Columbia Basin Project. The Grand Coulee is the backbone of the Northwest's federal power grid and agricultural economy.  To the Spokane Tribe, however, the Grand Coulee Dam brought an end to a way of life. The dam flooded their reservation on two sides. The Spokane River changed from a free flowing waterway that supported plentiful salmon runs, to barren slack water that now erodes the southern lands of the reservation. The benefits that accrued to the nation and the Northwest were made possible by uncompensated injury to the Native Americans of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers.  The legislation I am introducing seeks to compensate the Spokane Tribe for its losses. In 1994, Congress enacted similar settlement legislation to compensate the neighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. That legislation provided a onetime payment of $53 million for past damages and approximately $15 million annually from the proceeds from the sale of hydropower by the Bonneville Power Administration. The Spokane Tribe settlement legislation would provide a settlement proportional to that provided to the Colville Tribes, which was based on the percentage of lands appropriated from the respective tribes for the dam. This translates into 39.4% of the past and future compensation awarded the Colville Tribes.  Let me give my colleagues some of the background surrounding this issue. From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its tributaries. In its report to Congress, the Corps recommended the Grande Coulee site for hydroelectric development. In 1933, the Department of Interior federalized the project under the National Industrial Recovery Act, and in 1935, Congress authorized the project in the Rivers and Harbors Act.  In 1940, Congress enacted a statute to authorize the Interior Department to designate whichever Indian lands it deemed necessary for Grand Coulee construction and to receive all rights, title and interest the Indians had in them. In return, the Tribes received compensation in the amount determined by Interior Department appraisals. However, the only land that was appraised and for which Tribes were compensated was the newly flooded land, for which the Spokane Tribe received $4700. There is no evidence that the Department advised or that Congress knew that the Tribes' water rights were not extinguished. Neither was there evidence the Department know the Indian title and trust status for the Tribal land underlying the river beds had not been extinguished. No compensation was included for the power value contributed by the use of the Tribal resources or for the loss of the Tribal fisheries or other damages to Tribal resources.  As pointed out in a 1976 Opinion of Lawrence Aschenbrenner, the Acting Associate Solicitor, Division of Indian Affairs, Department of Interior       The 1940 act followed seven years of construction during      which farm lands, and timber lands were flooded, and a      fishery destroyed, and during which Congress was silent as to      the Indian interests affected by the construction. Both the      Congress and the Department of Interior appeared to proceed      with the Grand Coulee project as if there were no Indians      involved there. . . . There is no tangible evidence,      currently available, to indicate that the Department ever      consulted with the Tribes during the 1993-1940 period      concerning the ongoing destruction of their land and      resources and proposed compensation therefore. . . . It is      our conclusion that the location of the dams on tribal land      and the use of the water for power production, without      compensation, violated the government's fiduciary duty toward      the Tribes.  In 1994, the Colville legislation settled the claims of the Colville Tribes to a share of the hydropower revenues from the Grand Coulee Dam. This claim was among the claims which the Colville Tribes filed with the Indian Claims Commission (ICC) under the Act of August 13, 1946, which included a five year statute of limitations. While the Colville Tribes had been formally organized for more than 15 years, the Spokane Tribe did not formally organize until 16 days prior to the ICC statute of limitations deadline. In addition, while the BIA was aware of the potential claims of the Spokane Tribe to a portion of the hydropower revenues generated by Grand Coulee, there is no evidence that the BIA ever advised the Tribe of such claims. The settlement for the Spokane Tribes was not included with that for the Colville Tribes in 1994 because the Colvilles had concerns that the statute of limitations would hold up the legislation.  Since the 1970s, Congress and federal agencies have indicated that both the Colville and Spokane Tribes should be compensated. Since 1994, when an agreement was reached to compensate the Colville Tribes, Congress and federal agencies have expressed interest in providing equitable compensation to the Spokane Tribe. This legislation will provide for the long overdue settlement to which the Spokane Tribe is entitled. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1525       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians of      the Spokane Reservation Grand Coulee Dam Equitable      Compensation Settlement Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress find the following:       (1) From 1927 to 1931, at the direction of Congress, the      Corps of Engineers investigated the Columbia River and its      tributaries to determine sites where power could be produced      at low cost.       (2) The Corps of Engineers listed a number of sites,      including the site where the Grand Coulee Dam is now located,      with recommendations that the power development be performed      by local governmental authorities or private utilities under      the Federal Power Act.       (3) Under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act, licensees      must pay Indian tribes for the use of reservation lands.       (4) The Columbia Basin Commission, an agency of the State      of Washington, applied for, and in August 1933 received, a      preliminary permit from the Federal Power Commission for      water power development of the Grand Coulee Site.       (5) In the mid-1930's, the Federal Government, which is not      subject to the Federal Power Act, federalized the Grand      Coulee Dam project and began construction of the Grand Coulee      Dam.       (6) At the time the Grand Coulee Dam project was      federalized, the Federal Government knew and recognized that      the Spokane Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville      Reservation had compensable interests in the Grand Coulee Dam      project, including but not limited to development of      hydropower, extinguishment of a salmon fishery upon which the      Spokane Tribe was almost totally dependent, and inundation of      lands with loss of potential power sites previously      identified by the Spokane Tribe.       (7) In an Act dated June 29, 1940 (54 Stat. 703; 16 U.S.C.      835d), Congress enacted legislation to grant to the United      States all the rights of the Indians in lands of the Spokane      Tribe and Colville Indian Reservations required for the Grand      Coulee Dam project and various rights-of-way over Indian      lands required in connection with the project. The Act      provided that compensation for the lands and rights-of-way      required shall be determined by the Secretary of the Interior      in such amounts as such Secretary determines just and      equitable.       (8) In furtherance of the Act of June 29, 1940, the      Secretary of the Interior paid to the Spokane Tribe the total      sum of $4,700. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville      Reservation received a payment of $63,000.       (9) In 1994, following 43 years of litigation before the      Indian Claims Commission, the United States Court of Federal      Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal      Circuit, Congress ratified an agreement between the      Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and the      United States that provided for past damages and annual      payments of $15,250,000 in perpetuity, adjusted annually,      based on revenues for the sale of electric power and      transmission of such power by the Bonneville Power      Administration.       (10) In legal opinions issued throughout the years by the      Department of the Interior Solicitor's Office a Task Force      Study conducted from 1976 to 1980 ordered by the Senate      Appropriations Committee, and in hearings before the Congress      when the Confederated Tribes Act was enacted, it has      repeatedly been recognized that the Spokane Tribe suffered      similar damages and had a case legally comparable with that      of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation with      the sole exception that the 5-year statute of limitations      provided in the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946      prevented the Spokane Tribe from bringing its own action      for fair and honorable dealings as provided in that Act.       (11) The failure of the Spokane Tribe to bring an action of      its own before the Indian Claims Commission can be attributed      to a combination of factors, including the failure of the      Bureau of Indian Affairs to carry out its advisory      responsibilities as required by the Indian Claims Commission      Act (Act of August 13, 1946, ch. 959, 60 Stat. 1050) and an      effort of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to impose      improper requirements on claims attorneys retained by Indian      tribes which caused delays in retention of counsel and full      investigation of the Spokane Tribe's potential claims.       (12) As a consequence of construction of the Grand Coulee      Dam project, the Spokane Tribe has suffered the complete loss      of the salmon fishery upon which it was dependent, the loss      of identified hydropower sites it could have developed, the      loss of hydropower revenues it would have received under the      Federal Power Act had the project not been federalized, and      it continues to lose hydropower revenues which the Federal      Government recognized the Spokane Tribe was due at the time      the project was constructed.       (13) Over 39 percent of the Indian-owned lands used for the      Grand Coulee Dam project were Spokane Tribe lands.     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to provide fair and equitable      compensation to the Spokane Tribe on a basis that is      proportionate to the compensation provided to the      Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation for the      damages and losses suffered as a consequence of construction      and operation of the Grand Coulee Dam project.     SEC. 4. SETTLEMENT FUND ACCOUNT.       (a) Establishment of Account.--There is hereby established      in the Treasury an interest bearing account to be known as      the ``Spokane Tribe of Indians Settlement Fund Account''.       (b) Deposit of Amounts.--       (1) Initial deposit.--Upon enactment of this Act and      appropriation of funds, the Secretary of the Treasury shall      deposit into the Fund Account a sum equal to 39.4 percent of      the sum paid to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville      Reservation in a lump sum pursuant to section 5(a) of the      Confederated Tribes Act, adjusted by the consumer price index      from the date of that payment of the Confederated Tribes      until the date of enactment of this Act, as payment and      satisfaction of the Spokane Tribe's claim for use of its      lands for generation of hydropower for the period from 1940      through November 2, 1994, the date of the enactment of the      Confederated Tribes Act.       (2) Subsequent deposits.--Commencing on September 30 of the      first fiscal year following enactment of this Act and on      September 30 of each of the 5 fiscal years following such      fiscal year, the Administrator of the Bonneville Power      Administration shall pay into the Fund Account a sum equal to      20 percent of 39.4 percent of the sum authorized to be paid      to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation      pursuant to section 5(b) of the Confederated Tribes Act      through the end of the fiscal year during which this Act is      enacted, adjusted by the consumer price index to maintain the      purchasing power the Spokane Tribe would have had if annual      payments had been made to the Spokane Tribe on the date      annual payments commenced and were subsequently made to the      Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation pursuant to      section 5(b) of the Confederated Tribes Act.       (e) Annual Payments.--On September 1 of the fiscal year      following the enactment of this Act and of each fiscal year      thereafter, payments shall be made by the Bonneville Power      Administration, or any successor thereto, directly to the      Spokane Tribe in an amount which is equal to 39.4 percent of      the annual payment authorized to be paid to the Confederated      Tribes of the Colville Reservation in the operative and each      subsequent fiscal year pursuant to section 5(b) of the      Confederated Tribes Act.     SEC. 5. USE AND TREATMENT OF SETTLEMENT FUNDS.       (a) Transfer of Funds to Tribe.--The Secretary of the      Treasury shall transfer all or any portion of the settlement      funds described in section 4(a) to the Spokane Business      Council not later than 60 days after such Secretary receives      written notice of the adoption by the Spokane Business      Council of a resolution requesting that such Secretary      execute the transfer of such funds. Subsequent requests may      be made and funds transferred if not all of the funds are      requested at one time.       (b) Use of Initial Payment Funds.--       (1) General discretionary funds.--Twenty-five percent of      the settlement funds described in section 4(a) and (b) shall      be reserved by the Business Council and used for      discretionary purposes of general benefit to all members      of the Spokane Tribe.       (2) Funds for Specific Purposes.--Seventy-five percent of      the settlement funds described in section 4(a) and (b) shall      be used for the following:       (A) Resource development program.

(c) Treatment of Funds for Certain Purposes.--The payments      or distributions of any portion of the principal, interest,      and income generated by the settlement funds described in      section 4 shall be treated in the same manner as payments or      distributions from the Investment Fund described in section 6      of Public Law 99-346 (100 Stat. 677).       (f) Tribal Audit.--The settlement funds described in      section 4, once transferred or paid to the Spokane Tribe,      shall be considered Spokane Tribe governmental funds and, as      other tribal governmental funds, be subject to an annual      tribal governmental audit.     SEC. 6. REPAYMENT CREDIT.       Beginning in the fiscal year following enactment of this      Act and continuing for so long as annual payments are made      under this Act, the Administrator of the Bonneville Power      Administration shall deduct from the interest payable to the      Secretary of the Treasury from net proceeds as defined in      section 13 of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System      Act, a percentage of the payment made to the Spokane Tribe      for the prior fiscal year. The actual percentage     of such deduction shall be calculated and adjusted to ensure      that the Bonneville Power Administration receives a deduction      comparable to that which it receives for payments made to the      Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation pursuant to      the Confederated Tribes Act. Each deduction made under this      section shall be credited to the interest payments otherwise      payable by the Administrator to the Secretary of the Treasury      during the fiscal year in which the deduction is made, and      shall be allocated pro rata to all interest payments on debt      associated with the generation function of the Federal      Columbia River Power System that are due during that fiscal      year; except that, if the deduction in any fiscal year is      greater than the interest due on debt associated with the      generation function for the fiscal year, then the amount of      the deduction that exceeds the interest due on debt      associated with the general function shall be allocated pro      rata to all other interest payments due during that fiscal      year. To the extent that the deduction exceeds the total      amount of any such interest, the deduction shall be applied      as a credit against any other payments that the Administrator      makes to the Secretary of the Treasury.     SEC. 7. SATISFACTION OF CLAIMS.       Payment under section 4 shall constitute full payment and      satisfaction of the Spokane Tribe's claim to a fair share of      the annual hydropower revenues generated by the Grand Coulee      Dam project from 1940 through the fiscal year prior to the      fiscal year during which this Act is enacted and represents      the Spokane Tribe's proportional entitlement of hydropower      revenues based on the lump sum payment for damages from 1940      through 1994 and the annual payments by the Bonneville Power      Administration to the Colville Tribes commencing in fiscal      year 1995 through the fiscal year that this Act is enacted.     SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.       For the purposes of this Act--       (1) the term ``Confederated Tribes Act'' means the      Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Grand Coulee      Dam Settlement Act (P.L. 103-436; 108 Stat. 4577);       (2) the term ``Fund Account'' means the Spokane Tribe of      Indians Settlement Fund Account established under section      4(a); and       (3) the term ``Spokane Tribe'' means the Spokane Tribe of      Indians of the Spokane Reservation.
