President, today, I rise to introduce the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, IPAWS, Modernization Act of 2012. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman, Scott Brown, Akaka, and Carper in introducing this bill. It will ensure that more people receive life-saving information in more parts of America, more of the time, through current and future technologies.  Effective communication with the public before, during, and after a disaster is vitally important and can literally mean the difference between life and death. Since the 1950's, the U.S. Government has had a system in place to ensure that citizens can be warned in times of crisis. This system can also be used for local authorities to warn citizens of impending severe weather or other hazards to public safety.  Most people know the Emergency Alert System, EAS, as the crawling text on their television screens, and although this system remains the backbone of our national alerting capability, times have changed, and so must the way we communicate with the public during times of crisis.  This bill will strengthen the IPAWS system and ensure that as many Americans as possible receive these alerts in a timely and useful manner. The bill ensures that the integrated public alert and warning system incorporates multiple communications technologies, including new technologies such as smart phones and social networking sites;  The bill is designed to adapt to and incorporate future technologies;  The bill is designed to provide alerts to the largest portion of the affected population, including remote areas;  The bill promotes local and regional public and private partnerships; and  The bill provides redundant alert mechanisms in order to reach the greatest number of people possible.  The bill also requires the FEMA Administrator to ensure the inclusion of those with disabilities in the alert and warning system; ensure that the system is included in future exercises conducted through DHS's National Exercise Program, including the annual National Level Exercises; and requires FEMA to coordinate with DHS's National Terrorism Advisory System office. The bill provides for periodic nationwide tests of the system, and establishes a training program to instruct federal, state, tribal and local government officials in system use.  The bill also establishes an IPAWS Advisory Committee composed of federal, State and local representatives, as well as members who represent relevant industry groups and a consumer/privacy advocate. The committee would meet at least once a year and issue a yearly report on improvements to IPAWS. The bill also states that the administrator may not transmit a message from the President that does not relate to a natural disaster, act of terrorism, other man-made disaster, or other hazard to public safety.  This bill has been endorsed by the National Emergency Management Association, NEMA, the National Association of Broadcasters, NAB, the National Federation of the Blind, and the Hearing Loss Association of America. Additionally, we have received a letter of support from the CEOs of all 50 State broadcast trade associations.  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to pass this bill and have it signed into law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           National Association of                                                 Broadcasters,                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins, Ranking Member,     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Ranking Member Collins: I write in support of your      bill, the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)      Modernization Act of 2012, which will modernize the public      alert and warning system of the United States to ensure that      the president, under all conditions, can effectively alert      and warn citizens during times of disaster. America's      broadcasters strongly support this legislation.       Broadcasters serve our local communities during emergencies      by providing life-saving information, important news and      weather reports. We have proudly worked with local and      federal governments for more than six decades, airing alerts      issued by the Emergency Alert System (EAS), and continue to      do so today. Working hand in hand with law enforcement,      broadcasters have helped to successfully recover more than      540 abducted children to date through the use of AMBER      Alerts.       The IPAWS Modernization Act of 2012 is an important step      towards expanding the nation's public warning system by      integrating multiple communications systems and future      technologies. This legislation promotes local and regional      public and private partnerships and provides redundant alert      mechanisms to reach the largest number of people during an      emergency.       Additionally, this legislation establishes a training      program to instruct federal, state, tribal and local      government officials in system use. Broadcasters are very      supportive of such a training program and view this as a      critical component to successful alerting. Strengthening      coordination among the different levels of government, the      legislation will set up an IPAWS Modernization Select      Advisory Committee composed of federal, state and local      representatives as well as members from various industry      groups. We look forward to participating in this Advisory      Committee and continuing our partnership with the federal      government.           Sincerely,                                                  Gordon H. Smith,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                          Hearing Loss Association                                                   of America,                                     Bethesda, MD, April 12, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The Hearing Loss Association of      America is pleased to endorse the Integrated Public Alert and      Warning System Modernization Act of 2012. We applaud your      efforts to update the integrated public alert and warning      system, and are particularly pleased to see that this      legislation would require specific steps to ensure      individuals with disabilities are not forgotten.       One of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)      core responsibilities is to keep Americans informed about      threats to public safety, and yet the current public alert      and warning system is not always accessible to people with      hearing loss. In fact, the November 9, 2011 testing of EAS      proved to be problematic: some cable stations did not provide      the needed text to properly inform people with hearing loss      that it was only a test; some did not provide the needed      audible alerts; others did not provide the emergency alert at      all.       The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System      Modernization Act of 2012 updates the system to incorporate      multiple communication technologies and adapt to emerging      technology, and it requires the system to reach people with      hearing loss and other disabled people. The bill also ensures      that organizations representing people with hearing loss will      sit on an advisory committee that will make recommendations      on modernization of the system, keeping people with hearing      loss engaged with Federal agencies during this process.       By requiring the system to incorporate new technologies but      still reaching people with hearing loss and other people with      disabilities, FEMA will be supporting technology that is      accessible to all. The modernization will also ensure that      people with hearing loss are provided with the same critical      information at the same time as the rest of the country,      allowing everyone to make independent, educated decisions      during emergencies. On behalf of Americans with hearing loss,      we thank you again for taking the initiative in this matter      and sponsoring this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                    Brenda Battat,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                National Emergency                                       Management Association,                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Member, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs          Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Emergency      Management Association (NEMA) representing the emergency      management director of all 50 states, Territories, and the      District of Columbia, we are pleased to endorse The      Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act      of 2012.       The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) was      designed to bring together different and emerging      communication technologies into a fully coordinated network      so comprehensive communication may occur in the event of an      emergency or disaster. Created by a 2006 Executive order,      IPAWS represents a step forward from outdated systems which      relied on radio and television alone to reach the population      at-large when there is an incident.       Since the 2006 Executive Order, IPAWS has languished      without a true direction, appropriate authorization, or      codified organization. Your legislation brings about all      these needed aspects to the program that we have supported in      recent years. In 2008, NEMA unanimously approved a position      paper regarding IPAWS. One aspect of the program in which we      felt needed improvement was greater coordination with state      and local governments. Since last year, outreach to state      officials has certainly improved, but we believe your      recommendation of the IPAWS Advisory Committee will help      bring about even more coordination with the Federal Emergency      Management Agency.       Alert systems represent critical components of local and      state emergency operations plans, so it remains essential the      IPAWS system is integrated, coordinated, and comprehensive.      We must remain careful, however, that these components to not      come at the expense of already stressed state budgets.       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this issue and      look forward to working together with you, Chairman      Lieberman, and the rest of the committee to ensure passage of      this bill. Please feel free to utilize our membership as a      resource as The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System      Modernization Act of 2012 moves through the legislative      process. You may also call upon our Director of Government      Relations, Matt Cowles any time.           Sincerely,     Jim Mullen,       NEMA President, Director, Washington Military Department      Division of Emergency Management.                                  ____                                               National Federation                                                 of the Blind,                                    Baltimore, MD, April 18, 2012.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The National Federation of the Blind      (NFB), the nation's largest and oldest organization of blind      people, endorses the Integrated Public Alert and Warning      System Modernization Act of 2012. We thank you for sponsoring      a bill that updates the integrated public alert and warning      system to require inclusion of individuals with disabilities,      and we encourage the U.S. Senate to pass this legislation      promptly.       One of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA)      core responsibilities is to keep Americans informed about      threats to public safety, and yet many aspects of the current      public alert and warning system are not accessible to blind      people. This inaccessibility is perpetuated by misconceptions      about blindness and the ever-growing popularity of      inaccessible digital technology. As a result, blind people      are regularly denied access to critical public information.      The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization      Act of 2012 updates the system to incorporate multiple      communication technologies and adapt to emerging technology,      and it requires the system to reach blind and other disabled      people. The bill also ensures that a representative from a      blindness advocacy group will sit on an advisory committee      that will make recommendations on the modernization, keeping      the blind engaged with Federal agencies during this process.       By requiring the system to incorporate new technologies but      still reach blind and other disabled people, FEMA will be      encouraging manufacturers and carriers to make their      communication technologies accessible by nonvisual means. The      modernization will also ensure that blind people are provided      with the same critical information at the same time as the      rest of the country, allowing blind people to make      independent, educated decisions during emergencies. On behalf      of blind Americans, we thank you again for taking the      initiative in this matter and sponsoring this legislation.           Sincerely,                                                John G. Pare, Jr.,     Executive Director for Strategic Initiatives.                                  ____                                        National Alliance of State                                    Broadcasters Associations,                                                   April 16, 2012.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The undersigned, who are the chief      executive officers of the named State Broadcasters      Associations, are pleased to offer our support and      endorsement for your proposed bill authorizing the Integrated      Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS).       If passed, this bill will ensure that more people receive      life saving information in more parts of America, more of the      time,     through current and future alert and warning technologies,      while strengthening broadcasters' role as the backbone of      America's public alerting system.       Many of us serve as chairs or members of our respective      State Emergency Communications Committees, which are charged      with managing the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in our states.      We have all worked tirelessly over the years to ensure that a      robust, reliable alerting system is available when it is      needed.       We have observed over the years that the system needs a      higher level of coordination among the various federal, state      and local public safety and emergency management agencies as      ``message originators,'' on the one hand, and the broadcast,      cable and satellite ``message relayers'' on the other hand;      and that the absence of any formal, on-going training of      state and local public safety and emergency management      personnel on the use of EAS has hampered state and local      officials' willingness and ability to use it efficiently in      times of emergency, thus putting lives and property at risk.       Your bill will address these problems and will make giant      strides toward improvement of alert and warning capability in      our states and across our nation. We look forward to working      with you toward successful passage of this important measure.
