President, while I disagree with the position of the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, I, too, compliment him on his first speech. He obviously had given great thought to it and to his position. It was sort of in the dim recesses of my own memory of the first time I spoke on the floor. I know it is a special time. I applaud him for waiting to speak on this matter. Whichever side we are on, we all agree that it is a very serious matter.  I notice that the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts is on the floor and wishes to speak. Following the sort of informal arrangement the Senator from Utah and I have worked out, trying to go back and forth, I will yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.
