Mr. Speaker, I am attaching an exchange of letters between Chairman Hyde and Chairman Davis concerning the bill H.R. 4436, ``To provide certain authorities for the Department of State, and for other purposes'' for printing in the Record.                                         House of Representatives,                         Committee on International Relations,                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2005.     Hon. Tom Davis,     Chairman, House Committee on Government Reform, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the bill,      H.R. 4436, to provide certain authorities for the Department      of State. There are certain provisions in the bill which fall      within the shared Rule X jurisdiction of your Committee.      Specifically, I refer to the language in section 4 of the      bill relating to increased limits applicable to post      differentials; section 6 of the bill which extends the      authorization of personal services contracting authority that      waives civil service laws and danger pay allowances; and      section 7 relating to official residence expenses. Based on      discussions between the two committees, I will change the      language in this bill as called up to include a modification      in section 4 (e) relating to reporting requirements to      include your Committee and to sunset the authorization in      section 6. Section 7 will remain as in the introduced bill.       In the interest of permitting this Committee to proceed      expeditiously to the floor consideration of this bill, I      request your Committee to waive further consideration of this      matter. I understand that such a waiver only applies to this      language in this bill, and not to the underlying subject      matter. I will urge the Speaker to name Members of your      Committee to any conference committee which is named to      consider this bill.       I appreciate your willingness to allow us to proceed. I      will insert this exchange of letters into the Congressional      Record           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,                                                         Chairman.                                         House of Representatives,                               Committee on Government Reform,                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2005.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, House Committee on International Relations,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter concerning the      bill H.R. 4436 to provide certain authorities for the      Department of State. I concur in your judgment that certain      provisions which you mentioned fall within the jurisdiction      of your Committee.       Based on conversations between the two committees and your      agreement to make certain changes in the language which will      be considered under suspension of the rules, I am willing to      waive this committee's right to consider the bill. In so      doing, I do not waive its jurisdiction over the subject      matter of the bill. I appreciate your commitment to urge the      Speaker to name Members of this Committee to any conference      committee which is named to consider this bill and to insert      this exchange of letters into the Congressional Record.       I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.           Sincerely,                                                        Tom Davis,     Chairman.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2590-E2591]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]       TO PROVIDE CERTAIN AUTHORITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE                                 ______                                                                speech of                       HON.
