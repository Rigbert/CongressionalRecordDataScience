President, we are now in April and we have been in session for 4 months. We have confirmed two Federal judges in 4 months. That is half a Federal judge a month. There are almost 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. That means that puts a strain on our Federal justice system. Cases cannot be heard because judges are not there. Prosecutors are forced to plea bargain in cases they do not want to. If you are a private litigant in a business or just an individual and you have suits you want heard, they cannot be heard.  The Chief Justice of the United States has said it is a crisis situation. It is.  Mr. President, I urge the leadership of this body to start moving forward and get some of the vacancies filled, take the judges that have already been nominated, get them confirmed, and show respect to the independent Federal judiciary of this country.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
