I just wanted to thank the gentleman here, the gentleman from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Klink], and the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio], for their leadership in speaking for up for the people of the United States, the people of the continent, and the people of the world, not just those investors in large multinational corporations who have access to the media and to our own financial centers.                          ____________________
