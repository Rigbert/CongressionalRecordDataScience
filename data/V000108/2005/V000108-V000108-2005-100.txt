Speaker, I rise today in observance of Holocaust Martyrs, and Heroes Rememorance Day. Known as Yom Hashoah in Hebrew, this solem day commemorates the anniversary of the beginning of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. This year is of particular import, as it marks the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. I join my distinguished colleagues in remembering the victims of the Holocaust while vowing that such a horror shall never again take place.  In remembering the six million victims of the Holocaust, we must recommit ourselves to fighting against the evils that led to the Holocaust; anti-Semitism, racism, bigotry, and intolerance. This commitment requires that we tell the story of the Holocaust to our children and grandchildren. We owe nothing less to the survivors and to the brave men who fought to liberate the Ghettos and the death camps.  I rise also to condemn the rising tide of anti-Semitism around the globe and to demonstrate the United States' lasting commitment to the elimination of such bigotry and ignorance. It is essential that each and everyone of us takes action to prevent such atrocities and vigorously pursues justice for the victims of acts of hatred and inhumanity. The crimes against humanity that were perpetrated by the Nazis must never be forgotten, lest we allow such evil to spread again.  We must also remember the handicapped, homosexuals, gypsies, political dissidents, and even Poles who were murdered in the Nazi ``Final Solution,'' simply for being different. TheNazi hatred for anyone considered different stands as the antithesis of the values of freedom and liberty that we hold so dear.  It is also important to recognize the sacrifices, service, and dedication of Allied soldiers and underground fighters that resulted in the defeat of the Nazi regime and the liberation of the concentration camps. We are indebted to the service of these brave souls who fought against evil to stop the death and destruction of the Holocaust.  Mr. Speaker, today we mourn the innocent lives lost and vibrant communities destroyed by the Holocaust. We also honor those heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto who faced certain death when they fought against the Nazi's planned extermination of their community. With our solemn remembrance of the atrocities of the Holocaust, we empower a new generation to ensure that such crimes are never again repeated.                          ____________________
