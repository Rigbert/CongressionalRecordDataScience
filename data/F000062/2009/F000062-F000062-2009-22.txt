 President, I rise to introduce the Federal Judicial Fairness Act of 2009.  I want to thank my cosponsors--Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, and Senator Graham--for working with me on this important legislation.  The salaries of our Federal judges are eroding in their real buying power over time. This bill would solve that problem.  Over the past 30 years, pay for Federal judges has declined dramatically. Since 1969, the inflation-adjusted salaries of Federal judges have dropped by 24 percent, even as other Federal workers have received an average salary increase of 18 percent.  The way the pay system works now, Federal judges are at a stark disadvantage each year for receiving a cost-of-living adjustment to keep their salaries in pace with inflation. While most Federal civilian employees receive an automatic cost-of-living adjustment, Federal judges do not. Instead, they currently receive an adjustment only if Congress passes a special law and also provides an adjustment for itself.  Judicial salaries should not be ensnared in Congressional-pay politics. Judges should simply be on the same system that other Federal employees are.  That is what this bill would do.  It would repeal ``Section 140,'' which currently requires Congress to pass a special law each year in order for judges to receive a cost-of-living adjustment; and it would provide judges with an automatic, annual cost-of-living adjustment under the same General Schedule used for other Federal civilian employees.  In other words, the bill would simply put Federal judges on an even playing field.  Why is this important?  The drop in real pay for Federal judges has created what Chief Justice John Roberts has called ``a Constitutional crisis.'' More and more judges are being forced to leave the bench for financial reasons during what should be the peak years of their judicial careers.  Recently, the Federal court for the Central District of California lost a U.S. District Judge, Stephen Larson, after only 4 years of service. Larson had been a public servant for over a decade and said that because of his large family, he was finally faced with an impossible choice: He could either continue serving the public as a judge, or he could retire from the bench in order to be able to afford a college education for his children.  Judge Larson's story is not an anomaly. The Federal bench has lost 103 judges since 1990, 80 percent of whom ended up taking other, usually higher-paying, positions in the private sector.  The problem is especially acute in high-cost states like California. In California, State court judges have higher salaries than Federal Article III judges.  The rate at which our Federal courts are losing judges has increased by 24 percent since the 1990s, even as caseloads have gone up and the replacement process has slowed down.  Departures like Judge Larson's are only half the problem. As former Federal judge and former Representative Abner Mikva has pointed out, a primary effect of the erosion of judicial salaries is to discourage our Nation's most talented lawyers from joining the bench in the first place.  In 1969, the salary of a Federal district court judge was about 20 percent higher than the salary of a top law school dean and about 30 percent higher than that of a senior law professor at a top law school. Today, judges make only two-thirds the salary of similarly credentialed law professors, and half the pay of deans.  In many cases, judges make less than first-year associates fresh out of law school.  The bill that I am introducing today does not say that Federal judges should make as much as law firm partners or law school deans. It simply says that Federal judges should not be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis other Federal employees in getting a cost-of-living adjustment each year. It simply ensures that the salary Congress intended judges to receive will keep pace with inflation.  Congress has already delayed action on this issue for too long. Our Nation now risks losing both our most experienced judges and the next generation of talented jurists.  As early as 2003, the nonpartisan National Commission on the Public Service, also known as the Volcker Commission, concluded that ``the lag in judicial salaries has gone on too long, and the potential for the diminished quality in American jurisprudence is now too large.''  I believe that the legislation that I am introducing today with Senators Hatch, Leahy, and Graham is a straightforward solution. It is not a raise. It is simply an assurance that judges will not have to jump through special hoops or rely on the politics of Congressional pay in order to get the cost-of-living adjustment received by other Federal employees.  I do not believe that judges should expect to make the kind of salaries available to partners at private law firms. The rewards of public service are of a different kind. But we must ensure that judicial service remains a viable option for the most talented members of the bar.  Basic fairness requires that judges' salaries not diminish over time. It is time to provide these critical public servants with a fair pay system that will guarantee the future health of the judiciary.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2725       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Judicial Fairness      Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. JUDICIAL COST-OF-LIVING INCREASES.       (a) Repeal of Statutory Requirement Relating to Judicial      Salaries.--Section 140 of the resolution entitled ``A Joint      Resolution making further continuing appropriations for the      fiscal year 1982, and for other purposes.'', approved      December 15, 1981 (Public Law 97-92; 95 Stat. 1200; 28 U.S.C.      461 note), is repealed.       (b) Automatic Salary Adjustments.--Section 461(a) of title      28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``(a) Effective at the beginning of the first applicable      pay period commencing on or     after the first day of the month in which an adjustment takes      effect under sections 5303 and 5304 of title 5 in the rates      of pay under the General Schedule, each salary rate which is      subject to adjustment under this section shall be adjusted by      an amount, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 (or, if      midway between multiples of $100, to the next higher multiple      of $100) equal to the percentage of such salary rate which      corresponds to the overall average percentage of the      adjustment in the rates of pay under the General Schedule.''.                          ____________________
