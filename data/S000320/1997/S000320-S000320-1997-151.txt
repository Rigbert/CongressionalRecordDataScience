 President, I rise to address the issue of verification, and in opposition to the motion to strike condition No. 33 contained in the resolution of ratification, relating to effective verification.  I have a number of serious concerns with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, however, I have a particular responsibility to ensure that any treaty ratified by this body can be effectively verified by the intelligence community.  If it cannot be verified, the CWC could become the means by which CWC member states, such as China and Iran, expand and enhance--rather than renounce--their CW capabilities.  In negotiating the INF Treaty, ratified in 1988, President Reagan set forth an eminently reasonable standard to guide the negotiation and implementation of arms control agreements. ``Trust,'' he said, ``but verify.''  But I am afraid that the critical, second part of President Reagan's formula seems to have been forgotten with respect to this treaty.
