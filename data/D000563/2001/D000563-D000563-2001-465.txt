President, it is naive to believe we can eliminate soft money from candidates and political parties and that that money will disappear. That money will find its venue in these issue ads that we will then face. Believe me, the voters of your home State will not be able to distinguish where the soft money is being spent. It is going to be soft money spent for the purpose of influencing political campaigns.  The Senator from Minnesota has adopted the Snowe-Jeffords standard in terms of these ads. It is not changing it in any respect. I say, with all due respect to my colleague from North Carolina, the Senator from Minnesota has included a severability clause. If we are wrong, if this is unconstitutional, it can be stricken without having any damage to the rest of this McCain-Feingold bill as written.  In 1974, when the Senate and House presented to the Supreme Court our version of campaign finance reform, they decided spending limitations were unconstitutional but, in terms of contribution limitations, they were constitutional. When it comes down to it,they can make that same decision on this provision.  I hope if it is in the bill they will leave it there because then we will clearly takeout all soft money. Unfortunately, the Senator from Minnesota is not part of the bargain today. What he has brought before us is not something that has been bargained for by those who have written this bill. But his is a good-faith and valuable addition to this, and I hope my colleagues will vote for it.
