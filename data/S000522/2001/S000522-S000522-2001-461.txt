Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to commend Chile for its legal protection of unborn children. Chile has a wonderfully coherent constitution and system of laws relative to the protection of human life. The consistency of Chile's laws protecting human life is something that I look at very favorably when I consider the United States' relations with Chile.  That is why, as the Vice-Chairman of the House International Relations Committee as well as a Member of Congress with over 20 years of service, I am concerned about recent reports that the Chilean government has taken actions inconsistent with Chile's own legal protection of life.  I am specifically concerned about reports that the government has authorized and is promoting the ``morning after pill.'' Although the international abortion industry hasmisleadingly labeled this pill an ``emergency contraceptive,'' it operates not as a true contraceptive but as an abortifacient. That is, it does not prevent conception, but instead ensures the expulsion of the unborn child from the womb, causing its death.  As Congress reviews the free trade negotiations currently underway between the United States and Chile, the Chilean government's apparent failure to comply with its own benign laws regarding protection of human life from the moment of conception has become a factor in my consideration. For pro-life Members of Congress, admiration for Chile's continuing commitment to unborn children is an important reason to want to have a close and positive relationship with Chile. We believe Chile and other countries that still protect their unborn children should be commended and rewarded for setting an example to other nations, including the United States, whose courts or legislatures have imposed a legal regime that treats unborn children not as human beings to be nurtured and protected, but as disposable objects. I am sure that other Members of Congress who admire Chile's legal protection of unborn children will share my concern about reports that the government has taken actions in violation of that legal protection.  As the United States moves forward in our relations with Chile, I hope the Chilean government will consistently follow its own enlightened pro-life laws. I commend Chile for these laws, which reflect a consistent ethic of life over death.                          ____________________
