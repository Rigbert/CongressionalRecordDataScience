 President, section 114 of the Interior portion of this omnibus appropriations bill addresses the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act, Public Law 102-495. I would like to reflect on some of the legislative history of that section.  While section 114 slightly amends the Elwha Act, it also sustains and confirms the Elwha Act itself. The amendment simply provides for one new option in this restoration process: The State of Washington may purchase the dams for $2 after the Federal Government has bought them for $29.5 million from the current private owner.  Should the State wish to acquire two aging dams, it must enter into an agreement with the Secretary of the Interior to discharge all of the obligations of the Federal Government, as established in the Elwha Act. Although it is almost impossible to envision a basis on which the State might choose to purchase these projects, this amendment at least makes such a decision possible.  It is important to reiterate, the State may acquire the dams only if it agrees to remove the two dams, restore the fisheries, provide numerous tribal obligations, protect the local water quality, and do everything the Federal Government was committed to doing under the original Elwha Act. I specifically want to stress that the State must undertake all of the obligations of the Act, including section 3 (a), (c), and (d), as well as sections 4, 7, and 9.  In case my colleagues were not aware of the current State responsibilities for fisheries in Washington, the State manages fishery resources within State waters. It is required to manage these resources in a manner consistent with the Boldt decision regarding tribal treaty rights to fishery resources. The obligations under the Elwha Act are far more expansive.  I need to clarify a mistake made this weekend. Senator Gorton and my staff agreed Friday to report language that provided: ``None of the requirements of the Elwha Act are changed unless the State elects to exercise its option to purchase and remove the projects.'' As a colloquy between Senator Gorton and myself at the end of the bill reflects, that is the intent of the managers.  This colloquy makes clear an implied intention of the amendment: If the State does not exercise its new option, then the Secretary and the United States remain fully obligated under this act to acquire the dams, remove them, restore the river's ecosystem and fisheries, and deal honorably with the tribes. Until such time as the binding agreement provided for in this amendment is offered by the State and approved by the Federal Government, the Federal Government must continue to carry out its responsibilities under the Elwha Act with all due speed.  I do not support the approach taken by this amendment. However, my solace lies in my belief that the State would not--and should not--accept this option. Restoration of the Elwha ecosystem is a Federal responsibility. It is on Federal land, in one of this nation's most amazing parks and rainforests, the Olympic National Park. Only the Federal Government is responsible, via its trust obligations, to the S'Klallam people who have sacrificed so much as others have destroyed an historic religious and cultural icon, the abundant salmon runs of the Elwha.  Despite reservations about this amendment, I am pleased with the true appropriations work done in this bill, that is allocation of funds to acquire these dams. I strongly support the $4 million appropriated for fiscal year 1997. The Congress provided the same amount last year. I look forward to working to ensure the next administration demonstrates its commitment to this project with a substantial increase in its budget request for this important fisheries restoration project.  The Elwha River and ecosystem are precious to the tribes, environmentalists, Olympic Peninsula communities, commercial and sport fishers, and other people throughout the region and country. This river system was one of the most productive salmon rearing and spawning resources in the Pacific Northwest. Today, those fisheries are devastated. I appreciate the nearly $300,000 allocated in this bill for emergency measures to provide some relief for species currently imperiled.  I am committed to working with Senator Gorton and the next Administration in the 105th Congress to ensure the Elwha ecosystem is fully restored as soon as possible.
