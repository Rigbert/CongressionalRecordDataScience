And once again, the Senate Republican leadership is scrambling at the last minute to avoid a crisis of its own making.  Last year, we had a chance to pass the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014, and I urged the Senate to pass it. A majority of Senators, but not 60, voted for it because we all knew the expiration date for these surveillance authorities was right around the corner. We knew May 31 would arrive quickly in the new Congress.  I did not want our intelligence community to face a period of uncertainty leading up to the sunset, and I also didn't want the American people to have billions of their phone records stocked away in a government database any longer--especially as we have seen, in the case of Edward Snowden, just how insecure that database can be.  That is why we spent months holding six public hearings in the Judiciary Committee and even more months negotiating a bipartisan bill, which got the support of the administration, the intelligence community, privacy groups, and the technology industry. I think that is the first time we have had all of them together.  Unfortunately, my attempts to avoid this last-minute chaos were blocked by the Republican leader last year. He said this was a matter that could wait for the new Congress. He said the new Republican majority would have a rigorous committee process for important issues.  Well, five months into the new Republican majority, and with the deadline looming, the Republican leader has just now turned his attention to this issue.  The Republican-led Senate committees have not taken steps toward reauthorization or reform. Instead, the majority leader now proposes a 60-day extension of a program that a Federal court of appeals just ruled is unlawful. The court ruled unanimously that it is unlawful, and they are saying, well, let's just extend the bulk collection program for another 60 days.  The majority leader apparently wants to do this to allow one of his committee chairmen to develop a last-minute ``back-up plan.'' This is why we tried to pass legislation a year ago.  The House of Representatives is not going to pass a 60-day extension, nor should it. We should not extend this illegal program for one more day, and we do not need to do so. After all, we have a solution in hand. Why try to ignore reality and go on with something else?  We have a responsible solution. In fact, it is the only responsible solution. Broad consensus has developed around the bipartisan USA FREEDOM Act of 2015.  The Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence wrote a letter in support of the bill. The FBI Director told me he supports it. This past weekend, the former chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee advocated for passage of this legislation in an article in the Baltimore Sun.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these materials be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Baltimore Sun, May 15, 2015]Intelligence Reform Bill Is Important to Safeguarding Our Security and                                 Privacy             (By C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger and Mike Rogers)       The USA Freedom Act will protect our security and privacy.       A recent Baltimore Sun editorial described legislation to      reform the government's collection of Americans' phone and      email data as a sign that ``bipartisan cooperation in      Congress is not completely dead'' (``Reining in the      surveillance state,'' May 5). We'd like to remind The Sun      that similar legislation to end the mass storage of this data      passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan majority--it      garnered more than 300 votes, in fact--over a year ago.       In our role as leaders on the House Intelligence Committee,      we drafted and introduced last year's bill together with our      colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Reps. Bob Goodlatte      and John Conyers. Our success provided the foundation for the      legislation that passed the House by an even larger margin on      Wednesday. The USA Freedom Act ends the bulk collection of      what we now know as ``metadata''--that big database up at the      National Security Agency that contains the phone numbers of      millions of Americans will go away. The government will now      have to seek court approval before petitioning private cell      phone companies for records. The court will have to approve      each application, except in emergencies, and major court      decisions will be made public.       We need this reform to keep our country safe. Section 215      of the Patriot Act, which is the part that legalizes much of      NSA's critical work to protect us from terrorists, expires in      less than three weeks on June 1. If we do not reauthorize it      with the reforms demanded by the public, essential      capabilities to track legitimate terror suspects will expire,      too.       That couldn't happen at a worse time--we live in a      dangerous world. The threats posed by ISIS and other terror      groups are just the tip of the iceberg. We also need strong      defenses against increasingly aggressive cyber terrorists and      the ``lone wolf'' terrorists who are often American citizens,      for example.       This bill restores Americans' confidence that the      government is not snooping on its own citizens by improving      the necessary checks and balances essential to our Democracy.      We helped write it last year, we support it this year and we      hope Republicans and Democrats continue working together on      common sense reforms to protect our national security and our      civil liberties.                                  ____                                                     May 11, 2015.     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Senator Mike S. Lee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Lee: Thank you for your letter of      May 11, 2015, asking for the views of the Department of      Justice and the Intelligence Community on S. 1123, the USA      FREEDOM Act of 2015. We support this legislation.       This bill is the result of extensive discussion among the      Congress, the Administration, privacy and civil liberties      advocates, and industry representatives. We believe that it      is a reasonable compromise that preserves vital national      security authorities, enhances privacy and civil liberties      and codifies requirements for increased transparency. The      Intelligence Community believes that the bill preserves the      essential operational capabilities of the telephone metadata      program and enhances other intelligence capabilities needed      to protect our nation and its partners. In the absence of      legislation, important intelligence authorities will expire      on June 1. This legislation would extend these authorities,      as amended, until the end of 2019, providing our intelligence      professionals the certainty they need to continue the      critical work they undertake every day to protect the      American people.       The USA FREEDOM Act bans bulk collection under Section 215      of the USA PATRIOT Act, FISA pen registers, and National      Security Letters, while providing a new mechanism to obtain      telephone metadata records to help identify potential      contacts of suspected terrorists inside the United States.      The Intelligence Community believes, based on the existing      practices of communications providers in retaining metadata,      that these provisions will retain the essential operational      capabilities of the existing bulk telephone metadata program      while eliminating bulk collection by the government.       The bill also codifies requirements for additional      transparency by mandating certain public reporting by the      government, authorizing additional reporting by providers,      and establishing a statutory mechanism for declassification      and release of FISA Court opinions consistent with national      security. It establishes a process for appointment of an      amicus curiae to assist the FISA Court and FISA Court of      Review in appropriate matters. It provides reforms to      national security letters, requiring review of the need for      their secrecy. The bill also closes potential gaps in      collection authorities and increases the maximum criminal      penalty for materially supporting a foreign terrorist      organization.       Overall, the significant reforms contained in this      legislation will provide the public greater confidence in how      our intelligence activities are carried out and in the      oversight of those activities, while ensuring vital national      security authorities remain in place. You have our commitment      that we will notify Congress if we find that provisions of      this law significantly impair the Intelligence Community's      ability to protect national security. We urge the Congress to      pass this bill promptly.           Sincerely,                                                 Loretta E. Lynch,                                                 Attorney General.                                                 James R. Clapper,                                Director of National Intelligence.
