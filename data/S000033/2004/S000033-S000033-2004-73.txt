 Chairman, I do not have to convince any Member of this body that the American people are outraged by the extremely high prices they are currently paying for gasoline. I am sure that you are getting the same calls that I get in my office in Vermont.  As we all know, these exorbitant prices are a serious drag on our economy. They affect small business and farmers, they affect airlines and the trucking industry, they affect middle-income people who drive to work every day and are seeing their wage increases going into their gas tanks. This is a serious national problem.  Now, I understand that there are differences of opinion in this body about long-term solutions to this crisis. We have debated that over the last couple of days. I personally believe we have to take a hard look at OPEC, the cartel which today functions directly in opposition to international free trade law. I think we have to deal with the increased concentration of ownership in the oil industry, and I think the time is long overdue that we have to break our dependency on fossil fuels and move to sustainable energy.  But whether one agrees with my long-term solutions or not, there should be no debate about the need for us to come together now to provide immediate short-term relief to the American people who are hurting from high gas prices.  The concept I am introducing in this amendment has had support from Democrats and Republicans, people from all political views, and I hope and believe that it will win strongly today.  Specifically, this amendment would suspend oil deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and cap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at 647 million barrels of oil, the level that it was in in March of this year, just a few months ago. In other words, we would immediately stop the purchase of more oil for the reserve and release into the market 15 million barrels of oil. This action would have the very immediate impact of substantially lowering gas prices in America.  Mr. Chairman, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve currently contains approximately 662 million barrels and the administration is pushing to increase that number to some 700 million barrels. My amendment would increase the amount of oil on the market and lead to lower cash prices immediately upon its implementation. It would also keep gas prices down by making sure the government is not competing against consumers in the marketplace at a time that gas prices are so high.  Mr. Chairman, extrapolating from at least three economic studies done by Goldman Sachs; the largest crude oil trader in the world, the Air Transport Association; and petroleum economist Phillip Burleger, the estimate is that this amendment could reduce gasoline prices at the pump by 10 to 25 cents per gallon. It is not going to solve the whole problem, but 10 to 25 cents per gallon is not an insignificant step in helping the American consumer.  Mr. Chairman, even the staff at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve recommended against buying more oil for the SPRO in the spring of 2002. They state, ``Commercial inventories are low, retail prices are high, and economic growth is slow. The government should avoid acquiring oil for the reserve under these circumstances.''  Mr. Chairman, a lot of people have come up with this idea. This is not just mine. Members may remember that in March of this year, 53 Members of the House, including 39 of our Republican colleagues, wrote to President Bush calling for a halt of oil deliveries into the SPRO. Let me quote from this letter: ``Dear Mr. President, we are writing to urge that you suspend shipments of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and allow more oil to remain on the market and available to consumers when supplies are tight.''  I agree with those 39 Republicans and other Democrats who made that request of the President. They are right.  Mr. Chairman, in addition, on March 16 of this year, the Senate passed an amendment by Senators Carl Levin and Susan Collins with a bipartisan majority of 52 to 43 to suspend oil deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.                              {time}  1545  Frankly, there is nothing magical about the 647 million barrels of oil in this bill which this amendment proposes; that is the cap we propose. In conference, that number could be changed. That number simply came about with this amendment because it is where the SPR was in mid-March when the Senate passed its resolution and when the 53 Members of the House, including 39 Republicans, wrote their letter to the President.
