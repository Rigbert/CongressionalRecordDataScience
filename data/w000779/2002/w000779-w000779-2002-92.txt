That is what our agreement does. At the same time, I have also said that legislation should not make it harder for legally registered voters to cast a ballot, or discourage people from voting. The agreement will do this as well.  This has not been an easy task. I want to commend Senators Bond, Cantwell, McConnell, and Murray for sticking with the negotiations, and I especially want to thank Chairman Dodd for the support he and his staff have given us in reaching the agreement and in including it in the managers' package.
