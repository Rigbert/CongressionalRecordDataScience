Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Congressional Black Caucus Budget Substitute.  I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Kilpatrick), and all our staff for their hard work on this effort. Our budget reflects the values and priorities of the American people.  The CBC Members represent some of the most conservative and most progressive people in this country. Some of us are from big cities; others come from tiny, little towns and farm lands. And every year we find a way to come together. Every year, we find a way to provide funds for the most important priorities of all our constituents.  If you care about health care; if you care about homelessness; if you care about education; then you will support this substitute. Our amendment includes an additional $20 billion investment in education. And we provide an additional $17 billion for health care.  In Georgia, the mortgage foreclosure crisis is devastating our communities. This budget includes an additional $8 billion to assist with housing and services for families, this disabled, senior citizens, and children. Unlike the President's budget proposal, we increase services and security for our constituents. And we find a way to pay for it.  Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to really look at this legislation. Study our fact sheets; read the dear colleague letters. Then really think about your constituents, and think about how our budget will better all of their lives.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.                          ____________________
