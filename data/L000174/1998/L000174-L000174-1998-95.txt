President, I am pleased to continue my strong objections to proposed Federal Communications Commission rules that could rob states and communities of the authority to decide where unsightly telecommunications towers should be built.  I am one of five Senators who voted against the Telecommunications Act of 1996. One of my fears was that the will and voice of states and local communities would be muzzled if that bill became law. Unfortunately, with the passage and implementation of the Telecommunications Act, my fears have been confirmed.  Mayors and citizens in Vermont towns and in towns across this nation are outraged that they have little control over the construction of these towers. This is especially troubling when communications technology is advancing so rapidly that large towers may become obsolete.  For example, some wireless phone providers offer the older analog wireless service. That is now being replaced by digital phone service in many parts of the nation. Analog providers could provide towerless service to towns by using an array of small antennas, instead of a large tower. Phone companies prefer to build one large tower with its switching equipment because that is cheaper than the switching equipment needed to control an array of small antennas. However, if a town does not want its landscape ruined with a tower, I think the company should be required to offer service through these smaller antennas.  Second, for companies offering the ``newer'' digital wireless phone service, other technologies are eliminating the need for large towers. The Iridium Corporation will offer phone service throughout the United States in the near future that is based on more than 60 low-earth-orbit satellites. Over time, this will provide a satellite communications link from any place in the world, even where no tower-based system is available.  In areas of the United States outside the range of cellular coverage the Iridium phone will connect you directly to the Iridium satellite network. Emergency communications--911 and disaster assistance--will be greatly aided with this development.  Hospitals, ambulances and other emergency service providers will be linked together by satellite directly from a hand held phone.  The Wall Street Journal reports that this service will cost more than regular cell phone service. However, they also report that other competitors and more efficiencies of scale are likely to bring down costs over time.  In addition, I have previously discussed how the towerless PCS-Over-Cable technology provides digital cellular phone service by using small antennas rather than large towers. These small antennas can be quickly attached to existing telephone poles, lamp posts or buildings and can provide quality wireless phone service without the use of towers. This technology is cheaper than most tower technology in part because the PCS-Over-Cable wireless provider does not have to purchase land to erect large towers.  Since there are viable and reasonable alternatives to providing wireless phone service through the use of towers, I think that towns should have some say in this matter. And I think that mayors, town officials and local citizens will agree with me.  Why should a large tower be forced on a town when wireless phone service can be provided without using a tower? Indeed, many argue that towerless phone service is much better in a disaster situation. During New England's ice storm, I am told that some towers collapsed. Tornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes can destroy large telephone towers. But satellite phone service would not be affected by these disasters. Also, the PCS-Over-Cable technology is much less likely to be out of service for large areas during a disaster as compared to wireless phone service provided by large towers.  In addition, other advances in communications technology may also make towers obsolete even faster than anticipated.  This is one reason why I am so concerned about the federal government taking away the power of local communities to control where these towers are located. When big, unsightly towers are proposed to be located in the wrong place, towns should be able to just say no. And if the rules proposed by the FCC are implemented, towns will be further marginalized and even lose their input as to where the towers are placed.  As I have said before, I do not want Vermont turned into a pincushion, with 200 foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every mountain and in every valley. I have heard from many Vermonters, as well as town leaders and citizens from across the country, who are justifiably afraid that they are losing control over the siting, design, and construction of telecommunications towers and related facilities. They feel that state and local concerns are being sacrificed to the interests of a small part of the telecommunications industry that uses large towers.  Today I continue in my commitment to the preservation of state and local authority. I am joined by Senators Jeffords, Hutchinson, Moynihan, Feingold, Gregg, Moseley-Braun, Sarbanes, Dodd, and Cleland in introducing legislation which would repeal the authority of the FCC to preempt state and local regulations affecting the placement of new telecommunications towers. This legislation expands and improves upon S. 1350, which I introduced one year ago.  Vermont communities and the state of Vermont must have a role in deciding where towers are going to go. Theymust be able to take into account the protection of Vermont's scenic beauty. This is true for other states as well.  In fact, by requiring the companies to work with Vermont towns, acceptable alternative locations of towers, acceptable co-location of antennas on existing towers, or the use of alternative towerless technology, could be suggested. This would be much better than allowing any company to just come in willy-nilly and plop down towers next to our backyards.  In my view passage of this bill will actually promote better emergency phone service, better phone service in disasters and the more advanced digital wireless phone service.  The bill I am introducing today will mandate that states and towns cannot be ignored in the spread of telecommunications towers. This bill will recognize that states and towns do have choices in this cellular age.  This bill also incorporates the concerns of the aviation industry. The Federal Aviation Administration presently does not have authority to regulate the siting of towers. Airport officials work with local governments in the siting of towers. Silencing local governments will have a direct effect on airline safety, according to the representatives of the airline industry that we have heard from.  In a comment letter responding to the FCC's proposed rule, the National Association of State Aviation Officials attacked preemption on the grounds that it ``is contrary to the most fundamental principles of aviation safety * * * the proposed rule could result in the creation of hazards to aircraft and passengers at airports across the United States, as well as jeopardize safety on the ground.'' I cannot think of anyone who would want towers constructed irrespective of the negative and potentially dangerous impacts they may have on airplane flight and landing patterns.  Make no mistake. I am for progress, but not for ill-considered, so-called progress at the expense of Vermont families, towns and homeowners. Vermont can protect its rural and natural beauty while still providing for the amazing opportunities offered by these technological advances.  To deprive states of the ability to protect their land from unsightly towers is wrong, and the FCC rules should not stand. My legislation would reaffirm that states have a role to play in where telecommunications towers are placed and providing alternates to wireless providers.  I ask unanimous consent that this new legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2514       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The placement of commercial telecommunications, radio,      or television towers near homes can greatly reduce the value      of such homes, destroy the views from such homes, and reduce      substantially the desire to live in such homes.       (2) States and localities should be able to exercise      control over the siting and modification of such towers      through the use of zoning, planned growth, and other controls      relating to the protection of the environment and public      safety.       (3) There are alternatives to the construction of towers to      meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the      co-location of antennae on existing towers or structures,      towerless PCS-Over-Cable telephone service, satellite      television systems, low-Earth orbit satellite communication      networks, and other alternative technologies.       (4) There are alternative methods of designing towers to      meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the      use of small towers that do not require blinking aircraft      safety lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree      canopies and that are camouflaged or disguised to blend with      their surroundings, or both.       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications      Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182,      which would preempt the application of State and local zoning      and land use ordinances regarding the placement of broadcast      transmission facilities. It is in the interest of the Nation      that the Commission not adopt this rule.       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the memoranda      opinions and orders and proposed rules of the Commission with      respect to application of certain ordinances to the placement      of such towers (WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62,      RM-8577, and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified in order      to permit State and local governments to exercise their      zoning and land use authorities, and their power to protect      public health and safety, to regulate the placement of      telecommunications or broadcast towers and to place the      burden of proof in civil actions, and in actions before the      Commission relating to the placement of such towers, on the      person or entity that seeks to place, construct, or modify      such towers.       (7) PCS-Over-Cable or satellite telecommunications systems,      including low-Earth orbit satellites, offer a significant      opportunity to provide so-called ``911'' emergency telephone      service throughout much of the United States.       (8) According to the Comptroller General, the Commission      does not consider itself a health agency and turns to health      and radiation experts outside the Commission for guidance on      the issue of health effects of radio frequency exposure.       (9) The Federal Aviation Administration does not have the      authority to regulate the siting of personal wireless      telephone or broadcast transmission towers near airports or      high-volume air traffic areas such as corridors of airspace      or commonly used flyways. The Commission's proposed rules to      preempt State and local zoning and land-use restrictions for      the siting of such towers will have a serious negative impact      on aviation safety, airport capacity and investment, and the      efficient use of navigable airspace.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local      authority regarding the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless service towers and related      facilities as such limitations arise under section 332(c)(7)      of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).       (2) To permit State and local governments--       (A) in cases where the placement, construction, or      modification of personal wireless service telephone and      broadcast towers and other facilities is inconsistent with      State and local requirements or decisions, to require the use      of alternative telecommunication or broadcast technologies      when such alternative technologies are available; and       (B) to regulate the placement of such towers so that their      location or modification will not interfere with the safe and      efficient use of public airspace or otherwise compromise or      endanger public safety.     SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST                    TRANSMISSION AND OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS                    FACILITIES.       (a) Repeal of Limitations on Regulation of Personal      Wireless Facilities.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is      amended--       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that      follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not      unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally      equivalent services.'';       (2) by striking clause (iv);       (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and       (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``30 days after such      action or failure to act'' and inserting ``30 days after      exhaustion of any administrative remedies with respect to      such action or failure to act''; and       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the      following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to      place, construct, or modify a tower facility is a party, such      person shall bear the burden of proof.''.       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Preemption of      State and Local Authority Over Broadcast Transmission      Facilities.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the      Federal Communications Commission may not adopt as a final      rule the proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State and      Local Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement      and Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission      Facilities'', MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, 1997.       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and      Modification of Other Transmission Towers.--Part I of title      III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.)      is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 337. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF                    TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND BROADCAST TOWERS.       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      this Act, no provision of this Act may be interpreted to      authorize any person to place, construct, or modify a      broadcast tower or telecommunications tower in a manner that      is inconsistent with State or local law, or contrary to an      official decision of the appropriate State or local      government entity having authority to approve, license,      modify, or deny an application to place, construct, or modify      a tower, if alternate technology is capable of delivering the      broadcast or telecommunications signals without the use of a      tower.       ``(b) Authority Regarding Production of Safety Studies.--No      provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State      or local government from--       ``(1) requiring a person seeking authority to locate      telecommunications facilities or broadcast transmission      facilities within the jurisdiction of such government to      produce--       ``(A) environmental studies, engineering reports, or other      documentation of the compliance of such facilities with radio      frequency exposure limits established by the Commission; and       ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such facilities      with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety      standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects      effecting navigable airspace; or       ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to locate      such facilities within the jurisdiction of such government if      such person fails to produce any studies, reports, or      documentation required under paragraph (1).''.
