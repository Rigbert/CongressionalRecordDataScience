Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Speaker, we have heard an impassioned plea about civil rights. This is about civil rights for children. It is about protecting minors who cannot protect themselves from the sexual exploitation over the Internet.  There are some in this House that do not believe that wiretaps are proper at any time. I respect that position, even though I disagree with it. But I think we ought to make it clear in the legislative history of this bill that under the law, law enforcement is authorized to use a wiretap to intercept wire or electronic communications that may provide evidence of a crime under 18 U.S.C. section 2516, and that no wiretap, regardless of the crime that is being investigated, can legally be done in this country without a court order.  So that provides the protection against unmitigated, unrestrained surveillance by wiretaps of citizens by law enforcement.  This is a good bill. It is a bill that has bipartisan support. It is a bill that plugs a loophole in our present laws, and it ought to become the law of the United States of America. The House can do so by suspending the rules in just a few minutes, and I urge my colleagues to support this motion.
