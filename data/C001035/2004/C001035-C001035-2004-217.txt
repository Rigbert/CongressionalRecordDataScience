President, I am very pleased to inform our colleagues that, after working very closely with Senator Stevens, Senator Lieberman and I have agreed to a modification of his amendment that is acceptable to us.  The bill originally called for an effective date after enactment of 180 days. The amendment of Senator Stevens would retain that date but give the President the ability to extend for another 6 months for certain provisions of the bill. That is an acceptable compromise.  I thank the Senator from Alaska for working with the Senator from Connecticut and myself to reach this agreement. I want my colleagues to take note that we have accommodated the Senator's concern in this regard.
