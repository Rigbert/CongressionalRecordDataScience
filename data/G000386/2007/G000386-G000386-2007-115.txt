 President, it is with great admiration that today I recognize some of the most intelligent, driven young minds in this country. I would like to acknowledge the 17 recipients of the 2007 Davidson Fellows Award, a scholarship awarded to exceptional students to assist them in furthering their education. These scholarships are given by the Davidson Institute for Talent Development to inspiring individuals under the age of 18 who have completed academically rigorous projects that demonstrate a potential to make a significant, positive contribution to society. This year's recipients achieved academic excellence in the areas of science, literature, mathematics, technology, and music. As I read through the accomplishments these young minds have achieved, I can assure you that this year's recipients are more than deserving of such an honor. I would like to take a few moments to describe what each recipient has accomplished.  Richard Alt II, a 17-year-old from Fredericksburg, VA, has compared three weather forecasting methods to formulate a brandnew forecasting method. He has done this through detailed interpretation and analysis of varying aspects of climatology. Through his findings, Richard has created a universal process that allows meteorologists to compile more accurate forecast data and help public officials prepare seasonal response plans for various weather patterns.  Another 17-year-old from Vienna, VA, Christina Beasley has explored human perception and beauty in her portfolio, ``An Experiment in Free Speech.'' This young lady has compared emotion in famous literary works to her own pieces of writing to reveal the tucked away beauty of common occurrences. She has realized through careful research and interpretation that a person must make the connection between emotion and rationality to fully understand the intricacies of the human mind.  Sixteen-year-old Nate Bottman of Seattle, WA has found an array of solutions to the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation, NLS, that shows the pattern of waves in fluids and plasmas that have sharp boundaries and dissipation. Nate has developed a method of findingsolutions to integrable equations and has discovered that stationary solutions of the NLS are spectrally stable. His work will help in many areas of math and science, including but not limited to the study of Bose-Einstein condensates and plasma physics.  A young woman from Davis, CA, Alexandra Courtis, has developed an innovative method used in areas such as cancer research to track different biological functions via luminescent silicon nanorods and quantum dots. At just 17, she has developed a less expensive method of using sodium silicide and ammonium bromide that has made it possible to produce silicon nanoparticles on a larger scale. Alexandra's accomplishment is a significant advancement in targeting cancerous tumors and individual cells.  Billy Dorminy, a 15-year-old from McDonough, GA, has invented a secure method of message encryption using reduced redundancy representations of improper fractional bases. This new method of encryption takes up far less computer memory while also utilizing confusion and diffusion to keep a message hidden. Billy's method allows for the placement of a second undetectable encrypted message in the body of the first, opening the door for further advancement in the area of message encryption.  Another 15-year-old, Yale Fan, from Beaverton, OR, has furthered the binary quantum computational Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover algorithms to create multivalued logic problems. These two algorithms were among the first in the creation of a quantum computer. His work is relevant in many areas including the vision systems in computers, various economic issues, and aspects related to space, including transportation, scheduling, and manufacturing.  Madhavi Gavini, a 17-year-old from Starkville, MS, has developed an innovative method to restrict the augmentation of biofilm-forming pathogens. For example, Pseudomonas, a pathogen that is resistant to many drugs, produces a biofilm that protects it from antibiotics. This young woman's progress was done through the combination of traditional Indian medicine and molecular biology that will be used to treat millions dealing with Pseudomonas infections.  A 17-year-old from Bridgewater, NJ, Michael Harwick wrote a piece entitled ``Highways: The Road as Existence'' that utilized prose, poetry, and dialogue to depict relationships that oscillate between isolation and connection. Michael consistently astounds the reader with a unique voice filled with streams of symbolic and linguistic meaning. Through his choice of short dialog and extravagant descriptions of a visual world, he has shown the lack of dialog in a world filled with noise.  Todd Kramer, a 17-year-old from Port Jefferson, NY, produced a portfolio that followed his growth as a composer since he was 12 entitled ``Finding My Voice Through Music.'' He believes that each generation needs its musicians, composers, and performers that create artistic conventions that grow and mature with the times. This young man just graduated from the Juilliard Pre-College Division and is a student at the Perlman Music Program. He has performed in such prestigious places as Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center right here in Washington, DC.  Fifteen-year-old Shannon Lee of Plano, TX, is another very talented musician who believes that music is a cornerstone of communication, which she has shown through her violin portfolio, ``Creating a Musical Bond.'' Shannon specifically enjoys keeping tradition alive by playing a variety of distinguished composers to captivate her audiences. She earned the silver medal at the Stulberg International String Competition, and she received a scholarship from the Texas Commission on the Arts, where she also performed as a soloist in the Dallas Symphony.  Danielle Lent, a 17-year-old from Cedarhurst, NY, has developed an innovative, cost-effective, and earth-friendly method of recycling plastics. Her process involves the exposure of plastic polymers to supercritical carbon dioxide, creating a plastic that has equal or superior properties in comparison to the original. Miss Lent's discovery has allowed for this entire process to occur without releasing harmful toxins while also reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  A seventeen-year-old young woman from Wesley Chapel, FL, Celeste Lipkes, has transfixed her readers by exploring themes of disease, discovery, and faith in, ``Room to Pace.'' Her portfolio includes the juxtaposition of poetry that is amusing, intense, uplifting, and downright enjoyable with personal essays on physical loss and the oddities of the human family, and finally critical essays analyzing other poetry. Through her work, Celeste wants to inspire her audience to take notice of the details of life.  Yuqing Meng, a 16-year-old from Madison, NJ, feels privileged to contribute to the art of classical music, which he has shown through his piano portfolio, ``Reviving Classical Music Through Individualism.'' When he was just 7 years old, Yuqing was one of the youngest candidates ever to be accepted to the Juilliard School Pre-College Division, where he later went on to win the Junior and Senior Concerto Competitions. In 2007, he also received the Jack Kent Cooke Young Artist award.  Katherine Orazem, a 17-year-old from Ames, in my home State of Iowa, has written a collection of sonnets, short stories, and essays entitled ``After Elegies'' that delves into the human issue of death and examines those who have gone through loss. She looks at these issues from many perspectives, including the loss a widow must face, the denial of his wife's death by a husband, and the pain an apostate feels who has lost her faith. Through her work, we have come to understand the human condition and its variety of responses to death and loss.  A 15-year-old from Norristown, PA, Janet Song has created a urine test to detect the early signs of cancer. She has been able to isolate short circulatory DNA found in urine to identify tumor sites. Janet's new method has made cancer screening less unpleasant, less invasive, and cheaper than current methods.  Columbia, SC, native Graham Van Schaik has researched pyrethroids that are found in common household and garden pesticides. He even discovered that pyrethroids are used in over 30 commercial crops and have had the effect of cellular proliferation in breast cells, a sign of cancer and neurite retractions in neurons which is a sign of neurodegenerative disease.  Nora Xu, a 17-year-old from Naperville, IL, has developed a different method of determining the crystal structure of nanocrystalline superlattice thin films. Using a three dimensional model of the nanocrystalline superlattice, she found that x-ray scattering pattern intensities can be applied to molecules and atoms. Her work has potential in the area of optical and electron microscopes and the ability to deliver drugs to cancerous tumors.  Mr. President, these are 17 very talented, hard-working, motivated young men and women who are making advances in music, science, literature, mathematics, and technology for the betterment of society. I would like to thank all these young people for their willingness to seek out new horizons and make the world a better place. I would also like to personally thank the Davidson Institute for their support of these young individuals. In an ever-changing world, it is the young who show hope for the future. I can honestly say, after learning about every one of these kids, that I have great hope for the future.                          ____________________
