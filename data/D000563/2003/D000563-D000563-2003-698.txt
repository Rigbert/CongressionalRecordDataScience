There are three times as many long-term unemployed in America today--that is, those out of work for over 6 months--than when President George W. Bush took office. His economic plan has failed, and what we are hearing again is this vision that the way to help the unemployed, the way to help the working families is to give to Warren Buffett a $390 million tax break. It is a wide chasm of thought between the two sides of the aisle.  I would argue, for those who want to make up their mind, take a look at what happened to the President's last tax cut. It did not work. It provided some assistance for the wealthy, but it did not create jobs. It did not revive the economy. And this time the President says we need to rerun that play, we need to try it again and again at the expense of Social Security and Medicare.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, as we listen to people such as Warren Buffett talk about this issue, how would the Senator respond to our Republican critics who say: There you go again, class warfare; that is all you Democrats want to do, set the wealthy off against the people who are not so wealthy?  I ask the Senator from Nevada, in this coalition of the willing that we would put together in this class warfare, wouldn't we include an awful lot of people today who are struggling to make ends meet, a lot of seniors who face cuts in Social Security for their own benefits, a lot of people who do not have health insurance because their businesses cannot afford it? I suggest the coalition on our side of class warfare is a pretty broad one across America. I ask the Senator to respond.
