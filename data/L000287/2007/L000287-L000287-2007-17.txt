Madam Speaker, today we must override the President's veto because it is the right thing to do for our children.  We have a mission, an obligation, and a mandate to provide health insurance for all of the children and override the President's veto.  We can spend millions and billions of dollars on war, but we cannot take care of health care for our children? It would be a shame and a disgrace not to take care of the little children.  We must take care of the children. ``Suffer the little children.'' They need our help and they need it now. Override this veto.
