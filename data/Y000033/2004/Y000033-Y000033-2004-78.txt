Mr. Chairman, I will do the best I can. I have been here long enough to know when I am out of line; but when I am out of line, I am right.  In 1980, most of you were not here. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks) was here. We made an agreement. We said we could have logging in the Tongass. That was an agreement made by the environmentalists, made by those who proposed it; and we lost, as I said, over the years, 15,000 jobs. Members talk about outsourcing, Members talk about losing American jobs. What we are doing on this floor by the gentleman's amendment is taking the jobs away from the American people that live in this great Nation and this great State.  I am asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. It is ill thought, ill conceived and wrong totally. Where it came from I know. I am ashamed that somebody got in bed with those that advocated over the years of putting us out of business, the people. This is not about big timber. They are all gone. These are local people that need that timber to maintain those jobs, to make sure we have a different economy in southeast Alaska.  So I am asking my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this ill conceived, ill thought and very rude amendment.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. All time for debate on this amendment has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
