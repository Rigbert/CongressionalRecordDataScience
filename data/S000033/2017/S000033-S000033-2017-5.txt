 WYDEN. Right, that is correct. But there was not one single hearing with respect to the specifics of the bill.  I would like to turn, if I could, to this work that my colleague--and I am happy to have partnered with him--has played such an important role in; that is, the consequences of all this reckless haste and secretive process, which he and I have been working on. In my view, it is really is legislative malpractice. We have a bill that is full of mistakes that are going to have unintended consequences, opening many new loopholes for the wealthy and crafty accountants and lawyers.
