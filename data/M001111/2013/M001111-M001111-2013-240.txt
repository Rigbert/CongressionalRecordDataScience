 President, when Governor Christine Gregoire signed the Washington State marriage equality bill into law last year, it was a day of joy for all of the loving, committed LGBT couples of Washington--and for all who love, respect, and support them. And when voters approved the law in a referendum last November, we showed the Nation once again that we can change the course of history and give true voice and meaning to the idea that all are created equal. This law takes us one important step closer towards true equality for LGBT families across Washington State. It is proof of the incredible power a community can have when we come together to fight for equality. Washington is now 1 of 12 States to have affirmed the right for LGBT couples to marry--an amazing sign of progress in our Nation.  I am proud to work with my colleagues in the Senate to achieve equal rights for LGBT Americans in Washington State and across the country. Earlier this year, I joined 172 Members of the House of Representatives and 39 Senators in filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor, arguing the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional and should be struck down. And, as a senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I led a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki calling for an expedited waiver process to grant every same-sex spouse of a veteran burial rights in our national cemeteries.  There is much to celebrate today, but still so much more to be done to ensure equal rights for LGBT Americans. As we look back upon our recent victories, we must also recommit to our efforts and harness the energy we used to achieve marriage equality last year to continue this fight. From our immigration and employment laws to our policies for veterans and military families, there is still plenty of work to be done to ensure all Americans, including members of our LGBT community, are treated equally.  Equal protection under the law is a fundamental right in our country. No one should suffer discrimination because of their race, religion, national origin, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Whether applying for a job, finding a home, eating in a restaurant, seeking credit, serving in our military, or attending school, we must ensure all citizens are treated fairly and equally. To me, the fight for equality for the LGBT community is a fight for what it means to be American. That is why Pride Month is so important.  Each June, Pride Month brings our community together to honor diversity, equality, and love. And this year, we can celebrate some truly historic gains as LGBT couples are finally able to express their commitment to each other in the same way so many other Washingtonians have throughout our State's history--by joining in marriage and saying ``I do.''  Pride Month is a time to commemorate our accomplishments and recharge for the fight ahead. We have many more opportunities to advance our efforts in the coming months and years, and we will not give up until we haveachieved full equality under the law for all Washingtonians and all Americans. I wish to thank the countless organizations that have led us to the victories and accomplishments we celebrate in June. When we gather together in moments such as this, we speak with one unified voice for the cause of equality and give true meaning to our Founders' belief that all are created equal. I am proud to fight for the LGBT community in Washington and across the country, and I will continue to ensure the voices of LGBT Americans and their allies are heard in the United States Senate.                          ____________________
