Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  As she has said, this is the law. This is another attempt, another opportunity not to substantively legislate because this is already the law. This is an effort to kill this bill indirectly and without telling the public that that is what you are doing.  I am asking all of our Members to vote ``no'' on this. This is simply a procedural motion to kill this bill. If they wanted to add a substantive amendment, they could have done it. This was a modified open rule. All they had to do was file and notice it.  So I ask all of my colleagues, we are not going to go down this road and play this political game. We want to substantively legislate. We are going to vote ``no'' on this motion.
