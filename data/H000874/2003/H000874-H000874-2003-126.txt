Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the leader's comments, and I understand when we get down towards the end of the session you are not sure exactly how the business will flow and you have got to make decisions as that occurs.  I understand the week of October 6, which is I guess a week and a half from today, I hate to try to pin the gentleman down, but Members obviously are trying to figure out when they get requests in their districts to do things, whether or not that October 6 date, again because the Senate's going to be off, is a probable time that they may be able to work in the District or whether it is too problematic for them to make any kinds of plans. I yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. Let me just correct the gentleman. The week of October 6 is 2\1/2\ weeks from today, and I really believe that it is going to hinge on what the supplemental looks like and what the Committee on Appropriations thinks that their schedule might be in order to get the supplemental to the floor as quickly as possible, giving the Members every opportunity to look at the bill and participate in it.  My thinking is that if we can get that supplemental to the floor of the House by that week of October 6, we could very well be here voting on that supplemental.
