Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I rise today to honor the Holy Trinity Hungarian Church in East Chicago, Indiana, as the parish celebrates its 105th anniversary. On Saturday, September 24, 2011, a celebrated Mass will take place at Holy Trinity, which will be followed by a celebratory banquet to recognize this extraordinary occasion.  Around the turn of the 20th century, the Hungarian community in East Chicago, Indiana, with its deep religious traditions, embarked on a venture to start a church of its own. With this goal in mind, on July 4, 1904, a group of community members met in the home of Stephen Farkas on Alexander Avenue to discuss ideas for what would later become the Holy Trinity Hungarian Church. The cornerstone was laid for the first church building on November 11, 1906, followed by its dedication on the Feast of the Holy Trinity in 1907. The parish's first resident pastor, Father Oscar Szilagyi, arrived on Christmas Eve in 1907. Although regulations of the Religious Order prevented Father Szilagyi from remaining at the church for a longer period of time, he has the distinction of performing Holy Trinity's first marriage, baptism, and funeral. Sadly, this building, as well as a second church, were lost to fires, but through the faith, hard work, and dedication of its leaders and congregation, the present church was constructed and was dedicated on May 22, 1921. After the church was rebuilt, the parish continued to grow. In 1922, Holy Trinity opened the doors to a new school, providing a much needed service for young people in the community. By 1927, several organizations had also formed, including: the Holy Rosary Circle, Altar Society, Holy Name Society, Knights of Holy Trinity, Children of Mary, and Young Ladies Sodality.  Although Holy Trinity has faced its share of struggles, the collective faith of the clergy and parishioners, and their commitment to the church, has allowed the parish to reach many milestones during its 105-year history. In February of 1957, the Diocese of Gary was established, and Holy Trinity joined other area Catholic parishes in welcoming its first bishop, the Most Reverend Andrew G. Grutka. On July 10, 2004, Holy Trinity experienced the most prestigious event in its history when the church was honored with a visit from Peter Cardinal Erdo, Primate of Hungary.  Another extraordinary event took place on May 1, 2005, when the present pastor, Father Alphonse Skerl, celebrated his 50th anniversary of ordination to the priesthood. For the past forty years, Father Skerl has served the parishioners of Holy Trinity. Under the leadership of Father Skerl, and because of the dedication of the parish members, 2011 has been a year of two more historic milestones, the 90th anniversary of the present church and the 105th anniversary of the parish.  Mr. Speaker, Holy Trinity Hungarian Church offers an invaluable service to its parishioners and community, providing numerous opportunities for all to join together to experience its rich heritage. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the clergy and congregation Holy Trinity Hungarian Church as they celebrate their 105th Anniversary. Throughout the years, these fine individuals have provided spiritual guidance to their community while honoring and preserving their faith and the traditions of the Hungarian people. Their devotion is worthy of our deepest admiration, and I am proud to serve as their Representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
