President, I was following the procedure followed by the other side this morning of putting items in the Record without identifying them.  Why don't I read them all so there will be no question, if the Senator from Iowa does not mind waiting 20, 30, 40 minutes for me to do that, or if there is no objection, I will renew my request that the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund position statements regarding Mr. Estrada be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                For Immediate Release, January 27, 2003 Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund--Reissues Its Position  Statement Opposing the Nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the United       States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit       We previously expressed our strong opposition to the      candidacy of Miguel Estrada for a Judgeship on the D.C.      Circuit Court of Appeals. The hearing which Mr. Estrada was      given by the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2002 did      nothing to address our grave concerns about his fitness to      serve as an Appellate Judge. In fact, the hearing raised more      questions then it answered. Accordingly, we are reissuing our      position statement in strong opposition to Mr. Estrada's      nomination. In our review, it is clearly not in the best      interests of Hispanic Americans or for that matter all      Americans, to appoint an individual about whom there are      serious and for that matter unanswered doubts concerning his      ability to render justice in a fair and impartial manner.                                                Pierre M. LaRamee,     Executive Vice President.                                  ____                                       Reissued: January 27, 2003.Position Statement on the Nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the United       States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit                             I. background       On May 9, 2001, Miguel A. Estrada was nominated by      President George W. Bush to the United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court is      widely considered to be the second most powerful court in the      nation and traditionally has served as a launching pad for      judges to be appointed to the United States Supreme Court.      Mr. Estrada has been touted as the first Hispanic-American      nominated to the DC Circuit, and many believe that he is      being groomed to be the first Hispanic-American Supreme Court      Justice. Because of the tremendous importance of this      nomination to our nation's nearly 40 million Latinos, and to      all Americans in general, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense &      Education Fund (PRLDEF), has decided to take a position on      his nomination.       Since Mr. Estrada was nominated, PRLDEF has sought to learn      as much as it could about his background and qualifications      for the important, life-tenured position of Circuit Judge.      Because our offices are located seven blocks away from      ``Ground Zero'' in New York City, our diligent efforts were      interrupted by a six-month delay to mourn, reflect, and      recover after the tragic events of September 11. Thereafter,      we resumed our extensive examination of Mr. Estrada's history      and record. We reviewed his available writings, although such      writings are extremely limited. We conducted dozens of      interviews with individuals familiar with Mr. Estrada,      including those who have studied and worked with him as well      as those who have lived in the same communities with him. We      also surveyed all available news media reports and other      public materials concerning Mr. Estrada. Finally, we      interviewed Mr. Estrada himself.       As a national civil rights organization primarily concerned      with advancing and protecting the civil and human rights of      the Latino community and all Americans through litigation,      policy analysis, and education, we sought to answer several      questions in evaluating Mr. Estrada's nomination. First and      foremost, is Mr. Estrada sufficiently qualified? Second, are      or should Mr. Estrada's reportedly extreme views by      disqualifying? third, would Mr. Estrada's life experiences      bring to the D.C. Circuit the unique sensitivities and      perspectives of Hispanic-Americans? Finally, does Mr. Estrada      possess the proper judicial temperament required for appeals      court nominees?       For the reasons stated below, we believe that Mr. Estrada      is not sufficiently qualified; that his reportedly extreme      views should be disqualifying; that he has not had a      demonstrated interest in or any involvement with the      organized Hispanic community or Hispanic activities of any      kind; and that he lacks the maturity and judicial temperament      necessary to be a circuit court judge. Accordingly, we oppose      his nomination and urge the United States Senate Judiciary      Committee to reject his nomination.                 ii. concerns about his qualifications       While the positions Mr. Estrada has held and his      intellectual abilities may initially appear impressive, they      are neither as complete nor as impressive in depth and scope      as those of many others who have been or could be appointed      to the elevated position of Circuit Judge. Mr. Estrada seems      to us to have had insufficient experience for the position of      United States Circuit Judge, especially in the powerful D.C.      Circuit. His experience is not as extensive as that of others      who have been appointed to the federal appellate courts and      have had greater depth and breadth of experience.       Historically, both judicial experience and academic      experience have been given great weight in considering      nominations for circuit court judgeships. Perhaps most due to      his relatively young age of 39 when he was nominated,      however, Mr. Estrada had not had any judicial experience      whatsoever. Nor has he had any academic or teaching      experience. Much of his legal experience has been devoted to      handling criminal law matters. In addition, he simply has not      developed a sufficient record upon which one could fairly      evaluate his positions, fairness and reasoning skills.       Traditionally, the written record from either scholarly      works or judicial opinions has historically served as the      best basis upon which candidates for appellate courts have      been evaluated. Where a written record does not exist, life      experiences and activities have been relied upon to help      measure fairness and reasoning skills. Mr. Estrada's record      provides a wholly inadequate basis upon which to conclude      that he can be a fair and impartial court judge. This is      especially relevant and important given the fact that a     number of his colleagues have said unequivocally that Mr.      Estrada has expressed extreme views that they believe to      be outside the mainstream of legal and political thought.      Unfortunately, we could not fully test these strong      impressions against Mr. Estrada's very limited record. If      Mr. Estrada first served as a district court judge or in      another judicial capacity, we would have a much more      complete record upon which to assess his later nomination      to the court of appeals.                     iii. concerns about his views       Despite the absence of a written record of Mr. Estrada's      views, concerns over whether Mr. Estrada could impartially      serve on an appellate court have been heightened because      individuals who have worked with and even supervised him have      both privately and publicly stated that he is an ideologue      with extremely strong ideological views, and would have      difficulty keeping those views from affecting his judgment      when deciding cases as an appellate judge. He has reportedly      made strong statements that have been interpreted as hostile      to criminal defendants' rights, affirmative action and      women's rights. Additionally, he has clearly chosen to be      actively engaged principally with ideological causes and      organizations, such as the Federalist Society and the Center      for the Community Interest. Members of these groups have been      outspoken on the issues we believe are of concern to      minorities, the very groups Mr. Estrada should be sensitive      to. It is also particularly noteworthy that some of the most      ideologically extreme organizations in our nation have      endorsed his nomination.       Because of Mr. Estrada's very limited written record,      coupled with his refusal to answer detailed questions about      his ideological views, the public and private reports of his      extreme ideological views were not effectively rebutted, and      should therefore be disqualifying.       The Senate Judiciary Committee asked Mr. Estrada to provide      information on the ten most significant litigated matters      that he personally handled and whether he had played any role      in a political campaign. Curiously, Mr. Estrada failed to      include two important activities in his response. He      neglected to mention that he participated in the preparation      of a brief in the Bush v. Gore election recount litigation,      and that he served on the Bush Department of Justice      Transition Team.       When questioned on whether the Supreme Court has hired      enough minority law clerks, Mr. Estrada's response was ``if      there was some reason for underrepresentation, it would be      something to look into . . . but I don't have any reason to      think it's anything other than a reflection of trends in      society.'' He said that he does not know whether he has been      a beneficiary of affirmative action or not. He explained      that he may be for or against affirmative action depending      upon the particular issues at hand.       Bush Administration supporters of Mr. Estrada tout his      nomination by stressing that he is the first Hispanic to be      nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and could      become the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice. This      ``Hispanic'' touting is at odds with Mr. Estrada's clearly      expressed desire to be judged only ``on the merits.'' Mr.      Estrada's views on the ethnic dimension of his candidacy      notwithstanding, it is clear that the Bush Administration      fully intends this to be a ``Hispanic'' nomination to the      Court. This intent is what compels our interest in and      underscores both the importance of this nomination and the      relevance of this issue to the Hispanic community.            iv. concerns of the hispanic-american community       Of greatest concern to the Latino community is Mr.      Estrada's clear lack of any connection whatsoever to the      issues, needs, and concerns of the organized Hispanic      community. It is indeed ironic that someone promoted as a      Hispanic has neither shown any demonstrated interest in, nor      has had any involvement with many Hispanic organizations or      activities throughout his entire life in the United States.      Nor has he been involved with, supportive of, or responsive      to issues of concern to Latinos.       Some have attempted to portray his story as a compelling      one of a Hispanic who came to this country speaking little to      no English. In stark contrast with this story, however, the      reality is that Mr. Estrada appears to have come from a      privileged background and received English training and      education prior to his arrival in the United States. This      training enabled Mr. Estrada to participate fully in the      educational opportunities afforded to him in the United      States. As the son of a lawyer and a bank vice president who      had the resources to finance superior educational      opportunities for him, Mr. Estrada has not lived the      educationally or economically disadvantaged life his      proponents would have others believe. Nor have Mr. Estrada's      life experience resembled or been shared with those of      Latinos who have experienced discrimination or struggled with      poverty, indifference or unfairness.       Knowledge of people and of their aspirations for fairness      and justice should be possessed by all candidates for      judicial office. Mr. Estrada has lived a very different life      from that of most Latinos--a life isolated from their      experience and concerns. Once he made it, he both disappeared      from and never became connected or committed to the Hispanic      community. As a result, we believe that he lacks the      sensitivity and perspectives shared by the majority of      Hispanic-Americans in our country. During our interview with      him, he took offense at the view that he is disconnected from      the Hispanic community, but he countered those concerns      merely by asserting that he listens to Hispanic music and      reads Spanish language books. We believe that he is      disconnected from the real-world activities that would      enable him to contribute uniquely to the development of      the law and the enhancement of the administration of      justice, as have other Hispanics who have served as judges      before him.               V. CONCERNS ABOUT HIS JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT       We have serious concerns about Mr. Estrada's judicial      temperament. Simply put, he has been described as one who is      arrogant and elitist. It has been reported that he      ``harangues his colleagues'' and ``doesn't listen to other      people.'' We witnessed these qualities first-hand during our      interview.       Based largely on our personal observations, we now firmly      believe that Mr. Estrada lacks the maturity and temperament      that a candidate for high judicial office should possess. In      our view, he does not have the humility or the demeanor      typical of worthy nominees to our nation's federal bench. He      does not appear to us to be even-tempered. While Mr. Estrada      may have been understandably apprehensive about the      opportunity to meet with PRLDEF to allay its concerns, he was      surprisingly contentious, confrontational, aggressive and      even offensive in his verbal exchanges with us.       He made several inappropriately judgmental and immature      comments about PRLDEF. He characterized some of PRLDEF's      president's comments as ``boneheaded.'' He indicated that      were it not for his quasi-public status as a judicial      nominee, our comments might otherwise be actionable. He      stated that we ``had probably already made up [our] minds to      oppose his nomination because the person [we] had supported      had lost the presidential election.'' In fact. PRLDEF had not      made up its mind nor had it endorsed any presidential      candidate. Mr. Estrada also made a fleeting reference to      ``[our] Democratic senator friends on the Hill.'' In fact,      PRLDEF has Republican senator friends on the Hill as well. He      also challenged PRLDEF's board chair on how [we] could say      that ``there is a strong consensus among Hispanic attorneys      and Hispanics in general that they do not want to see a      Hispanic Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.''                             VI. conclusion       For all of the above reasons, we strongly believe that Mr.      Estrada's nomination should be opposed and rejected.      Potential nominees who aspire to such important positions as      circuit judges should be better qualified and possess the      unquestioned ability to be fair, open-minded and committed to      equal justice for all Americans. They should be connected to      the real-world concerns of the people who will be governed by      their decisions. They should also be even-tempered. In our      view, Mr. Estrada clearly does not possess the qualities      necessary to be placed in such an important position of      trust--for a lifetime--interpreting and guarding the rights      of ordinary Americans.
