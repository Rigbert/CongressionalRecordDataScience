Mr. Speaker, today, I am reintroducing legislation that would add a rare form of cancer, bronchiolo-alveolar pulmonary carcinoma, to the list of cancers that are presumed to be service-connected for veterans who were exposed to radiation, in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 100-321.  The merits of adding bronchiolo-alveolar pulmonary carcinoma to the list of cancers that are presumed to be service-connected for veterans who were exposed to radiation during their military service were pointed out to me in 1986 when I became acquainted with Joan McCarthy, a constituent from New Jersey. Mrs. McCarthy has worked tirelessly for many years to locate other ``atomic veterans'' and their windows and she founded the New Jersey Association of Atomic Veterans.  Joan's husband, Tom McCarthy, was a participant in Operation Wigwam, a nuclear test in May of 1995 which involved an underwater detonation of a 30-kiloton plutonium bomb in the Pacific Ocean, about 500 miles southwest of San Diego.  Tom served as a navigator on the U.S.S. McKinley, one of the ships assigned to observe the Operation Wigwam test. The detonation of the nuclear weapon broke the surface of the water, creating a giant wave and bathing the area with a radioactive mist. Government reports indicate that the entire test area was awash with the airborne products of the detonation. The spray from the explosion was described in the official government reports as an ``insidious hazard which turned into an invisible radioactive aerosol.'' Tom spent 4 days in this environment while serving aboard the U.S.S. McKinley.  In April of 1981, at the age of 44, Tom McCarthy died of a rare form of lung cancer, bronchiolo-alveolar pulmonary carcinoma. This illness is a nonsmoking related lung cancer which is remarkable given the fact that nearly 97 percent of all lung cancers are related to smoking. On his deathbed, Tom told Joan, his wife, about his involvement in Operation Wigwam and wondered about the fate of the other men who were also stationed on the U.S.S. McKinley and on other ships.  Mr. Speaker, it has been well documented in medical literature that exposure to ionizing radiation can cause this particular type of lethal cancer. The National Research Council cited Department of Energy studies in the BEIR V (Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) reports, stating that ``Bronchiolo-Alveolar Carcinoma is the most common cause of delayed death from inhaled plutonium 239.'' The BEIR V report notes that this cancer is caused by the inhalation and deposition of alpha-emitting plutonium particles in the lungs.  Mr. Speaker, the Department of Veterans Affairs has also acknowledged the clear linkage between this ailment and radiation exposure. In May of 1994, Secretary Jesse Brown wrote to then Chairman Sonny Montgomery of the Veterans' Affairs Committee regarding this issue. Secretary Brown stated as follows:       The Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards      considered the issue of the radiogenicity of bronchiolo-     alveolar carcinoma and advised me that, in their opinion,      this form of lung cancer may be associated with exposure to      ionizing radiation. They commented that the association with      exposure to ionizing radiation and lung cancer has been      strengthened by such evidence as the 1988 report of the      United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic      Radiation, the 1990 report of the National Academy of      Sciences' Committee the Biological Effects of Ionizing      Radiation (the BEIR V Report), and the 1991 report of the      International Committee on Radiation Protection. The Advisory      Committee went on to state that when it had recommended that      lung cancer be accepted as a radiogenic cancer, it was      intended to include most forms of lung cancer, including      bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma.  Back in 1995, I met with former Secretary Brown and he assured me that the VA would not oppose Congress taking action to add this disease to the presumptive list. Notwithstanding this fact, however, the VA has repeatedly denied Joan McCarthy's claims for survivor's benefits.  The VA has claimed in the past that adjudication on a case-by-case basis is the appropriate means of resolving these claims. Unfortunately, the practical experiences of claimants reveal deep flaws in the process used by the VA.  Mr. Speaker, I believe the widows of our servicemen who participated in these nuclear tests deserve better than this. They should not be required to meet an impossible standard of proof in order to receive DIC benefits, which CBO estimates will cost the government, on average, a mere $10 thousand a year for each affected widow.  As many of my colleagues will remember, this legislation was passed on the floor of the House on October 14, 1998 by a vote of 400 to 0. Unfortunately, our colleagues in the Senate failed to take up this legislation before Congress' adjournment. During the 104th Congress, the House passed H.R. 368, identical legislation to the bill we are considering today. It too added bronchiolo-alveolar pulmonary carcinoma to the list of cancers that are presumed to be service-connected for veterans who were exposed to radiation. H.R. 368 was later included as part of H.R. 3673, an omnibus veterans' package which passed the House on July 16, 1996. Unfortunately, this provision was dropped from the final conference report.  They say that the third time is the charm so I remain hopeful and determined that my introduction of this legislation today will result in its speedy consideration in the House and approval in the Senate. I would also like to thank my colleague, Congressman Lane Evans from Illinois, the ranking democrat on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, who is joining me today as an original cosponsor of this legislation. His tireless work on behalf of ``atomic veterans,'' and those who have suffered as a result of exposure to radiation while serving our country is to be commended and I thank him for his support of my legislation.                          ____________________
