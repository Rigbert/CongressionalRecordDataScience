Speaker, I thank the Chair for recognizing me on the point of order.  Mr. Speaker, this amendment is offered for the purpose, as it says, of limiting all late-term abortions, of prohibiting all late-term abortions, including abortions to which the gentleman spoke. We believe it does in fact expand upon but is inclusive of the procedures to which the gentleman's bill speaks. We believe it is an effort and an opportunity for the Congress to say that not only the late-term partial birth to which the bill speaks but that all procedures to effect late-term abortions ought to be prohibited. They ought to be prohibited as the policy of the United States of America.  It does provide, as does the underlying bill, with certain exceptions: The life of the mother, as is consistent with the bill on the floor. It also expands upon that to say serious adverse health consequences as well.  We believe in that context and, frankly, got an initial judgment as it was offered in the Committee on the Judiciary that this amendment was believed initially to be in order.  We believed that initial judgment was in fact correct. We believed this gives an opportunity for Members not only to speak to the instant issue raised by the particular 1122 bill, but also importantly gives to Members the opportunity to express their view that all late-term abortions, not just one procedure, but that procedure and all procedures to effect post-viability abortions be outlawed, be illegal, be against the policy of the United States of America, except in very limited circumstances.  Because of that, Mr. Speaker, Members will have the opportunity to express themselves as being against late-term abortions, which is the context, I suggest to the Speaker, in which this debate has occurred and proceeded.  Because of that, this gives Members the opportunity to particularly but more broadly, as Mr. Canady did in fact correctly observe, express themselves on limiting all procedures for late-term abortions.  For that reason, we think it expands upon, he is correct, expands upon and makes more broad the prohibition on late-term abortions. It is for that reason that we think it critically important that the Chair rule that this is in fact in order so that Members can appropriately--because we believe it to be in order--express themselves in opposition to late-term abortions.                              {time}  1500
