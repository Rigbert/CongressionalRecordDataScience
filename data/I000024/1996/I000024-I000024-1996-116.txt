President, I have been sitting in on this debate, and I have been presiding during part of the time. There are some things that I think should be said at this point that have not been said so far that would be appropriate.  It is shocking, it seems to me, the issue of raising taxes is a partisan issue. I mean, if you look at the way that the debate is going, those on the Democratic side are trying to raise taxes.  I reread a statement that was made by Laura Tyson who is the chief economic adviser to the President of the United States. I am going to quote it right now into the Record.       There is no relationship between the level of taxes a      nation pays and its economic performance.  If you really believe that, then it is understandable why we are having the discussion that we are having today. But the difference in the way we treat our attitude toward taxes, between the Democrats and the Republicans, is incontrovertible.  In the 103d Congress, under a Democrat-controlled Congress, they had the ``largest single tax increase in the history of public finance in America or any place in the world.'' That is a direct quote from Patrick Moynihan who at that time was the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
