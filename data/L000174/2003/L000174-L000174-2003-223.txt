President, I am pleased to introduce today, with my respected colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, the Farm-to-Cafeteria Projects Act of 2003. This important bipartisan proposal will support grassroots efforts all across our Nation to bring school cafeterias and local farms together.  It is amazing how many kids do not know where the food that they eat comes from. It is also amazing how far some farm products travel to get to the cafeteria table. The Farm-to-Cafeteria Projects Act of 2003 will establish a U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, grant program to help schools connect children with local farms by bringing fresh local foods to their cafeterias and by implementing hands-on nutrition education programs.  Communities all across our Nation are beginning to explore the concept of linking farms and cafeterias. In my home State of Vermont, from rural towns like Jay and Westfield to the city of Burlington, schools have experimented with how they can integrate the daily service of school meals with classroom learning and local agriculture. And as more schools create these connections, more and more want to learn how they too can start a program. Oftentimes these are very small schools, which do not have the staff or money to kick off a project on their own. With just a little money and some technical assistance, these schools can create a program that teaches kids about good nutrition, shows them the importance of agriculture, and supports local farms by keeping food dollars within the community. In introducing The Farm-to-Cafeteria Projects Act of 2003, Senator Specter and I seek to provide these communities with the assistance they need to get such school and farm partnerships off the ground. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this exciting initiative, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1755       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
