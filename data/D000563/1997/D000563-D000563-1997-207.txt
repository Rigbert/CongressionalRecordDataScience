President, I rise today to recognize the people of Bloomington-Normal, IL, for their efforts to stem the growth of hate crimes and racial intolerance. Their commitment to taking proactive measures to prevent division and promote understanding serves as a model for communities across the Nation.  Inspired by the film ``Not in Our Town,'' which tells the story of how Billings, MT, joined together in response to rampant hate crimes, the citizens of Bloomington-Normal created their own ``Not in Our Town'' program. They were not, however, responding to hate crimes or clear racial unrest. Instead, these Twin Cities chose to create a vehicle for awareness and prevention, to stop hate crimes before they started. This type of program is without a doubt ahead of its time.  Designed to increase public knowledge about the threat of racial violence, the program is carried out in a variety of ways. Adult and youth discussions and forums are regularly held. All city entrances are marked with ``no racism'' signs. Many city workers wear ``Not in Our Town'' buttons, and all city vehicles are marked with ``Not in Our Town'' bumper stickers. Clearly, it's difficult to be in Bloomington-Normal without knowing that prejudice and violence will not be accepted. In addition to these efforts, the city has also sponsored two anti-racism marches, which give citizens the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to the program and its goals not only to each other, but to surrounding communities as well.  Perhaps most vital to the program's success are its youth discussion groups. As one teen noted, ``History is going to repeat itself if the youth aren't taught about the Holocaust and slavery * * * they won't know any better.'' ``Not in Our Town'' provides young people a way to learn how local events are part of national issues, and more importantly, how community action can really make a difference for people everywhere.  As President Clinton begins a new initiative to have a national conversation about race and diversity, Bloomington-Normal has truly taken the lead in providing a model that all Americans can follow when organizing their home towns to discuss and confront what is perhaps our most important issue.                          ____________________
