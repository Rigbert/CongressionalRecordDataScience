 President, many times in the last several months, I have addressed my colleagues in this Chamber on the subject of the bad accounting system in the Defense Department and particularly the subject of unmatched disbursements, a subject that involves the principle that if you are going to spend the taxpayers' money, you ought to be able to show exactly what that money went for.  The Defense Department has accumulated several billions of dollars over the last several years in money that has been spent. It is very difficult for them or anybody else to show exactly what that money has bought: A service or commodity.  So the unmatched disbursement problem at the Pentagon has been a problem that has been simmering on the back burner for several years. Now, all of a sudden, it is on the front burner, and the pot is boiling over.  The Department of Defense is getting hammered with bad publicity about this problem. Most of the heat is directed at the Defense Department's chief financial officer, Mr. John Hamre. He is fighting back, countering with damage control, sending letters and papers to allies on the Hill. He is trying to debunk all the criticism being directed his way.  As I have said many times, I think that Mr. Hamre is trying to do a good job. I think his heart is in the right place, but career bureaucrats under him are feeding him bad information.  In a nutshell, Mr. President, this is the problem: The Department of Defense does not match disbursements with obligations before making payments. Unless the matches are made, [[Page S8459]] then we do not know how the money is being spent. Of course, this leaves the Department of Defense accounts vulnerable to theft and abuse.  DOD accounts are vulnerable to the tune of at least $28 billion. Those are not my numbers, those are the Department of Defense numbers. Mr. Hamre is desperately trying to diffuse all the criticism. Mr. Hamre says that my arguments that I have been stating on the floor over the last several months are baloney. He says the Department has, in his words, ``certified receipts for every penny spent.''  Mr. President, he said that in his latest rebuttal, and his rebuttal appears on page A15 of the June 10, 1995, Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent to print that article in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, June 10, 1995]                    Pentagon Spending: by the Books                           (By John J. Hamre)       Colman McCarthy's May 23 column ``The Pentagon's      Accountability Problem'' so badly distorts my statements on      Department of Defense financial management that the record      must be corrected.       McCarthy implies that I am a naive dupe absolving      government workers and defense contractors of any financial      responsibility. He further suggests that our reform efforts      are merely verbal smokescreens to mask business as usual.      Nothing could be farther from the truth.       It is clear McCarthy did not attend the May 16      congressional hearing on which he bases his column. Had he      been there he would have learned that not a penny of taxpayer      dollars has been ``lost,'' as his article implies--since the      crux of the matter is not ``phantom payments'' but outmoded      accounting procedures.       For every disbursement he characterizes as lost, we have a      validated receipt with an independent confirmation that the      government received the goods and services. He also would      have learned that in the past 18 months we researched and      correctly accounted for $20 billion in problem disbursements      inherited from a decade of defense spending. He would have      learned that during the same time period we also froze more      than 20,000 payments to more than 1,500 contractors until we      could correct underlying accounting problems.       He would have learned that we are reversing a 25-year-old      ``pay first, account later'' policy. Beginning this summer,      we will match disbursements to accounting records--not just      against valid, certified invoices as we do now--before      payments are made. And he would have learned that we created      a special financial fraud detection organization.       Unfortunately none of this was reported by McCarthy, and I      am unaware of any effort on his part to attempt to gather the      facts.       The public has every right to know the extent of the      Pentagon's accounting problems, as well as the efforts in      place to remedy them. Your readers deserve far better than      McCarthy provided.
