Mr. Speaker, just to point out during markup, and this was extraordinary, at least four Members came forward to speak as the gentleman from Texas just pointed out, his father-in-law, the gentleman from Mississippi, his dad, and so many others. Few battles have touched more people than the Battle of the Bulge. The gentleman from Arizona's uncle also fought. He is a combat veteran himself, but his uncle fought at the Battle of the Bulge, was there.  And Joe McNulty, one of our key staffers on the majority side, he just came up and whispered to me that his father got the purple heart, was wounded in both legs. There are few battles that have touched more people and few battles that have done more to save freedom and liberty than the Battle of the Bulge. It is amazing how many people in this Chamber have relatives and close relatives and perhaps themselves actually fought in that very, very famous battle.
