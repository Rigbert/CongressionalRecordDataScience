It does not. It does not do that at all. It changes no provision in it at all.  The PSLRA did not establish the current statute of limitations. It did not deal with that issue at all. The Leahy bill does not impact on these provisions. It was a 5-to-4 Supreme Court case that overturned years of established law to set the current limitation periods in Lampf v. Gilbertson.  In fact, interestingly enough, former Secretary General Kenneth Starr and I take the same position on these statutes of limitations. In the dissent in that case, two of the dissenters, Justices Kennedy and O'Connor, said the one in three statute of limitation makes the possibility of injured investors recovering basically a dead letter.  Here are some numbers. Florida lost $335 million because of Enron; the University of California, $144 million--all the way down to Vermont; we lost millions of dollars. These are people who would like, in these kinds of cases, at least to have a statute of limitations such that we can go after them.  We are not suggesting changing in any way--I want everybody to be clear on this--we are not suggesting changing the basic standards of the law on a statute of limitation. We are talking about extending the time. We are talking about extending the time so it will not be, as the Supreme Court said, with a short statute of limitations, a dead letter. We are saying we want enough of a statute of limitation--still very short but a long enough one so people can recover. We are perfectly willing to have exactly the same words as the law says now, with the exception the statute is slightly longer.  I cannot speak for an activist Supreme Court that seems to be meddling in most of our laws, but their case law, their stare decisis impacts on every single Federal court in this country--district level, court of appeals level. So there, with the exact same law, the stare decisis is Lampf v. Gilbertson. That would be controlling except it would be a longer statute of limitations.  The Senator from Texas, or anybody else, if they think that statute of limitations is too long, fine, vote against it. But I am here to try to protect people and give them an opportunity--when there has been such enormous fraud and all the pension funds have been lost, and all the people who have lost their life savings--give them at least some chance to recover something, especially as the executives of these companies walk off with tens of millions of dollars. We go two-five instead of one-three.  It makes sense to me. That was negotiated and voted on in the Judiciary Committee, and the final bill was passed unanimously.
