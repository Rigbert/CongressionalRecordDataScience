President, the nomination of Keith Starrett of Mississippi is strongly supported by Senator Lott and Senator Cochran. Judge Starrett is nominated to a vacancy on the Southern District of Mississippi created when the President ignored the Senate's withholding of its consent and unilaterally appointed Judge Charles Pickering to the Fifth Circuit.  With this nomination, President Bush forfeited another opportunity tobe a uniter and to draw the country together. I understand the concerns of so many African-American organizations and lawyers who continue to ask the President to begin to achieve some diversity on that bench by the nomination and appointment of a qualified African American. The Magnolia Bar Association, a primarily African-American bar association in Mississippi, has written the Senate in connection with this nomination. The Magnolia Bar's president, Crystal Wise Martin, expresses the group's strong opposition to proceeding with Judge Starrett's nomination, not only because it is so late in the session but also because, as she writes: ``[I]t fails to remedy the egregious problem concerning the lack of diversity on Mississippi's federal bench.'' She points out that Mississippi has the highest percentage of African Americans of any State, but that Mississippi has had only one African-American Federal judge. She explains that the Magnolia Bar and the National Bar Association have both made direct requests to the President that he appoint an African American to fill this important vacancy.  During the consideration of Charles Pickering's nomination, reports were that Republicans were indicating that they would advocate for an African-American nominee if some African Americans would support Judge Pickering's elevation to a higher court. The administration has chosen not to fulfill those hopes by proceeding with a qualified African-American nominee for this important judgeship.  This President has shown where his priorities are by nominating more lawyers affiliated with the Federalist Society than qualified African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans combined.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter from the Magnolia Bar Association be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      Magnolia Bar                                            Association, Inc.,                                   Jackson, MS, September 6, 2004.     Senator Orrin Hatch,     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Dirksen Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Senate Dirksen          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: Founded in 1955 by less than      ten black lawyers with several purposes including advancing      the science of jurisprudence and promoting reform in the law,      the Magnolia Bar Association can now boast that it has more      than four hundred African-American and white members who      practice across Mississippi and many states throughout      America. Our members are engaged in every form of practice      just as other members of the Mississippi Bar. We are      prosecutors, criminal defense attorneys, plaintiff attorneys,      defense attorneys, and we are administrative lawyers. Our      ranks also include attorneys who specialize in domestic      relations and commercial litigation. Simply put, we do it      all. We practice in state, federal and tribal courts. The      Magnolia Bar is represented on every court in Mississippi      except the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. We are proud of      what we do, and we are committed to our profession. I,      Crystal Wise Martin, am indeed honored to serve as its      president.       We are strongly opposed to the Senate's consideration of      the nomination of Keith Starrett to the Southern District of      Mississippi so late in this Administration's term. We      understand there is a longstanding and well-respected      practice of the Senate Judiciary Committee to withhold      consideration of controversial federal judicial nominations      by the fall of an election year. We see no reason to deviate      from this tradition in the case of the Starrett nomination.       The Starrett nomination is particularly untimely. President      Bush only nominated Keith Starrett on July 7 of this year, to      fill the seat vacated by Charles Pickering upon his recess      appointment to the Fifth Circuit. Consideration of the      nomination at this point in an election year is simply      inappropriate. In Mississippi, absentee voting in the      Presidential election begins on September 20. Holding a      hearing on the nomination just twelve days before      Mississippians can cast their Presidential votes is simply      too late. Moreover, it is doubtful that Mr. Starrett could      even proceed through the Judiciary Committee before the      voting begins.       We know of no federal judicial nomination in recent history      in which the nomination was made so late in a Presidential      term and yet still received a hearing before the Judiciary      Committee in the fall of an election year. In the last      presidential election year of 2000, there were no hearings      whatsoever held in the fall. For example, when President      Clinton nominated Ricardo Morado to the district court in      Texas on May 11, 2000, Senators objected to the nomination as      occurring too late in an election year. Mr. Morado never      received a hearing.       Additionally, we strongly object to the Starrett nomination      because it fails to remedy the egregious problem concerning      the lack of diversity on Mississippi's federal bench.      Mississippi has the highest percentage of African Americans      of any state in the country. Yet Mississippi has had only one      African American federal judge--ever. Judge Henry Wingate,      who holds this distinction, was appointed nearly twenty years      ago.       Earlier this year, the Magnolia Bar Association made a      direct plea to President Bush to rectify this lack of      diversity. In a letter dated February 2, we urge President      Bush to appoint an African American to the Southern District      of Mississippi. We wrote that the ``appointment of an African      American . . . is long overdue.'' We set forth the history of      the lack of appointments, and concluded there was a      ``compelling case'' for the appointment. We noted the      existence of hundreds of African American lawyers in the      State and the representation we have been able to achieve on      our State and local bench. We offered to consult with the      President about the numerous candidates who exist for a      federal court position. The National Bar Association, the      nationwide organization of African American lawyers, made a      similar request this year, directed specifically to the      vacancy in the Southern District of Mississippi.       Moreover many members of the African American community in      Mississippi were led to believe that an African American      would receive the nomination to fill Judge Charles      Pickering's district court seat. Judge Pickering's      supporters, including but not limited to his son,      Representative Chip Pickering, were express about their      intentions to bring about the nomination of an African      American should Judge Pickering be elevated. These      representations are well documented in the press. The      Washington Post reported that ``Chip Pickering confirmed that      he has also been telling prominent African Americans in the      state that if his father is promoted to the appeals court,      his replacement on the district court will likely be an      [African American nominee].'' (``Judge's Fate Could Turn on      1994 Case,'' Washington Post, May 27, 1993). The Clarion-     Ledger from Jackson, Mississippi referred to Congressman      Pickering's representations in an article entitled,      ``Pickering Vows to Push Diversity.'' (Clarion-Ledger, May      28, 2003).       President Bush has refused to heed our requests. Despite      having four opportunities, he has not nominated one African      American to the federal bench in Mississippi. During his      term, President Bush has nominated three persons to the      federal district court in Mississippi and one person from      Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. None are      African American. We deplore this Administration's record on      diversity in judicial appointments in Mississippi.       The failure to diversify Mississippi's federal bench is      just one example of the lack of diversity in this      Administration's judicial appointments generally. In four      years, President Bush has appointed only 11 African Americans      to district court seats anywhere in the country. These 11      appointments constitute only less than seven percent of the      total of 162 district court appointments. This stands in      stark contrast to the record of President Bush's predecessor.      In his first term, President Clinton appointed 33 African      Americans out of 170 district court appointments, or almost      twenty percent. In his second term, President Clinton      appointed 20 African Americans out of 137 district court      appointments, or fourteen percent. The Magnolia Bar      Association strongly believes we should be advancing in      African American representation on the federal bench, not      retreating.       For all of these reasons, we urge you to refrain from      considering the Starett nomination at this late date. Thank      you.           Respectfully yours,                                              Crystal Wise Martin,                                                        President.
