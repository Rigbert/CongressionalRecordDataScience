 President, this legislation which has passed the Senate today is a great bipartisan success. I am thankful to my colleagues for their support and willingness to work together in order to do this for the workers, farmers and companies of this country.  I would first like to thank Senators Gramm and Breaux and their staff for helping to make this final vote possible. If it were not for their help in brokering a deal, we may not have reached this point today.  I would also like to thank Senator Baucus and his excellent staff for all the hard work and dedication which has gone into this bill over the past year. I want to specifically thank Mike Evans and John Angell as well as the trade staff--Greg Mastel, Tim Punke, Ted Posner, Angela Marshall-Hoffman, Shara Aranoff, and Andy Harig. I appreciate their willingness to work with my staff to accomplish so much.  I would also like to thank Polly Craighill of the Office of Senate Legislative Counsel, for her hard work, and great expertise in drafting this bill.  Finally, I would like to thank my staff, beginning with my Finance Committee staff director, Kolan Davis and my trade counsels Everett Eissenstat and Richard Chriss, who have worked tirelessly to bring this bill to fruition. I credit them with much of today's success. It was their hard work, along with the help of Carrie Clark and Tiffany McCullen-Atwell, that helped us to this point.  I look forward to a productive conference, and swift passage of the conference report, so we can get this to the President's desk, and enacted into law.
