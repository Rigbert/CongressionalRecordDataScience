  As part of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002, the Committee mandated that not less than $14,541,000 be used solely to address the many deficiencies that the IG found with the Coast Guard's readiness in the area of Search and Rescue. We also mandated that the Inspector General monitor the Coast Guard's compliance with this directive.  While the Inspector General's office has not yet finalized its report, I am greatly concerned by preliminary indications that the Coast Guard did not, I repeat ``not fulfill the requirement in the law. This is precisely the kind of concern that makes it essential that we continue to monitor the Coast Guard's compliance with Appropriations Committee directives as well aswith Section 888 of the Homeland Security Act. Again, I commend your leadership in this area and look forward to working with you and Admiral Collins, the Commandant, on these issues in the future.  I also want to thank the Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee again for his foresight and leadership in the efforts to create the Department of Homeland Security.
