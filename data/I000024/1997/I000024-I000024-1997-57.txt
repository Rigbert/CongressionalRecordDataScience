President, my amendment would provide $2,225,000 to establish a demonstration project to assist persons with disabilities due to the loss of a limb to return to work.  According to a 1996 GAO report on SSA disability programs, ``[r]eturn-to-work strategies and practices may hold the potential for improving federal disability programs by helping people with disabilities return to productive activity in the workplace and at the same time reduce program costs.''  The GAO report goes on to note that the three most important strategies to mainstream individuals back into the work force are: intervene as soon as possible; identify and provide necessary return-to-work assistance; and structure benefits to encourage people to return to work.  Using these GAO suggestions as a guide, I have attempted to address the medical, rehabilitative, and job training needs of individuals who have lost their limbs.  Experience has shown that for people who have lost limbs, access to appropriate medical rehabilitation can mean the difference between prolonged dependence and a successful return to the work place. Due to advancement in modern rehabilitation medicine, persons who experience limb loss can now routinely expect to attain high levels of independence and functionality.  Over the last several years, I have worked with Limbs for Life Foundation which provides financial help to amputees nationwide. As a result of my association with them, I have observedthat a significant percentage of people who lose limbs do not return to the work force and subsequently become dependent on Social Security's Supplemental Security Income [SSI] and Disability Insurance [DI] programs. A leading cause for this dependence has been the inability to gain access to appropriate rehabilitation care.  According to the Social Security Administration, less than half of 1 percent of Social Security beneficiaries return to work. Yet, they also estimate that as many as 3 out of 10 persons on disability may be good candidates for return to work but the system does not encourage it.  I believe this partial due to the Social Security Administration's process for determining disability which does not generally assess the individuals functional capacity to work, but rather presumes that certain medical conditions are in themselves sufficient to preclude work. However, the link between medical condition and work incapacity is weak. While there are certainly some medical impairments which prevent individuals from working, others factors such as vocational, psychological, economic, environmental, and motivational are often more important determinants of work capacity.  My proposed demonstration program will result in a better rate of return to work because it will provide people with the tools needed to successfully overcome many of the impediments which have traditionally held them back from main streaming into the work place.  Specifically, by providing appropriate prosthetic and rehabilitation services, followed by an intensive regimen of occupational therapy the demonstration program will prepare amputees to meet the physical demands of the work place. Practical assistance such as job training and job placement are also critical for successful main streaming and would be a part of the program.  Not only will we be helping people who want to work, but will more effectively spend our limited disability money. The Social Security Administration's estimates that lifetime cash benefits are reduced by $60,000 when an individual receiving Disability Insurance returns to work; $30,000 when an individual receiving Supplemental Security Income returns to work.  The Limbs for Life Foundation has estimated that they could provide services for 775 individuals with the proposed $2,225,000 demonstration program. Under their proposal, this money would be combined with the Foundation's own funds and services and result in a net savings of $9 million.  Mr. President, I believe this is a sound investment and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.                           amendment no. 1106  (Purpose: Provide for additional Security Administration continuing     disability reviews as authorized by cap adjustment legislation)       On page 71, line 23, strike ``$245,000,000'' and insert in      lieu thereof: $290,000,000.
