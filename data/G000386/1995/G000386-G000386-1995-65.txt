 President, I rise today to introduce an amendment, on behalf of myself and Senator Kyl, that would stop a wasteful Government practice that has received a lot of press attention lately and has drawn sharp criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union. Mr. President, the practice I am talking about is taxpayer-funded travel by Federal judges to so-called judicial conferences. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I am concerned about the budgetary propriety of continuing current practice with regard to judicial conferences in this new era of balanced budgets and streamlined Government.  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. The first article is entitled ``Taxpayers Foot the Bill for Judges to Meet at Resort'' and the second is entitled ``Times Are Tight, But Circuit Isn't.''
