The Senator from Oklahoma brought up a very important point. It is very burdensome recordkeeping for small businesses to have to deal with depreciation schedules and sometimes very unrealistic recovery periods.  For example, most computers are required to be depreciated over a 5-year period, but we all know from our experience that the usual life of a computer is 2 to 3 years. The Senator from Oklahoma has raised an important point. Not only will this put more cash into the pockets of small businesses andallow them to go ahead with investments that have been put on hold because of this tax incentive, but it will also relieve them from some very burdensome recordkeeping requirements. That simplification is another advantage of the Bond-Collins amendment.  I thank my colleague from Missouri who does such a great job as the ranking minority member of the Senate Small Business Committee. It has been a great pleasure to work with him on this amendment. I believe this is the one provision we have debated that will make a real difference to those entrepreneurs throughout our country, to those small mom-and-pop firms that are creating good jobs in communities throughout our country. So I hope we will have a strong show of support for this amendment.
