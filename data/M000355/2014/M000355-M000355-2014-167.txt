 President, therefore, I propose a different unanimous consent agreement. I ask unanimous consent that the only amendments in order be five amendments from the Republican side related to energy policy with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each amendment. I further ask that following the disposition of these amendments, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.
