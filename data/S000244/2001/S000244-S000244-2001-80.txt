Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time, and I rise today to explain that I will be voting in favor of the Patriot Act of 2001.  Previously, I was one of three Republicans to cast a ``no'' vote on the bill, but I believe that the addition of the money laundering provisions of this bill are a great addition to the bill and certainly enhance the ability of law enforcement to do what they need to do. Also, the provision of sunset for 4 years, which the Senate includes no sunset, but the 4-year provision is a good provision.  I intend to vote for the bill and I appreciate the kind of provisions that have been added to make this a much better bill. I thank the chairman for the opportunity to express my support.
