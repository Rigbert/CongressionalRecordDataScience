Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise in strong support of this legislation. The Palo Alto battlefield in Brownsville, Texas is the site of the second battle of the U.S. War with Mexico. During the battle, American forces drove Mexican troops back across the Rio Grande River. This bill adds 34 acres to the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site and provides for a cooperative agreement under which the Brownsville Community Foundation and the National Park Service would co-manage this land that is owned by the foundation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
