It fell far short of the mark.  They stated the basis of their proposal is the theory ``the financial system failed to perform its function as a reducer and redistributor of risk.'' Let me repeat that. Their fundamental principle is ``the financial system failed to perform its function as a reducer and redistributor of risk.'' They then advised the President to use that idea as the basis of what he proposes.  I beg to disagree. The purpose our financial system should be to assure sound credit. A financial system should be structured to promote responsible lending and responsible savings practices. We have seen the result of a financial system that lost its way and traveled down the road of high risk-taking with other people's money, a system with no boundaries, no accountability and inherently unstable.  Securitization and risk were at the heart of that failed system. Have we learned nothing? Securitization may spread out risk, but it does not spread out damage when it fails. We see that clearly enough today.  Who on Wall Street who led the charge on high risk-taking is suffering today? They are getting bonuses. I cannot say that for those Americans who are losing their jobs, their homes and their businesses.  Enshrining securitization and risk at the heart of their proposal is absolutely the wrong end of the road to be starting at. Securitization has nothing to do with sound credit. Securitization removes the connection between the lender and the borrower. It does nothing to assure sound credit, nor encourage savings and prudent lending. The lender sells the loan, and they are done. What does the lender care if the profit has been made? They don't.  We don't need more securitization, more credit default swaps, more derivatives and more obligations that are hedged so many times that no one can even find them.  The financial regulatory reforms the administration released this week do not restore prudent financial behavior. That is what is necessary to lead us out of this economic darkness. America needs a credit system that is safe and sound, not risky and not overleveraged.  Yesterday in The New York Times, and I will place this article in the Record, Joe Nocera said that if President Obama wants to create regulatory reform that will last for decades, he needs to do what Roosevelt did. ``He is going to have to make some bankers,'' and I would add security dealers, ``mad.''  But why are Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers protecting Wall Street? To date, the executive branch has been barking about the too-big-to-fail institutions. But the best they have done is nip at the edges of real reform and fixing what is wrong. Did AIG teach us nothing? An institution that is too big to fail is too big to exist.  Wall Street's bailout taught banks exactly the wrong lesson. It taught them, be reckless. The U.S. Government will make sure you do not take a hit. Just keep your campaign contributions rolling our way.  Take a look at derivatives in their proposal. Why only regulate normal boring derivatives when the derivatives that got us here are the exotic ones that are being protected from regulation? Do we need yet another credit default swap debacle to teach us that every derivative needs to be regulated in a transparent way and over the counter? Didn't the President campaign on transparency? Isn't the best disinfectant sunshine? Let the sun shine too on the Federal Reserve.  Do you know that the Federal Reserve is responsible for regulating mortgage lending? But did the Federal Reserve act when the FBI warned in 2004 that the subprime mortgage fraud could become an epidemic? No. So if the FBI warned an epidemic was ahead on something that the Federal Reserve regulated and the Federal Reserve failed to act, what makes us think that they can actually regulate anything, and why should we give them more power, which the administration proposal does?  Many more questions need to be asked about financial regulatory reform. We should not rubber-stamp the administration's first idea. Our people want a sound credit system. We should ask for no less.  The first goal of our banking system, as opposed to a securities system, should be to create a safe and sound credit system, one that promotes responsible savings and lending practices. Prudent financial behavior by individuals and institutions should be its primary purpose. The administration's priorities tell me they plan a much larger role for higher-risk securities in whatever system they are envisioning, which to me threatens higher-risk behavior.  Banks traditionally have served as intermediaries between people who have money--depositors--and those who need money--borrowers. The banks' value-added was their ability to loan money sensibly and manage and collect the loans. Securitization broke down that system. The banks didn't much care about making sensible loans as long as they could sell them. The regulators didn't stay on top of it because they foolishly thought the banks had gotten the loans off their balance sheets and the chickens would not come home to roost.               [From The Washington Post, June 15, 2009]                       A New Financial Foundation               (By Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers)       Over the past two years, we have faced the most severe      financial crisis since the Great Depression. The financial      system failed to perform its function as a reducer and      distributor of risk. Instead, it magnified risks,      precipitating an economic contraction that has hurt families      and businesses around the world.       We have taken extraordinary measures to help put America on      a path to recovery. But it is not enough to simply repair the      damage. The economic pain felt by ordinary Americans is a      daily reminder that, even as we labor toward recovery, we      must begin today to build the foundation for a stronger and      safer system.       This current financial crisis had many causes. It had its      roots in the global imbalance in saving and consumption, in      the widespread use of poorly understood financial      instruments, in shortsightedness and excessive leverage at      financial institutions. But it was also the product of basic      failures in financial supervision and regulation.       Our framework for financial regulation is riddled with      gaps, weaknesses and jurisdictional overlaps, and suffers      from an outdated conception of financial risk. In recent      years, the pace of innovation in the financial sector has      outstripped the pace of regulatory modernization, leaving      entire markets and market participants largely unregulated.       That is why, this week--at the president's direction, and      after months of consultation     with Congress, regulators, business and consumer groups,      academics and experts--the administration will put forward a      plan to modernize financial regulation and supervision. The      goal is to create a more stable regulatory regime that is      flexible and effective; that is able to secure the benefits      of financial innovation while guarding the system against its      own excess.       In developing its proposals, the administration has focused      on five key problems in our existing regulatory regime--     problems that, we believe, played a direct role in producing      or magnifying the current crisis.       First, existing regulation focuses on the safety and      soundness of individual institutions but not the stability of      the system as a whole. As a result, institutions were not      required to maintain sufficient capital or liquidity to keep      them safe in times of system-wide stress. In a world in which      the troubles of a few large firms can put the entire system      at risk, that approach is insufficient.       The administration's proposal will address that problem by      raising capital and liquidity requirements for all      institutions, with more stringent requirements for the      largest and most interconnected firms. In addition, all      large, interconnected firms whose failure could threaten      the stability of the system will be subject to      consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, and we      will establish a council of regulators with broader      coordinating responsibility across the financial system.       Second, the structure of the financial system has shifted,      with dramatic growth in financial activity outside the      traditional banking system, such as in the market for asset-     backed securities. In theory, securitization should serve to      reduce credit risk by spreading it more widely. But by      breaking the direct link between borrowers and lenders,      securitization led to an erosion of lending standards,      resulting in a market failure that fed the housing boom and      deepened the housing bust.       The administration's plan will impose robust reporting      requirements on the issuers of asset-backed securities;      reduce investors' and regulators' reliance on credit-rating      agencies; and, perhaps most significant, require the      originator, sponsor or broker of a securitization to retain a      financial interest in its performance.       The plan also calls for harmonizing the regulation of      futures and securities, and for more robust safeguards of      payment and settlement systems and strong oversight of ``over      the counter'' derivatives. All derivatives contracts will be      subject to regulation, all derivatives dealers subject to      supervision, and regulators will be empowered to enforce      rules against manipulation and abuse.       Third, our current regulatory regime does not offer      adequate protections to consumers and investors. Weak      consumer protections against subprime mortgage lending bear      significant responsibility for the financial crisis. The      crisis, in turn, revealed the inadequacy of consumer      protections across a wide range of financial products--from      credit cards to annuities.       Building on the recent measures taken to fight predatory      lending and unfair practices in the credit card industry, the      administration will offer a stronger framework for consumer      and investor protection across the board.       Fourth, the federal government does not have the tools it      needs to contain and manage financial crises. Relying on the      Federal Reserve's lending authority to avert the disorderly      failure of nonbank financial firms, while essential in this      crisis, is not an appropriate or effective solution in the      long term.       To address this problem, we will establish a resolution      mechanism that allows for the orderly resolution of any      financial holding company whose failure might threaten the      stability of the financial system. This authority will be      available only in extraordinary circumstances, but it will      help ensure that the government is no longer forced to choose      between bailouts and financial collapse.       Fifth, and finally, we live in a globalized world, and the      actions we take here at home--no matter how smart and sound--     will have little effect if we fail to raise international      standards along with our own. We will lead the effort to      improve regulation and supervision around the world.       The discussion here presents only a brief preview of the      administration's forthcoming proposals. Some people will say      that this is not the time to debate the future of financial      regulation, that this debate should wait until the crisis is      fully behind us. Such critics misunderstand the nature of the      challenges we face. Like all financial crises, the current      crisis is a crisis of confidence and trust. Reassuring the      American people that our financial system will be better      controlled is critical to our economic recovery.       By restoring the public's trust in our financial system,      the administration's reforms will allow the financial system      to play its most important function: transforming the      earnings and savings of workers into the loans that help      families buy homes and cars, help parents send kids to      college, and help entrepreneurs build their businesses. Now      is the time to act.                                       ____                [From the New York Times, June 18, 2009]    Talking Business--Only a Hint of Roosevelt in Financial Overhaul                            (By Joe Nocera)       Three quarters of a century ago, President Franklin      Roosevelt earned the undying enmity of Wall Street when he      used his enormous popularity to push through a series of      radical regulatory reforms that completely changed the norms      of the financial industry.       Wall Street hated the reforms, of course, but Roosevelt      didn't care. Wall Street and the financial industry had      engaged in practices they shouldn't have, and had helped lead      the country into the Great Depression. Those practices had to      be stopped. To the president, that's all that mattered.       On Wednesday, President Obama unveiled what he described as      ``a sweeping overhaul of the financial regulatory system, a      transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that      followed the Great Depression.''       In terms of the sheer number of proposals, outlined in an      88-page document the administration released on Tuesday, that      is undoubtedly true. But in terms of the scope and breadth of      the Obama plan--and more important, in terms of its overall      effect on Wall Street's modus operandi--it's not even close      to what Roosevelt accomplished during the Great Depression.       Rather, the Obama plan is little more than an attempt to      stick some new regulatory fingers into a very leaky financial      rather than rebuild the dam itself. Without question, the      latter would be more difficult, more contentious and probably      more expensive. But it would also have more lasting value.       On the surface, there was no area of the financial industry      the plan didn't touch. ``I was impressed by the real estate      it covered,'' said Daniel Alpert, the managing partner of      Westwood Capital. The president's proposal addresses      derivatives, mortgages, capital, and even, in the wake of the      American International Group fiasco, insurance companies.      Among other things, it would give new regulatory powers to      the Federal Reserve, create a new agency to help protect      consumers of financial products, and make derivative-trading      more transparent. It would give the government the power to      take over large bank holding companies or troubled investment      banks--powers it doesn't have now--and would force banks to      hold onto some of the mortgage-backed securities they create      and sell to investors.       But it's what the plan doesn't do that is most notable.       Take, for instance, the handful of banks that are ``too big      to fail''--and which, in some cases, the government has had      to spend tens of billions of dollars propping up. In a recent      speech in China, the former Federal Reserve chairman--and      current Obama adviser--Paul Volcker called on the government      to limit the functions of any financial institution, like the      big banks, that will always be reliant on the taxpayer should      they get into trouble. Why, for instance, should they be      allowed to trade for their own account--reaping huge profits      and bonuses if they succeed--if the government has to bail      them out if they make big mistakes, Mr. Volcker asked.       Many experts, even at the Federal Reserve, think that the      country should not allow banks to become too big to fail.      Some of them suggest specific economic disincentives to      prevent growing too big and requirements that would break      them up before reaching that point.       Yet the Obama plan accepts the notion of ``too big to      fail''--in the plan those institutions are labeled ``Tier 1      Financial Holding Companies''--and proposes to regulate them      more ``robustly.'' The idea of creating either market      incentives or regulation that would effectively make banking      safe and boring--and push risk-taking to institutions that      are not too big to fail--isn't even broached.       Or take derivatives. The Obama plan calls for plain vanilla      derivatives to be traded on an exchange. But standard, plain      vanilla derivatives are not what caused so much trouble for      the world's financial system. Rather it was the so-called      bespoke derivatives--customized, one-of-a-kind products that      generated enormous profits for institutions like A.I.G. that      created them, and, in the end, generated enormous damage to      the financial system. For these derivatives, the Treasury      Department merely wants to set up a clearinghouse so that      their price and trading activity can be more readily seen.      But it doesn't attempt to diminish the use of these bespoke      derivatives.       ``Derivatives should have to trade on an exchange in order      to have lower capital requirements,'' said Ari Bergmann, a      managing principal with Penso Capital Markets. Mr. Bergmann      also thought that another way to restrict the bespoke      derivatives would be to strip them of their exemption from      the antigambling statutes. In a recent article in The      Financial Times, George Soros, the financier, wrote that      ``regulators ought to insist that derivatives be homogeneous,      standardized and transparent.'' Under the Obama plan,      however, customized derivatives will remain an important part      of the financial system.       Everywhere you look in the plan, you see the same thing:      additional regulation on the margin, but nothing that amounts      to a true overhaul. The new bank supervisor, for instance, is      really nothing more than two smaller agencies combined into      one. The plans calls for new regulations aimed at the ratings      agencies, but offers nothing that would suggest radical      revamping.       The plan places enormous trust in the judgment of the      Federal Reserve--trust that critics say has not really been      borne out by its actions during the Internet and housing      bubbles. Firms will have to put up a little more capital, and      deal with a little more oversight, but once the financial      crisis is     over, it will, in all likelihood, be back to business as      usual.       The regulatory structure erected by Roosevelt during the      Great Depression--including the creation of the Securities      and Exchange Commission, the establishment of serious banking      oversight, the guaranteeing of bank deposits and the passage      of the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated banking from      investment banking--lasted six decades before they started to      crumble in the 1990s. In retrospect, it would be hard to      envision even the best-constructed regulation lasting more      than that. If Mr. Obama hopes to create a regulatory      environment that stands for another six decades, he is going      to have to do what Roosevelt did once upon a time. He is      going to have make some bankers mad.                          ____________________
