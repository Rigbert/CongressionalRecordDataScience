 President, this morning we have set aside some debate time in executive session for the consideration of Renee Bumb to be U.S. district judge for New Jersey. Following those statements, we will vote at around 10:20 a.m. on the confirmation of that nomination.  Immediately after the vote, we will resume debate on the motion to proceed to the Marriage Protection Amendment. We reserved blocks of time throughout the session for Members to come to the Senate to give their remarks on the marriage amendment.  The Senate will recess, as usual on Tuesdays, from 12:30 to 2:15 for our weekly policy luncheons.  I remind our colleagues, I filed a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the Marriage Protection Amendment. That vote will occur on Wednesday. Later today, we will alert all Members as to the precise timing of that cloture vote on the marriage amendment which, as I indicated, will occur Wednesday.                          ____________________[Page S5435]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
