Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Bill Number: H.R. 2638, Air Force, RDT, Line 221, PE# 0708611F (Support Systems Development).  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Biomass Energy Systems, Inc., 100 Overlook Center, 2nd Floor, Princeton, NJ 08540.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: This project is underway to introduce alternative energy sources based on locally available resources for the USDOD and in Alaska. The Air Force, APTO, Eielson AFB and BESI have forged an alliance to create an alternative energy source program to be implemented in Alaska. The program consists of three phases. First, an integrated waste to energy system consisting of waste gasification, gas cleanup, and a gas engine to convert waste-based fuel gas to electricity will be demonstrated using wood waste and other locally generated wastes will be located at Eielson AFB in Fairbanks, AK. After the testing is complete and any modifications are identified, the gasification system will be relocated to a local village, to demonstrate the system in a typical local setting as a backup source of power. After testing the system under local conditions is completed, the system will be integrated in parallel with the existing petroleum-based system. Initially the system will operate as backup for the existing system with a gradual change over to a primary role. This provides a practical model of sustainable renewable energy for the USDOD facilities, as well as the Alaskan villages.  Description of matching funds: BESI is currently under contract to the U.S. Air Force, APTO to deliver a final design for a 1MW system for Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.  This is a Congressionally funded project from FY 07 and the contract is worth $848,040.00.  Appropriated Amount: $2,400,000.  Project Name: Eielson Air Force Base Alternative Energy Source Program.

Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Army Battle Command Battle Laboratory, Mr. Jason Denno, Deputy Director, Ft. Huachuca AZ 85613.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: (BRAMA-E) is a critical decision and training aid for commanders and operators to use in support of military operations on urbanized terrain (MOUT). BRAMA is an integrated collection, planning, and course of action system. It integrates existing U.S. Army developed blast modeling software with a state of the art 4D (Lat, Long, Alt, and Time) visualization front end. It is used by the Army to simulate blast analysis and vulnerability assessments.  BRAMA provides decision support for anti-terrorism/force protection (AT/FP) and critical infrastructure protection (CIP). BRAMA is a royalty-free tool and requires minimal training. It leverages previous U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force--force/facility protection R efforts. Starting in 2007, the BRAMA capability--along with training--has been provided to active duty Army, Homeland Security and National Guard representatives from 7 states. The U.S. Army CONOPS for Force Protection highlights the need for a Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) tool. Additionally, user feedback post-delivery on BRAMA specifically asks for enhancements on the speed at which facility data can be generated and visualized. Research conducted by the Army in 2006 and 2007 has identified a candidate commercial technology that can be integrated into the BRAMA baseline to meet the CONOPS and speed up the collection process.  BRAMA has demonstrated its usefulness to commanders, planners, and security forces by employing full-dimensional display technology to visualize, analyze and remediate blast effects generated by DoD-approved blast models. BRAMA-E will extend that capability by simplifying the ease of use and helping the Army meet its goal to field a unit level Capabilities Based Assessment (CBA) tool.  Description of matching funds: Not Applicable.  Appropriated Amount: $800,000.  Project Name: Blast and Damage Assessment Risk Analysis and Mitigation Application--Enhancements (BRAMA-E).

Bill Number: H.R. 2638, Army, RDT, 999 Classified Programs.  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark: Battle Command Battle Lab, Mr. Jason Denno, Deputy Director, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613.  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: The Constant Look system is a prototype biometric sensing capability developed for the U.S. Army to support MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain). Its unique standoff capability gives users an ability to support surveillance and special operations remotely. User comments from several demonstration tests included requests for enhancements to improve usability and extend the capability of the system in terms of what can be collected The Constant Look Operational Support Environment (CLOSE) will provide that additional functionality by leveraging several proven off-the-shelf technologies--a standoff digital collection system and additional digital signal processing (DSP) to extract other types of biometric signatures.  The U.S. Army's ISR Battle Command Battle Lab at Fort Huachuca (BCBL-H) responding to user requests--has developed and tested a stand-off biometric sensor system that allows traditional and special operations units to conduct surveillance and identify potential hostiles from a safe distance with a low probability of detection. To date, the majority of the effort on Constant Look has focused on the core collection system technology and the user interface has not kept pace with available commercial technology. CLOSE will remedy that by leveraging millions of dollars in commercial investment and integrating that investment into the Constant Look baseline.  CLOSE will provide CL users with a rapid capability to collect and model surveillance target facilities, including ingress and egress, from the same standoff range as the CL collection system itself. Secondly it will extend the DSP capability resident within the CL baseline to extract other types of Indications and Warning (I) data.  Description of matching funds: Not Applicable.  Appropriated Amount: $1,600,000.  Project Name: Constant Look Operational Support Environment (CLOSE).
