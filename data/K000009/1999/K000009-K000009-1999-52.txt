Speaker, I thank the distinguished and able gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan), who is really fully admired by Members of this House for being here this evening, and our dear colleague, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) as well.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure to put some steel back into the spine of America and to help our beleaguered independent energy sector. Earlier this year, the House passed this legislation. It has been stalled over in the other body all this time. Unforgivable.  Now six more steel companies in our country, American jobs, have filed for bankruptcy. Over 6,000 jobs at stake in Alabama, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Utah, coast to coast, and more on the chopping block.  I think we are obligated to do what we can to provide help to this beleaguered set of industries in the United States of America, especially when they are so adversely impacted by imports from Japan, which has never opened its markets to us; Indonesia, not exactly the most Democratic place on the face of the earth.  So I rise in support of this bill, as I would have on the Chrysler loan bailout, in which every penny was paid back with interest.
