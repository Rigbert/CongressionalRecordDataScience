So underfunding BRAC MILCON by $3 billion, or even $1, sends a terrible message to our troops. It tears to shreds the bipartisan support involved with the BRAC process.  Isn't it ironic, I would say to the Senator from Texas, and to you, Mr. President, and to my colleagues, that at a time when many of our colleagues in the House and Senate are saying, bring the troops home now, and everybody wishes we could, these same colleagues in the House--again, either through ignorance or incompetence or politics--apparently do not think it is necessary to provide the facilities that will support these troops and their families.  There is no other option, I say to the Senator from Texas and to my colleagues. I urge the majority leader to support our troops and their families by allowing a vote on this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  I thank the Senator from Texas for yielding me this time for these many questions.
