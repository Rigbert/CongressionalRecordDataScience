 REID. I am happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. I think it is a problem on both sides of the aisle. I agree with the majority leader, we need to get going. I will give an example, what happened yesterday. Senator DeMint came down shortly after noonto offer his amendment, was prepared to accept a short time agreement, so we could have had a vote early in the afternoon. But in that particular instance, the problem was on the side of my good friend, the majority leader. We were unable to get a time agreement on Senator DeMint's amendment until almost the end of the afternoon because there was someone on that side of the aisle who wanted to offer a side-by-side. This has been sort of a bipartisan problem both the majority leader and myself have in getting this legislation going and getting votes up and handled. Yesterday, the dilemma was basically on his side. On our side, our hands are not entirely clean, either. We are trying to get amendments up.  I happen to agree with the majority leader, we ought to have a full day with plenty of amendments. We are working hard to get that done on our side.
