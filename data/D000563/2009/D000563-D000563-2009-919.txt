Today, we are considering a resolution to apologize for America's original sin--the sin of slavery.  By apologizing for the enslavement and racial segregation of African Americans, we take another important step toward racial healing and reconciliation. This measure follows similar apologies issued by the States of Alabama, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia, which have all recognized their role in sanctioning the evils of slavery and Jim Crow. While we cannot correct the brutality and dehumanization caused by these evils, we can acknowledge the vestiges of harm caused by that dark chapter in our history. We can accept responsibility.  I am proud that when my home State of Illinois entered the Union in 1818, the Illinois State Constitution contained the following provision: ``Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall hereafter be introduced into this state otherwise than for the punishment of crimes.''  Soon after the granting of statehood, proponents of slavery in Illinois moved for a constitutional convention to amend the Illinois Constitution to allow slavery.
