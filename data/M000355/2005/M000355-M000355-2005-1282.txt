 That is the way I voted. I believe that is the way he voted. That is the way the Senate ought to operate.That is a good model for how we ought to behave tomorrow. We will have a cloture vote on Justice Priscilla Owen. If the Senate wants to operate the way it used to, we will invoke cloture on Justice Owen and then give her the up-or-down vote which she richly deserves.  I yield the floor.
