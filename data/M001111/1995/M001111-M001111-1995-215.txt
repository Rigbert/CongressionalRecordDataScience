 President, I introduce legislation that grants a Jones Act waiver to the vessel Wolf Gang II. This vessel is owned by Robert L. Wolf, a Washington State resident who, after 30 years of service, retired in 1992 as a colonel in the U.S. Army.  After his retirement, Wolf decided to operate a charter boat business on Puget Sound and bought Wolf Gang II, a 1985 Bayliner 4518 motoryacht. Although Wolf can document the boat was built in the United States, he cannot verify all of the boat's previous owners were U.S. citizens. As a result, Wolf's boat fails to meet all of the requirements in the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, and he is unable to gain certification for coastwise trade.  I understand how frustrating this situation is for Mr. Wolf. He simply wants to run a charter boat business in the beautiful waters of Puget Sound, and he has waited 3 years for an exemption from the unintended consequences of the Jones Act. My bill addresses this complication and waives the Jones Act requirements so that Mr. Wolf can begin operating his charter business this year. I look forward to swift passage of this legislation, and I expect to see Barnacle Bob's Cruises operating soon.                                 ______      By
