Clair, Tom Jarboe, and Donald Cropp, founders of the St. Mary's Hurricane Relief Fund. That is the county in which I live.  Following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, these three men organized the St. Mary's Hurricane Relief Fund to help the victims of the storm in the small town of D'Iberville, Mississippi, located in the district of my friend, Congressman Gene Taylor.  This October, Joe, Tom and Don drove two tractor trailers stocked with needed school supplies, book bags and other goods the entire way to D'Iberville. These items were collected with the assistance of countless St. Mary's County businesses and volunteers. Literally, tens of thousands of dollars of contributions.  The Hurricane Relief Fund's work to help D'Iberville did not stop when they returned to St. Mary's County. Since their initial trip, the St. Mary's Hurricane Relief Fund has organized an Adopt A Kid Campaign to ensure that the children of D'Iberville had the resources that they needed, facilitated stationing a medical team in D'Iberville, sent educational supplies to Sacred Heart Catholic School, sent 80 first-aid kits to D'Iberville Health Care Clinic and worked to fulfill the needs of the community as requested by D'Iberville officials.  This December, Joe, Tom and Don organized another massive donation drive, Operation Mississippi Christmas, this time to ensure that no child in D'Iberville went without a present.  Last Friday, I visited with the organizers and a group of volunteers at a warehouse as they loaded two additional tractor trailers bound for D'Iberville. That is four tractor trailers for these young people. I am proud I was able to participate in this noble effort by donating hundreds of duffle bags filled with gifts.  When the trucks left for the gulf coast on Saturday morning, they were loaded with more than just presents, and included among their cargo were 200 book bags loaded with school supplies, 50 additional first-aid kits, cases of needed medical supplies for the D'Iberville clinic, quilts donated by the local Amish community, bicycles, hundreds of duffle bags, 35 complete computer systems with printers, cables, et cetera, all donated by SmartCo, defibrillator batteries and a charger donated by St. Mary's Hospital, a critical item for the medical clinic, and 1,160 Wal-Mart gift cards for the upper middle and high school students.  On Sunday afternoon, the trucks rolled into D'Iberville, completing the approximately 16 hours and 1,000 mile journey.  On Monday, D'Iberville Elementary School held a pizza party as the presents were handed out and the goods distributed to the grateful community. At the end of the day, I received a call from the group indicating they had accomplished their mission of handing something to every school child, every school child in D'Iberville.  St. Mary's Hurricane Relief Fund has organized an amazingly successful relief effort, and I applaud its hard work. I would like to personally and publicly thank you, Joe St. Clair, Joe Cropp, Tom Jarboe, Guy Curley, Reggie Townsend, Ann Raley, Vince Whittles, the St. Mary's Chamber of Commerce, Father John Ball and the St. Mary's Trinity Episcopal Parish, Technology Security Associates, Larry Wise and the folks at BAE Systems, Bo Bailey and his son Tony for driving the trucks, and the hundreds of additional contributors, volunteers and businesses that contributed St. Mary's Hurricane Relief Fund's drive to help D'Iberville, Mississippi.  I am proud that my constituents, realizing that they are part of a community bigger than St. Mary's County, have sought to help our neighbors in Mississippi during their time of need. Their efforts surely for us all symbolize the true meaning of compassion, and I think it sets a great example of giving in this holiday season.  Joe St. Clair and Don tell the story of the children and their eyes gleaming as they received these gifts. Joe St. Clair, a crusty businessman about 55 years of age, telling me the story had tears flowing down his cheeks.  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of acrimony on this floor too often, and too often we forget to remember our neighbors and our friends. This is an example of the best that is America.                          ____________________[Page H11868]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                ST.
