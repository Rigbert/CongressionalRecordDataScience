 President, I rise today to honor Father Edward Randall on the occasion of his Golden Jubilee and in recognition of 20 years of priesthood in Letcher County.  During Father Randall's 20 years in Letcher County, he has served at both St. George Catholic Church in Jenkins and Holy Angels Catholic Church in McRoberts. People throughout the community have come to know Father Randall for his dedication to parishioners and generosity to everyone, both inside and outside the Church walls.  The Letcher County community also boasts of Father Randall's artistic talent, which he graciously uses to enhance church buildings and to teach free art classes open for all to attend. Father Randall also helped establish, along with the late Mother Teresa, an order of the Sisters of Charity in Jenkins, which will endure as an honor to his philanthropic contributions.  Father Randall continues to display an unswerving commitment to his parishioners and possesses the love and respect of many in the community. Those who know him in Letcher County describe him as a man with great strength of character who demonstrates honesty and integrity, and who serves as a role-model to young and old alike.  I am certain that the legacy of commitment to faith that Father Randall has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire those who follow. Congratulations, Father Randall, on 50 years of priesthood and 20 years of service to Letcher County. Best wishes for many more years of service, and know that your efforts to better the lives of your parishioners and those in Letcher County will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others.                          ____________________
