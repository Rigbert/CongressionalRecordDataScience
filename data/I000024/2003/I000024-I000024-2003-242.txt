President, I publicly thank the administration for being responsive to the concerns of Senator Breaux and myself. I know it took real courage to pursue the NSR reforms. It took courage because the President knew that many people would misconstrue these reforms as a ``sneak attack on the environment'' in an attempt to score cheap political points and fundraise.  Despite the rhetoric we will hear today and have heard today about NSR reforms and the process of developing these reforms, make no mistake: President Bush's decision will result in a cleaner environment and greater energy security.  The Clinton administration developed draft proposals and accumulated over 130,000 pages of comments on NSR reform. In fact, on his last day at work on January 19, 2001, President Clinton's air chief with the EPA, Bob Perciasepe, wrote a letter, No. 1, outlining NSR reforms which are similar to the Bush administration's NSR reforms and which are almost identical and, No. 2, calling for the Bush administration to consider finalizing the reforms.  At this point in the presentation, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                U.S. Environmental                                            Protection Agency,                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2001.       Memorandum on the Status of the New Source Review      Improvement Rulemaking:       Over the last two years we have all worked hard to develop      improvements to the New Source Review (NSR) program. As I      have discussed with you, I believe it is essential that this      program have greater incentives for companies to employ the      most effective emission reduction techniques voluntarily and      give greater flexibility when companies take these voluntary      actions. I am writing to share with you where we are on the      NSR Improvement effort as I leave this office.       We have come a long way together in developing the      conceptual framework for how EPA can improve the NSR program      by providing greater certainty and flexibility for industry      without sacrificing the level of environmental benefit      provided by the current program or meaningful public      participation. Due to the array of policy and legal issues      that arose on the vast number of areas we attempted to tackle      in one very large rulemaking, we were not able to complete      the regulatory/packages in this Administration. The concepts      that we developed make both economic and environmental sense      because in return for environmental performance, industry      will receive greater flexibility and more certainty for      business investment decisions. The concepts would not      undercut the basic goals of the NSR program.       The concepts that we developed and which I support are      listed below. I believe many of these could be taken as final      actions because of the hard work we have done together.       Voluntary Alternative NSR Program for the Electric Power      Generating Industry.--This voluntary program would allow      owners of power plants to commit to specific, verifiable      emissions reductions across all their generating units over a      defined period     of time and in most instances would avoid the need to get an      NSR permit when making changes at their facilities.       Plantwide Applicability Limits (PALs.--Source owners would      be able to make changes to their facilities without obtaining      a major NSR permit, provided their emissions do not exceed      the plantwide cap. Also, facility owners that use PALs must      commit to install best controls over time to gain this      flexibility and certainty. PALs would be especially      attractive to those industries (e.g., pharmaceuticals and      electronics) who need to make changes quickly to respond to      market demands in order to stay competitive in a global      marketplace;       Clarifications of Roles, Responsibilities and Time Frames      for Class I Area Reviews.--The process for review of permit      applications by Federal Land Managers (FLMs) would be      clarified to delineate the roles of the source owner, the      permitting authority and the FLM, in conducting permit      reviews for sources potentially affecting air quality near      national wilderness areas and parks (Federal Class I areas).      These changes would reduce delays and disputes associated      with permitting applications for sources near Federal Class I      areas because they would provide a time frame for the FLM to      identify any concerns and analyses needed for the permit      applications. Also, it would clarify that the FLM does not      have the authority to veto permits, and ensure that the FLM      obtains the necessary information to conduct their permit      reviews in a timely manner;       Clean Unit Exemption.--This exemption would provide an      incentive for source owners to install the best emission      controls on new or modified emission units and provide      flexibility and certainty so that most future changes at such      units would not trigger NSR. An owner of an emissions unit      that meets certain minimum criteria to be considered      ``clean'' could make most changes to these units without      triggering NSR for a specified period of time, such as ten      years.       Innovative Control Technology Waiver.--This waiver would      provide more flexibility for owners of sources who risk      trying innovative technology that have not yet been proven      effective. Should the innovative technologies not perform up      to expectations, we would provide the owners with time either      to correct the efficiencies or alternatively apply a more      standard control technology;       Pollution Control Project Exclusion.--This would codify our      existing policy that owners of facilities making changes to      their plants that primarily reduce one or more targeted air      pollutants (but which collaterally increase other pollutants)      are excluded from NSR provided certain conditions are met. We      would provide a list of environmentally beneficial      technologies that, absent other information that would      indicate that the projects would not be environmentally      beneficial, would be presumptively eligible for the      exclusion; and       Control Technology Review Requirements.--Because disputes      arise over what control technologies are considered      available, the permit review process can become lengthy. To      improve the process for obtaining a permit, we would (1) add      a definition of ``demonstrated in practice,'' (2) provide a      ``cut off'' date for consideration of additional control      technologies, (3) add provisions that specify when      applications are deemed ``complete,'' and (4) require that      control technology determinations be entered into a      clearinghouse before permits can become effective.       Nearly all parties in our discussions identified the need      to have all of the data on the latest control technology      determinations made by permitting authorities in the EPA      clearinghouse. Improving the availability of this information      to everyone will greatly assist the permitting process. To      this end, I have committee significant resources to gather      all of the existing data, input into the database, and      redesign the system to make it easier for all parties to put      in new data to keep it up-to-date.       One of the lessons that we have learned through our ongoing      efforts is that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to      improve NSR in one large rulemaking. Instead, I believe it is      best to make incremental changes that will provide      flexibility and certainty without sacrificing the benefits of      the current program. I hope the new Administration will      consider finalizing the concepts described above that provide      flexibility and certainty without compromising environmental      protection to make near term progress. I realize there are      other issues, such as applicability for the base program,      that also need resolution. For these remaining issues,      continued discussions in the context of the overall program      are needed.       I appreciate and thank you for the time, effort and input      that you have provided over the past years, and I believe      that both industry and environment will benefit from the      approaches described above.
