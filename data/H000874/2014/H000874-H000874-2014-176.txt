 Mr. Speaker, perhaps we ought to have a criteria of everybody who has read this bill can vote on it. My bet is there would be very few Members who would be able to vote on this bill.  This is an 8-page summary of this bill with probably 50 paragraphs in it about changes that have been effected in the Medicare system. None of us know what the substance of this bill is.  We had a lot of rhetoric in 2010 about reading the bills. I challenge any Member to come up here and say: I have read this bill.  I am for a permanent fix in the sustainable growth rate for doctors. I have pledged that for the last 4 or 5 years. We have a bipartisan agreement to effect that exact end; but, as so often is the case, we do not have the courage to rationally fund that agreement. That is why America is in trouble fiscally. This is a game unworthy of this institution and of the American people.
