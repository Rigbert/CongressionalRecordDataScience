President, last year's balanced budget agreement contained provisions to make Medicare more efficient by moving away from wasteful practices that the private sector long ago consigned to history, while offering seniors in Oregon and other states more and better choices for their health care service. The bipartisan bill Senator Smith and I are introducing today will make sure that those provisions are implemented in a way that will indeed bring about the full potential of these reforms.  The Medicare+Choice Payment Equity Act of 1998 will finish what we started with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by creating payment equity under Medicare's formula for paying for managed care services . Without equity in payment, beneficiaries in Oregon could be penalized because they may never get the same kinds of services in their Medicare managed care package that are available in other areas of the country with less efficient health care systems.  For states like Oregon with cost efficient health care systems, the Medicare formula resulted in lower payment. While we made progress in correcting this inequity through the Balanced Budget Act, changes made at the last minute in the legislation will actually prevent efficient states from ever gaining full equity in payment under Medicare managed care plans.  This legislation corrects that by requiring full funding of what is known as the ``blend'' portion of the formula. With managed care taking a larger role in Medicare it is more important now to assure equity in the payment formula. This legislation is supported by the Fairness Coalition and the American Hospital Association.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed for the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2227       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
