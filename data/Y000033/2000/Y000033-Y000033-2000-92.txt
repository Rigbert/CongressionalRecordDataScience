Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1211 authorizes an increase in the ceiling of the Salinity Control Program from $75 million to $175 million. In addition, the legislation requires the Secretary of the Interior to file a report on the status of the implementation of the program designed to minimize salt entering the Colorado River from Bureau of Land Management lands.  In 1995, the Subcommittee on Water and Power amended the Salinity Control Act and created a pilot program authorizing the Bureau of Reclamation to award up to $75 million in grants, on a competitive-bid basis, for salinity control projects in the Colorado River Basin. The result of this entrepreneurial initiative has been a substantial drop in the cost per ton of salt removal. This legislation will continue to provide assistance to further reduce the salt content of the Colorado River.  I urge an aye vote on this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
