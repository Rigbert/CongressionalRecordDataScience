President, first, I associate myself much with the remarks of Senator McConnell. Serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee and having been in that theater more than any other Member from the very beginning, it is so obvious to see what the cost of defeat would be. When you look at Iran and Ahmadinejad saying that if the Americans cut and run, ``there will be a void and we will fill that void,'' it would be a disaster for freedom and that would bring the fight from over there over to our soil. We cannot let that happen.                          ____________________
