 President, today I would like to recognize an outstanding Kentuckian for her talented efforts to entertain and educate the public about the Cumberland Gap National Historic Park. Ranger Carol Borneman is the recipient of the 2009 Freeman Tilden Award for the southeast region of the National Park Service. Ranger Carol, as she is commonly known from her television show, ``Wild Outdoor Adventures with Ranger Carol,'' has been with the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park for over 15 years and serves as the park's supervisory interpreter.  The Cumberland Gap, through the Cumberland Mountains and near the Kentucky-Virginia border, was America's historical gateway to the West. Ranger Carol's stories bring to life the travel experiences of America's earliest western settlers in a way that is both educational and memorable.  There is no doubt that it is Ranger Carol's love for the park that keeps her stories entertaining. Mark Woods, Superintendent of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, stated that ``she truly has a passion for the work that she does and it definitely comes through on the show. . . . You cannot watch the show without being captivated by Carol's knowledge, dedication, and sheer enthusiasm.''  The Freeman Tilden Award is the most prestigious award given in the field of interpretation and education within the National Park Service. Borneman is not new to such an honor; in fact, this is the second time she has received it. It is with great pride that I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ranger Carol Borneman on receiving the Freeman Tilden Award, and for her outstanding efforts to keep important Kentucky history alive for future generations to enjoy.                          ____________________
