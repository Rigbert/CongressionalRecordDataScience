 This is a good discussion.  The issue that I wanted to pose is, yes, I can get on national shows and I occasionally do, but we have a problem. Let us talk about the radio for a second. I would characterize the United States as being kind of a centrist country, not right wing, not left wing, kind of centrist. In the last election, as youknow, Gore and Nader got more votes than did Mr. Bush and Mr. Buchanan, by a few million votes. Kind of a centrist country.  If you turned on talk radio today, would my friend agree with me that what you would hear is one extreme right winger after another right winger after another right winger? So that even a moderate or progressive voice, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) and I are probably progressives, we know that our people are not going to have a radio station with Rush Limbaugh and his friends out there, Gordon Liddy and all these other folks out there.  But is it somehow interesting, I would think it is somehow interesting, that a country which is basically centrist, that one talk radio show after another is dominated by not right wingers but extreme right wingers.
