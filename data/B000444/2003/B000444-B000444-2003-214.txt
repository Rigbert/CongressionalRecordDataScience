 President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003, along with over a dozen Senators of both parties who are joining me on this legislation. This bill creates new temporary and permanent bankruptcy judgeships in districts that need them, and extends and converts other temporary judgeships.  The substantial increase in bankruptcy case filings in recent years has created a dire need for additional bankruptcy judgeships. My bill would create 23 new permanent bankruptcy judgeships, 5 temporary judgeships, convert 2 temporary judgeships to permanent status and extend 2 other temporary judgeships. 17 States would receive new judgeships, as recommended by the Administrative Office for United States Courts.  Among other things, the bill authorizes four new bankruptcy judgeships, and converts one from temporary to permanent status, for the District of Delaware, the Nation's most overloaded bankruptcy district. The most recent data show weighted filings for the district of Delaware surpassing 13,500 per judge, while the next busiest district faces only about 3,000.  The bankruptcy bar in Delaware is among the most respected and accomplished in the country, as are our bankruptcy judges. But our judges are not superhuman. They must receive the assistance that this bill would grant them, and I intend to see that they get it.  The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 2003 is long overdue and I urge my colleagues to support it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1061       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
