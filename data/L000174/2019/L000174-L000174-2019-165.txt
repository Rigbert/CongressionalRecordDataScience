. Senate--a body that should be the conscience of the Nation--should care. Stoking fear through misinformation in order to promote a political agenda is simply wrong. We could and should reopen the government this week.  Last week, the House passed a bipartisan, six-bill minibus to reopen most of the government and a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security. To show how bipartisan it is, the six appropriations bills the House passed originated in the Republican-controlled Senate last Congress and had bipartisan support, including by Senator Shelby as chairman and by myself as vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee.  I worked hard with Senator Shelby--and I admire his efforts--to produce these bills last summer and fall, and all of them received nearly unanimous support when they were considered on the floor of the Senate or in the Appropriations Committee. Senator McConnell should bring them to the floor of the U.S. Senate today and put them up for a vote. We have already shown virtually every Republican and every Democrat in this body will vote for them.  Bring them up. Let's vote for them. End this nonsense. End it. The leader owes that to the American people. We owe that to the American people. Let us be the conscience of the Nation, not an institution that is simply a foil for the latest tweet or posting. We can do it. We have passed these bills before. Bring them up. Bring them up. Bring them up, and pass them again. Republicans and Democrats have voted for them in the past. The Republican chairman and I strongly support them. Bring them up. Bring them up. Bring them up and pass them and open the government and let 800,000 Americans stop their suffering.  I yield the floor.  I see the Senator seeking recognition, so I withhold my request.
