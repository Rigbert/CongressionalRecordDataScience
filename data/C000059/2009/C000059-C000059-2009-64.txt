. 3326--Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R. 3326  Account: Navy Research and Development--0604215N  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Navy; Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division  Address of Requesting Entity: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Corona, CA 92878-5000  Description of Request: I have secured $5,800,000 for the Measurement Standards Research and Development Program. The program includes testing for electro-optic and night vision systems; chem/bio and radiation detection systems; advanced sensor technologies; nano-technology. It also provides for improved and state of the art measurement calibration systems that ensure an accurate traceability of measurement from the weapon system parameter to National Standards maintained at NIST. Without adequate measurement capability, verification of performance for weapon and detection system readiness is not possible. This project results in the development of the measurement standards and calibration systems necessary to provide traceable measurements. These state-of-the-art measurement standards often reside at NIST and thus provide benefit to other federal agencies and industry as well. This project allows the Navy to make correct test decisions that ensure mission success and safety while reducing the cost of unnecessary rework. Substantial cost savings have resulted from past R&D project funding through this program.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R 3326  Account: Microelectonic Technology Development and Support--0603720S  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, University of Riverside, California  Address of Requesting Entity: 900 University Avenue, Riverside, California 92521  Description of Request: I have secured $6,000,000 for the Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering. The funds will be used for the 3-D Electronics program which aims to take advantage of recent advances in nanomaterials and nanodevices to begin to address the issue necessary to take the electronics industry beyond the two-dimensional silicon based devices and wiring and to develop high density, 3D-electronics technology together with associated packaging, heat dissipation solutions and the investigation of alternative electronic materials. Conventional electronics is based on 2D planar processes, but this is becoming prohibitively expensive as well as a barrier to performance. By stacking devices and interconnecting them in a 3D arrangement, a huge leap in functionality density is possible. 3D integration is a cornerstone of the coming revolution in electronics.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R 3326  Account: Navy Research and Development--0603739N  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Navy; Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division  Address of Requesting Entity: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Corona, CA 92878-5000  Description of Request: I have secured $1,800,000 for the NSWC Corona IUID Center which provides technical support, implementation assistance, training, and lessons learned for IUID, a DoD mandate, to various DoD programs and offices. The IUID Center leverages complementary efforts and catalogs, distributes lessons learned, and helps streamline implementation efforts, reducing IUID implementation cost. IUID itself will enable lifecycle traceability and improve data integrity, leading to more informed decisions and improved asset management. Substantial cost savings result from IUID implementation in DoD programs as well as major gains in asset management and tracking of critical DoD material.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R 3326  Account: Operation & Maintenance; 1C8C Depot Operations Support  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Navy; Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division  Address of Requesting Entity: Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division, Corona, CA 92878-5000  Description of Request: I have secured $2,400,000 for the NSWC, Corona Fleet Readiness Data Assessment project which will update/replace existing tools to enable the accurate, efficient collection and transmission of data to quickly perform detailed readiness analyses. It will take advantage of the improved automation and data collection capability provided by the METBENCH calibration system. The analyses resulting from this project will quickly put accurate readiness information into the hands of Navy decision-makers and accelerate the savings resulting from METBENCH implementation in the Navy.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Bill Number: H.R 3326  Account: Operation and Maintenance, Navy--03 Training and Recruiting 3A2J  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps  Address of Requesting Entity: U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Corps; 2300 Wilson Blvd, North, Arlington, VA 22201-3308  Description of Request: I have secured $651,000 for the U.S. Naval Sea Cadet Program. The Sea Cadet Program is focused upon development of youth ages 11-17, serving almost 9,000 Sea Cadets and adult volunteers in 387 units country-wide. It promotes interest and skill in seamanship and aviation and instills qualities that mold strong moral character in an anti-drug and anti-gang environment. Summer training onboard Navy and Coast Guard ships and shore stations is a challenging training ground for developing self-confidence and self-discipline, promotion of high standards of conduct and performance and a sense of teamwork. Funds will be utilized to ``buy down'' the out-of-pocket expenses for training to $120/week. NSCC instills in every Cadet a sense of patriotism, courage and the foundation of personal honor. A significant percent of Cadets join the Armed Services often receiving accelerated advancement, or obtain commissions. The program has significance in assisting to promote the Navy and Coast Guard, particularly in those areas of the U.S where these Services have little presence.                          ____________________
