President, an incredible woman died late last month after a hard fought battle with Alzheimer's disease--a woman who gave her life to help and teach others. A former University of Illinois Springfield professor, Dr. Mattilou Sexton Catchpole, passed away at the age of 88.  Mattilou was born on Halloween day in Chicago, IL, but grew up in Texarkana, AR. Her parents gave her a strong moral background and an appreciation for justice. As active participants in the Arkansas civil rights movement, they taught her that social justice, equitable educational opportunities, and equal rights for all were of the utmost importance.  She enlisted in the Air Force during World War II and served as a medical technician stateside. While post-traumatic stress disorder was not categorized as a medical condition, Mattilou knew that many of the returning soldiers experienced hell. She soon realized that quiet conversations and a caring touch helped to heal the wounds that she couldn't see.  Still caring for others, she first became a registered nurse and then a certified registered nurse anesthetist, or CRNA. While raising three children and suffering from sometimes debilitating back pain, she worked as a CRNA at the Cleveland Clinic and obtained bachelor's and master's degrees at Case Western Reserve University.  She came to my hometown of Springfield, IL, to teach at the university in 1978, and in no time finished her doctorate in health education from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Dr. Catchpole became the director of the Nurse Anesthesia Program and Nurse Anesthesia Completion Program in Springfield. She spent the rest of her life teaching at the university and writing.  At the age of 78, Dr. Catchpole was named the 2002 Kayaker of the Year by the Missouri Whitewater Association. Physical fitness and the outdoors were very important to her. It was swimming that enabled her to build the strength and leave behind a full-body cast that doctors thought she would wear for most of her adult life because of back pain. In 2006, at the age of 82, Mattilou was one of 18 recipients of the President's Call to Service Awards for over 5,000 hours of service with Health Volunteers Overseas. You could always rely on Mattilou to lend a helping hand to someone in need or to teach a person all that she knew about a subject.  I offer my deepest condolences to her family, her brother, U.A. Garred Sexton; her three children, Julia Ann, Nancy, and Floyd; and her eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Mattilou's passing is a deep loss for so many, but her hard work, accomplishments, and students will continue to carry on.                          ____________________
