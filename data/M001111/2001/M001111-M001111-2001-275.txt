 President, as the Senator from Massachusetts knows well, we only fund one-third of the students who are eligible for title I today. It seems to me we should be investing the money in making sure title I students have access to additional help. If we reduce class size, if we provide teacher training, if we invest in public schools in a way we have promised for many years to do, vouchers would not be an argument on the floor. Our children everywhere would be getting the good education they should and we would not select just a few kids to go on to a few schools to succeed. We would go back to the principle we all espouse in the Senate, to leave no child behind.  As a country that cares about all of our children, we are making sure we invest in all of our children.
