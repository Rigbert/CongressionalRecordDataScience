 President, today we have returned from the Presidents Day break to resume our debate on the PATRIOT Act. At 3 today, following our morning business period, we will return to consideration of S. 2271, the PATRIOT Act amendments bill. Tomorrow at 2:30, we will have a cloture vote on the underlying bill. If cloture is invoked, we will proceed to vote on passage of the bill at 10 a.m. on Wednesday. The 2:30 cloture vote on Tuesday will be the first vote of this week.  There are a number of important conmittee meetings going on this week, including the discussion on lobbying reform. The majority leader has stated that it is his expectation to begin consideration of that reform legislation next week. We will also have a joint meeting to hear an address from the Honorable Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister of Italy. That address will be at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, and Senators should gather in the Chamber at 10:30. The Senate will proceed at 10:40 to the Hall of the House of Representatives for that address.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S1489]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
