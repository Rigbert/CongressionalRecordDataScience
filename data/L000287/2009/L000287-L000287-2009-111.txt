Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the vision of a thousand ``Points ofLight'' and to celebrate the growing tide of commitment to service and volunteering that is a hallmark of this great nation. Tomorrow, President George H. W. Bush and President Barack Obama are together to mark this important milestone in the history of the service movement.  Twenty years ago, President Bush spoke of a thousand points of light, individuals and organizations ``spread like stars throughout the nation, doing good.'' From this idea rose the Points of Light Foundation which has both recognized and organized exemplary acts of giving for the past two decades.  In 2007, it merged with Hands On Network, which started in my district, in the city of Atlanta, and the combined organization is now the Points of Light Institute, the largest volunteer network in the country. Their mission is to mobilize, not just a thousand, but millions to answer the call to solve our most pressing problems--volunteers working together to help those with HIV in San Francisco, building wheelchair ramps in Greenville, and creating award-winning tutoring programs in Atlanta.  In today's hard times, people are hurting. Americans are having to choose between paying their mortgages and putting food on the table. In these tough times it is more important than ever that we, as American citizens, give back to those in need. National Service becomes ever more important when people are hurting. I am proud of my fellow citizens who have heeded the calls to service, and have dedicated their time to helping others. In 2008, 61.8 million Americans volunteered, dedicating more than 8 billion hours of service worth an estimated $162 billion.  The Points of Light Institute and its 250 Hands On Action Centers reach 80 percent of our nation's communities have been at the forefront of this remarkable growth. I am so pleased to be able to recognize this organization's first 20 years of harnessing the energy and enthusiasm of our people to be a part of a better world and their ongoing contributions as a part of President Obama's United We Serve initiative.                          ____________________
