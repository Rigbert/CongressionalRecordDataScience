  I would just like to make this comment and really express my profound disappointment. For those of us that are somewhat, relatively new to this body, I think to see a very consequential piece of legislation come a cropper in this way is extraordinarily disappointing. Obviously, what has happened is to kill tobacco reform.  There is no question about how it is being done. There is no search for alternatives. There is no search for where there may be a consensus in this body. And I think there are points where there is consensus. I deeply believe a bill can be put together which can deter teen smoking.
