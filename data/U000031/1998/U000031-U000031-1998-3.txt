Speaker, what is fast track? Fast track allows the President to negotiate trade agreements with other countries. Does Congress lose its right to approve those treaties, those agreements? No, they do not. Absolutely not. This body, this Congress, will then vote yes or no based on the merits of the trade agreement that may be negotiated.  I would like to think that every Republican and every Democrat in this body does in fact care about jobs. Letme tell you about some of the jobs in Michigan, an exporter, by the way, to the tune of $38 billion in exports last year.  I visited a multinational company recently that showed me a letter from their general manager down in Chile. That letter talked about the importance of Chile's market, their leadership, the gateway to a very important market in the world. That general manager in that letter asked that the Michigan company stop sending goods manufactured in Michigan and change to their facility in Canada.  Why? Well, Canada, thanks to their free trade agreement, their strategy, their trade agreements they have been able to reach because they had fast track, do not have to pay tariffs on their goods going down to Chile. That is right. That same good produced in Canada has an automatic 11 percent discount compared to the same product manufactured in Michigan. We cannot do that. Why? We do not have fast track. This bill allows that to happen.  We see this happening time and time again across the country. Without fast track, there are incentives in fact for companies to send their manufactured goods from other countries.  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I yield two minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Sawyer).  (
