President, if I could very briefly, because I know others are here to speak, I would like to distinguish, if I can, three or four approaches where we differ between us.  The first element that is important--and I wish to make sure it is clear for the record--my amendment gives to the bankruptcy court the authority to modify the mortgage. But under your amendment, or your approach, the ultimate decision on whether a mortgage is going to be modified still has to be approved by the lending institution; is that not correct?
