I have known Shirley for many years, and she is one of the most involved citizens that I have ever known, especially when it comes to her service to the residents of Lake Station. Shirley has been a public official in Lake Station for the past twenty years, the last twelve of which she served as the city's mayor. Though Shirley has been the cornerstone of her community, she decided not to run for reelection and will be retiring from her elected office at year's end. For her efforts and many contributions to the City of Lake Station, Shirley was honored at a retirement celebration on Saturday, December 1, 2007, at the Lake Station Veterans of Foreign Wars Post #9323.  Originally from Indiana, Pennsylvania, Shirley came to Northwest Indiana in 1960. A resident of Lake Station since that time, Shirley's familiarity with the people of Lake Station and her fondness for the city emerged from her everyday interactions with them as the owner of a local sandwich shop. Undoubtedly, it was her connection to the people that steered her in the direction of public service and led to her election to the city council in 1987. Following eight years on the council, Shirley's leadership skills and dedication led to her election as mayor, serving from 1996 to 2007. During this time, Shirley received numerous accolades from the community, including: the Liberty Bell Award from the Indiana State Bar Association in 2002, the Department of the Army's Certificate of Appreciation in 2005, and the Marine Corps League Distinguished Service Award in 2007.  As the mayor of Lake Station, Shirley was instrumental in many improvements and upgrades within the city. Throughout her tenure, Lake Station has welcomed several new subdivisions and businesses, as well as many new public facilities, including a community center, a senior and nutrition center, a food pantry, a public library, and a compost facility. Thanks to Shirley's leadership and perseverance, the city was also able to acquire and restore what would become her most rewarding contribution, the Lake Station Boys and Girls Club. Throughout the years, Shirley's commitment to public safety and the well-being of the community was constant. During this time, the city saw improvements and additions made to the ambulance service, the police department, and the fire department. These included additional vehicles, equipment, officers, computer upgrades, and a new 911 emergency system. Public health services were also improved through the addition of a mosquito sprayer, new storm sewers, a renovated water tower, and new sidewalks and walking trails. Beautification of the city has also been one of Shirley's primary objectives, as is evidenced by Lake Station's Veterans' Community Park, a covered walking bridge, and numerous landscaping projects throughout the city.  Having decided to retire from public service, Shirley will now be able to spend much of her time with those closest to her, her family. A loving wife, mother, and grandmother, Shirley's commitment to the people of Lake Station is surpassed only by her dedication to her family. Shirley and her husband, Harry, have shared many wonderful years together. They have been blessed with three children: Jody, Toni, and James. Harry and Shirley are also the proud grandparents of 6 adoring grandchildren: Larissa, Kristin, Jordan, Jenna, Jake, and Jonas.  Madam Speaker, Shirley Wadding has given her time and efforts selflessly to the people of Lake Station for the past twenty years and beyond. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending her for her service and dedication. I also ask you to join me in wishing her the best of health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
