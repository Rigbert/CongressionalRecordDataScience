Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I have always supported strengthening families and fair treatment for legal immigrants. Many people have waited for years to be reunited with their families,while others have blatantly disregarded U.S. policy and flooded our Nation with illegal immigrants.  We must not place more restrictions on those who await reunification with their families. We must not go back on our promise to reunite the families of these law-abiding United States citizens with their parents, their children, brothers, and sisters who have waited for this day.  Mr. Chairman, in support of the integrity of our Nation, of controlling illegal immigration, and encouraging the use of correct procedures for legal immigration, I strongly strongly support the Kim amendment, and hope that my colleagues will do so as well.
