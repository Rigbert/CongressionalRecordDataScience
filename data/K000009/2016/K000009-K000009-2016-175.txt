Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. DeForest L. ``Woody'' Trautman, of Toledo, Ohio. Woody passed from this life on Thursday, August 19, 2016 at the age of 96. He was an amazing sage and a very community minded man. He was a man of peace.  Woody Trautman was born to Charlotte and DeForest L. Trautman in Panama on June 14, 1920 while his father was stationed there in the U.S. Navy. Later the family moved to Drexel Hill in Pennsylvania. Woody went on to receive his undergraduate and graduate degrees in engineering from Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh and his PhD from Stanford University. He married his first wife Retta and together they raised 3 children until her passing in 1998.  Woody's engineering talents were sought by many both in the United States and worldwide. He taught at Carnegie, UCLA and the University of New York at Stony Brook. Through the Ford Foundation he developed graduate schools of engineering in the U.S. He worked for Hughes Aircraft. He worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris, France. Later the family moved to Chile for five years while Woody helped organize a graduate school of engineering at the University of Concepcion through UNESCO. Settling in at the University of Toledo, Woody was a former president of the Technical Society of Toledo and was named Engineer of the Year in 1978.  Once retired, Woody pursued his passions with vigor. He was a grief counselor for Hospice of Northwest Ohio for many years. He was part of the Interracial Religious Coalition and helped organize workshops on world religion. Together with his wife Judy, who he married in 2003, he co-founded the MultiFaith Council of NW Ohio ``to facilitate educational and fellowship activities to promote shared community service across many faith perspectives.'' According to the history, ``When the council began, he said `all faiths and none.' '' With more than 500 members representing many faiths, the Multi-Faith Council is among the jewels in the crown that is Woody Tautman's legacy. In December 2014, Toledo's charter as a ``Community of Compassion,'' was signed after a four year effort by Woody and Judy Trautman and part of an international movement.  He once noted, ``I'm honored and humbled at this opportunity to be able to represent the effort to get together all kinds of people in the same room and to share and to find out firsthand we are all the same human race.'' Woody, ``with his chest-length white beard, was a familiar figure in the audience of events that promoted understanding, even if organized by another group.'' His wife Judy explained, ``It became his trademark. People would not recognize him anymore without his beard.''  Judy Trautman commented that Woody ``was persistent and intensely gregarious. People used to say of him that he would just keep asking until they stopped saying no. It was hard to say no to Woody.'' Pastor Ed Heilman of Park Congregational United Church of Christ summed up Woody best when he said, ``He was looking to do good in a practical, pragmatic way. His own questioning mind and his engineering mind was, `Something is going on in the world that needs to be fixed, let's do something about it,' ''  To Judy and the Trautman children Patricia, Edwin and Craig, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, we extend our deepest sympathy to each of you on the passing of this extraordinary man. Called home, he most certainly was met with the embrace ``Well done, my good and faithful servant.''                          ____________________
