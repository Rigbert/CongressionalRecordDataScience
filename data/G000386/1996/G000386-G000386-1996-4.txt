 President, in late July, IRS issued a Revenue Procedure that may cost thousands of State and local governments and their taxpayers as much as $2 billion. The purpose of the IRS action is to recover funds that were diverted from the Treasury when local governments were overcharged by investment firms for securities they purchased in the course of tax-exempt municipal bond refinancings. If these State and local governments had caused the overcharges or if they themselves benefitted then the IRS ruling, even though costly, might be fair.  That, however, is not the case. There has been no suggestion whatsoever that municipal authorities across America acted unlawfully. Instead, as expressed by the president of the League of Cities in a recent letter to Treasury Secretary Rubin, ``it appears that the IRS understands that cities are not at fault, but rather the IRS wants to use cities to go after the underwriters who overcharged us.''  In Iowa alone the IRS ruling could cost taxpayers more than $1.5 million. For other States the totals run even higher. In California, for example, Rev. Proc. 96-41 could require State and local governments to pay as much as $200 million to the IRS.  If, as the IRS suggests, underwriters and investment bankers were responsible for use of ``a valuation method that results in prices * * * that exceed fair market value,'' it is those underwriters and investment bankers who should repay the Treasury, not towns, cities, State universities, school districts, transportation systems and utility authorities. Indeed, by some estimates, according to the New York Times: ``underwriters may have earned some $2 billion to $3 billion of illegal profits.''  Fortunately, under the False Claims Act, the Government has the ability to proceed directly against any party which causes financial loss to the Treasury and recover treble damages plus penalties. The False Claims Act may be helpful in the yield burning context.  Ten years ago, President Reagan signed the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act into law. As the principal sponsor of the 1986 amendments, my purpose was to strengthen and revitalize the Justice Department's efforts to fight fraud against the Government wherever it occurs. Since then, false claims recoveries to the Treasury have totaled more than $1.3 billion.  While the statute has been applied most often in the context of Federal defense spending and federally funded health insurance programs, with the narrow exception of income tax cases, the act allows the Government to recover treble damages and penalties against anyone who defrauds the Treasury. If the overcharges described by the IRS occurred, the U.S. Treasury may have sustained substantial losses as it essentially paid unlawful profits to those who sold the overpriced securities. If such losses occurred, the False Claims Act offers an ideal remedy.  For these reasons, I intend to write to Attorney General Reno and urge that the Department of Justice investigate the circumstances underlying the IRS action, and that if so warranted, the Department then seek to pursue all remedies against any party which damaged the Government by overpricing securities sold in connection with municipal bond refinancings. I will also write to IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson to indicate my concern that the IRS is seeking to make local governments the primary target for repayment of any sums that were lost by the Government as a result of overcharges for escrow securities.                          ____________________
