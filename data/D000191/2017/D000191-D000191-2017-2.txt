  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, it is a dark day; $3 trillion in revenue cuts, in tax breaks; three quarters of that goes to corporations under the premise that they will use that money to employ people. The last time they got this kind of a break, 93 percent of the money went to stock dividends, buybacks, and executive bonuses, and it will be no different this time--squandering America's wealth for the wealthiest among us.  Eighty-three percent of the remainder goes to people who earn over $400,000 a year. They are going to trickle down on us, yet again.  At the same time, there is no infrastructure package. The Trump administration, the DOT says, we just don't know where we can find the money.  Well, imagine if they used a fraction of these tax giveaways for infrastructure--15,000 jobs per billion invested. We could have had $1.5 million with 3 percent of the money they just wasted on these tax cuts.  Shame on them.                          ____________________
