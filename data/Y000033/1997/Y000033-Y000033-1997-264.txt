Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Unrecognized Southeast Alaska Native Communities Recognition Act. This legislation provides long overdue recognition of five Native communities of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell, which were wrongly denied the opportunity to establish and enroll in a Native corporation under the terms of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [ANCSA]. The act also provides for a process to determine the lands or other appropriate compensation for the communities.  This legislation is intended to rectify an injustice that is over 25 years old. In 1971, ANCSA was enacted as the means to settle the aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to their traditional homelands. The law provided for the establishment of Native Corporations, which were awarded land and compensation. Natives could enroll to 1 of 13 regional corporations and, within the geographic area of their regional corporation, to the village where they lived or had historic, culture, or familial ties.  However, Natives in the five southeast Alaska villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell, were not recognized in ANCSA, and therefore were denied the ability to form Native corporations. The legislative and historical record of ANCSA does not clearly provide a reason for leaving these villages out of the process of forming Native corporations.  A study ordered by Congress in 1993 examined why the five unrecognized communities were denied eligibility to form Native corporations. The study found that there was no meaningful distinction between the five communities and other communities in southeast Alaska recognized in ANCSA, and thus no justification for omission of the Native communities of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell from eligibility to form urban or group corporations under ANCSA.  The Natives and their heirs in these communities deserve the chance to enroll to Native corporations. The legislation I am introducing simply grants recognition to these communities and enables them to form Native corporations. The bill also directs the Secretaries of Interior and of Agriculture to submit a report to Congress regarding lands or other compensation that should be provided to the new urban and group corporations that are established.  This is the first, but most important step to bringing the struggle of the Natives of five southeast Alaska communities to a close.                          ____________________
