Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 343) commending the State of Kuwait for granting women certain important political rights.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 343       Whereas on May 16, 2005, the Parliament of the State of      Kuwait amended Article 1 of the Election Law 35 of 1962,      providing female citizens of Kuwait the right to vote and run      in the 2007 elections;       Whereas the rights of women are of paramount importance in      international human rights, to be respected and promoted      regardless of historical, cultural, or religious heritage;       Whereas the active advancement of women's rights throughout      the world is and remains an important policy priority of the      United States; and       Whereas the Department of State recognizes that the Kuwaiti      parliamentary vote of May 16, 2005, was an important step      forward for the women of Kuwait and the nation as a whole,      and the United States views this step as a positive      development on the road to political reform, serving as a      positive example for other governments and societies in the      region that are on the path to political freedom, inclusion      of women, and full democratization: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That House of Representatives--       (1) commends the Government and Parliament of the State of      Kuwait for providing female citizens of Kuwait the right to      vote and hold public office;       (2) urges the full participation of Kuwaiti women in the      political life of their country; and       (3) encourages the Government of Kuwait to continue taking      positive steps to achieve full modernization of its political      system and lasting democratic reform.
