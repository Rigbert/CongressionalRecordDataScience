 GORTON. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. As the Senator from Washington knows, that very issue is currently before the Supreme Court, as to whether or not it is even constitutional to restrict what parties can do on behalf of their candidates, an absurd restriction on its face.  There has been much discussion out here on the floor about the advantages of incumbency. We know that political parties will support challengers. If we wanted to have the right kind of campaign finance reform, one of the first things we ought to do--and I am sure my friend from Washington would agree--is take the shackles off, if the Court does not do it for us, take the shackles off of the one institution of American politics that will support a challenger every time.
