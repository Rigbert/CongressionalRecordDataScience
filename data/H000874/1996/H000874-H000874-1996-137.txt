I share many of the chairman's concerns as it relates to TSM as he knows, and we have worked together to make those concerns known to the Treasury Department and to the Internal Revenue Service. I believe we must take strong action to be sure this program is ultimately successful and gives us a tax administration system that is efficient and effective. I am committed to working with the chairman on these and other important issues as we move to conference with the Senate. Again I would reiterate my thanks to the chairman for these clarifications.
