 President, I join with friends and associates across the country to honor the 100th birthday on September 17 of Dr. Edgar Wayburn of San Francisco. From the time that his appreciation of the American landscape began in Macon, GA, to his role today as honorary president of the Sierra Club, Dr. Wayburn has built a lifetime of conservation activism that has immeasurably benefited our country and the world.  Across our Nation, 100,000,000 acres of some of the most beautiful landscape in the world are protected for future generations thanks in large part to the dedicated efforts of Dr. Wayburn. Never a full-time conservationist, Dr. Wayburn has dedicated weekends and hours away from his medical practice to protecting our wild lands and wildlife.  From the Mount Tamalpais State Park in California to Admiralty Island in southeastern Alaska, Dr. Wayburn's accomplishments read as an honor roll of conservation achievements. He has been a true visionary in promotion of conservation and has inspired countless other Americans.  One example in particular uniquely epitomizes Dr. Wayburn's legacy. Driving out of San Francisco International Airport, you face west toward the hills of San Mateo County. Beyond those hills, along the coast for more than 10 miles to the south and for 75 miles to the north stands one or our country's most majestic national parks--the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The park encompasses 80,000 acres in 3 counties and lies adjacent to Point Reyes National Seashore; thus more than 150,000 acres are preserved for habitat and wildlife and are enjoyed by more than 20 million people every year. Dr. Wayburn played an instrumental part in the founding of both of these national parks.  For over 100 years, the U.S. military fortified the region now home to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. But in the 1960s the military became aware that its bunkers and missiles had little value for our Nation's defense and made plans to sell parts of the area's installations and fortifications.  Bay Area residents were determined that this magnificent landscape not belost to ordinary development. Here was the chance for people to see the natural world in an urban context, to look upon the wilderness from the city, and Dr. Wayburn helped lead the way. When he learned of a farsighted Interior Department proposal to preserve underused military land across the Nation for public use and enjoyment, he became the leader of the citizens' group organized to save the land at his doorstep. He also insisted upon enlargement of the original 8,000-acre proposal.  Thanks to widespread support and the indefatigable efforts of Dr. Wayburn, the campaign to protect this invaluable natural treasure was a resounding success. Congress authorized the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972, which now stands as a monument to the committed efforts of so many like Dr. Wayburn.  The story of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area stands as just one of many achievements that mark Dr. Wayburn's inimitable career.  In 1999, President Bill Clinton recognized Dr. Wayburn's lifetime of service by awarding him our Nation's highest civilian honor--the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In honoring his achievements, President Clinton counted Dr. Wayburn as the person who had saved ``more of our wilderness than any other person alive.'' I can think of no more fitting praise to offer Dr. Wayburn.  Dr. Wayburn has created a legacy that will live on for generations to come, and he has made our Nation and our world a better place. I commend him on his efforts and offer my heartfelt gratitude for his service.                          ____________________
