President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the Medical Savings Account Expansion Act of 1999. There has been much said recently regarding the need to reform health care. I agree with many of my colleagues that health care is indeed in need of serious reform. However, the nature and the scope of reforms are open to debate.  During the health care debate of 1996, the Congress focused its efforts on attempting to provide the uninsured with insurance. Included in the legislation, Congress created a demonstration project in order to test the effectiveness of Medical Savings Accounts. However, in establishing the demonstration project, the Congress created numerous legislative roadblocks to the success of Medical Savings Accounts.  As we are all aware, Medical Savings Accounts combine a high deductible insurance policy and tax exempt accounts for the purpose of providing health care. MSA holders use these accounts to purchase routine health care services. When account holders spend all of the funds in their account and reach their annual deductible, their health insurance policy kicks in. If they don't spend all the money in the account, they get to keep what's left, plus interest for the following year.  The creation of Medical Savings Accounts was the result of a bipartisan coalition that many in the Senate worked long and hard to achieve. Medical Savings Accounts are really based on a simple principle that should be at the heart of the health care reform, that being, empowering people to take control of their own health care improves the system for everyone. Expanding MSAs is one small, but important, step in that regard. Providing individuals with an incentive to save money on their health care costs encourages them to be better consumers. The result is much needed cost control and consumer responsibility.  Mr. President, I think as the Congress begins to discuss health care reform this year, we must move away from the debate on the regulation and rationing of health care and focus our energies on providing health care to the uninsured. Instead of concentrating our efforts on reforms that will likely result in less health care, we should be trying to expand the opportunity for health care. At the same time, we must do so in a cost effective and market oriented way. MSAs meet that goal.  According to the General Accounting Office, more than 37% of the people who have opted to buy an MSA under the 1996 law were previously uninsured. That bears repeating; people who have previously been uninsured, are now buying health insurance. We need to make it possible for more people to obtain health care insurance. Now, compare those 37% of previously uninsured who now have health insurance with the projected 400,000 people who would lose their current health insurance if the Congress does something that would raise current health insurance premiums by just one percentage point and the argument becomes even stronger to expand the use of MSAs.  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today does just that, it makes Medical Savings Accounts more readily available to more people by eliminating many of the legislative and regulatory roadblocks to their continued success. The GAO report referred to earlier, points out that one of the key reasons why MSAs have not been as successful as originally thought is the complexity of the law.  Let me touch on a just few of the problems my legislation addresses. First is the scope of the demonstration project. Mr. President, I believe we should drop the 750,000 cap and extend the life of the project indefinitely. The 750,000 cap is merely an arbitrary number negotiated by the Congress. By lifting the cap and making MSAs permanent, we will be allowing the market to decide whether MSAs are a viable alternative in health insurance. The capand the limited time constraint create a disincentive for insurance companies to provide MSAs as an option. The GAO study I cited earlier supports this conclusion. The majority of companies who offered MSA plans did so in order to preserve a share of the market. The result, few, if any, are aggressively marketing MSAs. If Congress is serious about testing the effectiveness of MSAs in the marketplace, we must free them from unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed restraints.  Second, under current law, either an employer or an employee can contribute directly to an MSA, but not both. The legislation I am introducing would allow both employers and employees to contribute to a Medical Savings Account. This just makes sense. By limiting who can contribute to an individual MSA, the government has predetermined the limits of contributions. I think many employers would prefer to contribute to an individual's health care account, rather than continue the costly, third-party payer system. By allowing both employers and employees to contribute to MSAs, we will be giving more flexibility to Medical Savings Accounts. That flexibility will allow more people to obtain MSAs and undoubtedly contribute to their success.  One of the arguments frequently made against MSAs is that they are for the rich. Certainly that is an understandable conclusion, given the fact that we limit who can contribute to MSAs. By lifting the contribution restrictions, individuals of all income levels will find MSAs a viable health care alternative.  As I travel throughout Oklahoma, a common complaint is the access to quality health care and the rising cost of health care. In my state, managed care is not always an option for many people in rural areas. However, Medical Savings Accounts are an option for many families because MSAs give them the choice to pursue individualized health care that fits their needs. These are the sorts of solutions that our constituents have sent us to Washington to find. They are not interested in more government. In fact, many want less. Yet, all we offer them is differing degrees of government intrusion in their lives.  Mr. President, the debate in the 105th Congress clearly demonstrated we are all concerned about access to health care, doctor choice, cost, and security. As the debate moves forward in the 106th Congress, I want to urge my colleagues to consider alternatives to further big-government and to be bold enough to pursue them.  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 657       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
