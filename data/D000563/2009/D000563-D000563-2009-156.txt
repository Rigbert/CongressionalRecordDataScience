What happens is this program next year will be up going through the Senate and the House of Representatives. For the Senator from South Carolina to misrepresent the contents of the bill is not fair.  Secondly, this idea of government funding abortion, let me say to the Senator from South Carolina, here are the basic pillars on this controversial issue in America. First, the Supreme Court has said abortion is a legal procedure in Roe v. Wade.  Second, Congress said, through the Hyde amendment, that we will spend no Federal funds for abortion except in cases involving the life of the mother, rape, and incest.  Third, Congress said any provider--hospital, doctor, medical professional--who in good conscience cannot participate in an abortion procedure will never be compelled to do so.  This bill doesn't change that at all. In the Senator's State of South Carolina and in my State of Illinois, the leadership of the States--the Governor and the legislature--decide what they will spend their State funds on. That is done in States across the United States. Seventeen States have decided they will have State funds pay for abortions beyond the Hyde amendment. It is their State's decision, not our decision in DC. We, in this bill, give them the same authority that the State of South Carolina has and the State of Illinois has. No Federal funds from the government, from Congress, can be spent on this exercise or use of funds for abortions beyond the Hyde amendment. But if they choose to use their own funds--just as South Carolina and Illinois make their choice--then they make that decision.  Many in Congress have a secret yearning to be mayors of the District of Columbia. They want to be on the city council--not just in the Senate. They want to make every finite decision for the 500,000 or 600,000 people who live here.  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?
