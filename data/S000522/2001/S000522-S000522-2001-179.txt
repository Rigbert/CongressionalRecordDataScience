Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McCrery).  (Mr. McCRERY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Joint Resolution 61.  This resolution expresses clearly the sentiment not only of this Congress, but the sentiment of the American people. It condemns the despicable actions of terrorists who planned and carried out the attacks yesterday against the people of the United States. It extends the condolences of all our citizens to the victims and their families, commends the heroic actions of the fireman, police, and other rescue workers who responded to these tragic events, and underscores the resolve of all of us in America and many others around the world to fight and win this war against terrorism.  Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that so many Members of Congress are speaking for their constituents in support of this resolution, and that they are speaking, not as Republican or Democrats, liberals of conservatives. Easterner or Westerner, but as Americans. It is this unity of spirit, singularity of purpose, and faith in our destiny as purveyors of freedom which will see us through this and lead us to victory.
