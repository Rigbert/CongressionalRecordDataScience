Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the gentleman from Louisiana, and I have not heard him mention the word ``Medicare'' in any of his remarks. I would yield to the gentleman for a question: Does the gentleman's amendment delete the provision in the continuing resolution which increases the Medicare premiums by 25 percent?
