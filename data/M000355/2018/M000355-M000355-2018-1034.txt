 President, it is my privilege today to welcome a special group of visitors to Washington. Thanks to Honor Flight Bluegrass, more Kentucky veterans are touching down today in our Nation's Capital. They are coming to remember fallen comrades and to visit the memorials dedicated to their own service.  Earlier this month, I was lucky enough to spend time with a flight of World War II veterans who arrived in time for the 74th anniversary of D-Day. Today's flight includes veterans of World War II, along with Korea and Vietnam. On behalf of the Commonwealth and all Americans, I am proud to thank them for their service.  Next week, we celebrate our Independence Day. So let's not forget that the freedoms we enjoy come at a cost. Let's take time to thank the heroes who have paid it and those who continue to pay it today.                          ____________________
