 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Aubrey ``Cotton'' Lake, a long-time friend and respected member of the Tuscaloosa community, who passed away on Friday, August 14, 1998 at the age of 69.  Aubrey was a valued employee of the Tuscaloosa News for 18 years and traveled extensively with the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. His photographs of the team won him the coveted Look Magazine National Sports Photography award, and many of his photographs hang in Tuscaloosa's Coach Bear Bryant Museum. Aubrey captured many of the Crimson Tide images that have become emblazoned on our memories--from photographs of Bear Bryant coaching the team to victory, to Joe Namath before his tenure with the NFL. Aubrey was there, documenting sports history, shooting and selecting the most descriptive photographs for the next day's Tuscaloosa News sports page.  Aubrey was more than a sports photographer, however, and served both God and country throughout his life. In addition to his active membership at the First Freewill Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa, he also served many of Alabama's elected officials. For more than 24 years, Aubrey worked for late Representatives Walter Flowers and Claude Harris, and most recently for me, on my own staff.  More than just an employee, Aubrey was a friend and a confidant. He was loyal, had a lifetime of experience in Alabama, and was a true servant to the people of our state. I could never have asked for a more dedicated staff member or friend.  After leaving public service, Aubrey worked as president of Tuscaloosa Insulation Company, and served as a member of the Tuscaloosa Home Builders Association. He was an avid sportsman, and attended as many Alabama football games as possible.  Aubrey was a loving father, devoted community member, and friend to most anyone he met. He will be missed by all who knew him, especially his wife Dot, his daughter Suzanne, his son Greg, his grandchildren, and other family members and friends.  I'm glad I had the opportunity to know and work with Aubrey Lake. He was a good friend, and I will miss him.                          ____________________
