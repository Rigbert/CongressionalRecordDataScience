If NAFTA were really about free trade, and free markets, then it would mean a free fall for both the Mexican tax market and a free fall for the peso.  Heaven forbid that we should let the free market work when Wall Street's major financiers, Mexico's 24 billionaires, multinational corporations, big brokerage houses, and international investment bankers have gambled and lost.  Fred Bergsten, director, Institute for International Economics, says of Members of Congress such as myself who oppose the bailout Mexico, ``They don't realize they could cause what might be like an accidental nuclear war.''  Out of such outrageous hyperbole is born the idea that the bailout of Mexico's billionaires and international speculators is an issue of national security which requires the United States to put its full faith and credit, that is read exactly, more specifically, United States taxpayers at risk.  In the spirit of openness and sunshine, demanded by the new Republican majority in Congress and adopted in their rules, let us have some hearings on this issue. Let us have hearings before the Republican leaders jam the Mexican bailout through in the dark of the night, without any deliberation by this House.                          ____________________
