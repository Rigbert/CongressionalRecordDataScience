President, with only a few legislative days left to us before the Christmas holidays and the end of this session, we continue seeking to make progress in filling the many U.S. attorney vacancies across our Nation and the high-level vacancies at the Justice Department.  Today, the Senate will confirm three more nominations for U.S. attorneys, including the nominations of Gregory A. Brower to the District of Nevada, Diane J. Humetewa to the District of Arizona, and Edmund A. Booth, Jr. to the Southern District of Georgia. Two of the three nominations--Ms. Humetewa and Mr. Brower--are replacements for two of the outstanding U.S. attorneys who were fired almost a year ago as part of the ill-advised, partisan plan to replace well-performing U.S. attorneys. I thank the home State Senators--Senators Reid, Ensign, McCain, Kyl, Chambliss, and Isakson--for their consideration of these nominations.  We also are proceeding to fill one of the many high-level vacancies at the Department of Justice by confirming the nomination of Ronald Jay Tenpas to be Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division at the Justice Department. I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing his hearing.  Over the course of this year, the Judiciary Committee's investigation into the firing of United States attorneys and the influence of White House political operatives on Federal law enforcement has led to resignations at the highest ranks in the Justice Department, including the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, the chiefs of staff of the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General, the White House liaison, as well as several White House officials.  When I met with Michael Mukasey before his confirmation hearing to replace Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General, I emphasized the need to fill the many vacancies that remain at the Department with nominees who will restore the independence of Federal law enforcement.  In the days before the congressional Thanksgiving recess, the White House made a show of releasing the names of a score of nominees for high-level positions in the Department of Justice. Yet, that announcement was mostly bluster. We received the nomination of Mark Filip to be the Deputy Attorney General nearly 3 full weeks after the announcement was made. Had the nomination been sent immediately following the White House announcement, the committee could have considered Judge Filip's nomination in early December. As it was, after a 3-week White House delay in sending up the nomination, I immediately set a hearing on his nomination for next Wednesday, December 19, once the Senate received it.  Nearly a month after the White House announced its intent to nominate Kevin O'Connor be the Associate Attorney General and Gregory Katsas to be the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division at the Department of Justice we have only now received those nominations. We have not yet been provided with their background materials to allow us to review them. Because of the administration's delay, we will not be able to consider those nominations before the end of the year.  The Judiciary Committee has reported 20 executive nominations this year. To make further progress, the committee is holding back-to-back hearings next week, before the Christmas break, on six nominations for senior leadership posts at the Justice Department and Executive Office of the President, including the recently received nomination to be Deputy Attorney General.  There are now 23 districts with acting or interim U.S. attorneys instead of Senate-confirmed, presidentially appointed U.S. attorneys, over a quarter of all districts. Many of these vacancies, including several for which we consider nominations today, could have been filled a year ago had the White House worked with the Senate.  In the course of the committee's investigation into the unprecedented mass firing of U.S. attorneys by the President who appointed them, we uncovered an effort by officials at the White House and the Justice Department to exploit an obscure provision enacted during the Patriot Act reauthorization to do an end-run around the Senate's constitutional duty to confirm U.S. attorneys. The result was the firing of well-performing U.S. attorneys for not bending to the political will of political operatives at the White House.  When it comes to the United States Department of Justice and to the U.S. attorneys in our home States, Senators have a say and a stake in ensuring fairness and independence in order to insulate the Federal law enforcement function from untoward political influence. That is why the law and the practice has always been that these appointments require Senate confirmation. The advice and consent check on the appointment power for U.S. attorneys is a critical function of the Senate.  I had hoped when the Senate unanimously voted to close the loophole created by the Patriot Act, passing S.214, the ``Preserving United States Attorneys Independence Act of 2007,'' it would send a clear message to the administration to make nominations that could receive Senate support and begin to restore an important check on the partisan influence in law enforcement.  Yet, even as we closed one loophole, the administration has been exploiting others to continue to avoid coming to the Senate. Under the guidance of an erroneous opinion of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, the administration has been naming acting U.S. attorneys and interim U.S. attorneys sequentially. They have used this misguided approach to put somebody in place for 330 days without the advice and consent of the Senate. This approach runs afoul of congressional intent and the law.  We will continue to make progress when we can, and I will continue to urge the White House to send the Senate consensus, qualified nominees. I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmation today.                          ____________________
