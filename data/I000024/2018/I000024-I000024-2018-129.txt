President, let me, first of all, join my friend from Illinois in this tribute he is making to Tammy and the baby. I do have to correct him on one thing, however. He talked about diaper bags. They don't use diaper bags anymore. They are disposable diapers. I know because I have 20 kids and grandkids. But I agree with the Senator's remarks wholeheartedly.                          ____________________
