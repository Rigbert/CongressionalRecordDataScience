Speaker, it is my honor to commend to you and my other colleagues a distinguished citizen of Indiana's First Congressional District, Mr. Robert Welsh, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer of Welsh Oil, Inc. Bob, whose executive office is located in Merrillville, IN, has used his ``grow or go'' philosophy to make his business the success that it is today.  While today Bob is the mainstay of Welsh Oil, Inc., his father founded the company on St. Patrick's Day in 1925 with a one-pump gas station located at 5th and Virginia in Gary, IN. Since then, the company has flourished, diversifying into convenience stores, four truck plazas, and an oil delivery service with a total of 57 locations in Indiana, Michigan, and Virginia. The Merrillville-based company grossed $151 million in sales last year. However, Bob gives credit for the success of his business to his dedicated, hardworking employees.  As if running a multi-million dollar company were not enough, Bob has donated his time and money to numerous causes and community service groups. Last year, Welsh Oil solicited $84,700 from the individual Welsh Oil stations while corporate donations brought the total donation to $100,000. In addition, Bob is on the boards of NIPSCO Industries Inc., NBD Bank's Merrillville Region, the Northwest Indiana Forum, the Northwest Indiana Entrepreneurship Academy, Zollner Industries, Lakeshore Health Systems, and Catholic Charities. He is also on the Board of Regents of St. Mary's College in Notre Dame and has served as chairman of St. Mary's School of Finance and Investment Committee.  As a result of Bob's charitable contributions to Northwest Indiana, Bob is one of three finalists for the Ernst & Young Illinois/Northwest Indiana ``Entrepreneur of the Year'' award that will be decided in December, 1995. To be considered for this distinguished award, one must be nominated by his colleagues or employees. This award recognizes entrepreneurs whose success is exemplified through their financial performance and personal commitment to their business or community.  However, this is not the first time that Bob's hard work and achievements have been recognized. Previously, he was awarded the Entrepreneurial Lifetime Achievement Award for the Northwest Indiana Small Business Development Center, the Asian-American Medical Society's Crystal Globe Award, and the President's Medal from St. Mary's College.  In between Bob's business and his community service, Bob has time to appreciate the finer things in life. Bob and I share a passion for the University of Notre Dame from which we both earned degrees. Bob is currently a trustee of the university and serves on three board of director committees. Notre Dame has recognized his contributions to the university by naming him Notre Dame's Man of the Year.  Bob is truly a remarkable man. Along with his professional and civic responsibilities, he and his wife, Kay, have also raised a wonderful family. Indeed, their proudest accomplishments are their five children. Mr. Speaker, I applaud Bob for successfully achieving the ``American Dream.'' May the future continue to hold great things in store for this fine man.                          ____________________
