 President, I rise today to introduce the Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis Act. This legislation would establish a small, professional office within the legislative branch charged with analyzing the potential impacts of Federal rules and regulations.  In April 1996, Congress passed and the President signed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Included in this legislation was a provision known as the Congressional Review Act or CRA which established an expedited process for Congress to review and disapprove Federal agency regulations. Under the CRA, agencies are required to send their final regulations to Congress 60 days before they take effect, and they can be overturned by a joint resolution of disapproval that is signed by the President. At the time of enactment, this law was hailed as a way to rein in agencies and prevent the implementation of costly regulations with few practical benefits.  The legislation that I am introducing would give Congress the tools to fully implement the CRA and reduce the regulatory drain on our economy. Under current law, the potential impacts of new regulations are not systematically evaluated--a fact that I think would come as a surprise to most of our constituents. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs within OMB reviews regulations only to ensure that they conform to Administration policies and current law and that they do not interfere with the actions of other Federal agencies. However, this office has performed these minimal calculations on only a small fraction of the new rules promulgated in recent years. In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) was given some additional responsibilities under the CRA. GAO must now submit to Congress a checklist citing which reports an agency has or has not completed when developing a new rule. These reports are often incomplete or nonexistent, and Congress has little recourse for obtaining factual information in these instances.  For these reasons, I believe that a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA) is essential to allowing Congress to fulfill its oversight obligations. At present, Congress does not have any resources for objectively evaluating the potential costs and benefits of new regulations. CORA can provide those resources. While the executive branch has thousands of employees devoted solely to creating and enforcing regulations, Congress has few means of effectively overseeing those rules. Our committee staffs are already stretched to their limits, and they cannot possibly study and evaluate each and every regulation that comes out. We need a professional staff that is charged with analyzing regulations and providing Congress with its findings. By gaining access to this valuable information, Congress will then be able to decide whether or not to pursue further action under the CRA.  Specifically, CORA would analyze both the monetary and non-monetary effects of all new major regulations. Non-major rules would be evaluated at the request of committees or individual Members of Congress. In addition to providing information on costs and benefits, which are very important, CORA's analyses would also explore possible alternative approaches to achieving the same goals as the proposed regulation at a lower cost. Finally, this office would issue an annual report on the total cost of Federal regulations to the United States economy.  I believe that anything which costs the average American family $6,800 peryear warrants very careful Congressional examination. Without the objective information that CORA can provide, oversight cannot properly be carried out.  Senator Bond, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, has joined me as a cosponsor of this legislation. I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in establishing this office in order to ensure that future regulations do not place unnecessary burdens on the American public.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1675       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Office of      Regulatory Analysis Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) Federal regulations can have a positive impact in      protecting the environment and the health and safety of all      Americans; however, uncontrolled increases in the costs that      regulations place on the economy cannot be sustained;       (2) the legislative branch has a responsibility to see that      the laws it passes are properly implemented by the executive      branch;       (3) effective implementation of chapter 8 of title 5 of the      United States Code (relating to congressional review of      agency rulemaking) is essential to controlling the regulatory      burden that the Government places on the economy; and       (4) in order for the legislative branch to fulfill its      responsibilities under chapter 8 of title 5, United States      Code, it must have accurate and reliable information on which      to base its decisions.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a      congressional office to provide Congress with independent,      timely, and reasoned analyses of existing and anticipated      Federal rules and regulations, including--       (1) assessments of the need for, and effectiveness of,      existing and anticipated Federal rules and regulations in      meeting the mandates of underlying statutes;       (2) statements of the existing and projected economic and      noneconomic impacts, including the impacts of reporting      requirements, of such rules and regulations; and       (3) separate assessments of the effects of existing and      anticipated regulations on segments of the public, such as      geographic regions and small entities.     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE.       (a) Establishment.--       (1) In general.--There is established a Congressional      Office of Regulatory Analysis (hereafter in this Act referred      to as the ``Office'').
