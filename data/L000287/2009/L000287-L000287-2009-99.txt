Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Scott for yielding. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution that I introduced that supports National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Week.  Let me begin by thanking Chairman Conyers and Chairman Scott and all of the staff who worked so hard to bring this resolution to the floor. Youth dating violence is a trend that is spreading across our country. It does not discriminate based on race, sex, class, or sexual orientation.                              {time}  1530  In 2005 many of my colleagues and I mourned the loss of April Love. She was an outstanding Congressional Black Caucus Foundation summer intern from Arkansas who was killed by her boyfriend. April was really a shining star, a southern belle, with a heart of gold and a brain to match.  In the past few years, metro Atlanta witnessed similar, terrible incidents of youth dating violence. In separate cases, two teenage girls were shot and killed by their abusive boyfriends.  Some relationships that begin innocently enough soon spiral out of control, and no one has any idea how they missed the signs. And technology has made it easier for abusive relationships to go undetected by parents and loved ones.  We must bring attention to this unbelievable series of incidents that are spreading around our country. Fear, stalking, violence, and abuse are unacceptable and always shocking.  Madam Speaker, we must break this chain and educate young people about the importance of developing healthy relationships.  During this week, I urge all of my colleagues to educate themselves and all of their citizens about this important issue.
