  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, at this very moment, the Federal Reserve is ensconced in their marble palace downtown meeting in secret, eating a catered breakfast off of fine china, all paid for by the taxpayer.  They are deciding how high, how much, how often to raise interest rates to combat inflation that does not exist.  They are about to raise the rates on credit cards for tens of millions of Americans, auto loans for tens of millions of Americans, mortgages for tens of millions of Americans?  Why? Because they said they are worried about the stock bubble on Wall Street.                              {time}  1015  But instead of using their awesome power to go directly at the speculators and the rampant speculation on Wall Street, they are going to take a whack at Main Street in the hope that the pain and the message exacted on average consumers filters up to the speculators on Wall Street. This is a bizarre new twist in economics.  It is time to pull back the curtain of secrecy and reveal the profundity of the Federal Reserve working in the interests of the privileged few at the expense of the majority in this country.                          ____________________
