It is not just the basic injustice and unfairness of saying you will not give the hardest working, lowest paid Americans any increase in their hourly wage unless you give the wealthiest Americans a tax break that, frankly, only but a few of them have asked for.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, the outcome of this deal--if they pull it off--will increase the debt of America, will increase the money we have to borrow from China and Japan and Korea and Saudi Arabia, will leave a greater debt for our children so the Republican dream of reducing the estate tax for the wealthiest people in America will come true. Does the Senator from Nevada think that increasing America's debt, cutting taxes in the midst of a war, is sound evidence of fiscal conservatism?
