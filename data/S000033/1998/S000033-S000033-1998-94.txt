 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Before I make my presentation, I would like to ask the gentlewoman a question. As I understand it, the gentlewoman will have four Independents as part of the commission. As the only Independent in Congress, that issue is of some significance to me.  We know how Democrats and Republicans might be appointed. Ross Perot is not the only Independent in America. Some of us do not have many billions of dollars but also consider ourselves Independents. How would those Independents be selected?
