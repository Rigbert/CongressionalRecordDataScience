President, I rise to introduce the Global Coordination of HIV/AIDS Response Act, known as the Global CARE Act. HIV/AIDS is a national security issue, an economic issue, a health and safety issue, and most importantly a moral issue. It is for these reasons I am proposing comprehensive legislation to address the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. This bill will not solve all these problems. But it does set the bar where the need is, and it does offer innovative ideas to address the global AIDS crisis in a strategic, coordinated, accountable manner.  Since the tragedy of September 11, we have all been focused on combating the war on terrorism, and rightfully so. But as we all know, perhaps even more clearly since September, fighting and preventing terrorism, preparing for and preventing bioterrorist attacks, maintaining international stability, and promoting global economic cooperation and growth require not only a military and political response but also a social and humanitarian effort.  Today's reality is a world in which geographical borders seem to hold less and less significance. As we work to maintain economic prosperity and safety in our own Nation, we must face the fact that globalization is upon us. This has never been more true than in the case of disease. The HIV/AIDS pandemic, tuberculosis and other life threatening infectious diseases know no borders. They cannot be prevented by a missile defense system. We cannot halt the spread of AIDS with bombing raids.  Whether deliberately spread as a man made bioterrorist threats or a naturally occurring, infectious diseases are a pressing national security issue. A CIA report last year noted the link between disease and political chaos, saying that rampant AIDS, tuberculosis and other infectious illnesses were ``likely to aggravate, and in some cases, may even provoke, economic decay, social fragmentation and political destabilization in the hardest hit countries.''  The epidemic is not confined to Africa. HIV has reached epidemic proportions in India. The World Bank estimates that if effective prevention efforts are not implemented immediately and sustained, India could have more than 37 million people infected with HIV by the year 2005. This is roughly equal to the total number of HIV infections in the world today. The AIDS epidemic is sweeping across Eastern Europe, where HIV infection rates are rising faster in the former Soviet Union than anywhere else in the world according to a U.N. Report on AIDS. The Baltic nation of Estonia reported 10 times as many new infections last year as it did in 1999. In China, the number of people living with AIDS now tops one million. This is a moral issue that cannot be ignored.  The rising rates of infection and the rising death toll are draining national budgets and depriving local economies of their workforce. Last November United Nations officials predicted that some of the most affected African nations could lose more than 20 percent of their Gross Domestic Product, GDP, by 2020 because of AIDS. Recent studies by the World Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health show that infections and disease are not only the product of poverty; they also create poverty. By investing in health in developing countries we can save lives and produce clear and measurable financial returns. For example, the Commission reported that well-targeted spending of shared among nations in the amount of $66 billion a year by 2015 could save as many as 8 million lives a year and generate six-fold economic benefits, more than $360 billion a year by 2020.  AIDS is also the single largest contributor to a worldwide resurgence in Tuberculosis, TB. The spread of TB in the developing world has a direct effect on the health and safety of Americans. Last month, forty-eight people in Mobile, Alabama, tested positive for exposure to tuberculosis, three weeks after a graduate student at Spring Hill College died of the disease. The Student, from Nairobi, Kenya, is thought to have contracted TB before coming to the U.S. Also last month, health officials in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, announced they were treating five people for drug-resistant TB. All were immigrants from countries where TB flourishes. Just last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the number of new cases of TB in this country declined in 2000 but the number of cases occurring in the foreign-born U.S. population increased. The point is clear: we cannot maintain our own safety if we neglect the health needs of the developing world.  For all these reasons--national security, economic stability, public health, and our moral obligation, I have introduced the Global CARE Act. It is critically important that we demonstrate the political will to act on this issue. I think it would be productive for Congress to establish clear policy goals and funding targets that represent the real need. It is also our job to ensure that there is accountability for the money that we appropriate, and that we are able to articulate the results of our U.S. investment. It is my hope that by doing this we will secure a serious, effective financial commitment that to date has been woefully inadequate.  The Global Coordination of HIV/AIDS Response Act is grounded in the principles of leadership and accountability.  The policy goals I have set forth in this bill are the following: better coordination among the myriad of U.S. agencies active in the global AIDS fight; a more focused strategic planning initiative that makes the best use of U.S bilateral assistance; increased accountability for the health and policy objectives we seek to achieve with our financial and human investment in AIDS-ravaged countries; the ability to mobilize the most effective human and capacity-building tools to provide some of the building blocks that are needed; and a clear articulation of the broader issues that need to be addressed to have a real impact on HIV/AIDS, including not just prevention but treatment and care, and not just health initiatives but also economic investments.  The Global CARE Act provides specific funding authorizations for the key agencies working on global AIDS, as well as for the Global Fund. Both bilateral and multilateral assistance is needed to address this problem. Before the Leadership and Investment in Fighting and Epidemic, LIFE, initiative authorized USAID to conduct activities specifically focused on global AIDS in FY2000, there was little direction from Congress on this issue. And up until the United Nations and President Bush specifically requested money for the Global Fund, there was little agreement about what was needed. It is now time for Congress to step up to the plate and provide some direction.  The authorized funding levels in the Global CARE Act represent a need thathas been well documented. The World Health Organization's Marcoeconomics and Health Commission has determined that by 2007, the international community--donor and affected countries--should be spending $14 billion in response to the AIDS pandemic. Last year, the United Nations called for roughly $10 billion annually.  America has by far the greatest giving capacity, yet we devote the smallest percentage of our overall wealth to efforts aimed at alleviating global poverty and disease. Last year the United States gave one-tenth of 1 percent of its GNP to foreign aid--or $1 for every thousand dollars of its wealth, the lowest giving rate of any rich nation. By comparison, Canada, Japan, Austria, Australia and Germany each gave about one-quarter of 1 percent, of $2.50 for every thousand dollars of wealth. Many other countries give even more, at rates 8 to 10 times higher than the United States. Based on its share of global GNP, the United States should contribute at least 25 percent of the total AIDS response cost in 2003. Twenty-five percent of the estimated $10 billion needed next year would be $2.5 billion. Hundreds of civic groups and religious leaders have joined together, calling on Congress to provide at least $2.5 billion to combat the pandemic.  The Global CARE Act establishes broad policy goals and activities that are embodied in an international HIV/AIDS Prevention and Capacity Building Initiative and an International Care and Treatment Access Initiative. These goals and activities, which range from education, voluntary testing and counseling, to helping preserve families and ameliorate the orphan crisis, are not parceled out to the various agencies we know are actively engaged in this issue such as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Rather this legislation generally relies on the existing authorities of the agencies to carry out these broad activities with the requirement that they coordinate their activities with each other and with host country needs and host country plans.  The development of a coordinated, effective, and sustained plan for U.S. bilateral aid in relation to multilateral aid and other nation's bilateral aid is paramount. The U.S. has the opportunity to provide the requisite leadership in this global effort though operating strategically, and in an accountable and transparent manner.  To provide an incentive for such coordination, the bill establishes an interagency working group charged with ensuring that global HIV/AIDS activities are conducted in a coordinated, strategic fashion. Members of this working group include agencies within the Department of State, specifically USAID; agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and the National Institutes of Health; the Department of Defense, Labor, Commerce and Agriculture, and the Peace Corps.  This is policy working group with representatives from the agency programs doing the real work. It is my intention that the working group help to ensure that the various agencies we fund to provide bi-lateral assistance are making the most of the money we appropriate; that they are not duplicating efforts; that they are learning from each others' programmatic experience and research in order to implement the best practices; and that they are accountable to Congress and the American people for achieving measurable goals and objectives. In fact, the function of this group is very similar to the interagency working group established in H.R. 2069--legislation that passed the House of Representatives last year.  The Global CARE Act very specifically directs the working group to report back to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the Senate Appropriations Committee, and the corresponding Committees in the House of Representatives, with the following information: 1. The actions being taken to coordinate multiple roles and policies, and foster collaboration among Federal agencies contributing to the global HIV/AIDS activities; 2. A description of the respective roles and activities of each of the working group member agencies; 3. A description of actions taken to carry out the goals and activities authorized in the International AIDS Prevention and Capacity Building Imitative and the International AIDS Care and Treatment Access Initiative set out in the legislation; 4. Recommendation to specific Congressional committees regarding legislative and funding actions that are needed carry out the activities articulated in the bill; and 5. The results of the HIV/AIDS goals and outcomes as established by the working group. In my view, only by requiring very specific reporting requirements will the working group actually work.  The Global CARE Act includes a number of other provisions. Some have been discussed on the Hill, others have not. It authorizes a Global Physician Corps to utilize the human capital we have in our working and retired physicians by providing a mechanism for them to serve overseas where their expertise is so needed.  The bill authorizes a small amount for USAID to work on development and implementing initiatives to improve injection safety. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year the overuse of injections and unsafe injections combine to cause an estimated 8 to 16 million hepatitis B virus infections, 2.3 million to 4.7 million hepatitis C infections and 80,000 to 160,000 HIV infections. Together, these chronic infections are responsible for an estimated 10 million new infections, more than 1.8 million deaths, 26 million years of life lost, and more than $535 million in direct medical costs.  It includes a new pilot program to provide a limited procurement of antirectoriviral drugs and technical assistance to programs in host countries. And it includes a very important orphan relief and microcredit component that acknowledges that addressing the AIDS problem requires both an economic and social investment in women and families.  I hope my colleagues will consider the framework and policy I have developed as we work to introduce a unified proposal to address the HIV/AIDS problem. Tackling this pandemic will take more than one good bill--it will take a concerted effort to combine the best ideas and realistic initaitives to get the job done.                          ____________________
