But, if you will indulge me, I also understand that other radars have to be put in place beyond Cobra Dane, beyond the Aegis systems that they have not yet put in place. There are other elements that have to be in place for a more comprehensive system.  The other point on which I raise a question is the simple fact reflected in Mr. Christie's letter. This isn't a question of logic as much as technology. He seems to be saying the system is so premature or has a lack of maturity such that you can't do operational testing. I must say, I find it difficult, then, to say we can't do operational testing but we are going to put it in operation. That is the situation we face in September. But that is more of a comment than a question.  I thank the Senator for his kindness.
