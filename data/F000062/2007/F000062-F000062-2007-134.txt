  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 Section by Section                     Analysis and Legislative History                   Title I Closing the Revolving Door     Section 101. Amendments to restrictions on former officers,          employees and elected officials of the executive and          legislative branches       This section prohibits very senior executive personnel from      lobbying the department or agency in which they worked for 2      years after they leave their position. It bans Senators from      lobbying Congress for 2 years after they leave office and      bans senior Senate staff and officers from lobbying the      Senate for 1 year after they leave Senate employment. Senior      employees of the Senate are those who, for at least 60 days,      during the 1-year period before they leave Senate employment,      are paid a rate of basic pay equal to or greater than 75      percent of the basic rate of pay payable to a Senator.      Section 101 also makes technical and conforming changes to 18      U.S.C. Sec. 207(e).     Section 102. Wrongfully influencing a private entity's          employment decisions or practices       Section 102 prohibits members from influencing hiring      decisions of private organizations on the sole basis of      partisan political gain. It subjects those who violate this      provision to a fine and imprisonment for up to 15 years. This      section is not intended to preclude Senators from providing      references or writing letters of recommendation that speak to      the credentials of an individual.     Section 103. Notification of post-employment restrictions       This provision directs the Clerk of the House and the      Secretary of the Senate to inform Members, officers, and      employees of the beginning and end dates of their post-     employment lobbying restrictions under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 207. It      also requires the Clerk and Secretary to post such      notifications on their Internet sites.     Section 104. Exception to restrictions on former officers,          employees, and elected officials of the executive and          legislative branch       This section removes any confusion as to whether lobbying      rules apply to former federal legislative and executive      senior staffers who go to work for Indian tribes, tribal      organizations and inter-tribal consortia immediately after      their federal employment.       The amended tribal provision applies lobbying restrictions      to those former federal employees who do not work directly      for tribes or the exempted tribal entities or who represent      an entity in an unofficial capacity or on non-governmental      matters.       Section 104 removes any ambiguity that federal employees      who are assigned to Indian tribes, tribal organizations or      inter-tribal consortia may represent the Indian entity before      a federal agency, department or court without violating      lobbying laws. Further, this section removes any ambiguity      that only those former federal executive and legislative      branch employees who go to work for tribes, tribal      organizations and inter-tribal consortia and who perform      official governmental duties associated with tribal      governmental activities or Indian programs and services are      exempt from lobbying laws.     Under the provision, only ``tribal organizations'' (for      example, a tribal or village governing body) or ``inter-     tribal consortia'' (defined as, a coalition of tribes who      join to undertake self-governance activities) may employ      former officials, who may be exempted. And, only employees of      these entities who act on behalf of these entities and who      participate in matters related to a tribal governmental      activity or federal Indian program or service may be      exempted.       Importantly, the amendment preserves federal policy that      encourages former federal employees to go to work directly      for Indian tribes and tribal organizations that provide      governmental services.     Section 105. Effective date       The effective date for section 101 is for individuals that      leave federal office or employment on or after the date of      adjournment of the first session of the 110th Congress sine      die, or December 31, 2007, whichever is earlier. Section 102      will become effective upon enactment. Section 103 requires      the Secretary to begin issuing notifications after 60 days,      and all notifications must be published on the Internet as of      January 1, 2008. Section 104 goes into effect upon enactment;      however the post-employment restrictions go into effect for      individuals that leave federal employment on or after 60 days      after enactment.       The new ``revolving door'' restrictions are effective only      for officials or employees that terminate office or      employment on or after the relevant effective date. A delayed      effective date was deemed more reasonable and practical than      an immediate effective date.              Title II Full Public Disclosure of Lobbying     Section 201. Quarterly filing of lobbying disclosure reports       Section 201 increases the frequency of lobbying disclosure      reports from semiannually to quarterly filings, with required      adjustments to dates, thresholds, etc. A number of practical      consequences result from the changes in section 201. For      instance, exempted from filing are those whose total income      from lobbying activities does not exceed $2,500 or for whom      total expenses in connection with lobbying activities do not      exceed $10,000. The changes in the section decrease the      threshold amounts that trigger required disclosures of earned      income or expenses from clients on lobbyist disclosure      reports from $10,000 to $5,000, and require registrants to      round income and expenses to the nearest $10,000.     Section 202. Additional disclosure       This provision requires that lobbyists disclose whether      their client is a State or local government or a department,      agency, or other instrumentality of a state or local      government on their reports filed under the Lobbying      Disclosure Act.     Section 203. Semiannual reports on certain contributions       This section requires lobbyists to disclose semiannually      their name, their employer, the names of all political      committees that they established or control, the name of each      Federal candidate, officeholder, leadership PAC or political      party committee to whom they have contributed more than $200      in that semiannual period, payments for events honoring or      recognizing federal officials, payments to an entity named in      honor of a covered federal official or to a person or entity      in recognition of such official, payments made to      organizations controlled by such official, or payments made      to pay the costs of retreats, conferences or similar events      held by or in the name of one or more covered federal      officials, and contributions to Presidential library      foundations and Presidential inaugural committees in that      semiannual period. To avoid duplicative reporting, the bill      provides an exception for payments made to committees      regulated by the Federal Election Commission with respect to      the provisions relating to disclosure of payments made to      events honoring or recognizing federal officials, to entities      named in honor or recognition of federal officials, to      organizations controlled by such officials, and to pay the      costs of meetings, etc. held by officials. All of this      information would already be reported elsewhere under      provisions in this bill or under reporting required by the      Federal Election Commission Act.       Section 203 also requires a certification by the lobbyist      filing the disclosure report that the person is familiar with      House and Senate gift and travel rules, and has not provided,      requested, or directed a gift, including a gift of travel, to      a Member, officer, or employee of Congress with knowledge      that receipt of the gift would violate the relevant rules.       The bill directs the Clerk of the House and the Secretary      of the Senate to submit a report to Congress on the      feasibility of requiring such reports to be made on a      quarterly rather than semiannual basis and expresses the      sense of Congress in favor of moving to quarterly reporting      in the future if it is practically feasible to do so. After      the report is filed by the Clerk and the Secretary, an      affirmative vote of Congress will be required to alter the      frequency of the filing period.     Section 204. Disclosure of bundled contributions       This section requires certain political committees to      disclose to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) the name,      address and employer of each current registered lobbyist who      has provided the committee with bundled contributions in      excess of $15,000 in each six month period defined      in statute. The aggregate amount of contributions is      measured on a non-cumulative basis in each six month      period.       The definition of ``bundled contribution'' in this section      contains two prongs. Subparagraph 204(a)(8)(A)(i) covers the      situation where a lobbyist physically forwards contributions      to the campaign. Subparagraph 204(a)(8)(A)(ii) covers the      situation where contributions are sent directly by      contributors to the committee, but where the committee or      candidate credits a registered lobbyist for generating the      contributions and where such credit is reflected in some form      of record, designation or recognition. An example of such      designations would include honorary titles within the      committee; examples of such recognition include access to      certain events reserved exclusively for those who generate a      certain level of contributions or similar benefits provided      by the committee as a reward for successful fundraising.       The disclosure requirement is not triggered by general      solicitations of contributions, or where a registered      lobbyist attends an event or an event is held on the premises      of a registrant. An event hosted by a registered lobbyist may      trigger the disclosure requirement if the committee credits      the lobbyist with the proceeds of the fundraiser through      record, designation or other form of recognition, as      described in the preceding paragraph.       This provision covers only contributions credited to      registered lobbyists, as defined in subsection 204(a)(7).      Contributions credited to others, including others who may      share a common employer with, or work for a lobbyist, are not      covered by this section so long as any credit is genuinely      received by the non-lobbyist and not the lobbyist.       Subparagraph 204(a)(8)(A)(ii) requires that the      contribution be credited by the committee or ``candidate      involved.'' The candidate ``involved'' in the case of a      principal campaign committee is the candidate for whom the      committee is the principal campaign committee; the candidate      ``involved'' in the case of a Leadership PAC is the candidate      who directly or indirectly establishes, finances, maintains      or controls the Leadership PAC; and the candidate      ``involved'' in the case of a political party committee is      the chairman of the committee.       The definition of ``Leadership PAC'' in 204(a)(8)(B) is      intended to recognize the FEC rule on a related topic at 68      Fed. Reg. 67013 (December 1, 2003)--a Leadership PAC      associated with a given Member of Congress is not deemed to      be ``affiliated'' with that office holder's principal      campaign committee for purpose of contribution or expenditure      limits under the Federal Election Campaign Act.     Section 205. Electronic filing of lobbying disclosure reports       Section 205 requires lobbying disclosure reports to be      filed in electronic form, and directs the Clerk of the House      and Secretary of the Senate to use the same electronic      software for receipt and recording of the filings.     Section 206. Prohibition on provision of gifts or travel by          lobbyists that are registered or required to register          under the LDA, to Members of Congress and to          congressional employees       This provision prohibits registrants and lobbyists from      providing gifts or travel to covered legislative branch      officials with knowledge that the gift or travel is in      violation of House or Senate rules.     Section 207. Disclosure of lobbying activities by certain          coalitions and associations       This section amends existing rules in section 4(b)(3) of      the Lobbying Disclosure Act requiring reporting of      ``affiliated organizations.'' The bill closes a loophole that      has allowed so-called ``stealth coalitions,'' often with      innocuous-sounding names, to operate without identifying the      interests engaged in the lobbying activities. Section 207      requires registrants to disclose the identity of any      organization, other than the client, that contributes more      than $5,000 toward the registrant's lobbying activities      (either directly to the registrant or indirectly through the      client) in a quarterly period and actively participates in      the planning, supervision, or control of such lobbying      activities.       The new provision includes several exceptions to narrow the      rule. First, it does not require disclosure of an      organization or entity that would otherwise be identified if      the client already lists the organization or entity as a      member or contributor on its publicly-accessible website. In      such cases, the registrant must report the specific web page      that includes the relevant information. If the entity would      have been disclosed under the existing rule 4(b)(3) language      (as adjusted, i.e., the entity contributes $5,000 per quarter      to the lobbying activities and in whole or in major part      plans, supervises, or controls the lobbying activities),      however, that entity must still be disclosed. Second, the new      rule makes clear that it does not require disclosure of      individuals that are members of or donors to a client or an      entity identified as an affiliated entity.       The provision requires disclosure only of organizations or      entities that ``actively participate'' in the planning,      supervision, or control of the lobbying activities described      in the report. Entities or organizations that have only a      passive role--e.g., mere donors, mere recipients of      information and reports, etc.--would not be considered to be      ``actively participating'' in the lobbying activities.     Section 208. Disclosure by registered lobbyists of past          executive branch and congressional employment       This provision amends the requirement under the Lobbying      Disclosure Act that lobbyists disclose their executive or      legislative employment in the preceding two years.      Specifically, section 208 extends the disclosure to include      executive and legislative branch employment in the preceding      20 years.     Section 209. Public availability of lobbying disclosure          information; maintenance of information       Section 209 directs the Secretary of the Senate and the      Clerk of the House to maintain and provide online access to      an electronic database in a searchable, sortable, and      downloadable manner, that includes the information contained      in registrations and reports filed under this Act for a      period of 6 years after they are filed and provides an      electronic link to relevant information in the database of      the Federal Election Commission.     Section 210. Disclosure of enforcement for noncompliance       This section requires the Secretary of the Senate and the      Clerk of the House to publicly disclose on a semi annual      basis the aggregate number of lobbyists and lobbying firms      referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia      for noncompliance with the Lobbying Disclosure Act. It also      requires the Attorney General to report semiannually to      Congress on the aggregate number of enforcement actions taken      by the Department of Justice under the Lobbying Disclosure      Act and the amount of fines and prison sentences imposed.     Section 211. Increased civil and criminal penalties for          failure to comply with lobbying disclosure requirements       Section 211 increases the civil penalty for violations of      the Lobby Disclosure Act from $50,000 to $200,000. It imposes      a criminal penalty of up to five years for knowing and      corrupt failure to comply with the Act.     Section 212. Electronic filing and public database for          lobbyists for foreign governments       This provision amends the Foreign Agents Registration Act      (FARA) to require that mandatory registration statements or      updates be filed electronically, in addition to any other      form that may be required by the Attorney General. It      requires the Attorney General to maintain a searchable and      sortable electronic database, made publicly available on the      Internet, that includes the information contained in      registration statements and updates filed under FARA.     Section 213. Comptroller general audit and annual report       Under Section 213, the Comptroller General will annually      review random samples of publicly-available registrations and      reports filed by lobbyists, lobbying firms, and registrants      and evaluate compliance by those individuals and entities      with the Lobbying Disclosure Act--i.e., it will review the      same registrations and reports that are available to the      public. The GAO is required to report annually to Congress on      its findings. The report will include recommendations to      Congress on improving compliance and providing the Department      of Justice with the resources and authorities necessary for      effective enforcement. Under this provision, it is intended      that the GAO audit lobbyist compliance with the Lobbying      Disclosure Act; the provision does not give the GAO authority      to audit the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the      House's activities under the LDA, including receipt,      compilation, dissemination and/or review of information filed      under the LDA.       Section 213(c) authorizes the Comptroller General to      request and receive information from lobbyists, lobbying      firms and registrants. This section provides the Comptroller      General with the tools necessary to evaluate whether the      information included by lobbyists, lobbying firms and      registrants in the reports filed under this Act is accurate      and complete, and thus whether these individuals and entities      are complying with the Act. Nothing in this section provides      authority for the GAO to obtain information protected by the      attorney-client privilege.     Section 214. Sense of Congress regarding lobbying by          immediate family members       Section 214 expresses the Sense of Congress that the use of      family relationships by a lobbyist who is an immediate family      member of a Member of Congress to gain special advantage over      another lobbyist is inappropriate.     Section 215. Effective date       Sections 201, 202, 205, 207, 208, 209 and 210 apply to      information in periods on or after January 1, 2008, and for      subsequent registrations and reports. Section 203 goes into      effect on the first semi-annual reporting period that begins      after enactment. Section 204 goes into effect 90 days after      the FEC has promulgated final regulations. Sections 206 and      211 go into effect upon enactment. Section 212 goes into      effect 90 days after enactment. Section 213 requires the      first audit to be done with respect to filings in the first      calendar quarter of 2008 and the report to Congress be      completed within 6 months after that quarter, with annual      reports thereafter.                 Title III Standing Rules of the House       Title III includes changes to the Rules of the House.      Information provided with respect to Title III simply      summarizes the provisions of the Act and is not meant to be      authoritative legislative history with respect to the      provisions in that Title.     Section 301. Disclosure by Members and staff of employment          negotiations       This provision prohibits House Members from engaging in any      agreements or negotiations with regard to future employment      or salary until his or her successor has been selected unless      he or she, within three business days after the commencement      of such negotiations or agreements, files a signed statement      disclosing the nature of such negotiations or agreements, the      name of the private entity or entities involved, and the date      such negotiations commenced with the Committee on Standards      of Official Conduct. It requires that Members recuse      themselves from any matter in which there is a conflict of      interest or an appearance of a conflict, and that Members      submit a statement of disclosure to the Clerk for public      release in the event that such a recusal is made. It requires      senior staff to notify the Committee on Standards of Official      Conduct within three days if they engage in negotiations or      agreements for future employment or compensation.     Section 302. Prohibition on lobbying contacts with spouse of          Member who is a registered lobbyist       Section 302 amends House Rules to require that Members      prohibit their staff from having any lobbying contact with      the Member's spouse if such individual is a registered      lobbyist or is employed or retained by a registered lobbyist      to influence legislation.     Section 303. Treatment of firms and other businesses whose          members serve as House committee consultants       This section clarifies that when a person is serving as a      House committee consultant, other members and employees of      that person's employing firm, partnership, or other business      organization, shall be subject to the same lobbying      restrictions that apply to that individual under the Rules.     Section 304. Posting of travel and financial disclosure          reports on public website of Clerk of the House of          Representatives       Section 304 directs the Clerk of the House of      Representatives to develop a publicly available, searchable,      sortable and downloadable website by August 1, 2008 to post      Members' travel information that is required to be disclosed      under rule XXV of the Rules of the House of Representatives.       It directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives to      post on a publicly available website by August 1, 2008      Members' financial disclosure reports required to be filed      under section 103(h)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act.      Allows Members to omit personally identifiable information      from these forms.     Section 305. Participation in lobbyist sponsored events          during political conventions       This section prohibits Members from attending parties held      in their honor at national party conventions if they have      been directly paid for by lobbyists, unless the Member is the      party's presidential or vice presidential nominee.     Section 306. Exercise of rulemaking authority       This provision acknowledges that the House adopts the      provisions in this title as an exercise of its rule making      power with full recognition of the constitutional right of      the House to change those rules at any time.             Title IV Congressional Pension Accountability     Section 401. Loss of pensions accrued during service as a          Member of Congress for abusing the public trust       Section 401 prohibits Members from receiving their pension      earned while serving in Congress if convicted of bribery,      perjury, conspiracy or other related crimes in the course of      carrying out their official duties as a Member of Congress.       Title V Senate Legislative Transparency and Accountability     Section 511. Amendments to Rule XXVIII       Section 511 amends certain provisions of Rule XXVIII of the      Standing Rules of the Senate, and adds a new provision to the      Rule. Rule XXVIII currently provides for a point of order to      be made against a conference report if the conferees add      ``new matter'' ``not committed to them by either House.''      (The current rule also includes language purporting to      prevent conferees from ``strik[ing] from the bill matter      agreed to by both Houses.'' The bill authors, in consultation      with the Parliamentarian, could not identify a situation in      which this language could ever have effect. When there are      amendments in disagreement, the conferees have no authority      over matter not in disagreement, and thus could not strike      such material. When a disagreement to any amendment,      including an amendment in the nature of a substitute, has      been referred to conferees, nothing has been ``agreed to by      both Houses.'') As Rule XXVIII notes, conferees may include      in their report matter which is a germane modification of      subjects in disagreement, and the amendments made in this      section do not change that rule.       Section 511 does, however, change the parliamentary      consequences if conferees violate the rule by adding new      matter. Rule XXVIII currently provides a very blunt      instrument--if a point of order is sustained, the conference      report is rejected or recommitted to the conference if the      House has not already acted. Because many times the House      will have already acted, successful invocation of Rule XXVIII      would often spell the death knell for legislation. This      result has two negative consequences. When successfully      invoked, Rule XXVIII may derail legislation     that otherwise has strong bipartisan support. At the same      time, because of the dramatic consequences from making a      point of order under Rule XXVIII, it is rarely invoked. In      fact, some Senators believe that the very blunt nature of      Rule XXVIII has provided conferees more leeway to add new      matter on ``must pass'' bills.       Section 511 amends the current Rule XXVIII point of order      in two ways. First, it changes Rule XXVIII from a blunt      instrument to a ``surgical'' one--if new matter is added by      conferees, then a point of order may be made and, if      successful, the new matter shall be struck, and the Senate      will then proceed to consider whether to concur in the bill      as so amended by the removal of the material stricken on the      point(s) of order, and send it back to the House. Second,      Section 511 adds the possibility of 60-vote waivers for      points of order under the rule. The language in Section 511      is similar to that used in the so-called ``Byrd'' rule and is      intended to be interpreted similarly--waivers may be as to      one, multiple, or all points of order under the rule; waivers      may be made after a point of order has been raised or      prospectively. Section 511 also ensures that appeals from      rulings of the Chair may be sustained only by an affirmative      vote of three-fifths of all Senators (generally, 60 votes).       Separately, Section 511 adds a new paragraph 9 to Rule      XXVIII, which requires that all conference reports be posted      on a publicly accessible website controlled by Congress 48      hours prior to the vote on adoption of the conference report,      as reported to the Presiding Officer by the Secretary of the      Senate. This new rule is enforceable via a point of order,      which may be waived by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of      all Senators. The requirements of the rule may be fulfilled      by posting the conference report on any publicly accessible      website controlled by a Member of Congress, committee of      either the House or Senate, the Library of Congress, another      office of the House, the Senate, or Congress, or the      Government Printing Office. Section 511 directs the Committee      on Rules and Administration, in consultation with the      Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, and the      GPO to issue regulations to help harmonize practice among      conference committees for the convenience of Senators and the      public. Paragraph 9 may be waived by an affirmative vote of      three-fifths of all Senators. Waivers may be made after a      point of order is made or prospectively.       Under well-established Senate precedent, a new directed      spending provision added in conference does not constitute      ``new matter'' if it relates to the matter in conference. The      modifications to rule XXVIII do not change the well-     established rule. The new rule XLIV includes a separate      provision relating to the addition of ``new directed spending      provisions'' in conference.     Section 512. Notice of objecting to proceeding       Section 512 relates to the concept of so-called ``secret      holds.'' Section 512 provides that the Majority Leader or      Minority Leader or their designees shall recognize another      Senator's notice of intent to object to proceeding to a      measure or matter subsequent to the six-day period described      below only if that other Senator complies with the provisions      of this section. Under the procedure described in section      512, after an objection has been made to a unanimous consent      request to proceeding to or passage of a measure on behalf of      a Senator, that Senator must submit the notice of intent to      object in writing to his or her respective leader, and within      6 session days after that submit a notice of intent to      object, to be published in the Congressional Record and on a      special calendar entitled ``Notice of Intent to Object to      Proceeding.'' The Senator may specify the reasons for the      objection if the Senator wishes.       If the Senator notifies the Majority Leader or Minority      Leader (as the case may be) that he or she has withdrawn the      notice of intent to object prior to the passage of 6 session      days, then no notification need be submitted. A notice once      filed may be removed after the objecting Senator submits to      the Congressional Record a statement that he or she no longer      objects to proceeding.     Section 513. Public availability of Senate committee and          subcommittee meetings       Section 513 requires that, 90 days after enactment, Senate      committees and subcommittees shall make available through the      Internet a video recording, an audio recording or a      transcript of all public meetings of the committee not later      than 21 business days after the meeting occurs. This      requirement may be waived by the Rules Committee upon request      should the committee or subcommittee be unable to comply due      to technical or logistical issues. To be issued a waiver, a      committee will be expected to prove that none of the three      means of recording a committee meeting are technically or      logistically feasible in the space that the meeting is being      held.     Section 514. Amendments and motions to recommit       Section 514 amends Rule XV of the Senate to require that an      amendment and any instruction accompanying a motion to      recommit be reduced to writing and read, and that identical      copies be provided to the desks and the Majority and Minority      Leaders before being debated. Section 514 further amends Rule      XV to require motions to be reduced to writing if desired by      the Presiding Officer or any Senator, and be read before      being debated.     Section 515. Sense of the Senate on conference committee          protocols       Section 515 expresses the Sense of the Senate that      conference committees should hold regular, formal meetings of      all conferees that are open to the public, that conferees      should be given adequate notice of the time and place of such      meetings, and be allowed to participate in full and complete      debate on the matter before the committee, and that the text      of the report of a conference committee should not be changed      after the signature sheets have been signed by a majority of      the Senate conferees.     Section 521. Congressionally directed spending       Section 521 establishes a new Senate Rule XLIV, which      provides sweeping reforms to the treatment of so-called      ``earmarks,'' limited tax benefits, and limited tariff      benefits in legislation before the Senate. With respect to      ``earmarks,'' the Rule provides a more accurate term--     congressionally directed spending items--because      congressional ``earmarks'' merely reflect the spending      priorities of Congress, just as Presidential ``earmarks''      reflect the spending priorities of the President. The      Constitution provides Congress control over the      appropriations of the federal government, and congressionally      directed spending constitutes a legitimate and important      exercise of that authority. Rule XLIV also creates rules for      ``limited tax benefits'' and limited tariff benefits in      legislation--essentially, tax provisions and tariff      suspensions that assist only a small number of beneficiaries.      The provisions of Rule XLIV fall into three main categories--     transparency, accountability, and discipline.       Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the new rule require the Chairman of      the committee of jurisdiction (or the Majority Leader or his      or designee) to certify that all congressionally directed      spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited tariff      benefits in bills and joint resolutions (and accompanying      reports), have been identified through lists charts, or other      similar means, including the name of each Senate sponsor, on      a publicly accessible congressional website, in a searchable      format, at least 48 hours before the vote on the motion to      proceed to consider the bill or joint resolution. If a point      of order is sustained, then the motion to proceed shall be      suspended until the sponsor of the motion (or his or her      designee) has requested resumption and compliance with the      requirements of the relevant paragraph has been achieved. In      light of the possibility that it may take a day or more for      compliance to be achieved and/or for a request for      resumption, suspended motions under these paragraphs shall      not terminate when Congress adjourns.       Paragraph 3 establishes a similar rule for conference      reports the Chairman of the committee of jurisdiction (or the      Majority Leader or his or her designee) must certify that all      congressionally directed spending items, limited tax      benefits, and limited tariff benefits in bills and joint      resolutions (and the accompanying joint statement of      managers), have been identified through lists, charts, or      other similar means, including the name of each Senate      sponsor, on a publicly accessible congressional website at      least 48 hours before the vote on adoption of the conference      report. If a point of order is sustained under paragraph 3,      then the conference report shall be set aside.       The bill follows the basic approach taken by the House,      which has ensured broad transparency throughout the      appropriations process for the FY08 bills. In each case under      paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, the point of order lies as to the      existence or not of the certification. Especially given that      the definition of ``congressionally directed spending''      requires that the item be included in the bill ``primarily at      the request of a Senator,'' the Parliamentarian has no      capacity to determine whether a given item is or is not a      ``congressionally directed spending'' item and thus is not in      a position to determine the accuracy of the list. Requiring      the Parliamentarian to make such a determination      independently is not only unworkable in practice (e.g., even      if the Parliamentarian could make a determination, it would      take a tremendous amount of time and resources to compile the      lists that are already compiled by numerous committees, each      with their own staff), it is impossible--the Parliamentarian      has no choice but to defer to the Committee Chair in      determining why a particular item was included in a bill.      Similarly, the Parliamentarian is not in a position to know      the number of individuals or entities impacted by a tax or      tariff provision, and so must defer to the relevant Committee      Chair on that information.       The authors fully expect that Committee Chairs (and in the      unusual case that the Majority Leader or his or her designee      must provide the certification, the Majority Leader or      designee) will fully, honestly, and in good faith, comply      with the requirements of the new Rule. Given the role of the      Ranking Member in compiling the bill and the list of      congressionally directed spending items, a Chairman may      request that the Ranking Member (and the Chair and Ranking      Member of a relevant subcommittee) join him or her in making      the certification. In addition, it is consistent with the      spirit of the rule if a Committee Chair chooses to identify      Presidential earmark requests.       Rule XLIV provides rules on waivers and appeals from      paragraphs 1, 2, and 3. Waivers may be made after a point of      order has been raised or prospectively. The rule also places      limits on appeals, because a successful appeal would      eviscerate the paragraph under     which the appealed ruling had been made, eliminating the new      transparency to which the Senate has committed itself. Rule      XLIV places limits on debate for appeals and waivers, so that      these are not used as dilatory measures.       Paragraph 4 of new Rule XLIV requires Senators that propose      amendments containing congressionally directed spending      items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits to      identify each such item, and the Senate sponsor, in the      Congressional Record as soon as practicable. Paragraph 4 also      directs Committees to make publicly available on the Internet      as soon as practicable after reporting a bill or joint      resolution, the list of congressionally directed spending      items, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits      included in the bill, joint resolution or accompanying      report. Finally, paragraph 4 states that, to the extent      technically feasible, information provided under paragraphs 3      and 4 shall be provided in a searchable format. The      electronic version of the Congressional Record constitutes      one option for a ``searchable'' publication.       Paragraph 7 provides that, for congressionally directed      spending items in classified portions of a report      accompanying a bill, joint resolution, or conference report,      the committee of jurisdiction shall, to the greatest extent      practicable consistent with the need to protect national      security, provide a general program description, funding      level, and name of Senate sponsor.       In addition to the requirement that Senate sponsors of      congressionally directed spending items, limited tax      benefits, and limited tariff benefits be identified, Rule      XLIV requires accountability through paragraphs 6 and 9.      Paragraph 6 requires Senators who request congressionally      directed spending items, limited tax benefits, and limited      tariff benefits to provide a written statement to the      relevant Chairman and Ranking Member that identifies the name      and location of the intended recipient or activity, the      purpose of the item, and a certification that neither the      Senator nor the Senator's immediate family has a pecuniary      interest in the item, consistent with the requirements of      paragraph 9. Paragraph 9 makes the requirements of Rule      XXXVII(4)--the longstanding Senate Rule against financial      interest by Senators and Senate employees relating to any      legislative action--specific to actions relating to      congressionally directed spending items, limited tax      benefits, and limited tariff benefits. It is anticipated that      the Select Committee on Ethics will apply the requirements of      paragraph 9 (including as incorporated by reference into      paragraph 6) identical to the way in which it has applied      Rule XXXVII(4).       Finally, Rule XLIV provides an important tool for      disciplining the conference process to ensure that new      directed spending provisions--i.e., directed spending      provisions not included in either the House or the Senate      bill committed to conference--are not added in conference.      Specifically, paragraph 8 allows any Senator to raise a point      of order against one or more new directed spending provisions      added in conference. (It is important to note that the term      ``new directed spending provision'' is defined differently      than the term ``congressionally directed spending item.'')      The term ``measure'' as used in paragraph 8 refers only to      the bill or amendment committed to the conferees by either      House. If the point of order is sustained, then the provision      is struck from the bill and the Senate will then proceed to      consider whether to concur in the bill as so amended by the      removal of the material stricken on the point(s) of order,      and send it back to the House. The rule includes the      possibility of 60-vote waivers for points of order under the      rule. The language is similar to that used in the so-called      ``Byrd'' rule and is intended to be interpreted similarly--     waivers may be as to one, multiple, or all points of order      under the rule; waivers may be made after a point of order      has been raised or prospectively.       Rule XLIV provides for a number of points of orders, and      sets out rules for accompanying waivers and appeals. If Rule      XLIV does not expressly provide for a point of order with      respect to a provision, then no point of order shall lie      under that provision. Rule XLIV also includes in paragraph      11, a waiver of all points of order under the rule with      respect to a pending measure. As with other waivers in the      rule, it may be made after a point of order has been made      or prospectively.     Section 531. Post employment restrictions       Section 531 amends the current ``revolving door''      restrictions in Rule XXXVII of the Senate Rules.      Specifically, Section 531 amends the rule to prohibit      Senators from lobbying Congress for two years after they      leave office and prohibits officers and senior employees from      lobbying the Senate for one year after they leave Senate      employment. Senior employees of the Senate are those who, for      at least 60 days, during the 1-year period before they leave      Senate employment are paid a rate of basic pay equal to or      greater than 75 percent of the basic rate of pay payable to a      Senator.       The new ``revolving door'' restrictions are effective only      for Senate staff that terminate Senate employment on or after      the date that the 1st session of the 110th Congress adjourns      sine die or December 31, 2007, whichever is earlier. A      delayed effective date was deemed more reasonable and      practical than an immediate effective date.     Section 532. Disclosure by Members of Congress and staff of          employment negotiations       Section 532 amends Senate Rule XXVIII to add new disclosure      requirements for employment negotiations. This provision      requires Senators to disclose within 3 business days any      negotiations they engage in to secure future employment      before their successor is elected. The new addition to Rule      XXXVII also prohibits Senators from seeking employment at all      as a registered lobbyist until his or her successor has been      elected. It requires senior staff to notify the Ethics      Committee within 3 days of beginning negotiations for future      employment, and to recuse themselves from involvement in a      matter should employment negotiations create a conflict of      interest or the appearance of a conflict.     Section 533. Elimination of floor privileges for former          Members, Senate officers, and Speakers of the House who          are lobbyists or seek financial gain       This section amends Senate Rule XXIII to revoke floor      privileges and the use of the Members' athletic facilities      and parking for former Senators, former Secretaries of the      Senate, former Sergeants at Arms of the Senate and former      Speakers of the House who are registered lobbyists. The Rules      Committee will issue guidelines to allow those affected by      this provision to participate in ceremonial functions and      events on the Senate floor.     Section 534. Influencing hiring decisions       Section 534 amends Senate Rule XLIII to specifically      prohibit members from taking official action or threatening      to take official action in an effort to influence hiring      decisions of private organizations on the sole basis of      partisan political affiliation. This section is not intended      to preclude Senators from providing references or writing      letters of recommendation that speak to the credentials of an      individual.     Section 535. Notification of post-employment restrictions       Section 535 requires the Secretary of the Senate to notify      Members, officers or employees of the Senate of the beginning      and end dates of their post-employment lobbying restrictions      under the Senate Rules. It is expected that the Secretary of      the Senate will encourage Senators and staff to contact the      Ethics Committee for a full explanation of the terms of their      post-employment lobbying restrictions. This provision goes      into effect 60 days after the date of enactment.     Section 541. Ban on gifts from lobbyists and entities that          hire lobbyists       Section 541 amends the gift rules in Rule XXXV of the      Standing Rules of the Senate. This provision prohibits      Senators and their staff from accepting gifts from registered      lobbyists or entities that hire or employ them. The provision      does not alter the exceptions under Rule XXXV(1)(c).     Section 542. National party conventions       This provision prohibits Senators from attending parties      held in their honor at national party conventions if they      have been directly paid for by lobbyists, unless the Senator      is the party's presidential or vice presidential nominee.     Section 543. Proper valuation of tickets to entertainment and          sporting events       Section 543 specifies that the market value of a ticket to      an entertainment or sporting event shall be the face value of      the ticket, or in the case of a ticket without a face value,      the value of the highest priced ticket to the event. It      allows the ticket holder to establish that a ticket without a      face value is equivalent to a ticket priced less than the      highest priced ticket by providing information related to the      primary features of the ticket to the Ethics Committee. In      order for a ticket holder to have the option to establish      ``equivalency,'' he or she must provide information to the      Ethics Committee prior to attending the event. The Committee      may accept information obtained on the Internet from venues      and third-party ticket vendors.     Section 544. Restrictions on lobbyist participation in travel          and disclosure       Section 544 makes significant changes to the provisions in      paragraph 2 of Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate      relating to reimbursement for travel for Senators and staff      from third parties. Section 544 prohibits certain types of      travel altogether, restricts other travel, and imposes new      requirements applicable to all privately funded travel.       Section 544 generally prohibits privately funded travel      paid for by entities that hire lobbyists or foreign agents.      It creates two exceptions from this general rule. First,      section 544 allows trips paid for by entities that hire      lobbyists or foreign agents if they are for one-day's      attendance/participation at an appropriate event (exclusive      of travel time and an overnight stay). The Select Committee      on Ethics is given authority to issue guidelines that would      allow a two-night stay when practically required to      participate in an event (e.g., an event requiring travel      across the country). With respect to these ``one day      trips,'' in addition to the other restrictions described      below, the new rule prohibits lobbyists from accompanying      the Member, officer, or employee on any ``segment of the      trip'' in other than a de minimis way, and requires a trip      sponsor to provide a certification to that effect. It is      intended that this language be interpreted identically to      the interpretation given similar language by the House      Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in its      memorandum dated March 14, 2007.       Second, section 544 allows trips paid for by 501(c)(3)      organizations, regardless of whether     the organization hires a lobbyist or foreign agent. The      Senate made the judgment that 501(c)(3)s, due to their non-     profit and often educational or public-interest nature were      not likely to be a source of abuse. In this respect,      501(c)(3)s are treated similar to entities that do not hire      lobbyists or foreign agents.       Section 544 also establishes new rules across the board for      all trips. It requires pre-approval from the Select Committee      on Ethics for all trips. The Select Committee on Ethics must      issue guidelines on the factors it will use to pre-approve a      trip.       Additionally, regardless of trip sponsor, section 544      prohibits Senators, officers, or staff from participating in      trips planned, organized, or arranged by or at the request of      a lobbyist or foreign agent in other than a de minimis way,      and a trip sponsor must provide a certification to that      effect. As a general matter, the term ``de minimis'' means      negligible or inconsequential. It would be ``negligible or      inconsequential'' for a lobbyist to respond to a trip      sponsor's request that the lobbyist identify Members or staff      with a possible interest in a particular issue relevant to a      planned trip or to suggest particular aspects of a Member or      staffer's interest known to the lobbyist. For instance, if a      trip sponsor that was a 501(c)(3) asked a lobbyist which      staffers might be most interested in joining a trip to the      U.S.-Mexican border and the lobbyist knew that a potential      trip participant had a particular interest in the DEA's      activities at the border, or in a particular border facility,      then the conveyance and receipt of that information (in light      of the trip sponsor's request), in and of itself, would not      exceed a de minimis level of participation. Additionally, the      mere presence of one or more lobbyists on the board of an      organization does not exceed a de minimis involvement. If a      lobbyist solicits or initiates an exchange of information      with a trip sponsor, however, that would go beyond de      minimis. Additionally, if the lobbyist has ultimate control      over which Members or staff are actually invited on the trip,      or determines the trip itinerary, each of these would go      beyond de minimis. Certainly, if a lobbyist actually extends      or forwards an invitation to a participant, or if an      invitation mentions a referral or suggestion of a lobbyist,      each of these would go beyond de minimis.       For all trips other than one day trips paid for by entities      that hire lobbyists, the new rule prohibits a lobbyist from      accompanying the Member, officer, or employee ``at any point      throughout the trip'' in other than a de minimis way. This      language should be interpreted in a manner different--and      more broadly--than the concept of ``any segment of the      trip.''       Both lobbyist ``accompaniment'' standards include a de      minimis exception. The Act directs the Select Committee on      Ethics to issue guidance on what constitutes ``de minimis.''      If the trip includes attendance at an event that meets the      definition of a ``widely attended event'' under Rule      XXXV(1)(c)(18), the trip sponsor is unlikely to know all      attendees at the event. Accordingly, a lobbyist's attendance      at a ``widely attended event'' also attended on the trip      would be a type of de minimis ``accompaniment.'' Similarly,      an organization cannot possibly know the other passengers      that might be on a common carrier used during a trip if the      organization has had no contact or coordination with these      other passengers. Accordingly, the new rule does not require      a sponsor to certify that it knows for certain that no      lobbyist will be on such a common carrier.       Section 544 also improves disclosure of privately funded      travel. It requires Members, officers and Senate employees to      disclose the expenses reimbursed by a private entity not      later than 30 days after the travel is completed and requires      disclosure of greater detail on the types of meetings and      events attended on the trip.       Section 544 includes a separate provision relating to      flights on private jets. This provision requires Senators to      pay full market value--defined as charter rates--for flights      on private jets, with an exception for jets owned by      immediate family members (or non-public corporations in which      the Senator or an immediate family member has an ownership      interest).       In general, the changes made by section 544 go into effect      60 days after enactment, or the date that the Select      Committee on Ethics issues the required guidelines under the      rule, whichever is later. Until the new rules take effect,      the existing rules for travel will remain in place. In light      of the transition to the new rule relating to reimbursement      for flights on private jets and the lack of experience in      many offices in determining ``charter rates,'' the Select      Committee on Ethics may treat reimbursement at current rates      as reimbursement at charter rates for a transition period not      to exceed 60 days.       Section 544 includes an important caveat--nothing in      section 544 or section 541 is meant to alter law or treatment      under Senate rules, of gifts and travel that fall under the      Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act or the Mutual Educational      and Cultural Exchange Act. Gifts and travel under those      provisions are governed by a separate regulatory regime.       Section 544 directs the Legislative Branch Appropriations      subcommittee, and the Committee on Rules to examine within 90      days whether congressional travel allowances will need to be      adjusted in light of the new restrictions on privately funded      travel.     Section 545. Free attendance at a constituent event       Section 545 creates a new, narrow exception, to the gift      rule for small constituent events. Specifically, section 545      allows Senators, officers or employees to accept free      attendance at a conference, convention, symposium, forum,      panel discussion, dinner event, site visit, viewing,      reception or similar event in their home state if it is      sponsored by constituents or a group of constituents, and      attended primarily by at least 5 constituents, provided that      there are no registered lobbyists in attendance, and that the      cost of any meal served is less than $50.     Section 546. Senate privately paid travel public website       This provision directs the Secretary of the Senate to      develop a publicly available, searchable website by January      1, 2008 to post Senators' travel information that is required      to be disclosed under rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the      Senate.     Section 551. Compliance with Lobbying Disclosure       Section 551 makes clear that former members and staff who      are registered lobbyists may contact the staff of the      Secretary of the Senate regarding compliance with the      lobbying disclosure requirements of the Lobbying Disclosure      Act of 1995 despite post-employment lobbying restrictions.     Section 552. Prohibit official contact with spouse or          immediate family member who is a registered lobbyist       This provision prohibits Senate spouses who are registered      lobbyists from engaging in lobbying contacts with any Senate      office, but exempts Senate spouses who were serving as      registered lobbyists at least one year prior to the most      recent election of their spouse to office, or at least one      year prior to their marriage to that Member.       The provision also prohibits a Senator's immediate family      members (including a spouse) who are registered lobbyists,      from engaging in lobbying contacts with the Senator's staff.     Section 553. Mandatory Senate ethics training for Members and          staff       This section requires the Ethics Committee to conduct      ongoing ethics training and awareness programs for Senators      and Senate staff.     Section 554. Annual report by Select Committee on Ethics       Section 554 directs the Ethics Committee to issue an annual      report that describes the number of alleged violations of      Senate rules received from any source, a list of the number      of alleged violations that were dismissed, the number of      alleged violations in which the committee conducted a      preliminary inquiry, the number of alleged violations that      resulted in an adjudicatory review, the number of alleged      violations that the committee dismissed, the number of      letters of admonition issued and the number of matters      resulting in disciplinary sanction. Nothing in this section      requires or allows the Ethics Committee to violate the      confidential nature of its proceedings.     Section 555. Exercise of rule making power       This section acknowledges that the Senate adopts the      provisions in this title as an exercise of its rule making      power with full recognition of the constitutional right of      the Senate to change those rules at any time.     Section 556. Effective dates and general provisions       All sections in this title go into effect upon enactment      except for section 513, which goes into effect 90 days after      enactment; section 531: This title shall take effect on the      date of enactment unless otherwise noted.              Title VI--Prohibited Use of Private Aircraft     Section 601. Restrictions on Use of Campaign Funds for          Flights on Non Commercial Aircraft       Section 601 amends the Federal Election Campaign Act to      require that candidates, other than those running for a seat      in the House of Representatives, pay the fair market value of      airfare when using non-commercial jets to travel. Fair market      value is to be determined by dividing the fair market value      of the charter fare of the aircraft, by the number of      candidates on the flight. This provision exempts aircraft      owned or leased by candidates or candidates' immediate family      members (or non-public corporations in which the Senator or      his or her immediate family member has an ownership      interest). The bill prohibits candidates for the House of      Representatives from any campaign use of privately-owned,      non-chartered jets.       Many candidates are not accustomed to determining charter      rates. The FEC may, during a transition period of no more      than 60 days, deem reimbursement at current rates to be      charter rates while committees determine how to calculate      charter rates.                   Title VII Miscellaneous Provisions     Section 701. Sense of the Congress that any applicable          restrictions on Congressional branch employees should          apply to the Executive and Judicial branches       This section expresses the Sense of Congress that any      applicable restrictions on Congressional branch employees in      this title should apply to the executive and judicial      branches.     Section 702. Knowing and willful falsification or failure to          report       This provision increases from $10,000 to $50,000 the      penalty for knowingly and willfully falsifying or knowingly      and willfully failing to report financial disclosure forms     required by the Ethics in Government Act. It imposes a      criminal penalty of up to one year of imprisonment and/or a      fine for knowingly and willfully falsifying such report and      imposes a fine for knowingly and willfully failing to file      such report.     Section 703. Rule of construction       Section 703 provides that nothing in this Act shall be      construed to prohibit any conduct or activities protected by      the free speech, free exercise, or free association clauses      of the First Amendment.  I yield the floor.
