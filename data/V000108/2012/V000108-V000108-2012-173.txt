Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that I congratulate Mrs. Mary Edith Brown Coleman on a momentous milestone, her 95th birthday, which will be on February 13, 2012. Edith will be celebrating this milestone with family and friends on Saturday, February 11, 2012. Throughout the past 72 years, Edith's presence in Northwest Indiana has allowed her the opportunity to touch the lives of countless people.   Edith Brown was born on February 13, 1917 in Muskogee, Oklahoma. She was one of four children born to Luther Albert Brown and Dora Rozolia Draper Brown. Having gone on to live in Kansas City, Kansas and Chicago, Illinois, Edith finally relocated to Gary, Indiana in 1940. Quite the accomplished student, Edith completed her Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in education at Indiana University in Bloomington. From there, she decided to go into the teaching profession. As a teacher at Frederick Douglass Elementary School in Gary for over 27 years, Edith was able to enrich the lives of so many young people in the Gary community. For her commitment to the youth of Northwest Indiana, she is worthy of the highest praise.   Equally as impressive, Edith has always been seen as the foundation of her family. She and her husband, the late William Henry Coleman, were blessed with the births of two wonderful children: Norma Louise Coleman and Merle Jean Coleman. Edith's family, as well as those whose lives she has touched, admire her for devoting unselfish love, time, dedication, guidance, and spirit to her family, her students, and her friends.   As well as being dearly loved and respected by her family, her students, and her community, Edith is also well known for her involvement with her church, the First Church of God in Gary, and several other organizations. For years, Edith has been a distinguished member of the American Association of University Women, the Women's Association of the Northwest Indiana Symphony Society, the Red Hat Society, and the Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority. Since her arrival in Northwest Indiana, Edith has always been known as a good-hearted woman who is always willing to help the people in her community. For her selflessness, she is to be commended and admired.   Mr. Speaker, Mary Edith Brown Coleman has always given her time and efforts selflessly to the youth and the community in Northwest Indiana throughout her illustrious life. She has taught every member of her family and extended family the true meaning of service to others. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in wishing Edith a very happy 95th birthday.                          ____________________
