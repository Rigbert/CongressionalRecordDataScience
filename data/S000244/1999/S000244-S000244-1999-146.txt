Chairman, I am pleased to accept the amendment of the gentleman from New York. It requires a certification in advance that the cooperative agreement with the People's Republic of China does not harm the U.S. space launch industry or improve the missile launch capabilities of China and also directs the NASA Inspector General to conduct an annual audit to make sure that these certifications are being complied with.  It is a constructive amendment, and I hope it is adopted.
