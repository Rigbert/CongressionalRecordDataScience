Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 461, sponsored by Congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah, conveys the federal title of electricity distribution lines to a local entity. This transfer resolves ownership confusion caused by lack of proper federal paperwork and will lead to more efficient management of the project. The general concept of so-called title transfers is a promising one: they place projects under local control; they reduce federal paperwork; and they provide instant ownership equity for a local entity to leverage private financing dollars. These benefits will all be achieved without a cost to the American taxpayer. This bill is an excellent example of a win-win scenario.  I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.
