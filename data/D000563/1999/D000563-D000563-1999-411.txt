We are dealing with a surplus in the Social Security trust fund which the Republican Party now wants to give away as a tax cut. Does that make sense? Does it make sense to any of us paying into Social Security, or those who hope to derive some benefit from it, at this point in time to decide to spend Social Security funds to give a tax cut?  I might say to the Senator from California: Look at the tax cut. There they go again. The Republicans cannot leave well enough alone. The economy is moving forward. Annual deficits are coming down. They want to put a tax cut package in place.  And look carefully at the winners under the Republican tax cut plan. For Mr. Bill Gates, good news. If you are in the top 1 percent, for the Republican tax, a cut of $22,000 a year--not bad. Will he notice?  But, look, if you are in the lowest 20 percent of average wage earners in America, under the Republican tax cut plan, listen to this, $22 a year--not bad--$22 a year for the average working family in America, and $22,000 for Mr. Trump and Mr. Gates.  There they go again.
