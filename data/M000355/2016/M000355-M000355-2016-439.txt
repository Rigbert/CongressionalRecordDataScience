 President, reserving the right to object, let me just walk through this one more time in case anybody is confused about where we are.  As I said yesterday, Republican Senators are eager to pass the conference report which is before us and send it to the President's desk for signature. We should do that today--this very day. That would accomplish several important things before we leave for the week. First, it would provide $1.1 billion in immediate funding to combat Zika. That is the exact amount of money in the Democrats' request. However, the Democrats' request includes only funding for Zika and leaves the rest of the important priorities behind.  The conference report that the House passed includes full funding for Zika, funding for military construction, funding for veterans programs, and temporary but meaningful reforms to ensure that we are able to combat mosquito-borne illnesses during the summer months, which are upon us.  We should pass the conference report today--this very day. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2577 and that the conference report be agreed to with no intervening action or debate.
