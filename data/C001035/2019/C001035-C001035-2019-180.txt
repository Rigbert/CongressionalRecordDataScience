Tester, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Jones,         Mr. Boozman, Mr. Manchin, and Ms. Harris):  S. 304. A bill to reauthorize section 340H of the Public Health Service Actto continue to encourage the expansion, maintenance, and the establishment of approved graduate medical residency programs at qualified teaching health centers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with my colleague from Montana, Senator Tester, to fund Teaching Health Centers, a time-tested model for success to train the next generation of primary care doctors in communities where they are needed the most. I am pleased that Senators Capito, Jones, Boozman, Manchin, and Harris have joined us as cosponsors.  Over the next decade, the severe shortage of primary care doctors could reach crisis levels in a growing number of rural and underserved communities in Maine and across our Nation. Alarmingly, these communities are often those hardest hit by the opioid epidemic. By 2030, we will need an estimated 120,000 physicians to meet the growing demand for health care services across the Country. In clinics and health centers in Northern Maine, I frequently hear stories about vacancies forcing Mainers to travel many miles simply to see a primary care doctor or dentist.  For the past eight years, one program, the Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education Program, has worked to fill these gaps. This program trains medical residents in community-based settings, including low-income, underserved rural and urban neighborhoods. For example, since its inception in 2011, the Penobscot Community Health Care Center has trained 34 residents and served more than 15,000 dental patients in Bangor, Maine.  Nationwide, this program has produced real results. Since the program began, 632 new primary care physicians and dentists have graduated and entered the workforce, and the number of Americans served is in the millions. Those who train at teaching health centers are very likely to practice primary care and remain in underserved or rural communities. Last Congress, this Committee considered and successfully passed my legislation to fund teaching health centers for two years. As a result, for the 2017-2018 academic year, this program supported the training of 732 residents in 57 primary care residency programs, across 24 states.
