We now hope to have action on the remaining appropriation bills. We expect those to be included in an omnibus appropriation bill. Obviously, we have considered all of them. They essentially have been conferenced, notwithstanding the fact that the other body did not pass through the Senate five of their bills, as you know, but they did in fact pass them out of subcommittee. So we had products to conference with.  Both the House and the Senate have been working together to get them in a place where they could be considered, and it would be my expectation that we would consider an omnibus appropriation bill Tuesday night after we come back. I would hope to be able to pass such a bill on Tuesday. Again, that is being worked on between the House and the Senate. There have been discussions, as you know, with the administration as well trying to reach agreement so that we can ensure that the Government certainly doesn't shut down.                              {time}  1545  The CR expires on the 14th of next week. We would hope that we can pass an omnibus appropriation before that.
