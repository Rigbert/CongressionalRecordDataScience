 The EAC is not perfect. There is no agency, including the one we're going to fund this week that spends almost $700 billion--that's not perfect. Should we fix it where it's broken? Yes. Should we do that to every agency? Yes. Is it our responsibility to do so? Yes. But to eliminate the very agency constructed to ensure that we do not repeat the travesty of 2000 is to retreat from ensuring fair, open, accessible elections where every vote will count.  I urge my colleagues to vote against this piece of legislation. If, in fact, the EAC needs fixing, let's fix it. That's the responsibility of the House Administration Committee on which I served for, I think, 17 years. You ought to do that if you think this is not working correctly, because what it does is absolutely essential for democracy and for America.  Defeat this legislation.
