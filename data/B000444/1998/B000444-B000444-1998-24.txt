 President, Montreal Protocol No. 4 is a useful step in modernizing the rules of cargo and baggage in international air traffic. I urge my colleagues to support it.                               Exhibit 1     Clouds on the Liability Horizon and What We Can Do About Them                         (By Lee S. Kreindler)       I am honored to appear on this symposium, the second      straight year in which I have been on your program. After      all, as a plaintiff's laywer, I have spent much of the last      forty five years bringing legal actions against IATA's      members, the international airlines. More important than      that, perhaps, I have spent most of that time being highly      critical of IATA's role in promoting the Warsaw Convention      and its progeny, and in defending and preserving a limit of      liability that to me, and all of my clients, has been      abhorrent.       Now I find myself applauding your monumental efforts, and,      particularly the monumental efforts of your distinguished      general counsel, Lorne Clark, to put an end to limits of      liability in personal injury and death cases. I find that,      after all these years, we are in synchronization, pulling      together to create a system that will protect the interests      of your member carriers' customers, the flying public, and      their families, and at the same time preserve the interests      of your airline members. To me this is an uplifting and      energizing experience.       I want IATA's efforts to establish a fair and enforceable      system of liability in international air law, as well as my      own efforts, to succeed. I have nothing but praise for IATA's      courage in leading its member airlines to waive the liability      limits of the Warsaw Convention. The IATA Agreement was long      and hard in coming, but it was a remarkable achievement given      the political and economic realities of the world. You      deserve enormous credit for bringing it about. I say that, as      your long time adversary, without condition or qualification.      You have done a wonderful job, for which the flying public      owes you thanks.       I think it would be a great mistake, however, to revel in      the glory of accomplishment, and ignore problems and threats      which could very well bring this brave new dream crashing      down. And so my concern now, as a friend, is that the new      system, because of its inherent weaknesses, may fail. Indeed,      I see clouds on the horizon, and I want to address them with      you while there is still time to deal with them, so that,      together, we can build a strong and lasting structure that      can and will withstand the storms that are sure to come.   Problems With the IATA-ATA Agreements and the Resulting System--A                       Foundation Based on Contract       The basic law in international airline liability is still      provided by the Warsaw Convention, which was effectively      modified in 1966, with respect to transportation involving      the United States, to increase the passenger injury and death      limitation to $75,000. Onto this convention there have now      been engrafted three agreements, the IATA Intercarrier      Agreement (IIA), the Agreement on Measures to Implement the      IATA Intercarrier Agreement (MIA), and the ATA Intercarrier      Agreement, also known as Provisions Implementing the IATA      Intercarrier Agreement (IPA), applicable, at least, to those      carriers which have signed the agreements.       Each of the three agreements, IIA, MIA, and IPA is a      private contractual agreement sponsored by either IATA or ATA      and signed by individual airlines. Some of these agreements,      by some of the signatory airlines, have been incorporated in      tariffs, which have been filed with the U.S. Department of      Transportation. This does not, however, turn them into      ``law.'' They are still private contracts which, by virtue of      the tariffs, are incorporated in the airline's conditions      of contract.       In the first of these agreements, IIA, the signatory      airlines agreed to ``take action'' to waive the limitation of      liability on recoverable compensatory damages, which, since      the Montreal Agreement of 1966 has effectively been $75,000      per passenger on a substantial part of international airline      travel, including all transportation involving the United      States.       In the MIA the signatory carriers agree to implement the      IIA by incorporating various provisions in their contracts of      carriage and tariffs where necessary. Under the most      important provision the carrier agrees that it will not      invoke the limitation of liability in Article 22 (1) of the      Convention as to any claim of recoverable compensatory      damages under Article 17. In order words, each carrier waives      the Warsaw limit.       The second provision each carrier agrees to in MIA is to      not avail itself of any defense under Article 20 (1) of the      Convention with respect to claims up to 100,000 SDRs. Article      20 (1), sometimes called the exculpatory clause, provides      that the carrier can exculpate itself from liability      completely if it can show it took all necessary measures to      avoid the damage. Thus, in agreeing to waive this defense up      to 100,000 SDRs each carrier has subjected itself to absolute      or strict liability up to that amount. In not making this      waiver above 100,000 SDRs the carrier has accepted the burden      of proving the taking of all necessary measures. Proving that      is a virtual impossibility in all cases except terrorist      cases, other situations entirely caused by a third party, and      possibly clear air turbulence cases.       Thus while this provision may not have substantial      practical significance the principle of the carrier having      the burden of proof regarding its absence of fault has become      a precedent which may affect the formulation of a new      convention or protocol.        Rights of Recourse, Including Indemnity and Contribution       The MIA goes on to provide that the signatory airline      ``reserves all defenses available under the Convention to any      such claim.'' And it adds that ``With respect to third      parties, the carrier also reserves all rights of recourse . .      . including rights of contribution and indemnity.''       It may be well and good for the signatory airlines to      reserve all rights of recourse against a manufacturer, for      example, in a contract between itself and other airline, but      there is real doubt that this can have any legal and binding      effect without the consent of such third party and possibly      without the consent of the passenger himself. The fact that      this reservation of rights is a creature of private contract,      rather than law or legal judgments, is, in my opinion, a      fatal flaw in the system in terms of legal enforceability.       An impleaded third party, such as a manufacturer, or its      insurer, will be free to claim that the airline, or its      insurer, which made a payment pursuant to IIA, was a      ``volunteer'', and was a collateral source whose payment may      not be created to damages owed the passenger or his estate by      the manufacturer.       It is my understanding that George Tompkins and Lorne Clark      have requested the manufacturers to provide a statement of      policy that they will not assert a ``volunteer'' defense in      the event that an airline settles a claim in excess of the      applicable limit of liability in any suit for contribution or      indemnity, and it is my further understanding that the      request is being favorably considered.       However, in my opinion, the problem can't definitively be      cured by consent of the third party defendant. Under this      system the airline can offer to pay unlimited damages, and it      may try to insist that a passenger or passenger's family      execute a general release, releasing third parties, but the      passenger does not have to accept that. The passenger can sue      the airline under the IIA and MIA, as a third party      beneficiary, and can maintain a wholly independent action      against a negligent manufacturer or air traffic control      facility. In other words there is the theoretical      possibility here of double recoveries. The passenger can      recover on his case against the airline, which is based on      the IIA and MIA contracts and then take the position, on      his case against the manufacturer, or other third party,      that the airline was collateral source for which the      manufacturer may not get a credit. For the recourse      provisions of     IIA, MIA, and IPA to be meaningful the payment of damages      by the airline would have to be the result of law and not      private contract.       This problem of recourse runs through all three of these      agreements, and, in my opinion, can be solved only by a new      convention or protocol, establishing a legal basis for the      payment of unlimited damages by an airline.       That is not the only problem presented by IIA agreements.                Domicile, ``Subject To Applicable Law''       IIA states as an objective ``that recoverable compensatory      damages may be determined and awarded by reference to the law      of the domicile of the passenger.''       When one examines the MIA, however, it provides that at the      option of the carrier it may include a provision in its      conditions of carriage and tariffs that, ``subject to      applicable law'', recoverable compensatory damages . . . may      be determined by reference to the law of the domicile or      permanent residence of the passenger.''       In the IPA there is no option provision. It simply states      that ``subject to applicable law, recoverable compensatory      damages * * * may be determined by reference to the law of      the domicile or permanent residence of the passenger.''       Thus the intent of the drafters, as shown by the language      of the three agreements, would appear to have been to apply      the law of the passenger's domicile or permanent residence.      In actual fact, however, there was no such uniform agreement      to apply the law of domicile, and the language can best be      explained by the political, or negotiating constraints if any      agreement at all was to be achieved.       Briefly stated, the United States carriers, with the      prodding of the U.S. Department of Transportation, insisted      on language applying the law of domicile. To European      carriers, however, their law did not apply law of domicile.      Generally there courts would apply the law of the place of      the accident or the law of the forum. Thus in the face of the      language in IIA, pointing to law of domicile, they insisted      on language making it clear that would only be at the option      of the airline.       The U.S. carriers, on the other hand, all signed the IPA,      and thereby accepted law of the passenger's domicile on cases      against them.       The agreements may not do that, however, because the      language, ``subject to applicable law'' may dictate some      other law!       Let's assume, for example, a case brought under the IPA in      which the deceased passenger was domiciled in Pennsylvania,      which has relatively liberal death damages law. Let's say the      airplane crashed into the high seas. When the case is brought      in the United States will the Death on the High Seas Act be      applied, or the law of Pennsylvania?       In the first instance the decision will be up to the      airline, or, more likely, the airline's insurer. Let's      suppose the airline, faithful to the text of the IIA      agreements, makes an offer under Pennsylvania law standards.      But let's assume the passenger, or the lawyer for the estate      of the passenger, rejects the offer as being insufficient.      The matter would then go to court. In court the passenger (or      the estate's) lawyer, asserts that the law of Pennsylvania      will govern damages, pointing to the IIA Agreements.       What position does the airline take in court? And what      position will the court take? After all the Death on the High      Seas Act is a United States statute.       As for the carrier, one might hope it would feel morally      bound to accept the law of the domicile of the passenger, but      history suggests that economics will determine its position,      or, more precisely, its insurer's position.       Let's take a similar case under the IPA, where the airplane      has crashed over land, as in the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie      bombing. Let's assume the action is started in Florida, as,      indeed, a significant number of Lockerbie cases were. In      those Lockerbie cases the court, stating that it was applying      Florida choice of law rules, applied the law of the place of      the accident, Scotland.       What will the situation be under the Intercarrier      Agreements including the IPA? Will the carrier, and the      court, enforce the law of the passenger's domicile, or will      they apply the law of the place of accident?       Again, history suggests that the parties are likely to be      motivated by economics.       In short, the words, ``subject to applicable law'' are      likely to introduce conflict and uncertainty in many cases      brought under the IPA. I would respectfully suggest that      those words be removed from the IPA Agreement, and that it      simply provide that the law of the passenger's domicile will      be applied.                          Successive Carriage       Another problem arises by virtue of Article 30 (1) and (2)      of the Warsaw Convention which deal with the liability of      successive carriers. Article 30 (2) states: ``(2) . . . the      passenger or his representative can take action only against      the carrier who performed the transportation during which the      accident or delay occurred. . . .''       It may turn out, of course, that all carriers sign and      adhere to the Intercarrier Agreement, and they will,      therefore, all be subject to it. But, given the nature of the      world, it is probable that some, or even many, will not sign      on. If the second, or third, successive carrier is the one on      which the accident happens, it may choose not to waive the      limit, despite the claim by the plaintiff that the successive      carrier is bound by the original contract of carriage. Then      where are we?       I understand that carriers now signing the IIA Agreements      are limiting their waivers of the limit to accidents      occurring on their own part of the carriage, so passengers      may still be subject to the limit in other cases.       But the injured passenger, or his family if he has been      killed, will, nevertheless, argue that the carrier which      issued the ticket must be liable for damages without      limitation, and that he or his estate is an authorized third      party beneficiary. An action will be brought against that      carrier for unlimited damages. The Warsaw Convention, which      was supposed to have simplified liability rules will be the      very cause of the dispute in these cases.       If, indeed, waivers of the limit do not apply to successive      carriers, then the IATA agreements will be something of a      cruel hoax in successive carriage situations and may well      inspire intense adverse passenger group reactions.                          The 5th Jurisdiction       Article 28 of the Warsaw Convention permits suit to be      brought in any one of four places; the place of incorporation      of the carrier, its principal place of business, the place      where the contract of carriage was made (i.e. where the      ticket was sold), and, finally, the place of ultimate      destination of the passenger. Notably absent is the place of      the passenger's domicile. In most cases the place of the      passenger's domicile will coincide with one of the places      suit can be brought anyway, so there is no problem. But      there are occasional cases where an American, for example,      will buy a ticket while on a trip, away from home.      American damages standards are considerably higher than      those of other countries, generally, and in that rare case      the American passenger, or his family, will be denied the      higher American standards.       It is generally recognized that the place of domicile is      the place which has the greatest interest in the question of      damages, and the denial of domicile law is very troubling to      parties and governments alike.       The United States Government, and particularly the      Department of Transportation and Department of State, have      taken the position that any new regime of law, in      international airline transportation, must provide for suits      in ``the 5th Jurisdiction'', i.e., the place of the      passenger's domicile. Non American carriers have resisted the      proposal, for reasons that baffle me. It seems to me that      from the airline's standpoint the point is not worth fighting      about, if the carriers can get an otherwise favorable system.      There are simply not enough such cases to provide a real      stumbling block.       The IATA intercarrier agreements do not and cannot solve      the problem, and they cannot because of the Warsaw      Convention's proscription against changing jurisdictional      rules (See Article 32). The United States has gone along with      the intercarrier agreements because of the predominant      interest in getting the airlines to abandon the limits,      notwithstanding their failure to adopt the 5th jurisdiction,      but the point remains one of contention for any new      convention or protocol.                           Fault or No Fault?       Finally, important lawyers in the United States DOT seem to      be locked into an anti-fault mode of thinking on any new      system, whether it be based on the intercarrier agreements or      a new convention or protocol. This probably goes back to      attitudes developed in 1966 at the time of the Montreal      Agreement, when State Department lawyers obtained from the      airlines and IATA an agreement to accept absolute liability      up to a limit of $75,000 as a tradeoff for perpetuation of      the Warsaw Convention and its limited liability regime. The      DOT has viewed absolute, no-fault, liability as being in the      passenger interest. Most passenger groups, however, as well      as lawyer groups which customarily represent passengers, view      the fault system as a fundamental necessity which is      critically important from the safety perspective for the      protection of passengers as well as society in general. They      point to numerous contributions to airline safety made by      tort cases and their examination into both negligence and      accident causation.       The contribution of the tort system to aviation safety is      well recognized, also, by aviation insurers and their      lawyers. Sean Gates, a London solicitor and senior partner of      Beaumont and Son, one of the leading firms representing      aviation underwriters, has expressed himself as strongly      opposed to absolute liability for international airlines,      both because he is opposed to abandonment of the fault      system, and because he doesn't see why airlines alone in our      society should be held to be guarantors of safety. Anthony      Mednuik, one of the world's leading underwriters, and      presently Managing Director of the British Aviation Insurance      Group, has similarly expressed himself as strongly opposed to      abandoning the fault system. He did so most recently at a      large meeting in Amelia Island, Florida, in October, of the      Aircraft Builders Council, which consists of both aviation      manufacturers and underwriters, and again at an aviation      insurance and law symposium in London in November, sponsored      by Lloyds of London Press. And George N. Tompkins, Jr. one of      the top airline defense lawyers in the United States has      recommended the following language to the ICAO Secretariat      Study Group, of which he is a member: ``No limit of liability      on the recoverable damages mentioned in A above if the      passenger/claimant proves negligence or     fault on the part of the carrier. This would not impose an      undue burden on the passenger/claimant and would serve to      preserve the ``Warsaw Convention'' as a fault based system.''       This difference of opinion on the fault system is not a      factor affecting the intercarrier agreements since they are      already in place and they have been based on strict liability      up to 100,000 SDRs and presumptive liability above that      amount if the carrier fails to show its complete absence of      fault, but it will be a significant factor in the effort to      achieve a new convention or protocol.       Thus we have a situation where the IATA agreements, however      noble their purpose and laudable their execution, provide an      insufficient basis for a satisfactory future regime in      international air law, and where there is considerable doubt      that, on a political level, the problems and differences of      fault/no fault, limitations of venue, rights of recourse, and      successive carriage, can be overcome, so as to create a      reasonable new convention or protocol. The prospect exists      that there will be no satisfactory new convention or      protocol, and that the intercarrier agreements will fail to      provide a workable system. It is uncertain where such an      outcome would lead, but one virtual certainty would be      complete abandonment of the Warsaw Convention, and the      airlines would not be happy about that.       So, where do we go from here?                       The Need to Work Together       Everyone involved, from IATA and airlines, to the United      States Government and other governments, to passengers'      groups and plaintiffs' lawyers, has something to lose from a      failure to come up with a satisfactory new liability regime.      The obvious answer to the problem is the formulation of a new      and widely acceptable convention or protocol which will have      the force of law to handle not only airline liability, but      rights of recourse, successive carriage, choice of law and      adequate venue.                       The Need for Ratifiability       At the excellent Lloyds of London Press Aviation Insurance      and Law Symposium in November, in London, Don Horn, Associate      General Counsel for International Affairs of the United      States Department of Transportation, pointed out the truism      that the first requirement for any new convention (or      protocol) is that it must be ratifiable.       I respectfully suggest that that is a good place to start      in our consideration of the new convention or protocol.      Whatever we come up with must be ratifiable. It must be      ratifiable by the United States, and it must be approval by      the international airlines.       Excellent preparatory work has been done by the ICAO Study      Group and the ICAO Legal Committee. The pattern of a splendid      convention or protocol is now clear, and available. In      general it has been set forth by the Study Group. It will      provide for a two tier liability system, with absolute      liability up to the threshold number of 100,000 Special      Drawing Rights, and negligence liability above that. It must      provide for the addition of the ``fifth jurisdiction.'' In      other words, passenger's domicile must be added to the other      available venues, place of incorporation of the carrier,      place of its principal place of business, and place where the      ticket was bought.       For those international airlines and insurers who are      reluctant to accept the fifth jurisdiction I would point out      three things. First, there is an element of compromise      inherent in the United States Government acceptance of the      two tier concept on fault. The position of the U.S. has been      to favor absolute liability across the board. This is not in      the airline interest, and in my humble opinion, not in the      public interest, but that, as I understand it, has been its      position. Acceptance of the two tier system by the United      States will have another laudable effect. It will insure      support of the new convention or protocol in the United      States on the part of passengers', consumers, and lawyers'      groups who believe that the fault system is one of society's      basic protections. Were the United States to hold out for      absolute liability across the board, and were that part of      the new Convention or protocol I would expect intense      opposition to the new convention or protocol in the United      States.       The second point is that in terms of cost to airlines or      insurers the fifth jurisdiction is deminimus. There are,      simply, very few cases where an American domiciliary buys a      ticket in another country and cannot sue in the United States      under one of the four presently permissible jurisdictions. I      have been practicing aviation law for forty five years, and I      have probably handled as many airline cases as any other      lawyer in the world, and I can only remember one case      involving an American passenger where I was unable to sue in      the United States because of Article 28.       Finally, the overall benefit to airlines, and all others,      of having a viable new convention or protocol would be      enormous. It would be foolish to jeopardize its chances      because of opposition to the fifth jurisdiction.                   Burden of Proof on the Second Tier       As indicated above, the new convention proposed by the      Legal Committee of ICAO prescribes a two tier system of      liability. There is absolute liability for damage up to      100,000 SDRs and negligence liability above that. In an      exercise of indecision, however, the drafters set forth three      alternative provisions on who shoulders the burden of proving      negligence. The concept of placing the burden on the      defendant airline of showing its freedom from fault grows      from Article 20 of the Convention which provides that to      exculpate itself the airline must show that it took all      necessary measures to avoid the damage. Generally speaking,      however, it is the plaintiff who has the burden of proving      negligence.       The concept of providing three alternative suggestions is      not sound and will lead to confusion and uncertainty.      Obviously, it is to the plaintiff's advantage to place the      burden on the defendant, but I don't consider it a make or      break matter. Again, it is more important to get the broad      outlines of the convention established than to fight about      each of its terms.                        Convention or Protocol?       Similary, the question of whether this should be a brand      new convention or a protocol to the Warsaw Convention is less      important than the substance of the new instrument. People I      respect, including Lorne Clark and George Tompkins, who know      far more than I do about the politics of enacting a new      convention, tell me that it will be much easier to enact a      protocol, so, for that reason alone I favor it.       I would urge a note of caution, however. The Warsaw      Convention has a very bad history and reputation with many      people, including me and my clients. For many of them it has      ruined their lives. I would eliminate all extolatory language      praising the Warsaw Convention, such as the introductory      language in the ICAO Legal Committee draft, regardless      whether it is new convention or protocol.                     Simpler and Shorter is better       I would suggest that all references to cargo be removed. It      is not necessary to include it in the new instrument. In      fact, it may be completely resolved by the ratification of      Montreal Protocol 4. The simpler and shorter the new      instrument is, the better.                          ____________________
