Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, we will not have a closing colloquy, obviously, because we are going on a break. We end what was, from the perspective of many, agree or disagree, a very productive period. As we face now this Memorial Day break, I want to thank all the Members.  I think we have done a lot of work over the last 5 months. I think it has been a very humane schedule. I hope all of you believe that, as well, that we have pretty much done it in a time frame. That is the good news.  The bad news is we are going to be moving into June and July. I want to put all of you on notice, as I have told many Members, that I expect June and July to be very busy months with much work and authorization bills coming out of committees, and I also expect for us to do the appropriation bills during the months of June and July.  The reason I rise is to say, as you know, that most Fridays in June and July, with the Fourth of July break, of course, being the exception, most Fridays will be days that my expectation is we will be doing work. This Friday was a day that we were going to work, but we won't be doing work. The supplemental is not able to be considered at this point in time.  The other thing that I wanted to rise and tell all Members is that we have gotten into a syndrome. Many of you on both sides of the aisle have talked to me about this. And I agree with you. I count myself in this, so I'm not pointing fingers at anybody exclusively. But frankly, all of us have gotten into a syndrome that when the bells ring, we watch how many have voted rather than how much time is left. That obviously is not thoughtful to those who do come here to vote within the time frame available. And very importantly, to the extent that the votes drag out, we have our committees in session with hearings that have taken a break. Chairman Frank and a number of other Members have talked to me about it. We leave secretaries of departments and other very busy and important witnesses, and all of our witnesses are treated without courtesy. That is not a good thing for any of us to do.                              {time}  1745  So I say when we come back--and we've tried this before and it's very difficult, but Members obviously don't get there on time, and some of you are going to be angry with me on both sides of the aisle, but I'm going to try to work with our presiding officers so that we keep to a much shorter period of time. We have been averaging 25, 26 minutes; and I would hope that all of us would cooperate with one another as a courtesy to each of us, our witnesses, and the work of this House.  I hope you have a wonderful Memorial Day break. Come back ready to report on time. Thank you very much.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
