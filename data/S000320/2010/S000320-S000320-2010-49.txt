 More than 1 year later, we tried again to pass these important reforms. The Banking Committee held more hearings leading to the markup of S. 190, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005. I will not read my entire statement from this markup, but I will read a part of it that describes the commonsense steps that we were attempting to take with our newest effort to pass then GSE reform. I quote from that markup:       My legislation creates a new regulator with combined      oversight for both the safety and soundness and the housing      mission of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan      Bank System.       The new regulator will have general regulatory authority      over all housing GSEs, including enhanced authority over      capital requirements, and enforcement and prompt corrective      action authorities that are comparable to those of the bank      regulatory agencies.       Among other enhanced regulatory authorities, the bill we      will consider today includes clear direction on portfolio      review for compliance with safety and soundness, mission and      systemic risk.       Under this proposal, the enterprises are permitted to hold      those assets which promote the enterprises' mission in the      housing market.       The bill also transfers the product review function from      HUD to the new regulator and creates a two-tier approval      process through which the enterprises must receive approval      prior to offering any new product.       The bill also establishes new criteria for approval of a      product that will ensure the enterprises remain focused on      their statutory mission of facilitating a secondary mortgage      market.       The new regulator will also have the power to conduct an      orderly resolution of a failing or insolvent GSE through a      receivership process. This clear and definitive process for      dealing with a troubled enterprise is a critical tool for the      credibility and strength of a new regulator.  Madam President, unfortunately, the Democrats did not share my view of increasing regulations on the GSEs, and their comments during the second attempt to pass meaningful reforms are telling. One of my Democratic colleagues stated then, ``When the sink is leaking, you do not tear down the house, especially if the house has served you well.'' Another recalled a critique he read of the bill before the markup, which claimed, ``It is like trying to cure the common cold with chemotherapy.''  In fact, at one hearing, one of my Democratic colleagues expressed an interest in hearing how the roles of the GSEs might be increased, when he explained:       I am not only interested in hearing about the role GSEs      currently play in the mortgage market, I am also interested      in how their commitment to home ownership and affordable      housing can be expanded.  In the end, the result of our 2005 markup was the same as our 2004 markup--a strict party-line vote with all 11 Republicans supporting the reforms and all 9 Democrats opposing them. Unfortunately, the Democrats once again sided with Wall Street and the special interests by rejecting GSE reform and any attempt to move the legislation beyond the Banking Committee.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of that recorded vote in the Banking Committee.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Markup of the Nominations of Hon.
