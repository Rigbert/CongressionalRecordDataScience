 President, I would like to pay tribute to Jim Lyons.  Jim was a tax counsel for Chairman Hatch on the Finance Committee. Before that, he served as a tax counsel for the committee when I was ranking member.  Jim had a medical emergency during a basketball game for charity which, unfortunately for us all, he did not survive.  Those who knew Jim would not be surprised that he was spending an evening at an event to help others.  He was well known for his generosity, whether it was donating holiday gifts for children in foster care or sharing his extensive knowledge of the Tax Code with younger staff who were learning the ropes.  He was incredibly smart and had a zest for his work and for life that was joyous and inspiring to all of those around him.  He loved to laugh and had a gift for making others laugh. Jim's quick wit is legendary, and he drew others to his company to hear what funny story or observation he might share next.  Devising clever floor charts that made an insightful point about tax policy was a Jim Lyons specialty. He was extremely gifted in using humor to draw attention to a serious policy concern or to point out a political absurdity.  It is a rare skill and one that Jim used to great effect. People liked to hear what he had to say. The tragedy of his loss in the prime of his life is immeasurable. Those of us who knew him take comfort in learning from his example. We can do serious work without taking ourselves too seriously. In fact, we might be much more successful by finding room to share a laugh with others. I wish Jim eternal peace and send my best wishes to his loving family.                          ____________________
