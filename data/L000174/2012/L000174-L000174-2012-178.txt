President, I know we are soon going to be voting on other matters, and I see the distinguished senior Senator from Florida, who wishes to speak, so I will not take long. However, there is one area I don't want people to forget about; that is, the Violence Against Women Act.  Eight months ago Senator Crapo and I joined together to introduce the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2011. We decided to put victims first, not politics first. So we set aside any partisan differences the two of us might have. We did this so we could tell the Senate that even though we come from entirely different political philosophies, we are united on the need to protect victims. At a time when we hear people say this body is deeply divided, an overwhelming majority of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats alike, joined us in that effort, and we passed this commonsense legislation with a remarkable 68 votes. That is a rare feat in the Senate today and it sent a clear message--stopping domestic and sexual violence. There are some who say we couldn't get 51 votes to say the Sun rises in the east. We got 68 votes to protect victims. We sent a clear message that stopping domestic violence is a priority and we will stand together to protect all victims from these devastating crimes.  Most of us here hoped the House Republicans would follow our demonstration of bipartisanship. We gave them an excellent bill and a chance to quickly take it up and pass it. Instead, unfortunately, they put politics first. They drafted a new bill, and they are within their right to do that, but here is what they did. They intentionally stripped out protections for some of the most vulnerable victims, including immigrants, LGBT victims, and Native women. They took out the key provisions to make campuses and public housing safer. They rejected the input of law enforcement and victims' services professionals who tell us these protections are desperately needed to save lives. In other words, they said: If you have two victims who are subjected to the same kind of abuse, we might protect this one, but by law we won't protect this one. I can tell my colleagues that there is no one in law enforcement in this country, no matter what their political background, who wants to be put in that position. They believe that a victim is a victim is a victim, and they want to protect all of them.  In fact, it was so obvious that the acts of some of these House Republicans were too much even for some of their own party. Nearly two dozen House Republicans, including the chair of the crime victims caucus, stood up and voted against this restrictive House bill.  We can talk about numbers and all of those things, but I wish those who came up with this restrictive House bill could have been with me last Thursday to hear from Laura Dunn, a courageous survivor of campus sexual assault who told us of her own horrendous experience. She said: I come before you to tell you about this because I want you to include the Senate provisions the House stripped out. She made an impassioned plea for that and for Congress to do all it can to protect all students on campus from the kind of unspeakable violence she encountered--the kind of violence that I pray my daughter and my granddaughters will never have to face.  More than 200 survivors of campus violence at 176 colleges and universities came forward publicly and joined her in an open letter to Congress calling for the immediate passage of this critical legislation. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence            Against Women,                                    Washington, DC, July 20, 2012.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator/Representative: We, the undersigned survivors      of violence committed on college and university campuses      nationwide and the families of those who did not survive this      violence, call upon every Member of Congress to pass the      Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization before the      end of September. Furthermore, the final VAWA must contain      comprehensive campus provisions including the Campus SaVE Act      and the Campus Safety Act.       Each of us has been dramatically affected by at least one      of the four crimes that have become a silent epidemic on      college campuses: stalking, sexual assault, dating violence      and/or domestic violence. We have been the victims of this      violence. We have family members who have been killed on      campus as part of the commission of these crimes. We have      family members who might not have been killed if their      colleges and universities had been fully and responsibly      addressing stalking, sexual assault, and dating violence      through well structured campus systems for prevention,      intervention, victim support and perpetrator accountability.       And we are not alone: 13.1% of college women report having      been stalked during the school year; one in five college      women report having been sexually assaulted; 70% of all      victims of intimate partner violence in the US experience the      first incidents of abuse before they reach the age of 25.       There are more than 4,700 colleges and universities in the      United States with a total enrollment of over 20 million      students. This is a population in crisis that cannot and will      not be ignored.       The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), enacted in 1994,      recognized the insidious and pervasive nature of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. In      every reauthorization of the Act, Congress has worked      carefully to craft improved, enhanced, and accountable      programs and services, as well as coordinated community      responses, with the goal of providing comprehensive,      effective and cost saving responses to these crimes. VAWA's      reauthorization must build upon its successes and continue      progress towards ending the violence. VAWA must reach all      victims and perpetrators of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault and stalking in every community and      on every college campus.       The Grants to Reduce Violent Crimes Against Women on Campus      program helps institutions of higher education adopt a      comprehensive response to domestic violence, dating violence,      sexual assault and stalking. First authorized in 1999, this      very small program has had a dramatic impact on the      institutions of higher education lucky enough to get one of      these grants (approximately 20-22 colleges per year). It is      essential to reauthorize the Campus Grants Program in VAWA,      yet it is unacceptable for this to continue to be the only      piece of VAWA addressing the overwhelming need.       The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination (SaVE) Act,      introduced independently in both chambers and passed as part      of S. 1925 in the Senate-passed VAWA, is a crucial step      forward. It will address sexual violence, dating violence,      and stalking at institutions of higher education and increase      awareness and prevention of these acts of violence by      requiring transparency of information, systemic, campus-wide      policies and procedures to address these crimes, prevention      programs, and assistance for victims.       The Campus Safety Act, introduced independently in both      chambers and passed as part of H.R. 4970 in the House-passed      VAWA, is also essential. It will establish a National Center      for Campus Public Safety that will provide a centralized,      government operated entity to promote proactive approaches to      campus safety through the development of best practices,      research, and training opportunities.       Both the House and the Senate passed bills earlier this      year to reauthorize VAWA. It is clear that the vast majority      of Congress supports a reauthorization of the Violence      Against Women Act with key improvements. But as we watch the      clock ticking on the 112th Congress, we are painfully aware      of the devastating blow to the young people in our colleges      and universities that will occur if Congress fails to pass a      final VAWA.       We are the voices of the unimaginable pain and suffering      occurring every day on our college campuses. We are the      voices of those young people whose safety continues to be at      such great risk. We are the voices of those who are still too      unsafe to speak out about the violence they experienced. We      are the     voices of those who have tragically died senseless deaths      when their lives were just beginning.       We will not wait! Get VAWA done now.       We call upon each and every Senator and Congressperson to      prioritize the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women      Act and the safety and well-being of the young people we are      all relying on to carry our nation forward. We implore you      not to let us or them down.
