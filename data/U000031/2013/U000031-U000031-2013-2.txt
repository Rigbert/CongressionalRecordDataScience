Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to honor Amo Houghton for his 16 years of service on the board of directors of The Faith & Politics Institute.  Amo, my good friend and our former colleague, a tireless advocate for civil rights, is stepping down as cochair of the board of Faith & Politics, just this week. He and our esteemed colleague, Congressman John Lewis, started the bipartisan Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama, which in March of next year will celebrate its 14th year. This important trip brings to life the values The Faith & Politics Institute is determined to instill, as it indeed shows the attendees how to ``rise above narrow partisanship and respond to the quiet call of conscience.''  My wife, Amey, and I traveled to Selma on this pilgrimage, and we feel that it was one of the most moving and humbling experiences of our lives.  Amo was also responsible for organizing a Faith & Politics congressional visit to South Africa, which resulted in a relationship that has lasted for over a decade and is still strong. As said by the great Nelson Mandela:       A good head and a good heart are always a formidable      combination.  My friend Amo Houghton is a formidable force.  Although The Faith & Politics Institute will miss his spirit and wisdom that he brought to the board of directors, his legacy and inspiration will always live on, as the Honorable Amory Houghton, Jr.'s status is now elevated to cochair emeritus for life.                          ____________________
