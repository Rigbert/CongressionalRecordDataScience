President, as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I salute the chairman and the ranking member for the fine work they do and for the fine staff we have. As the Senator from Kansas has said, we have 10 people who are working hard in this committee. Put it in perspective: 10 excellent staffers, responsible for overseeing the intelligence agencies of the Federal Government; 10 excellent staffers who in addition to that are initiating an investigation of the intelligence that led up to Iraq. It is totally inadequate. We are totally understaffed. That is why Senator Corzine's amendment is so important.  We have lost 335 American lives. Thousands have been wounded. We have put ourselves in a position in Iraq where we will be vulnerable for years to come, and we want to ask the hard questions with the Corzine commission. Was our intelligence right in leading us into this war? It is a difficult question and a painful question but it must be asked.  When Dr. Kay comes back emptyhanded, after more than 5 months of inspections, with hundreds of inspectors, with no evidence of weapons of mass destruction, it is a condemnation of one of two things: either our intelligence gathering or the use of that intelligence leading to the war. As painful as it is, we have to face that reality.
