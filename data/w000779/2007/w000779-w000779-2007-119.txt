President, our friend and colleague, Senator Bennett, and I have joined together in the first bipartisan legislation to guarantee quality, affordable health care for all Americans in more than a decade. I could have no better partner to deal with the premier issue here at home than Senator Bennett, who, of course, is a senior Member of the Senate Republican leadership and widely respected on both sides of the aisle. In the days ahead, together, we are going to be talking with Senators of both parties and discussing this legislation on the floor with one specific goal in mind; that is, Senate action to fix health care in America in 2007.  Now, of course, the popular wisdom is that something like this simply could never, ever be done. All the Washington, DC, beltway pundits say fixing health care is something we can't do right now and that it will be the job for the next President and the next Congress and everybody ought to expect that maybe 2 years from now, in the spring of 2009, Congress will get around to dealing with the principal domestic issue of our time.  I and Senator Bennett don't believe we were given election certificates to sit around for 2 more years, when the American people are saying they cannot afford for the Congress to wait on fixing health care. It is the top issue here at home. It has been studied, studied, and studied. It has been poked and prodded for an awfully long time. It is time for the Senate to act and act now.  Our citizens are staying up late worrying about how they are going to be able to afford quality health care. I don't see how Members of Congress can explain going home at night without addressing our citizens' concerns, and say we will talk about this again in a couple of years.
