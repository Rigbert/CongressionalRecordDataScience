Speaker, I certainly deplore the Cuban Government's decision to shoot down unarmed civilian aircraft. It was unconscionable and outrageous. However, our Government bears some blame for failing to fulfill its obligation to keep U.S. civilian aircraft from conducting harassing raids into foreign airspace from U.S. soil. But that's not the issue here. The issue is what kind of policy will bring Cuba into the fold of democratic nations.  In this case, United States foreign policy has been hijacked by a small population of right-wing Cuban exiles in Miami. The bill before us represents a complete surrender to these extremists by the President and congressional leaders. I urge my colleagues to reject it, though I know they will not.  This bill will do nothing to encourage Cuba's transition to democracy. In fact, the opposite will be the case. By continuing and tightening the fruitless embargo against Cuba, we are strengthening the Castro regime's only remaining claim to legitimacy. The losers are the Cuban people. The winners are Castro and his henchmen--who will remain in power not only in spite of but because of the embargo--and United States politicians eager to pander to the Cuban exile vote in Florida.  The contrast between United States policy toward Cuba and our Government's stance toward the brutal and geriatric communist leaders of China is stark. Despite China's well-documented human rights abuses, its unfair trade practices and its policy of exporting dangerous arms to terrorist regimes around the world, this Congress and the President insist on giving China favored nation trade status. Chinese belligerence and intransigence is not only tolerated by our Government, but rewarded. Yet the impoverished nation of Cuba is deemed to be such a threat to our shores that the most punitive sanctions are justified.  This bill is hypocrisy and pandering at its worst. It should be rejected.
