Boyd, Jr., to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division, and Eileen O'Connor to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division.  It took the Senate the entire month of June to pass S. Res. 120, a simple resolution reorganizing the Committees. I am sorry that we lost the month of June to the process of re-organizing the Senate, but I am proud of the very quick start that the Committee has gotten on holding hearings and reporting nominees.  I sent out official notice of the Committee's first hearing on judicial nominations within 10 minutes after Majority Leader Daschle announced that an agreement had been reached on reorganization. The hearing was held the day after Committee membership assignments were completed earlier this month.  We expedited Committee consideration of the nominees by urging all Senators to propound such follow-up written questions as they thought necessary as soon as possible after the hearing. I included them on the Committee agenda for our business meeting this week. At that meeting yesterday, the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to report each of the nominations. Each vote was 19 to 0.  These are the first nominations heard before the Committee, the first nominations considered by the Committee and will now be the first judicial nominations considered by the Senate this year. I have only served as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee since June 5, the Senate did not adopt its reorganizing resolution until June 29 and Committee assignments were not made until July 10.  There were no hearings on judicial nominations and no judges confirmed by the Senate during the months in which I was privileged to serve as the Ranking Democrat. I chaired the first hearing on July 11. That was the first hearing on judicial nominations all year and one more than the Republican Majority had held. The first judge we confirmed today is one more than all the judges confirmed by the Republican Majority in the first six months of this year.  I had heard the rumors that Democrats would not hold hearings and would not consider any of President Bush's judicial nominations and would not allow the confirmation of any judges. The word was that Democrats in the Senate would block all the judges. Well, here we are, having held a hearing noticed minutes after the delay in the Senate's reorganization finally ended, having proceeded with nominees to both the Court of Appeals and the District Court the day after Committee assignments were made, having proceeded with expedited Committee consideration yesterday and proceeding today to Senate consideration and what I hope will be confirmation of the first of President Bush's judicial nominations.                   NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROGER GREGORY  I know that Judge Roger Gregory, his family, and indeed, all of the people who live in the area covered by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit have been waiting a long time for this day. Judge Gregory was first nominated for this position in June, 2000 more than a year ago. He had the bipartisan support of both his home-state Senators, John Warner and Chuck Robb. Unfortunately, no hearing was ever scheduled on President Clinton's nominations of Roger Gregory.  President Clinton's attempts to fill a number of vacancies on the Fourth Circuit met with resistance, delaying the inevitable integration of the court. James Beaty, a U.S. District Court Judge for the Middle District of North Carolina, was nominated by President Clinton in December of 1995, but he never received a hearing. Judge Beaty was renominated in 1997, and again, the Committee scheduled no hearing for him. Judge Beaty waited a period of 34 months without a hearing.  President Clinton tried again in 1999, nominating another African-American, James Wynn. Judge Wynn, a North Carolina Court of Appeals Judge, was also denied a hearing before the Committee, but President Clinton sent him back to the Senate one more time, at the start of the 107th Congress in January this year. After pending for a total of 16 months without a hearing, Judge Wynn's nomination was among those withdrawn by President Bush in March of this year.  Roger Gregory was initially nominated, as I noted, over a year ago. Like the others, his nomination languished without a hearing last year. Because there was no action taken by the Senate on Mr. Gregory's nomination, President Clinton used his powers of recess appointment to make Roger Gregory the first African-American Judge to sit on the Fourth Circuit and sent his nomination for a permanent position on that Court back to the Senate at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, President Bush withdrew Judge Gregory's nomination in March.  After careful reconsideration, the President sent Judge Gregory's name back to us in May, again with the strong support of both Senators from Virginia. This makes Judge Gregory one of the few nominees ever to be nominated by Presidents of different parties.  In addition, Judge Gregory is in the unique position of serving by means of an appointment whose term would expire at the end of this session of the Senate, unless his nomination to a full lifetime appointment had been acted upon before we adjourn this year.  Judge Gregory received his B.A. in 1975 from Virginia State University, and his J.D. from the University of Michigan in 1978. Until his appointment to the Fourth Circuit, he was in private practice in Virginia. Mr. Gregory's law practice was a mix of civil and criminal, in both State and federal courts, including criminal defense, personal injury, domestic cases, real estate, work as general counsel for an urban school district, and defense cases for large insurance companies and other corporations such as General Motors and KMart. He was an active litigator, trying several cases a year. He also taught as an adjunct professor of constitutional law at Virginia State University, and as a member of the faculty of the Virginia State Bar Ethics and Professional Responsibility course for all recent admittees to the State bar.  Judge Gregory was very active in community and bar activities before he took the bench, including service on the Board of Directors of the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, the Richmond Bar Association, and the Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys. He had often spoken to students and churches. He has the strong endorsements of the National Bar Association, the Virginia Association of Defense Attorneys, the Maryland Defense Counsel Board of Directors, and many others.  His life and career have been exemplary and his qualifications for this position are stellar. His service on the bench since his appointment has beenuniformly praised. He conducted himself with distinction at his confirmation hearing this month. Based on all these considerations, it seems appropriate that Judge Gregory's nomination be the first considered by the Committee and the Senate this year.  I commended my good friend, the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, as well as Senator Allen and Representative Bobby Scott when they appeared before the Committee earlier this month to urge Judge Gregory's confirmation. I do so, again, here on the floor of the Senate. The broad, bipartisan support for this nomination has been extremely helpful.  At our hearing Senator Warner was characteristically generous in praising Senator Robb and Governor Wilder for their efforts on behalf of Roger Gregory, as well. I would also add my praise of two Presidents, one a Democrat and one a Republican. President Clinton first nominated Judge Gregory and when he appointed him to the bench broke a barrier that had extended too long at the Fourth Circuit.  President Bush deserves credit for renominating Judge Gregory and allowing the Senate a third chance to consider and confirm this outstanding nominee.
