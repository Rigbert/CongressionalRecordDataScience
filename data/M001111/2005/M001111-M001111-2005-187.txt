 President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now considering the Transportation-Treasury bill, formally known as H.R. 3058. It is the appropriations bill for the Departments of Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for fiscal year 2006.  This bill covers areas such as infrastructure, public housing, and the judiciary that are critical to millions of American families and to keeping our economy strong. For our country to reach its full potential, we need to invest in the priorities that are in this bill. Today, many people do not feel very secure about the future.
