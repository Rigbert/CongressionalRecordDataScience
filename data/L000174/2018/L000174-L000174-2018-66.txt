President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I want to honor Beth Kennett of Rochester, VT, who this month will be inducted into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame in recognition of her multifaceted leadership of agriculture in the Green Mountain State. Beth, with her husband, Bob, and their family, have for many years run a multigenerational diversified dairy farm in the White River Valley. I have often looked to Beth for her advice and insights into Vermont agriculture. She has been a strong leader on many fronts, including serving on the USDA Farm Service Agency State Committee, as founding member of the Connecticut River Watershed Farmers Alliance, as founding member of the White River Partnership, and especially as a leader in agritourism in Vermont, nationally and internationally.  Beth's induction into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame is well earned, and I ask unanimous consent that her nomination for this honor be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame Inductee Beth Kennett       Beth is a dairy farmer and innkeeper who helped forge the      path for Vermont's agri-tourism industry. For more than 30      years, she has helped educate Vermont farmers, government      officials, and the public about the economic, social, and      educational benefits of agri-tourism. As the former president      of Vermont Farms!, she has traveled and spoken both      nationally and internationally to build awareness for agri-     tourism and create new opportunities for Vermont farmers. Her      tireless outreach and desire to educate has enabled many      farms to diversify and realize the economic advantages of      connecting directly with the public. Since 1984, Beth, her      husband Bob, and three generations of her family have opened      their home for farm stays, providing educational, hands-on      vacations for thousands of domestic and international guests.                            ____________________
