President, C-SPAN is an interesting phenomenon. When I go back home to Illinois, I run into people who say: I saw you on C-SPAN.  I often joke and say: Do you have trouble sleeping? Why are you watching C-SPAN?  I wonder who it is that really watches C-SPAN. It could be a lot of people who are really fascinated by politics. It could be folks who are finding it difficult to sleep. It could be some older folks who just pass the time by watching what happens on the floor of the Senate and the House.  Tonight, I think we have a special audience of C-SPAN. Tonight, I think it is entirely possible that we are going to have the wealthiest section of audience and television viewers in the history of C-SPAN. Do you know why?
