 President, I want to thank the chairman and committee for their willingness to work with Senators Kyl, Hutchison, me, and others to include in the Treasury appropriations bill to hire 500 more inspectors and agents, along with appropriate intelligence support and equipment. It is my understanding, in addition, that if there is a difference between the House and Senate bills in this regard that the Committee will do what it can in conference to ensure that the funding for these increases will be found outside of the Customs budget.
