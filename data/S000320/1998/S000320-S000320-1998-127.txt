 President, I rise today to salute a great Alabamian and a great American whose life was cut short by war--Lieutenant James Edwin ``Jimmy'' Walker. I did not have the pleasure of knowing Jimmy, but many people from my home state who knew this young man have nothing but praise for him.  Born in 1913, Jimmy became one of the most outstanding athletes in the history of Holt High School. He was the captain of the football, baseball, and basketball teams, leading his small school to athletic prominence in the state. Jimmy's former high school coach and teacher described him as having ``superior athletic abilities, and as being a great and popular leader.'' He further described Jimmy as ``a joy and an inspiration to those who had the good fortune to work and play with or for him.''  In 1932, Jimmy entered the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, on an athletic scholarship. Throughout his three years of varsity competition, he started on both the football and basketball teams. On campus, as well as on the athletic field, Jimmy was well known, loved and respected. He was a member of the ``A'' Club, Alabama Quadrangle, Jason's Honorary Junior Society, Pi Gamma Alpha Fraternity, O.D.K., Cotillion Club, and the Court of Appeals of the Student Government. Notably, Jimmy was captain of the victorious Rose Bowl and national championship football team of 1935, as well as captain of the 1934 Crimson Tide Basketball team. He was an All-Conference, All-Southeastern, and All-American basketball player while remaining active on campus and successful in the classroom. Jimmy ultimately received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1935.  Jimmy continued in athletics, coaching basketball at Virginia Military Institute. As in high school, Jimmy led a small school to great heights. His teams were outstanding, consistently ranking higher than the much larger southern schools. At the time, newspapers called his accomplishment ``a coaching masterpiece.''  Despite his considerable professional and personal success and his growing notoriety, Jimmy asked for a leave of absence from coaching to join the United States Navy at the start of World War II. When he became a First Lieutenant in the Navy, he told his family that he had finally ``made the team.'' After a period of distinguished wartime service, on December 22, 1943, this Alabama sports-hero-turned-Naval-officer sadly died in South America, from wounds received while in the performance of his official duties.  Jimmy died serving his country. He was a true leader, not only on the athletic field but in all areas of life. As a coach, a student, and a military officer, he was a fine role model for those around him. His dedicated, patriotic spirit will be remembered for a long time. He truly gave his all for victory.  Today, 45 years after his untimely passing, my thoughts are with Jimmy's family and friends. His spirit will forever live on in those who knew him. Perhaps Jimmy's sister, Neta Walker Laycock, of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, captured his outstanding personality best when she said: ``If you knew him, you loved him. If you didn't, you missed a treat.''                          ____________________
