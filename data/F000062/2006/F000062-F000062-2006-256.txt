 President, I rise today with Senators Snowe, Durbin, Chafee, Inouye, Collins, Cantwell, Bill Nelson, Boxer, Lautenberg, Menendez, and Lieberman to introduce a bill to increase CAFE standards by 10 miles in 10 years.  This is a commonsense, bipartisan approach to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, decrease our greenhouse gas emissions, and save consumers at the pump.  We have the technology available today to increase the fuel economy of our vehicles. We just need the political will--which is why we are here today.  Specifically, our bill would raise the average fuel economy of all cars and SUVs to 35 miles per gallon by model year 2017.  This would save 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2025. That is the same amount of oil we currently import from the Persian Gulf.  This bill would also save consumers dollars at the pump. At $3 per gallon, Americans driving 15,000 miles per year are, on average, using 600 gallons of gasoline and spending $1,800 per year on gas.  By raising CAFE standards to 35 miles per gallon, consumers would only use 429 gallons of gas per year, costing $1,287 per year for gas. That is a savings of $513 per year at the pump.  Assuming the consumer keeps the vehicle for at least 5 years, that is a savings of more than $2,500--more than enough to recoup the cost of more efficient vehicles.  Raising CAFE standards is also good for the environment. The two largest culprits of climate change are coal-fired powerplants and automobiles. Coal powerplants are the largest U.S. source of carbon dioxide--producing 2.5 billion tons every year. But the automobile isn't very far behind--producing nearly 1.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year. In fact, every gallon of gasoline burned emits 20 pounds of harmful CO2 into the atmosphere. That means that each car is responsible for about 12,000 pounds of greenhouse gas emissions every year. This legislation would take a good first step at reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  By 2025, an average fuel economy standard of 35mpg would eliminate 420 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions--the equivalent of taking 90 million cars--or 75 million cars and light trucks--off the road in 1 year.  Our daily driving habits are costing consumers at the pump, threatening our national security, and potentially causing irrevocable harm to our environment. We have the technology available today to make significant increases in fuel economy standards. In fact, David Greene of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a leading expert on fuel economy, says that a 35 mpg standard by model year 2017 is cost effective and can be achieved without reducing the size, weight, or horsepower of vehicles. And 78 percent of U.S. drivers have said they are willing to pay for better fuel economy.  The longer we delay, the harder it will be to kick our addiction to oil. We must act today.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3543       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
