 President, I move to proceed to my censure resolution which is at the desk.  The text of the motion reads as follows:       I move to suspend the following:       Rule VII, paragraph 2 the phrase ``upon the calendar'',      and;       Rule VIII, paragraph 2 the phrase ``during the first two      hours of a new legislative day''.       In order to permit a motion to proceed to a censure      resolution, to be introduced on the day of the motion to      proceed, notwithstanding the fact that it is not on the      calendar of business.
