Speaker, this Sunday America celebrates Mother's Day. And families all over our country will gather on this day to honor the women who strive every day both inside and outside the home to keep the families of America strong; a celebration they richly deserve.                              {time}  2100  We all know that American women are working more and more inside the home and outside the home, and what we may not know is that many of them are working for less money.  For women in many industries, textiles, apparel footwear, for instance, their pay has actually dropped nearly 5 percent over the last 10 years in spite of the fact that they are working harder and working longer. In fact, one-third of America's working women earn poverty-level wages.  Ironically, many of the gifts which we traditionally give our mothers on Mothers' Day as expressions of our gratitude turn out to be the products of industries which depend on the depression of wages, primarily women's wages, both at home and abroad, products such as new shoes or new handbags or new outfits and, yes, even roses.  Last Tuesday, I had the privilege of participating in a press conference at which we pointed out the discrepancies in wages between products made in our country and the same products made overseas, in fact, products made by U.S. companies that have outsourced production abroad. We, to demonstrate our point, dressed a mannequin in many of these foreign goods, and on the mannequin we had a Coach handbag, where American women used to earn $7.42 an hour, not high wages by any standards, but today those bags are being made by Korean workers being paid $1.64 an hour, and those Coach bags cost nearly $200. So who is making the profit off those women?  Or Naturalizer shoes; women in our country used to make $6.95 an hour in manufacturing Naturalizer shoes, but their wages and jobs are gone, and those shoes are now made in Brazil, where women there earn 47 cents an hour, but, of course, Naturalizer shoes cost well over $50. So who is making the profit off those women?  Or take this sweater, a Chaus sweater that used to be manufactured in the United States, where women earned $7.88 an hour. Now this very same sweater made by that same company in China, where women work for pennies, but, of course, the sweater is not cheap. In fact, the price tag on this one is over $40. Who is making the profit off those women?  Or take this skirt, manufactured by the At Last Company. This skirt used to be made in the United States of America. Women workers earned $7.49 an hour. Now this skirt is being made in India, and chances are if a child in India helped make that skirt, which is very likely, no wages were paid.  [[Page H4872]] So it being Mothers Day, we provided our mannequin with a dozen roses. Roses are grown in this country, and they are harvested, and the average wage of farm workers is $5 an hour. But, of course, the roses that are available in this community today are provided through Colombia, where workers earn 55 cents an hour. But if you try to buy your mom a dozen roses in Washington this week, it is going to cost you $75. So ask yourself, who is making the money off of these women?  But are we getting a real bargain for all of this value for our money? A break for the consumer? Well, I ask you, is a bargain a Coach handbag at $200 or Naturalizer shoes at $50 or a Chaus sweater at $40 or roses at 75?  The Come Shop With Me campaign asks: Is it worth it? Are we really getting a good deal? Can the 7,300 people who have lost their jobs making handbags here in America afford a $200 Coach handbag made in Korea? Can the 17,700 women who have lost their jobs in our country in the footwear industry buy Naturalizer shoes made in Brazil that cost $50? And can the women of Brazil or the women of Korea or the women of India, can they buy those products on the wages they earn? Absolutely not.  Over the last decade in our country, nearly 300,000 women workers have lost jobs in the textile industry alone, mostly to foreign competition.  Mr. Speaker, let me end by saying the Come Shop With Me campaign will continue over the next few months to draw our attention to the human cost of trade.  Tonight I say to the mothers of America and the world, ``Happy Mother's Day. We will not forget you.''                          ____________________
