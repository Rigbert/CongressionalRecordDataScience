 President, the Senator from Massachusetts asked unanimous consent to have the New York Times editorial from today printed in the Record. It clearly laid out the case for what is happening today to taxpayers who are paying a tremendous price. And who is losing? It is our students.  We have to stop overcharging the American people. We still have time to do it this year and help students get to college at a time when we all know tuition rates are rising. We need to give more to get more students there.  I warn the Senate, the clock is ticking. Every Member of the Senate has to decide if they stand with students and families and taxpayers, or if they are going to stand with the special interests. Millions of students and millions of families are waiting for this answer. We have to stop the special interest subsidy today.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
