 I might say to the Chair, I have spoken to the Senator in the hopes that we can bring this to a vote. I have spoken to the minority leader, Senator McConnell, and he has said there are other Members who wish to come to the floor to speak on this amendment, and I hope they will. There is no point in dragging this out indefinitely. There are many other amendments that are going to be offered and I wish to bring this to a vote.  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding for a question.
