But the Senator has done a very careful and thoughtful analysis of the situation and particularly this situation of what Senator Grassley and I came to call the ``rotating hold,'' simply shifting to another person--something that has been done often over the years by Democrats and Republicans. I think now is the time to get this changed. By the way, the Senator is absolutely correct on the bipartisan nature of the rule change. The vote was 84 to 13. There was overwhelming bipartisan support for it.  The Library of Congress has actually put together a very thoughtful historical analysis featuring the discussion of things such as the ``Mae West'' hold, which came to be known as the ``come look me over'' hold, which I gather was not a full-fledged hold but it might actually blossom into one.  So the Senator is absolutely right about what the choices are. That is why it is time, once and for all, to get this changed. I so appreciate the Senator, and also Senator McCaskill from Missouri, coming and highlighting the fact that this has again gotten out of hand.  The historical analysis of this has been that the hold was something that would be used rarely. The hold was for something of great consequence. Yet now it seems we have these secret holds that are simply thrown out for nominations and pieces of legislation because someone has some modest interest or is carrying out a different agenda, and I think that is why the secrecy is so unfortunate.  I thank my colleague.
