 President, I send this amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Biden and myself.  For 3 years, Senator Biden and I have sent an amendment to the desk which would prohibit the teaching of bomb making. Twice it passed this body by unanimous consent, and twice in conference the amendment was taken out.  Last year, when we made this amendment and this body graciously and, I believe, wisely accepted it, it was replaced in conference with the proviso that the Department of Justice would do a report to see whether this amendment was well advised and would stand a constitutional test.  On April 29 of this year, the Department of Justice published a report, and that report was entitled, ``Report on the Availability of Bomb Making Information, The Extent to Which Its Dissemination is Controlled by Federal Law, and the Extent to Which Such Dissemination May be Subject to Regulation Consistent with the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.''  The bottom line of the report is that the Department of Justice agrees that it would be appropriate and beneficial to adopt further legislation to address the problem of teaching bomb making directly, if that can be accomplished in a manner that does not impermissibly restrict the wholly legitimate publication and teaching of such information or otherwise violate the first amendment.  In other words, the question presented by this is, when does the first amendment end and when does conspiracy to commit a felony begin?  So the language in the amendment that we submit to this body today has been reworked, strengthened and approved by the Department of Justice. I would like to briefly read it. The language is as follows:       It shall be unlawful for any person--       (A) to teach or demonstrate the making or use of an      explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of mass      destruction, or to distribute by any means information      pertaining to, in whole or in part, the manufacture or use     of an explosive, destructive device, or weapon of mass      destruction, with the intention that the teaching,      demonstration, or information be used for, or in furtherance      of, an activity that constitutes a Federal criminal offense      or a State or local criminal offense affecting interstate      commerce . . .  Then there is an alternative:       or (b) to teach or demonstrate to any person the making or      use of an explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of      mass destruction . . . knowing that such person intends to      use the teaching, demonstration, or information for, or in      furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal      criminal offense or a State or local criminal offense      affecting interstate commerce.  The penalty for violating this law would be a fine of $250,000 or a maximum of 20 years in prison, or both.  Mr. President, according to terrorism expert, Neil Livingston, there are more than 1,600 so-called mayhem-manuals in circulation. I outlined some examples of what I am talking about.  I will never forget, Mr. President, and you are a member of the Judiciary Committee--I don't believe you were on the committee at the time--but when a document entitled ``The Terrorist's Handbook'' was circulated, I believe at that time Senator Kennedy and I couldn't believe it. So I went back to my office and asked my staff to download what is called ``The Terrorist's Handbook.'' The cover of ``The Terrorist's Handbook'' reads something like this:       Stuff you are not supposed to know about.       Whether you are planning to blow up the World Trade Center,      or merely explode a few small devices on the White House      lawn, the Terrorist's Handbook is an invaluable guide to      having a good time. Where else can you get such wonderful      ideas about how to use up all that extra ammonium triiodide      left over from last year's revolution?  And then this handbook, which I have in my hand, goes on to tell people how to break into a building, how to pick a lock, how to break into a chem lab in a college, how to look like a student. It produces techniques for picking locks. It goes on and tells you what useful household chemicals you should use. And then it goes on to explain, with specificity, how to make a light-bulb bomb, a book bomb, a phone bomb, and it goes on and on and on.  Mr. President, there is no legal, legitimate use for a phone bomb, for a book bomb, for a baby-food bomb, all of which are described in this handbook. When it is put in this context, the context of criminality, it is my belief that the person who puts this up on the Internet becomes a conspirator in the ability to commit a major crime in the United States.  An interesting thing that we have found is that individuals who have committed these crimes have actually had at least some of these publications in their home when they were arrested.  According to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the following publications were found among Timothy McVeigh's possessions: ``Homemade C-4, A Recipe for Survival.'' My staff just went over to the Library of Congress and tried to take out a copy of this. Incidentally, it is missing from the library.  ``Ragnar's Big Book of Homemade Weapons and Improvised Explosives.''  So we know that materials on the Internet are used by terrorists to commit terrorist acts. We also know that the number of explosive devices now being found are increasing. Authorities have stated that the rise is attributable to a rise in Internet use. This is certainly true in Los Angeles County. During the first half of 1996, these numbers of explosive devices have increased dramatically; 178 were found compared to 86 total in 1995.  Responses by the Los Angeles Police Department to reports of suspected bombs have shot up more than 35 percent from 1994 to 1995. The LAPD found 41 explosives in 1995, more than double the number 3 years ago. And it goes on and on and on.  One thing is also very interesting. Not only are terrorists using this, but children are using this.  Not too long ago there was a cartoon in a newspaper. It really describes what is happening. A mother is on the telephone saying to a friend, ``* * * history, astronomy, science, Bobby is learning so much on the Internet * * *'' And there is Bobby sitting by his computer, and what Bobby is doing here is putting a timer on six sticks of dynamite looking at the Internet and following the recipe. Of course what that leads to is something like this:       Three Boys used Internet to Plot School Bombing, Police      Say.  That is the New York Times.  Something like this:       Internet Cited for Surge in Bomb Reports.       Police and sheriffs officials say Web sites provide      youngsters with information on making explosives.  Yesterday, June 18, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported on the pending trial of 15-year-olds Burke DeCesare and Adam Walker, who were charged with planting a bomb in their Catholic school. They are eighth graders. They live in the Bayview neighborhood. They broke into Saint Coleman Catholic School in Pompano Beach around 2 a.m. on February 24, 1996. They planted a gasoline bomb in the ceiling of classroom 116.  Bomb experts from the Broward Sheriff's Office said the device, made with gasoline, was wired to explode at the flick of a light switch. This is taught--the recipe for this is in one of these manuals. The boys told police they got the instructions to build the bomb from the Internet.  Nine days ago, on June 10, 1997, the Cleveland Dispatch reported the arrest of a North Side 15-year-old who built a homemade bomb with information he gathered from the Internet. The Columbus Fire Division bomb squad was required to remove devices from the kitchen and the basement of the parents' homes. Neighbors, who lived within 500 feet of the home, were evacuated for 2 hours.  Columbus police reported that one device consisted of a quart Mason jar containing lighter fluid and Styrofoam, with an M-90 inserted into the Mason jar cap which served as an igniter. This young man told his parents he learned to make the bomb on the Internet.  Last month, the Los Angeles Times reported that two 14-year-old boys were arrested in Yorba Linda, CA, after crafting eight pipe bombs and detonating one of them. The bomb caused a fire, charring 400 feet of land behind a home on Grandview Avenue. After admitting they sparked the fire with the bomb, the boys told investigators they had seven more bombs inside the house. The bombs were fashioned with information from the Internet.  In May of this year, the Baltimore Sun reported that two teenagers in Finland face charges over an explosion from Finland's second ``Internet bomb'' in a week. Sixty people were evacuated. And it goes on and on and on.  In Orange County, police say teenagers may have used the Internet to help construct acid-filled bottle bombs in Mission Viejo and Huntington Beach, one of which burned a 5-year-old boy when he found it on a school playground.  According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, between 1992 and 1995, 15 juveniles were killed and 366 injured in the United States while making explosive devices. Most of this comes right off of the Internet.  The Justice Department, on a single Web site, obtained the titles to over 110 different bombmaking texts.  The point here is that this material is now so easy to get. When it is put in something like a terrorist handbook and you are told what to use, how to steal it, how to dress like a college student, how to break into a chem lab, how to use cardboard to stuff in the lock so you can come back at night, how to go home and how to go into your kitchen and make one of these bombs, and then how to go out and explode it wherever you want--there is no legitimate legal use for this information.  There is only a criminal purpose for this information. There is no legal use for a baby food bomb, for a phone bomb, for a book bomb. You do not blow up a tree stump if you are a farmer in the field with one of these. There is no legal use. So I am hopeful--I know that we are into the third year of this amendment--that it will in fact survive a conference committee. I understand that both sides are willing to accept the amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Department of Justice report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Summary of the Report on the Availability of Bombmaking Information, The Extent to Which its Dissemination is Controlled by Federal Law, and   the Extent to Which Such Dissemination May be Subject to Regulation       Consistent with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution              (Prepared by the U.S. Department of Justice)                        Introduction and Summary       In section 709(a) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death      Penalty Act of 1996 [``the AEDPA''], Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110      Stat. 1214, 1297 (1996), Congress provided that, in      consultation with such other officials and individuals as she      considers appropriate, the Attorney General shall conduct a      study concerning--       (1) the extent to which there is available to the public      material in any medium (including print, electronic, or film)      that provides instruction on how to make bombs, destructive      devices, or weapons of mass destruction;       (2) the extent to which information gained from such      material has been used in incidents of domestic or      international terrorism;       (3) the likelihood that such information may be used in      future incidents of terrorism;       (4) the application of Federal laws in effect on the date      of enactment of this Act to such material;       (5) the need and utility, if any, for additional laws      relating to such material; and       (6) an assessment of the extent to which the first      amendment protects such material and its private and      commercial distribution.     Section 709(b) of the AEDPA, in turn, requires the Attorney      General to submit to the Congress a report containing the      results of the study, and to make that report available to      the public.       Following enactment of the AEDPA, a committee was      established within the Department of Justice [``the DOJ      Committee''], comprised of departmental attorneys as well as      law enforcement officials of the Federal Bureau of      Investigation and the Treasury Department's Bureau of      Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The committee members divided      responsibility for undertaking the tasks mandated by section      709. Some members canvassed reference sources, including the      Internet, to determine the facility with which information      relating to the manufacture of bombs, destructive devices and      other weapons of mass destruction could be obtained. Criminal      investigators reviewed their files to determine the extent to      which such published information was likely to have been used      by persons known to have manufactured bombs and destructive      devices for criminal purposes. And legal experts within the      Department of Justice reviewed extant federal criminal law      and judicial precedent to assess the extent to which the      dissemination of bombmaking information is now restricted by      federal law, and the extent to which it may be restricted,      consistent with constitutional principles. This Report      summarizes the results of these efforts.       As explained in this Report, the DOJ committee has      determined that anyone interested in manufacturing a bomb,      dangerous weapon, or a weapon of mass destruction can easily      obtain detailed instructions from readily accessible sources,      such as legitimate reference books, the so-called underground      press, and the Internet. Circumstantial evidence suggests      that, in a number of crimes involving the employment of      such weapons and devices, defendants have relied upon such      material in manufacturing and using such items. Law      enforcement agencies believe that, because the      availability of bombmaking information is becoming      increasingly widespread (over the Internet and from other      sources), such published instructions will continue to      play a significant role in aiding those intent upon      committing future acts of terrorism and violence.       While current federal laws--such as those prohibiting      conspiracy, solicitation, aiding and abetting, providing      material support for terrorist activities, and unlawfully      furthering civil disorders--may, in some instances, proscribe      the dissemination of bombmaking information, no extant      federal statute provides a satisfactory basis for prosecution      in certain classes of cases that Senators Feinstein and Biden      have identified as particularly troublesome. Senator      Feinstein introduced legislation during the last Congress in      an attempt to fill this gap. The Department of Justice agrees      that it would be appropriate and beneficial to adopt further      legislation to address this problem directly, if that can be      accomplished in a manner that does not impermissibly restrict      the wholly legitimate publication and teaching of such      information, or otherwise violate the First Amendment.       The First Amendment would impose substantial constraints on      any attempt to proscribe indiscriminately the dissemination      of bombmaking information. The government generally may not,      except in rare circumstances, punish persons either for      advocating lawless action or for disseminating truthful      information--including information that would be dangerous if      used--that such persons have obtained lawfully. However, the      constitutional analysis is quite different where the      government punishes speech that is an integral part of a      transaction involving conduct the government otherwise is      empowered to prohibit; such ``speech acts''--for instance,      many cases of inchoate crimes such as aiding and abetting and      conspiracy--may be proscribed without much, if any, concern      about the First Amendment, since it is merely incidental that      such ``conduct'' takes the form of speech.       Accordingly, we have concluded that Senator Feinstein's      proposal can withstand constitutional muster in most, if not      all, of its possible applications, if such legislation is      slightly modified in several respects that we propose at the      conclusion of this Report. As modified, the proposed      legislation would be likely to maximize the ability of the      Federal Government--consistent with free speech protections--     to reach cases where an individual disseminates information      on how to manufacture or use explosives or weapons of mass      destruction either (i) with the intent that the information      be used to facilitate criminal conduct, or (ii) with the      knowledge that a particular recipient of the information      intends to use it in furtherance of criminal activity.
