Secretary of State Powell has made it clear the United States approach involves all three--abstinence, fidelity, and condoms. And in the country of Uganda, it has been successful.  Why in the world are we establishing a 33 percent requirement when it comes to the abstinence programs? This afternoon we had tea with the First Lady of Uganda, and we had a conversation with her and asked, wouldn't you want to have the flexibility to apply these programs to the communities and villages and situations in the most effective way to fight this disease? She said, of course we would.  This House bill, which is now so sacred that we cannot change one word, has put in 33 percent--not in the interest of global health but in the interest of an American political agenda. That is unfortunate.
