Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Corona, California are exceptional. Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Bobby Spiegel is one of these individuals. On September 30, 2003, Bobby will be honored at the 2003 Distinguished Citizens Awards Dinner organized by the Boy Scouts of America.  Bobby graduated from Corona High School and has been a Corona resident since 1973. He attended Fullerton Junior College and began his career as an entrepreneur with his first business, The Flower Shoppe. He sold the business to work in the family electrical business in 1980. In 1989, while still working for the family business, he and his wife, Karen, a Corona City Council Member, started Spiegel Enterprises/Publications.  Bobby began volunteering at a young age when he first joined the Jaycees, the Junior Chamber of Commerce, in 1976. He served in almost every capacity and learned from the experience. He served as state president in 1986 and 1987 and was honored with one of the top ten awards in the nation for his service. Over the years, Bobby has also served on the Board of Directors for several community and professional organizations including the American Cancer Society, The National Electrical Contractors Association, and the YMCA. Bobby was also the charter president of the Circle City Rotary Club and is past president of Congregation Beth Shalom. He currently serves as Chairman for the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation.  Bobby has been recognized for his impressive community service and exemplary leadership. He was the recipient of the Outstanding Young Men of America award, the California Jaycees and US Jaycees awards, Rotary International award, and was named 1988 Corona Citizen of the Year.  Bobby and Karen have five children, Tanya, Rebecca, Rachel, Isaac, and Joshua who continue their parent's commitment to community involvement and service.  Bobby's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. He has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives the 2003 Boy Scouts of America Distinguished Citizen Award.                          ____________________
