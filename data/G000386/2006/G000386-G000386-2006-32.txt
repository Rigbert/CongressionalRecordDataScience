 We share an interest in making sure that States have adequate Federal funding to cover children through CHIP. No one wants to see children lose coverage, and we hope the provisions in this bill will help States on a temporary basis until we have time to work out a more permanent solution to the CHIP financing structure. Now I know that there are a lot of concerns about this package. And I want to make it clear that Senator Baucus and I thought this was what we could pass right now. We are hopeful that we can pass this package here in the Senate and then get House agreement tonight or tomorrow so that we can forestall these shortfalls for the first part of the year.  I want to make it clear, however, that nothing in this package binds us for CHIP reauthorization next year. There is discomfort with the CHIP provisions on both sides of the aisle. But Senators are willing to compromise in order to get something done for children before we go home. Therefore, we should put aside our differences and individual gripes in order to get something productive passed.
