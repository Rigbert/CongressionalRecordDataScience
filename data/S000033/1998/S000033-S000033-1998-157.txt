 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young people will benefit my colleagues.  Statement by Angela Deblasio and Lynne Clough Regarding Foreign Aid       Angela Deblasio. Foreign aid is an essential part of the      United States' annual budget. This aid to less fortunate      nations helps to alleviate famine and the effects of      disasters. It promotes agricultural and industrial      production. It also provides U.S. know-how for basic health,      education and housing needs, while rewarding governments for      embracing American ideals and interests.       Foreign aid is not just money. The United States aid      program consists of development, economic, military and food      assistance. Development assistance provides training and      advice in all areas. Economic support contributes to the      political stability and economic strength. Military aid      provides grants and credits for the purchase of weapons,      along with training and advice for the forces. Food aid is      free or reduced-price agricultural products.       One of the great historical successes of American foreign      aid was the Marshal Plan.       Lynne Clough. World War II left many scars in Western      Europe and the United States. Secretary of State George      Marshal proposed a plan that would not only help Western      Europe overcome poverty and resist temptations of communism,      but help Americans keep their jobs and offer more      opportunities.       This plan became known as the Marshal Plan. We sent over      tons of goods and money to Western Europe. Then, in turn,      Western Europe bought our products, which gave Americans      jobs. Giving U.S. aid prevented Western Europe from falling      under the influence of communism and it gave us protection      from the Soviet Union.       Aid to foreign countries has expanded over the past few      years.       Angela Deblasio. For the past 37 years, Peace Corps      volunteers have worked together with the people of Africa and      other nations around the world. Today, Peace Corps volunteers      contribute to grassroots development projects in education,      business, the environment and health. They establish forest      conservation plans and find alternatives to wood as a source      of food.       Volunteers work to involve people in protecting endangered      wildlife species and recycling projects. Peace Corps      volunteers help individuals in developing nations to learn      the skills necessary to help themselves.       The best example of how the United States gains from      foreign aid is the country of Russia. The U.S. is currently      giving aid to the Russians. The American taxpayers are      definitely getting their money's worth. They are helping to      bring banking experts, legal experts, business experts, and      political scientists to the nation of Russia and create a      free democratic society based on free enterprise. Also,      American tax dollars are paying to help the nations of the      former Soviet Union safely dismantle nuclear weapons once      pointed at the United States. American aid is also helping to      ensure that the nuclear materials do not fall into the hands      of terrorists during these potentially dangerous times.       Lynne Clough. ``Why spend our money on foreign aid?'' That      is a question many of us ask. As you just heard, foreign aid      helps America prosper. Foreign aid is only one percent of our      annual budget and is a very good investment. It provides      security by aiding our allies and sets up good trading      partners. Giving aid is also a way to deal with problems when      they are small, and perhaps prevent future conflict.    Statement by Natalie Ross Regarding Student Drinking and Driving       Natalie Ross. Good afternoon. I will have to be quite      honest with you: Many of the issues that I was going to speak      about today have already been brought up with the student      drinking and driving.       Congressman Sanders. That doesn't make them less important      for you to bring them up.       Natalie Ross. Recently, as you can tell by today, we had      many people who brought up many concerns about how      advertisers influence us, and many different things--we were      reminded of the tragedy up in Newport, which, unfortunately,      claimed two of my very close friends.       I feel there is a message that we're sending to our youth      that is not totally appropriate. It has been engraved in our      brains for the longest time not to drink and drive, but I      think that message is totally appropriate for adults who are      of age, because they have the right to drink. But I think we      are only fighting the battle halfway when we tell students      not to drink and drive; I feel the message should be not to      drink at all.       Many times students say, it is okay, you know, somebody      will bail me out. For example, we had a community forum in      St. Albans, and we have many parents who said, Sure, on prom      night, I will sit at City Hall and wait for all the teenagers      who are drinking, that are too, in their minds, drunk to      drive home, and I will go and get them. But I feel they are      sending the wrong message, because that is just saying: We      will come and get you if you mess up. And I feel that there      are too many times that people get off the hook too easily.      And I'm not exactly sure what the answer is, but I just      wanted to come today and express my concern about this. Statement by Nora Conlon, Megan Reardon, Blair Marvin, Shawn Beigen,       Kate Henry and Phillip Moore Regarding the U.N. and the U.S.       Nora Conlon. A great deal of how successful the United      Nations is depends on the attitudes of its member states.      Americans have usually supported full U.S. cooperation with      the U.N., but the level of support declined markedly      beginning in the early 1970s, and remained relatively low      during the 1980s. The U.S.'s stance during that period toward      the United Nations was that of a reluctant participant.       The 1990s have witnessed a strong revival of American      support for full U.S. cooperation with the United Nations      Nations. This is because President Clinton's administration      has expressed a great interest in the U.N., more so than its      predecessors. The U.N. support that exists now from Americans      is roughly equal to the strong support that existed in the      1960s. While American public support for the U.N. may be      high, nevertheless the United States Government's opinion of      the U.N.'s effectiveness is low.       This chart illustrates U.S. cooperation with the United      Nations. The question asked was whether or not poll      respondents agreed with the statement: Should the United      States cooperate fully with the United Nations? The red line      represents the percentage of those who are in support of full      cooperation, while the black line represents those who oppose      full cooperation with the United Nations. You can see that      American support for the United Nations has increased      considerably, and yet the U.S. Government has taken a far      different stance towards the U.N.       Kate Heney. The tension is between the U.S. and the U.N. is      financial. By a contradiction of terms, the U.S. is both the      greatest contributor and debtor of the 185 member countries      of the U.N. The United States is responsible for 25 percent      of U.N. expenditures, but despite a $60 billion surplus in      our own budget, we are $1.3 billion behind in our payments to      the peacekeeping budget of the U.N.       Legislative efforts have been made to pay up--and,      actually, I have a question for you, Congressman, concerning      this. On March 26th, the State Department authorization bill      approved by voice vote an $819 million U.N. debt payment.      This has been stalled since 1997, because the House of      Representatives tried to include a provision holding that      none of the money was to fund any family planning      organization that performed abortions. President Clinton vows      to veto any bill containing the abortion provision.       I believe that they have lost sight of the humanitarian      issues and that the payment of international peacekeeping      dues should not be prevented by conflicts within our own      government. I was wondering what your position was on this.       Congressman Sanders. I will answer that question in a      minute, Okay? I am happy to answer that, but let's let      everybody make their statement.       Blair Marvin. One of the reasons why the U.S. is      withholding a payment of its debt is that our government has      developed its own agenda for U.N. reform. The United States      emphasis on reform is intended to stabilize the U.N.      financially, making the organization more efficient. We      wanted it to be more focused on key priorities and more      accountable for its members.       Progress has begun in areas of greater budget discipline.      The two key requirements in this is the lowering of the      U.S.'s assessed share of the U.N. budget from 25 percent to      20 percent over a three-year period, along with the creation      of a contested arrears account for debts disputed by the U.S.       One other area of reform is the U.S. commitment to the      expansion the U.N. Security Council, which will strengthen      its effectiveness and this will enhance representation      throughout the world without detracting from its working      efficiency. The U.S. wishes to grant permanent seats to Japan      and accept three other seats from the developing nations from      the regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America.       Phillip Moore. The U.N. is a valuable asset for the U.S.      foreign policy. On numerous occasions, the U.N. has given the      United States a chance to gain international backing for      issues important to American national interests--for      instance, the Persian Gulf War. The U.N. Security Council      provided for several measures which gave support for a      multinational coalition force, which helped regain control of      Kuwait from Iraq and also provided President Clinton with the      authorization to form a multinational force to help reinstall      the democratic government on Haiti.       The peacekeeping missions of the U.N. are also vital to      American interests. Often, peacekeeping missions keep      regional conflicts from growing into a wider crisis which may      involve U.S. military intervention. For instance, on the      island of Cyprus. The two NATO nations of Greece and Turkey      have a conflict over the island of Cyprus. However, U.N.      forces have kept the issue from growing into open conflict.      And since the two nations are members of NATO, that could be      a serious problem for the alliance. Humanitarian aid of the      U.N. also benefits America as well, because it is in no one's      interest to allow members of other countries to go on      suffering.       By not paying our dues to the U.N., we are weakening our      ability to play a larger role in the international community      and ultimately hurt our own national interest and well-being.       Megan Reardon. We would like to leave you with a few      suggestions on the U.N., because it is a tough topic. We      propose you support the U.N. agencies on human rights and      economic and social development; and pay our dues, which is      an important one; support expansion of the Security Council      with Germany and Japan; and support and gain support for      collective peacekeeping.       Congressman Sanders. Thank you. Excellent.                                 ____________________
