HATCH. No. Look, as chairman, I can only do certain things. I will tell you this, I put through, as ranking member or chairman, 377 Clinton judges, the second most judges confirmed for a President in history. The highest confirmed happened to be through President Reagan, and there were 382, 5 more. I believe that I would have put through even more than President Reagan or President Clinton had it not been for Democrat holds on the floor against other Democrat nominees.  Let me go further because--let's be fair about it--President Reagan had 6 years of his own party in control of the Senate, in the Senate Judiciary Committee to help him get those 382 judges. President Clinton had 6 years of the opposition party, and yet we gave him virtually the same number as the all-time champion, President Reagan.
