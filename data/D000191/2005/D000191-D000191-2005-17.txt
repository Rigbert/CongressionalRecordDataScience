  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker, well, the Bush administration set yet another record yesterday. Congratulations to the Bush administration. We set the highest 1-month trade deficit in the history of the United States, eclipsing the highest deficit figure previous record which was set last month.  We are headed toward a $718 billion trade deficit this year. We are borrowing $2 billion a day from people overseas to buy things made overseas that used to be made here, and they keep standing up on that side of the aisle and saying what is wrong with Americans, can't they see the economy is booming? Yes, it is booming, we are borrowing money overseas to buy goods overseas, and that makes it look like a booming economy while people are losing their jobs here in America, 3 million manufacturing jobs left, and these trade policies are driving down wages in this country.  That is their idea of a successful economy, because the CEOs and a few investors are doing really well. It is a disaster. No more record trade deficits. We need a new trade policy for this country.                          ____________________[Page H11658]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          RECORD TRADE DEFICIT  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
