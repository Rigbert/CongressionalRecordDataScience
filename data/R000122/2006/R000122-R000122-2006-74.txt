President, I rise today, along with my colleague, Senator Isakson, to introduce the Tanning Accountability and Notification--TAN--Act of 2006. A House counterpart measure was introduced by Representatives Maloney and Brown-Waite in February.  Close to a million people will be diagnosed with skin cancer this year. Approximately 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime, and these numbers are on the rise.  There are many factors that contribute to these startling figures. In recent years efforts have been undertaken by various organizations to better inform the public about the risk of sun exposure and ways to decrease the chance of developing skin cancer. One area, however, where better information is sorely needed is on the use of indoor tanning salons.  Every day approximately 1 million people visit a tanning salon. It is a practice particularly popular among teens, the group that seems most at risk from the effects of indoor tanning. The American Academy of Dermatology, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the National Institutes ofHealth, NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and the World Health Organization, WHO, all discourage the use of indoor tanning equipment.  This message and the current information about the risks of indoor tanning I fear are not being adequately passed on to consumers. The FDA has not updated its warnings on tanning beds since 1979. Regular users of indoor tanning beds deserve to be fully informed.  The TAN Act calls upon the FDA to revisit the current label on indoor tanning beds and determine through a process of public hearings and consumer testing what kind of labeling requirements would convey important information on the risks of indoor tanning.  This legislation is not about introducing new regulations but ensuring that the current FDA regulations remain effective in communicating accurate, current, and clear information to consumers of indoor tanning salons.  I look forward to working with my colleagues towards passage of this important, bipartisan legislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                 ______                                       By
