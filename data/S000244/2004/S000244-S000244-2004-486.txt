In making      such appointments, the Librarian shall consult with the      Register of Copyrights.       ``(b) Functions.--Subject to the provisions of this      chapter, the functions of the Copyright Royalty Judges shall      be as follows:       ``(1) To make determinations and adjustments of reasonable      terms and rates of royalty payments as provided in sections      112(e), 114, 115, 116, 118, 119 and 1004. The rates      applicable under sections 114(f)(1)(B), 115, and 116 shall be      calculated to achieve the following objectives:       ``(A) To maximize the availability of creative works to the      public.       ``(B) To afford the copyright owner a fair return for his      or her creative work and the copyright user a fair income      under existing economic conditions.       ``(C) To reflect the relative roles of the copyright owner      and the copyright user in the product made available to the      public with respect to relative creative contribution,      technological contribution, capital investment, cost, risk,      and contribution to the opening of new markets for creative      expression and media for their communication.       ``(D) To minimize any disruptive impact on the structure of      the industries involved and on generally prevailing industry      practices.       ``(2) To make determinations concerning the adjustment of      the copyright royalty rates under section 111 solely in      accordance with the following provisions:       ``(A) The rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be      adjusted to reflect--       ``(i) national monetary inflation or deflation; or       ``(ii) changes in the average rates charged cable      subscribers for the basic service of providing secondary      transmissions to maintain the real constant dollar level of      the royalty fee per subscriber which existed as of the date      of October 19, 1976,     except that--       ``(I) if the average rates charged cable system subscribers      for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions      are changed so that the average rates exceed national      monetary inflation, no change in the rates established by      section 111(d)(1)(B) shall be permitted; and       ``(II) no increase in the royalty fee shall be permitted      based on any reduction in the average number of distant      signal equivalents per subscriber.     The Copyright Royalty Judges may consider all factors      relating to the maintenance of such level of payments,      including, as an extenuating factor, whether the industry has      been restrained by subscriber rate regulating authorities      from increasing the rates for the basic service of providing      secondary transmissions.       ``(B) In the event that the rules and regulations of the      Federal Communications Commission are amended at any time      after April 8, 1976, to permit the carriage by cable systems      of additional television broadcast signals beyond the local      service area of the primary transmitters of such signals, the      royalty rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B) may be      adjusted to insure that the rates for the additional distant      signal equivalents resulting from such carriage are      reasonable in the light of the changes effected by the      amendment to such rules and regulations. In determining the      reasonableness of rates proposed following an amendment of      Federal Communications Commission rules and regulations, the      Copyright Royalty Judges shall consider, among other factors,      the economic impact on copyright owners and users; except      that no adjustment in royalty rates shall be made under this      subparagraph with respect to any distant signal equivalent or      fraction thereof represented by--       ``(i) carriage of any signal permitted under the rules and      regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in      effect on April 15, 1976, or the carriage of a signal of the      same type (that is, independent, network, or noncommercial      educational) substituted for such permitted signal; or       ``(ii) a television broadcast signal first carried after      April 15, 1976, pursuant to an individual waiver of the rules      and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, as      such rules and regulations were in effect on April 15, 1976.       ``(C) In the event of any change in the rules and      regulations of the Federal Communications Commission with      respect to syndicated and sports program exclusivity after      April 15, 1976, the rates established by section 111(d)(1)(B)      may be adjusted to assure that such rates are reasonable in      light of the changes to such rules and regulations, but any      such adjustment shall apply only to the affected television      broadcast signals carried on those systems affected by the      change.       ``(D) The gross receipts limitations established by section      111(d)(1)(C) and (D) shall be adjusted to reflect national      monetary inflation or deflation or changes in the average      rates charged cable system subscribers for the basic service      of providing secondary transmissions to maintain the real      constant dollar value of the exemption provided by such      section, and the royalty rate specified therein shall not be      subject to adjustment.       ``(3)(A) To authorize the distribution, under sections 111,      119, and 1007, of those royalty fees collected under sections      111, 119, and 1005, as the case may be, to the extent that      the Copyright Royalty Judges have found that the distribution      of such fees is not subject to controversy.       ``(B) In cases where the Copyright Royalty Judges determine      that controversy exists, the Copyright Royalty Judges shall      determine the distribution of such fees, including partial      distributions, in accordance with section 111, 119, or 1007,      as the case may be.       ``(C) the Copyright Royalty Judges shall make a partial      distribution of such fees during the pendency of the      proceeding under subparagraph (B) if all participants under      section 803(b)(2) in the proceeding that are entitled to      receive those fees that are to be partially distributed--       ``(i) agree to such partial distribution;       ``(ii) sign an agreement obligating them to return any      excess amounts to the extent necessary to comply with the      final determination on the distribution of the fees made      under subparagraph (B); and       ``(iii) file the agreement with the Copyright Royalty      Judges.       ``(D) The Copyright Royalty Judges and any other officer or      employee acting in good faith in distributing funds under      subparagraph (C) shall not be held liable for the payment of      any excess fees under subparagraph (C). The Copyright Royalty      Judges shall, at the time the final determination is made,      calculate any such excess amounts.       ``(4) To accept or reject royalty claims filed under      section 111, 119, and 1007, on the basis of timeliness or the      failure to establish the basis for a claim.       ``(5) To accept or reject rate adjustment petitions as      provided in section 804 and petitions to participate as      provided in section 803(b)(1) and (2).       ``(6) To determine the status of a digital audio recording      device or a digital audio interface device under sections      1002 and 1003, as provided in section 1010.       ``(7)(A) To adopt as the basis for statutory terms and      rates or as a basis for the distribution of statutory royalty      payments, an agreement concerning such matters reached among      some or all of the participants in a proceeding at any time      during the proceeding, except that--       ``(i) the Copyright Royalty Judges shall provide to the      other participants in the proceeding under section 803(b)(2)      that would be bound by the terms, rates, distribution, or      other determination set by the agreement an opportunity to      comment on the agreement and object to its adoption as the      basis for statutory terms and rates or as a basis for the      distribution of statutory royalty payments, as the case may      be; and       ``(ii) the Copyright Royalty Judges may decline to adopt      the agreement as the basis for statutory terms and rates or      as the basis     for the distribution of statutory royalty payments, as the      case may be, if any other participant described in      subparagraph (A) objects to the agreement and the Copyright      Royalty Judges find, based on the record before them, that      the agreement is not likely to meet the statutory standard      for setting the terms and rates, or for distributing the      royalty payments, as the case may be.       ``(B) License agreements voluntarily negotiated pursuant to      section 112(e)(5), 114(f)(3), 115(c)(3)(E)(i), 116(c), or      118(b)(2) that do not result in statutory terms and rates      shall not be subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph      (A).       ``(c) Rulings.--The Copyright Royalty Judges may make any      necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings in any proceeding      under this chapter and may, before commencing a proceeding      under this chapter, make any such rulings that would apply to      the proceedings conducted by the Copyright Royalty Judges.      The Copyright Royalty Judges may consult with the Register of      Copyrights in making any rulings under section 802(f)(1).       ``(d) Administrative Support.--The Librarian of Congress      shall provide the Copyright Royalty Judges with the necessary      administrative services related to proceedings under this      chapter.       ``(e) Location in Library of Congress.--The offices of the      Copyright Royalty Judges and staff shall be in the Library of      Congress.     ``Sec. 802.

Such schedule shall be      determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges.       ``(II) In this chapter, the term `written direct      statements' means witness statements, testimony, and exhibits      to be presented in the proceedings, and such other      information that is necessary to establish terms and rates,      or the distribution of royalty payments, as the case may be,      as set forth in regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty      Judges.       ``(iii) Hearsay may be admitted in proceedings under this      chapter to the extent deemed appropriate by the Copyright      Royalty Judges.       ``(iv) Discovery in such proceedings shall be permitted for      a period of 60 days, except for discovery ordered by the      Copyright Royalty Judges in connection with the resolution of      motions, orders and disputes pending at the end of such      period.       ``(v) Any participant under paragraph (2) in a proceeding      under this chapter to determine royalty rates may, upon      written notice, seek discovery of information and materials      relevant and material to the proceeding. Any objection to any      such discovery request shall be resolved by a motion or      request to compel discovery made to the Copyright Royalty      Judges. Each motion or request to compel discovery shall be      determined by the Copyright Royalty Judges, or by a Copyright      Royalty Judge when permitted under subsection (a)(2), who may      approve the request only if the evidence that would be      produced is relevant and material. A Copyright Royalty Judge      may refuse a request to compel discovery of evidence that has      been found to be relevant and material, only upon good cause      shown. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the basis for      `good cause' may only be that--       ``(I) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or      duplicative, or is obtainable from another source that is      more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;       ``(II) the participant seeking discovery has had ample      opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the      information sought; or       ``(III) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery      outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs      and resources of the participants, the importance of the      issues at stake, and the importance of the proposed discovery      in resolving the issues.       ``(vi) The rules in effect on the day before the effective      date of the Copyright Royalty and Distribution Reform Act of      2004, relating to discovery in proceedings under this title      to determine the distribution of royalty fees, shall continue      to apply to such proceedings on and after such effective      date.       ``(vii) The Copyright Royalty Judges may issue subpoenas      requiring the production of evidence or witnesses, but only      if the evidence requested to be produced or that would be      proffered by the witness is relevant and material.       ``(viii) The Copyright Royalty Judges shall order a      settlement conference among the participants in the      proceeding to facilitate the presentation of offers of      settlement among the participants. The settlement conference      shall be held during a 21-day period following the end of the      discovery period.       ``(c) Determination of Copyright Royalty Judges.--       ``(1) Timing.--The Copyright Royalty Judges shall issue      their determination in a proceeding not later than 11 months      after the conclusion of the 21-day settlement conference      period under subsection (b)(3)(C)(vi), but, in the case of a      proceeding to determine successors to rates or terms that      expire on a specified date, in no event later than 15 days      before the expiration of the then current statutory rates and      terms.       ``(2) Rehearings.--       ``(A) In general.--The Copyright Royalty Judges may, in      exceptional cases, upon motion of a participant under      subsection (b)(2), order a rehearing, after the determination      in a proceeding is issued under paragraph (1), on such      matters as the Copyright Royalty Judges determine to be      appropriate.       ``(B) Timing for filing motion.--Any motion for a rehearing      under subparagraph (A) may only be filed within 15 days after      the date on which the Copyright Royalty Judges deliver their      initial determination concerning rates and terms to the      participants in the proceeding.       ``(C) Participation by opposing party not required.--In any      case in which a rehearing is ordered, any opposing party      shall not be required to participate in the rehearing.       ``(D) No negative inference.--No negative inference shall      be drawn from lack of participation in a rehearing.       ``(E) Continuity of rates and terms.--(i) If the decision      of the Copyright Royalty Judges on any motion for a rehearing      is not rendered before the expiration of the statutory rates      and terms that were previously in effect, in the case of a      proceeding to determine successors to rates and terms that      expire on a specified date, then--       ``(I) the initial determination of the Copyright Royalty      Judges that is the subject of the rehearing motion shall be      effective as of the day following the date on which the rates      and terms that were previously in effect expire; and       ``(II) in the case of a proceeding under section      114(f)(1)(C) or 114(f)(2)(C), royalty rates and terms shall,      for purposes of section 114(f)(4)(B), be deemed to have been      set at those rates and terms contained in the initial      determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges that is the      subject of the rehearing motion, as of the date of that      determination.       ``(ii) The pendency of a motion for a rehearing under this      paragraph shall not relieve persons obligated to make royalty      payments who would be affected by the determination on that      motion from providing the statements of account and any      reports of use, to the extent required, and paying the      royalties required under the relevant determination or      regulations.       ``(iii) Notwithstanding clause (ii), whenever royalties      described in clause (ii) are paid to a person other than the      Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright      Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the      copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60      days after the motion for rehearing is resolved or, if the      motion is granted, within 60 days after the rehearing is      concluded, return any excess amounts previously paid to the      extent necessary to comply with the final determination of      royalty rates by the Copyright Royalty Judges.       ``(3) Contents of determination.--A determination of the      Copyright Royalty Judges shall be accompanied by the written      record, and shall set forth the facts that the Copyright      Royalty Judges found relevant to their determination. Among      other terms adopted in a determination, the Copyright Royalty      Judges may specify notice and recordkeeping requirements of      users of the copyrights at issue that apply in lieu of those      that would otherwise apply under regulations.       ``(4) Continuing jurisdiction.--The Copyright Royalty      Judges may amend the determination or the regulations issued      pursuant to the determination in order to correct any      technical errors in the determination or to respond to      unforeseen circumstances that preclude the proper      effectuation of the determination.       ``(5) Protective order.--The Copyright Royalty Judges may      issue such orders as may be appropriate to protect      confidential information, including orders excluding      confidential information from the record of the determination      that is published or made available to the public, except      that any terms or rates of royalty payments or distributions      may not be excluded.       ``(6) Publication of determination.--The Librarian of      Congress shall cause the determination, and any corrections      thereto, to be published in the Federal Register.

The Librarian of Congress shall      also make the determination, corrections, and the      accompanying record available for public inspection and      copying.       ``(d) Judicial Review.--       ``(1) Appeal.--Any determination of the Copyright Royalty      Judges under subsection (c) may, within 30 days after the      publication of the determination in the Federal Register, be      appealed, to the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit, by any aggrieved participant in      the proceeding under subsection (b)(2) who fully participated      in the proceeding and who would be bound by the      determination. If no appeal is brought within that 30-day      period, the determination of the Copyright Royalty Judges      shall be final, and the royalty fee or determination with      respect to the distribution of fees, as the case may be,      shall take effect as set forth in paragraph (2).       ``(2) Effect of rates.--       ``(A) Expiration on specified date.--When this title      provides that the royalty rates and terms that were      previously in effect are to expire on a specified date, any      adjustment or determination by the Copyright Royalty Judges      of successor rates and terms for an ensuing statutory license      period shall be effective as of the day following the date of      expiration of the rates and terms that were previously in      effect, even if the determination of the Copyright Royalty      Judges is rendered on a later date.       ``(B) Other cases.--In cases where rates and terms do not      expire on a specified date or have not yet been established,      successor or new rates or terms shall take effect on the      first day of the second month that begins after the      publication of the determination of the Copyright Royalty      Judges in the Federal Register, except as otherwise provided      in this title, and the rates and terms previously in effect,      to the extent applicable, shall remain in effect until such      successor rates and terms become effective.       ``(C) Obligation to make payments.--(i) The pendency of an      appeal under this subsection shall not relieve persons      obligated to make royalty payments under section 111, 112,      114, 115, 116, 118, 119, or 1003, who would be affected by      the determination on appeal, from providing the statements of      account (and any report of use, to the extent required) and      paying the royalties required under the relevant      determination or regulations.       ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), whenever royalties      described in clause (i) are paid to a person other than the      Copyright Office, the entity designated by the Copyright      Royalty Judges to which such royalties are paid by the      copyright user (and any successor thereto) shall, within 60      days after the final resolution of the appeal, return any      excess amounts previously paid (and interest thereon, if      ordered pursuant to paragraph (3)) to the extent necessary to      comply with the final determination of royalty rates on      appeal.       ``(3) Jurisdiction of court.--If the court, pursuant to      section 706 of title 5, modifies or vacates a determination      of the Copyright Royalty Judges, the court may enter its own      determination with respect to the amount or distribution of      royalty fees and costs, and order the repayment of any excess      fees, the payment of any underpaid fees, and the payment of      interest pertaining respectively thereto, in accordance with      its final judgment.
