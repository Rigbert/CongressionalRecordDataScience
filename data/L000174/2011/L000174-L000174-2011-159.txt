President, I have spoken over the years about the political transformation that has been taking place in Nepal since 2005, from a corrupt, autocratic monarchy to an emerging democracy.  That process has moved forward by fits and starts, plagued by political infighting and the seeming inability of political and ethnic factions to unite for the good of the people. We are struggling with partisanship and divisiveness in this country, so I understand the problem, but Nepal is at a historic crossroads and cannot afford for this process to fail.  Key issues that were at the heart of the internal armed conflict, such as impunity for crimes against civilians by both sides, have not been addressed. Shielding perpetrators of gross violations of human rights from punishment is incompatible with a democratic society based on the rule of law.  There are many other challenges, like reform of the army, demobilization of former Maoist combatants, improving literacy, building effective, transparent government institutions, and reducing poverty. The United States is helping, but Nepal's competing political leaders must point the way forward by making the necessary compromises.  Today I want to speak briefly about caste discrimination, which is at the core of Nepal's feudalistic history. I do so by paying tribute to an extraordinary leader of Nepal's Dalit community, Suvash Darnal, who was tragically killed in a motor vehicle accident in Virginia on August 15, 2011.  Mr. Darnal was only 31 years old when he died, but he had already achieved far more than most people, even people with every advantage, do in a much longer life.  Mr. Darnal was of humble beginnings, with nothing but hardship and unfairness to look forward to. Yet he managed to overcome daunting obstacles to become a respected leader with boundless energy, a quenchless thirst for knowledge, extraordinary vision, and a tireless determination to help improve the lives of his people.  As I have said before in this Chamber, Nepal's democracy cannot succeed without the inclusion of minority castes, including Dalits, in political and economic decisionmaking. Mr. Darnal devoted himself passionately to that cause through journalism, research, and advocacy.  He was an inspiring example of why caste discrimination has no place in the 21st century, and his death is a tragic loss not only for Dalits but for all of Nepal. He had the humility, integrity, intellect, and dedication to his people that Nepal needs in its leaders, and I hope others of his generation are inspired by his life and work to continue his legacy.  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an August 16 article in the Kathmandu Post about Mr. Darnal.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Kathmandu Post, Aug. 16, 2011]                   Bidushi Dhungel, ``Palpali Flame''       The tragic death of 31-year-old Dalit activist and media      entrepreneur Suvash Darnal is a huge setback to Nepal's Dalit      movement. Well known for being the founder of Nepal's first      ever Dalit-focused media organisation, Jagaran Media, co-     founder of the Collective Campaign for Peace and most      recently, the Dalit-focused think tank, Samata Foundation,      Darnal made undeniable contributions to a burgeoning rights-     sensitive society.       Born in Mujhung in Palpa, and one of four siblings, Suvash      was schooled ``by accident,'' at a local school that just      happened to be in close proximity to his home. He was never      told to go to school, nor did he initially see it as      necessary, ``it just kind of happened,'' he would say.      Darnal's perseverance meant that he became the first Dalit to      pass the SLC from his village. That achievement, and the      positive reaction it garnered from the upper echelons of      society that once treated him as untouchable, gave him the      motivation to work harder.       But behind every success story, there is a long, hard      struggle. Looking at Suvash in his last years, one could      never guess that he'd come to Kathmandu with nothing except      the fire of convictions. He spent months selling watches      immersed in a bucket of water on the Ratna Park roadside. And      having made a few contacts here and there, Darnal ventured      into writing for small media houses. The ideas for the      foundations of the Jagaran Media Centre came in these days.      It was to be the largest Dalit-led media outlet in South      Asia. Even now, Jagaran media has a radio station that      produces a radio magazine that is broadcast throughout India      and Nepal.       These were turbulent times. By the time the media centre      was established and running smoothly, King Gyanendra took      over and attempted to reverse the course of history. Public      outrage was growing and so was the demand for the return of      democracy. At this crucial juncture, Darnal and his close      friend founded the Collective Campaign for Peace (COCAP). ``I      wanted to play my part in what I knew would be a momentous      time in Nepal's history,'' said Darnal. He often recalled      those days saying that at the heart of the uprising, it      became an unofficial ``secretariat'' for the civil democratic      movement in Nepal.       It was after this that Darnal set off to undertake the most      mammoth of his life's work. He realised that democracy would      be of little use to Dalit society unless there was a way to      bridge the gap between politics and caste. This was where      Darnal's deep frustrations with society resided. The idea      that discourse at the policy level was necessary gave way to      the Samata Foundation. Initially called the Nepal Center for      Dalit Studies, late in 2009, the name was changed and became      an officially registered organisation.       The Samata Foundation is now the hub of Dalit research.      Last year, under Darnal's direction, Samata held Nepal's      first ever International Dalit conference. An avid reader and      fan of B.R. Ambedkar, Darnal had set out to establish caste-     based policies in the country. His book, A Land of Our Own:      Conversations with Dalit Members of the Constituent Assembly,      came out in 2009. Although enthused by the 2008 elections      that ushered in some 40 Dalit Constituent Assembly (CA)      members, it didn't take long for Darnal to realise it wasn't      going to be enough. He often said that it was only natural      that the Dalit CA members wouldn't be educated, but that it      was then his task to give them the information and competence      to stand out and be clear about their demands. In this      endeavour, he decided to publish a Nepali translation of      Ambedkar's book. The translation was done by Dalit leader and      CA member Aahuti, and was published earlier this year. Darnal      held a special prominence in his head and heart for the      personality and works of Ambedkar and the translation of the      book and its subsequent publishing was a source of joy to      him.       The Dalit movement has a long history in this country, but      with Suvash Darnal it rose to new heights. From raising      national awareness to travelling abroad for guest lectures,      Darnal had the conviction to make Nepali society aware, not      only of the harsh realities of caste, but of the      repercussions of its perception in politics and society.      Suvash's Samata Foundation was in the process of achieving      precisely this. The organisation is now without its founder,      and the Dalit movement without a capable leader. The work he      undertook was as much professional to him as it was personal,      and that's what allowed for his success. Suvash Darnal's      close friends refer to him as very much of a family man. And      with only a few close friends, he maintained very close ties      with his family. He is survived by his wife and two year old      daughter.                          ____________________
