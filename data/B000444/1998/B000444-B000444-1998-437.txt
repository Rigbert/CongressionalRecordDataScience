 President, as often occurs here, we are presented with Hobson's choices. As I said, I have strongly supported and continue to support the school construction initiatives of Senator Moseley-Braun, but her amendment should have been added to the bill, not given as an alternative to it. In order to vote for her amendment, I would have had to vote against the guts of the Coverdell bill. I support the essence of what Senator Coverdell is doing. So I voted against Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment, although I strongly support it and think we need to invest considerable amounts of money in school construction.  I conclude by saying I only wish it had been an add-on to the Coverdell bill, not in place of the Coverdell bill.  I thank the Chair.
