Mr. Speaker, today, I'm pleased to introduce the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act (H.R. 856). This landmark legislation will end 100 years of uncertainty for the people of Puerto Rico and allow them to determine the political status for themselves and future generations.  The text of the legislation is identical to the updated version of the bill introduced as H.R. 4281 in the 104th Congress on September 28, 1996. This bill reflects the efforts of many of my colleagues during the last 2 years to formulate a fair, clear, and complete process that will once and for all, provide for the final resolution of Puerto Rico's political status. This is the starting point in the process which is long overdue and the people of Puerto Rico deserve.  The Legislature of Puerto Rico has once again asked the Congress to take action to resolve Puerto Rico's political status. Two weeks ago, a bipartisan delegation from Puerto Rico personally delivered copies of the resolution, asking the 105th Congress--and I quote:       to respond to the Democratic aspirations of the American      citizens of Puerto Rico in order to attain a process which      will guarantee the prompt decolonization of Puerto Rico,      through a plebiscite sponsored by the Federal Government,      which shall be held no later than 1998.  This bill answers the Legislature's request by providing for a vote on Puerto Rico's political status before December 31, 1998.  As the only Representative from Alaska--a State that made the transition from territorial status to full self-government--I know first hand that the process does work. This bill provides the process by which Congress and the residents of Puerto Rico define and approve politically acceptable options through a multi-staged Democratic process. This allows for the political will of the United States and Puerto Rico to be determined freely and democratically.  The U.S. Congress and the President have a moral obligation to act so the people of Puerto Rico can finally resolve their status. We are taking action today by re-introducing the United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act. Today marks the beginning of a historic effort by the Congress to actually solve Puerto Rico's political status.  I appreciate the strong bipartisan support for this legislation by such a large number of Members of Congress during the 104th Congress, and now in the 105th Congress. I particularly want to thank Speaker Gingrich for his involvement and support of this measure since its inception. Puerto Rico's delegate, Resident Commissioner Carlos Romero-Barcelo, has been working side-by-side with the sponsors of this bill, and his cooperation and leadership has been critical to this endeavor. My colleague from New York, Jose Serrano, has also been particularly supportive and helpful in this process. I also want to thank Chairman Gallegly, Chairman Gilman, Chairman Burton, Chairman Pombo, and Mr. Kennedy from Rhode Island for their outstanding efforts to address Puerto Rico throughout the 104th Congress; Chairman Solomon of the Rules Committee for his excellent work on the fast track procedures, as well as all the other distinguished co-sponsors for both political parties.  Resolving Puerto Rico's political status is a top priority of the Committee on Resources Oversight Plan for the 105th Congress. The leadership of the House also recognizes this as a matter of the highest priority.  To demonstrate the commitments of this Congress to act quickly on this matter, three hearings have been scheduled on this legislation. The first will be held in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, March 19, 1997 to enable the leaders of the Government of Puerto Rico and the political parties to express their views regarding their preferred status. I will also ask the Clinton administration to present their formal position regarding the legislation at this hearing. In addition, two hearings will be conducted in Puerto Rico, the first in San Juan on April 19 and the second in Mayaguez on April 21.  Those hearings will be dedicated to allow Congress to hear directly from the widest possible spectrum of views of the people of Puerto Rico. No proposal or idea will be excluded from the process, but we intend for Congress to work its will on this question in 1997.  That is what the people of this Nation, including our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico, deserve from the 105th Congress, and in my view that is what the national interest requires us to do.  Following is the text of House Concurrent Resolution 2, enacted by the Puerto Rico Legislature of January 23, 1997, which asks the 105th Congress and the President to sponsor a vote in Puerto Rico on political status before the end of 1998:                     House Concurrent Resolution 2       To request of the One Hundred Fifth Congress and the      President of the United States of America to respond to the      democratic aspirations of the American citizens of Puerto      Rico, in order to achieve a process that guarantees the      prompt decolonization of Puerto Rico by means of a plebiscite      sponsored by the Federal Government, which must be held no      later than 1998.                          statement of motives       As the present century draws to a close and a new      millennium full of hope is about to begin, men of good will      must act affirmatively to leave any colonial vestige behind      them.       The United States of America has contributed to fundamental      changes towards democracy and full participation in political      processes in other countries, thus asserting the universal      principles of human rights.       Just as the United States has successfully promoted      democratic values in the international sphere, it is now      appropriate for that nation to attend to the claims for full      political participation of the 3.75 million American citizens      of Puerto Rico.       On November 14, 1993, the Government of Puerto Rico      supported a plebiscite on Puerto Rico's status. Three      different political options were submitted to the People:      Statehood, represented by the New Progressive Party;      Independence, represented by the Puerto Rican Independence      Party; and Commonwealth, represented by the Popular      Democratic Party. This last option, redefined by its      advocates, is based on a bilateral pact that cannot be      revoked or amended unilaterally by Congress. It had the      following essential elements: first, parity of founding with      the states in federal assistance programs; second, tax      exemption within the scope of the former Section 936 of the      United States Internal Revenue Code, since repealed; and      third, the power of the Commonwealth to impose tariffs on      agricultural products imported into Puerto Rico. The      Commonwealth option obtained 48.2% of the votes cast in the      1993 plebiscite, while Statehood obtained 46% and      Independence, 4%. In a prior plebiscite, convoked by the      Government of Puerto Rico in 1967, Commonwealth had obtained      60% of the votes, while Statehood obtained 37.8%.       On December 14, 1994, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto      Rico approved Concurrent Resolution No. 62. By means of this      Resolution, Congress was asked to state its opinion on the      redefinition of Commonwealth mentioned above. If the elements      of that redefinition were deemed not to be viable, Congress      was requested to inform the people of Puerto Rico about which      status options it would be willing to consider in order to      resolve our colonial problem, and what procedural steps      should be taken to this effect.       On February 29, 1996, the leaders of the United States      House of Representatives Committee on Resources of the One      Hundred Fourth Congress and its Subcommittee on Insular and      Native American Affairs, together with the House Committee on      International Relations and its Subcommittee on the Western      Hemisphere, answered the People and the Legislative Assembly      of Puerto Rico by means of a Statement of Principles,      indicating the unfeasibility of accepting the redefinition of      Commonwealth submitted in the 1993 plebiscite. These same      Congressional leaders also expressed their interest in      promoting Federal legislation so that the One Hundred Fourth      Congress could expedite the steps to be followed in resolving      the status problem of Puerto Rico. They fulfilled their      pledge by submitting H.R. 3024 and S.R. 2019 with bipartisan      support, for the purpose of responding to Concurrent      Resolution No. 62, approved in 1994 by the Legislative      Assembly of Puerto Rico.       On June 28, 1996 four Congressmen who are members of the      Minority Delegation of the House of Representatives of the      United States also responded to Concurrent Resolution No. 62,      through a letter in which they stated that ``it is clear that      Puerto Rico remains a non-incorporated territory that is      subject to the authority of Congress under the Territorial      Clause . . .'', thus upholding the conclusions set forth in      the February 29, 1996 letter, mentioned above.       Barely a month later, on July 11, 1996, eleven Congressmen      belonging to the Minority Delegation of the House of      Representatives of the United States sent a letter to the      Minority Leader of the House, stating their total support of      H.R. 3024, which had been presented to that body in response      to Concurrent Resolution No. 62.       The Subcommittee on Insular and Native American Affairs of      the United States House of Representatives, exercised primary      jurisdiction over the matters set forth in Concurrent      Resolution No. 62. While studying and approving H.R. 3024 on      June 12, 1996, the Subcommittee considered proposals--     rejected until then--for the adoption of the redefinition of      Commonwealth, either as included in the 1993 plebiscite      ballot or, as an alternative, the non binding and never-     adopted definition presented in a 1990 legislative report to      the United States House of Representatives on the status of      Puerto Rico. Both proposals on Commonwealth were      overwhelmingly defeated in votes of ten to one for the first,      and eight to one, for the second.       On June 26, 1996, the House Committee on Rules adopted      House Report 104-713, Part 2, which endorsed well-founded      provisions for the purpose of facilitating congressional      consideration of the measures that responded to the results      of the self-determination process, as contemplated in H.R.      3024, which set forth a 3-stage decision-making process, with      periodic referral in the event of an inconclusive result in      any of the stages.       We recognize that substantial progress was achieved during      the One Hundred Fourth Congress in establishing a federal      policy to promote the decolonization of Puerto Rico. But      today, at the commencement of the work of the One Hundred      Fifth Congress, the reality of the situation is that after      almost a century during which Puerto Rico has been under the      sovereignty of the United States, the Federal Government has      never approved or implemented specific measures geared to      promoting a process in a conclusive binding manner, by which      the American citizens of Puerto Rico may democratically      express their wishes regarding their final political status.       We also recognize that even though important votes on the      political status in Puerto Rico were carried out in 1967 and      1993 under the auspices of the Government of Puerto Rico,      other voting events will be required in order to resolve the      status question once and for all; and that Congress has still      not defined the interests and responsibilities of the Federal      Government regarding that process.       The need to resolve Puerto Rico's political status      persists. It must be carried out by means of an effective and      enlightened process, whose legitimacy is acceptable to      Congress, acting in the exercise of the sovereignty of the      United States over Puerto Rico, pursuant to the full powers      granted under the Territorial Clause of the Constitution of      the United States, Article IV, Section 3, Clause 2 and which      enables the People of Puerto Rico to achieve a sovereign      political status through realistic and decolonizing      alternatives.       Following the plebiscites carried out by local initiative      in 1967 and 1993 and the corresponding results, the Congress      of the United States has refused to accept and implement as      permanent and binding the definition of Commonwealth that was      presented to the voters in 1993. As a result, we must      establish a process based on options defined in such a way      that both Congress and the American citizens of Puerto Rico      recognize that a choice based upon perpetuating the lack of      political suffrage and the subordination to the plenary      powers of Congress under the Territorial Clause does not      represent the best interests of the residents of Puerto Rico      nor the rest of the United States.       The final, permanent status of Puerto Rico should be      consistent with the democratic principles of freedom, human      rights and the goals of political, economic and social      development that constitute the legacy of a century in which      the political status of Puerto Rico has evolved within the      flexibility allowed under the American constitutional      framework. Although historical forces have caused the ongoing      evolution of Puerto Rico towards self-determination to be      delayed at sometimes and accelerated at others, now is the      time to take the final step. This historic moment requires      the adoption of measures that are carefully pondered yet      decisive, in order to solve the political status of Puerto      Rico by the beginning of a new century and a new millennium.       In 1998 Puerto Rico must not complete one hundred years of      colonialism under the American flag without at least being in      an irreversible, inevitable process of decolonization.       Be it Resolved by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico:       Section 1.--To request of the One Hundred Fifth Congress      and the President of the United States of America to respond      to the democratic aspirations of the American citizens of      Puerto Rico, in order to achieve a means of guaranteeing the      prompt decolonization of Puerto Rico through a plebiscite      sponsored by the Federal Government, to be held no later than      1998.       Section 2.--It is hereby ordered that this Concurrent      Resolution be delivered to all members of the Congress of the      United States of America, to the President, the Hon. William      J. Clinton, and to the Secretary General of the United      States.       Section 3.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives and      the President of the Senate of Puerto Rico are hereby      authorized to designate a Special Joint Committee made up of      legislators from the three political parties of Puerto Rico,      for the sole purpose of personally delivering the text of      this Concurrent Resolution to the Speaker of the House of      Representatives and the President Pro-Tempore and the      Majority Leader of the Senate, and to the leaders of the      Minority delegations of the Congress.       Section 4.--This Concurrent Resolution shall take effect      immediately after its approval.                          ____________________
