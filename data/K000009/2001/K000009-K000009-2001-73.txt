Speaker, as the profound tragedies in New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington flashed before the world, I was struck again by the greatness of our people, their valor, their order, their dignity; indeed, their actions of honor, one by one, shown to the world, loving mercy more than life itself.  As one Member, I can certainly say our Nation will not rest until the terrorists responsible for yesterday's carnage are brought to justice before the entire world.                              {time}  0110  I have also been overwhelmed by the outpouring of sympathy that our office is receiving from throughout the world. We thank President Putin. We thank the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, and all the world leaders who are sending us condolences and sympathies to our people.  But yesterday I received another offer of sympathy, this time from a Roman Catholic vicar general from the nation of Ukraine:       I would like to present to you and through you,      Congresswoman, to all the American people our condolences      because of the terrible tragedy that has stricken the whole      world.  As the profound tragedies in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania flashed before the world, I was struck again by the greatness of our people--their valor, their order, their dignity. Indeed, their acts of honor--one by one shown to the world. At every turn loving mercy more than life. To America's enemies let me say; our Nation will not rest until the terrorists responsible for yesterday's carnage are brought to justice before the entire world.  I have also been overwhelmed by the outpouring of sympathy coming to our people from throughout the world--President Putin, Prime Minister Blair of Great Britain.       I would like to present to You and Through You--to all the      American people--our condolences because of the terrible      tragedy that has stricken the whole world.       We have been very shaken to learn about a series of acts of      terrorism that happened in the United States of America      yesterday.       It has been an awful blow by its cruelty and scale that      struck not only the USA but all humanity. I received the      notice during spiritual retreats in our Higher Spiritual      Seminary [in Vorzel] where all priests of our Diocese came.      As a sign of our unity and sympathy in your grief we      celebrated Holy Mass for the souls of the departed and prayed      for all victims. May the Lord strengthen them by His grace      that they may outlive this horrible disaster.       In all our churches there are Divine Services and prayers      said for the souls of the departed victims and for all those      who have suffered.       These days our hearts and our prayers are with your people.           Sincerely Yours,                               Bishop Stanislaw Shyrokoradiuk,                                              Roman Catholic Vicar     General Ukraine.                          ____________________
