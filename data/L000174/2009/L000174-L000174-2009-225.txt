President, this amendment is very simple. Anybody can read it in about a minute. It says that nothing shall add to or detract from the first amendment to the Constitution. No court in the country would rule otherwise. It simply says that regarding the right of free speech in this country, nothing can be taken from it and nothing added to it.
