 President, we were very saddened to hear of the loss of U.S. Capitol police officer Vernon Alston this past weekend.  Officer Alston served on the force for nearly two decades, working to protect all of us. Capitol police chief Kim Dine said that his passing, at the age of 44, was ``truly a tragic loss for the Alston family and for the United States Capitol Police, which in fact is actually one and the same.''  I know his fellow officers would agree. I know his service and dedication will be remembered by all who knew him. I know our colleagues will join me in holding his family in our thoughts.                          ____________________
