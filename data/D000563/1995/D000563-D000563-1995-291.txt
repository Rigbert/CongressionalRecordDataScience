Chairman, let me tell Members what this debate is really all about. Some of the most radical leaders in the new Republican majority are determined to end the right to choose for American women, and their first target is women in the military. Today they oppose the right of American women in the military to be treated with the same rights and dignity as every other American woman.  This is patent discrimination against American women who have volunteered to serve their country. While America applauds the courage and achievement of women in the military, the Dornan language treats them as second-class citizens. America's servicewomen are prepared to risk their lives in the service of their country. The antichoice forces now are prepared to ask them to also risk their lives in the legal termination of a pregnancy.  Support the DeLauro amendment and support those strong and courageous Republicans who have joined in support of her effort.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Florida [Ms. Brown].  (
