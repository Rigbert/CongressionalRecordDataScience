 President, that is a fair question. Let me ask my colleague from Louisiana--as he knows, I will be speaking more to this in a moment. I wish to thank Senator Landrieu for her strong support of legislation I introduced and for her support not only for veterans in Louisiana but for every veteran in this country. This legislation is supported by virtually every veterans organization in the United States of America.  I will respond at this point to my colleague from Louisiana to say that if I were prepared to support the Landrieu amendment, which has no offsets--and she makes a good point, that veterans have paid for this legislation in their blood already--would the Senator from Louisiana object to an amendment I offered for the comprehensive bill that had no offset as well?
