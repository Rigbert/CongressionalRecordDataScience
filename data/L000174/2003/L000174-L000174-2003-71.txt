President, I appreciate what the Senator from Utah has said. He is a dear friend of mine. I try to emulate him so much, I even go to the same barber as he does. But in his State, Utah, they are $4.753 million behind what they thought they had been promised.  I couldn't agree more. I have been on the Appropriations Committee for more than a quarter of a century. I don't like to see problems fixed in the Appropriations Committee that could have been fixed in the authorizing committee. But we did fix it in the authorizing committee. We did put in a GAO study. A colloquy between Senator Cochran and Senator Harkin and others makes it very clear we fixed it there. It is USDA that is not following the law.  That is why Texas is behind $500 million in this area, Nebraska is behind $106 million, and Missouri is behind $200 million. I will just read some of these figures. I hope people understand this is not an attack on the CRP program. I support CRP. I voted many times for the CRP in 29 years. What this amendment does is prevent the administration from raiding other conservation programs. Unfortunately, the administration pits conservation programs against one another. What they should do is take it out of the CCC account, as we said in the law.  But I hope when Senators vote, they realize, if they are from Arizona, they have $30 million in their State's EQIP unfunded application. If you are from Arizona, you have $30 million that your farmers are looking for. If you are from Alabama, you have $10 million they are looking for. If you are from Colorado, you have $36 million you are looking for; Florida, $36 million; if you are from Iowa, you have $30 million you are looking for but have not received. If you are from Kansas, you have backlogs of $66 million; Louisiana, $11 million; Missouri, $200 million; Nebraska, $106 million; Montana, $52 million; Oklahoma, nearly $25 million; Tennessee, $21 million; West Virginia, $15 million.  Obviously, every Senator can vote any way he or she wants, but I don't know, if I were from a State that had a backlog of $10 million, as Alabama does, or $30 million, as Arizona does, or $17 million, as Arkansas does, or $35 million, as Colorado does, or $36 million, as Florida does, or $30 million, as Iowa does, or $66 million, as Kansas does, or $12 million, as Louisiana does, or $200 million, as Missouri does, or $51 million, as Montana does, $106 million, as Nebraska does, $500 million, as Texas does, or $25 million, as Oklahoma does, or $8 million, as Pennsylvania does, I think I might want to vote for this and not go back and tell my State, ``Sorry.''  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the fiscal year 2002 EQIP unfunded applications that we now face.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   FY-2002 EQIP UNFUNDED APPLICATIONS------------------------------------------------------------------------                        State                           FY-2002 Backlog------------------------------------------------------------------------Alabama.............................................         $10,244,510Alaska..............................................           4,164,056Arizona.............................................          30,581,190Arkansas............................................          17,689,860California..........................................          19,911,881Colorado............................................          35,966,766Connecticut.........................................           7,135,488Delaware............................................           2,618,440Florida.............................................          36,467,046Georgia.............................................          14,021,176Hawaii..............................................           2,327,794Idaho...............................................           9,064,742Illinois............................................          16,836,480Indiana.............................................           4,733,120Iowa................................................          29,066,020Kansas..............................................          66,157,013Kentucky............................................           4,080,336Louisiana...........................................          11,786,034Maine...............................................           6,167,328Maryland............................................           2,524,905Massachusetts.......................................           2,008,260Michigan............................................           6,839,033Minnesota...........................................          13,581,380Mississippi.........................................          10,331,727Missouri............................................         200,343,682Montana.............................................          51,678,240Nebraska............................................         106,772,528Nevada..............................................           1,366,340New Hampshire.......................................           2,363,200New Jersey..........................................          15,879,913New Mexico..........................................          30,194,736New York............................................          13,321,362North Carolina......................................           8,192,823North Dakota........................................          10,774,308Ohio................................................          14,921,919Oklahoma............................................          24,688,762Oregon..............................................          15,827,422Pacific Basin.......................................              34,185Pennsylvania........................................           8,316,990Puerto Rico.........................................             740,709Rhode Island........................................             551,043South Carolina......................................          15,288,390South Dakota........................................          14,666,850Tennessee...........................................          21,413,600Texas...............................................         502,051,618Utah................................................           4,753,280Vermont.............................................           7,960,070Virginia............................................           6,236,576Washington..........................................           6,365,088West Virginia.......................................          14,915,086Wisconsin...........................................           8,334,480Wyoming.............................................          14,686,650                                                     -------------------  Total.............................................      1,486,944,435.------------------------------------------------------------------------
