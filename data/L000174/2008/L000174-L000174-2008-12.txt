President, today I would like to share with my friends in the Senate a great story of personal triumph and success as told by Vermont Supreme Court Associate Justice Marilyn Skoglund, the keynote speaker for Vermont's 12th Annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference.  Marilyn forged her own remarkable path to success. She received her bachelor's degree in fine arts from Southern Illinois University, and after moving to Vermont, passed the bar exam on her first try all while raising her 7-year-old daughter. Marilyn continued to rise through the ranks of the Vermont Office of the Attorney General where she served as both chief of the civil law division and chief of the public protection division before her appointment in 1994 to the district court, and subsequently the Vermont Supreme Court in 1997. In addition to her accomplishments, Marcelle and I admired Marilyn's candidness as she walked us through her journey. She offered more than 300 Vermont women a very honest and inspirational perspective on the realities of balancing both a career and a family.  Marcelle and I have hosted the Vermont Women's Economic Opportunity Conference for 12 years, and we look forward to attending each year because we consider it one of the most important events in which we take part. Though our economy may be facing difficult challenges, this year's conference, and Marilyn's story, showed that adversity can be overcome and met with great success--especially by motivated and talented women of all ages.  Vermont's economic future depends on the countless talented women who drive it. According to the Vermont Center for Women's Business Studies, women-owned firms generate an impressive $1.5 billion annually and currently employ more than 35,000 Vermonters. In 2006, approximately 39 percent of all Vermont businesses were owned, or partially owned, by women. Even though the number of Vermont women-owned businesses is on the rise, we must continue working to encourage greater growth.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Justice Skoglund's speech, written for Vermont's 12th annual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference, detailing her journey to success, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:      Senator Leahy's 12th Women's Economic Opportunity Conference       I begin with a disclaimer. In Senator Leahy's letter,      asking me to be the keynote speaker, he wrote as follows:      ``We invite you to share your compelling personal experiences      of how you molded your successful career path to the Vermont      Supreme Court, all the while raising two daughters as a      single mother.''       I was of course so excited to learn that Senator Leahy knew      my name. And, that he thought I had done a good job of      balancing a career and a family. But, after skipping around      the kitchen a bit, I settled down. Sen. Leahy did not really      know what those compelling personal experiences were. Perhaps      he was lured into inviting me because a staff member had      heard rumors that my ``successful career path'' was pretty      funny. Someday I will be old enough to know better than to      discuss my past in public just because I was so flattered      someone of Sen. Leahy's stature asked, but, here I am. Ready      to reveal. I accept Sen. Leahy's invitation to share my      compelling, maybe, but more accurately, my ridiculous,      oddball, clueless, experiences of how I managed to crawl my      way into the best job on the planet, all the while dragging      two innocent, courageous daughters along in my wake. The      journey through the thicket of experiences was not always      pleasant, and mistakes were made. Truth is; I may have      nothing to offer to this audience. This is an economic      conference. I am not an economist. I am not a psychologist.      So, if you all just want to go get coffee and skip the gory      details, I will understand.       To begin, how does one grade ``success'' in balancing work      and family? I am a justice on the Vermont Supreme Court. I      have a good reputation as a jurist. I was a very good lawyer.      I have no arrest record. So far so good. I raised one      daughter, let's call her Martha, who is an ObGyn doctor      delivering babies in New Hampshire. She seems very content      and satisfied with her life. She just got married to a      wonderful man on August 30th. Most important indicia of      success: She loves me. I raised another daughter; I will call      her Ruby, who is working on a Ph.D. in clinical psychology.      She is currently very annoyed at how hard life is, but feels      good about her work. She loves me. This sounds great! By the      way, I have changed their names to protect their privacy.      They each bear their father's last names, as do I, so      hopefully, I have shielded them from any further      embarrassment from their mother, at least for today.       Because, while they may be well adjusted women, the truth      is, they adjusted to what their mother put them through. And,      if ``successfully balancing'' includes a solid marriage, I am      not your girl. Two creative, interesting, unique men, neither      ever bored me. I love them to this day, I danced with each at      Martha's wedding, but it did not work out.       In addition to my inadequacies standing up here before you,      I would also point out that everyone in this audience is      clearly way ahead of where I was when I wandered into      adulthood. Obviously, you are all women with a high degree of      confidence in yourselves and your ideas, ambitions, and      goals. You are at an economic conference, for heaven's sake.      You have given some thought to your life. At the beginning of      my meandering     road to the Supreme Court, I had little concept of who I was      and had not considered who I wanted to be.       To begin, my parents were the Swedish equivalent of Ozzie      and Harriet. I was raised in a nice middle class home in a      nice midwestern suburb. There literally was a white picket      fence around the yard. And, a little dog. My mother wore a      dress every day of her life, so she did her house work      looking like Donna Reed. By the time I came along, my father      was working in a steel plant and Mom had stopped being a hair      dresser to raise two kids. There were no drugs in my school.      My father's biggest complaint about me was that my bangs were      too long. It was an idyllic childhood. Just like on T.V. So I      assumed everyone pretty much lived like I did. Father made      enough so I could go to college. Back in those olden days,      in-state tuition at SIU was $97 a semester. And, I had part      time jobs to help pay my expenses. After four years, I got      married, continued going to school and working part time,      because it was cheap and it was fun. Finally, after seven      years in college, I decided to graduate, mainly because I was      pregnant and did not know how long it would be until I could      get back to going to classes. That should give you some idea      of how totally clueless I was about the changes a child      brings to a life.       The baby was great, but then things quickly stopped being      cheap and fun. There is something about the arrival of a      child, and one parent not working, that causes money      problems. My husband was working, but not getting paid much.      I was not working (day care didn't exist in southern      Illinois). And, there came a time when I had to apply for      food stamps. Three months of food stamps. We were two middle      class kids and we thought this was shameful, so of course, we      never told our folks and we couldn't ask them for money for      the same reason. But, of course, we weren't middle class kids      anymore--we were young parents with very little money,      renting a grimy little house with giant slugs in the      basement.       I'll cut this gruesome chapter short. In 1973 we moved to      Vermont, my husband got laid off and then, after eleven years      of marriage, he left. The reasons are not important. By now      my daughter was in first grade. and I was working a part-time      job for very little money. Those seven years in college? I      walked out with a degree in fine arts--sculpture. See, I      didn't go to college with an actual career in mind. I      expected to become my mom, making lunches, and ironing in my      pearls. My father always said, if a woman has to work outside      the home, it should be in one of the helping professions:      teaching or nursing. Things were not working out. What would      Donna Reed do? I pondered.       I decided to be a lawyer. Now, I do admit to having a      selective memory about some things. I do not remember my      first husband asking me to marry him and I have no      recollection of why I thought I could become a lawyer. Law      school wasn't an option--there was no money for tuition and      besides, I had to work.       I got a job working as a paralegal, law clerk at the      attorney general's office and participating in that marvelous      Vermont jewel, the four year reading clerkship. This path to      the bar required me to apprentice myself for four years to a      lawyer, and if I passed the bar exam, I was a real lawyer. I      began work in the AG's office at a salary of $7,000 a year,      which quickly went up to $12,000. Here's an interesting fact:      I had to borrow a dress for the job interview at the attorney      general's office. Now, at the time I knew I didn't have any      money, but I never thought I was poor. I was doing all right.       But if you ask my daughter, Martha, you'd get a different      picture. While I was working all day every day in Montpelier,      she was walking half a mile home from the school bus stop to      the adorable tiny three-room, un-insulated cottage in the      country with the only source of heat being a wood burning      furnace in the cellar. Walking home to a cold, empty house.      But, the good news was that I rented this cottage from Walter      Smith. I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay tribute      to my very own personal version of welfare: Walter Smith.      Walter was a beloved dairy farmer in Plainfield, about 68      years old when I met him, who was my landlord for eleven      years and my friend for twenty. He died several years back. I      loved him.       So, at the age of eight, Martha was expected to stoke the      furnace when she got home. Sometimes, Walter would come over      to help her. But most times he could not. And, you know, I      did not agonize over this. Donna Reed and June Cleaver would      be horrified, but I had to work. It was that simple. Walter,      who by then had become my surrogate father, had the hired      hands bring over truck loads of free split wood--an early      version of ``fuel assistance.'' I could dip raw milk from the      bulk tank for free. My very own WIC program. He'd give me      meat when he butchered a cow whose milking days were over.      Very, very chewy, but free. Free eggs if I fought the hens      for them, and maple syrup. He would give me bushels of      tomatoes and I would put them up and give him half. If my      cupboard was really bare, Martha and I could always wander      over to the farm house where Walter had cases and cases of      chicken noodle soup, which he ate every day with mayonnaise      sandwiches. He was my food shelf. Once, when Martha was about      ten, I sent her to school with a coconut and a hammer for      snack as I hadn't had time to grocery shop. Walter had given      me the coconut as a joke, asking me what kind of turkey I      thought had laid the brown hairy thing? The teacher sent a      note home thanking me for providing an interesting project      for the class. I thought that was nice.       See, I was not poor. I had Walter. And, there was a certain      satisfaction about supporting myself and my child.       But, I was also in love. Madly and passionately in love      with the law. The law is amazing. It is the infrastructure of      society. Sensible, mostly. Logical, usually. Enduring. It      adapts to changing mores and technologies, but only slightly      faster than the movement of the earth's tectonic plates. How      did the founding father's accept the constitution to deal      with the development of cyber-space and artificial      insemination? Heavy stuff. I love it. I had decided to go      into law thinking I liked writing, words, and arguing. I      hadn't expected to discover that it felt like ginger ale      poured over my brain. This is how I can describe the joy,      excitement, and the thrill of learning and understanding the      basis of the rules that manage our civilized life.       If you have a passion, if you find your passion, you are a      very lucky person. And, I had found my passion while Martha      was stoking the furnace.       But, here is an amazing fact: children have their own      memories, and their own perceptions about life. When she was      in high school, unbeknownst to me, Martha applied for a      Horatio Alger Scholarship, given to kids who have endured      hardship and managed to be successful students in spite of      it. And, she got one. When she told me about this wonderful      thing, I was so proud and delighted. Eventually it dawned on      me to ask in perfect ignorance: ``What was your hardship?''       ``You,'' she answered. She had written about those days      when she came home to an empty cold house and had to face the      cellar and the furnace alone and cold. I have never read her      winning essay. I am not that strong.       So, eventually, I connected again with an interesting,      creative, blah, blah, blah man and Ruby came along. At this      time I am a lawyer in the civil law division of the AG      office. Yes, I had passed the bar. Ruby started day care at      six months of age. And, having found what I was supposed to      be doing with my life, I wanted to keep working. Oh the      guilt. Her father was on the road most of the time, and 2\1/     2\ years after Ruby was born, that road did not pass by our      house any more.       One day, the call came from the day care that Ruby was sick      and I needed to pick her up. Naturally, I was scheduled to      prosecute a physician before the Board of Medical Practice      that day. I had prepared the case for months. Witnesses had      answered subpoenas to appear. No other attorney in the office      knew the case. What I knew was that just outside the hearing      room in the Secretary of State's office was a couch. So, I      went and got Ruby, swung by the house for a blanket and      pillow and a juice box, and put her to bed in the hall of the      Secretary of State's office.       I know that bundling up a sick little girl in a hallway      will not win me any parenting awards. But, helpful,      understanding people working at the office kept an eye on      Ruby while she slept. Ruby, too, adjusted to me.       But, being a mom with a profession that really requires      adherence to a schedule also had benefits. My first oral      argument before the Vermont Supreme Court was scheduled. I      was a nervous wreck. ``Got to get plenty of sleep the night      before so I'm sharp.''       Instead Martha got the flu and we spent most of the night      with me holding her hair while she drove the porcelain bus.      As soon as Walter was done milking, I trundled Martha over to      his house, told him I would be back in two hours, and went to      Montpelier to the hearing. Being worried about Martha put the      argument into a manageable perspective--I just did the job      then ran home to be a mom.       Eventually, after 17 years at the Attorney General's      office, I applied to be a trial judge. I made it past the      Judicial Nominating board and my name was sent to Governor      Dean for consideration. Then, I got worried. Martha was 21 by      then, but Ruby was only 8 and I knew I'd be away from home      for long hours every day. I was scared so I withdrew my name      from consideration. When I told my daughters what I had done,      the outcry was loud. Ruby was really insulted and said she'd      be fine. Martha said she would help out. They convinced me it      could work. I called back the Governor's office and said I      had changed my mind. When I had my interview with the      Governor, I explained how my concerns for my children had      caused me to chicken out. He understood and appointed me as a      judge.       And, it was hard. On me, and on Ruby. I got home late and      left early. I was at least an hour away if she got sick or      hurt. There was one year when I was family court judge in      Washington county--where we live. Ruby was in sixth grade      when a big eighth grade boy approached and asked, ``Is your      mom a judge?''       She admitted I was.       ``She sent me to juvenile hall,'' he said.       ``I'm sorry,'' said little Ruby nervously.       ``Oh, that's all right, I screwed up.'' He reassured her.      ``She's the one with black nail polish, right?''       Finding herself in the familiar territory of mortification      by her mother's behavior, Ruby admitted, ``Yeah, that's      her.''       I used to wear something odd on juvenile day to relax the      kids, and this boy noticed. Of course Ruby was pretty much      always embarrassed by me. Now I am on the Supreme Court, but      what did Ruby say when she heard about the appointment at the      age of twelve?       ``Oh no, now you'll be home all the time!''       What did I learn that I can offer to you? I tried to think      of an inspirational saying or     two, but could not. I do get a lot of catalogs. One      particularly annoying one is chock full of heart warming      sayings like, ``Life isn't about waiting for the storm to      pass. It's about learning to dance in the rain.'' Oh please.      Storms are scary, rain is cold and wet, and one can get      muddy. Let's get real. Life is hard, get over it.       Number 1: Take help that is offered. Would I have survived      without Walter Smith's care and kindness? I do not know. And      I am glad I did not have to find out.       Number 2: If you do not have a snack, send a coconut. In      other words, be flexible. When it came time to study for the      bar examination, I was on my own. I made little 3x5 filing      cards on all the subjects and set them around the house so      that whatever I was doing, I could incorporate a little      study. Some areas of law are governed by certain factors that      you just have to remember. Over the kitchen sink I placed the      filing card that listed the elements of a secured      transaction. Next to the toilet I posted the card that laid      out the parts of a bulk sale. I read them over and over and      over. And, poor Martha endured one pizza after another      because I did not cook much while I studied.       Number 3: Pity parties are a waste of time, and a breeding      ground for excuses. In other words, if your circumstances are      not the most conducive to success, try anyway.       Would I have liked to go to law school? Of course. Could I?      No. So what! Here's my favorite true example of making due      with what you have available. I watch the Canadian television      coverage of the summer Olympic games because it is so much      better than that of the U.S. coverage. They celebrate      individual athletes' ``personal bests'' rather than the medal      counts. And, they covered really weird events that I had      never heard of, like dory racing. I thought it was very cool.      They did a background piece on Jerad Connaghten, an athlete      training for the 200 meters in track and field. He was from      somewhere in Canada that had no running track. So he and his      coach improvised. To train for strength they did sand starts      taking off in deep sand on the sea shore. They set up their      own practice course. At the end of a dirt road was a little      cottage and that cottage marked 200 meters. The little      mulberry tree was 50 meters out and the larger mulberry tree      was the 150 meters mark. Competing against the world's best,      Jerad made it through the preliminary heats to the finals of      the 200 meter event. I was so impressed. Work with what      you've got. Excuses weigh you down.       Number 4: Do not insult your children by thinking life is      too hard for them. In other words, children are resilient.      What might appear to have been my heartless expectation of      little Martha's abilities to care for herself at a very young      age may have been influenced by my maternal grandmother,      Olga. All four of my grandparents were born in Sweden. Olga      was the daughter of a farm family the Dahlbergs--with too      many children to feed. First the Dahlbergs sent their oldest      daughter Margaret over to live with relatives in Chicago, the      Larsons. Margaret died within months of her arrival of      diphtheria. Then the Dahlbergs put there next daughter, my      grandma Olga, on the boat all alone at the age of 12 and sent      her to live with the Dahlbergs. Throughout my life, whenever      I thought life was too hard and I was scared, I thought of my      grandma traveling alone across the ocean to the family where      her older sister had died. How did she do that? What were her      nightmares? My grandmother was sweet, and kind, and patient,      and loving. Her early years did no apparent damage. I know I      could have done better by Martha. I wish I could have done      better by Martha. I did the best I could and that is my only      consolation.       Number 5: Play dough is far more important than doing the      dishes. Get your priorities straight. I was blessed with a      job I loved, and then had the added joy of coming home,      forgetting about the law, and playing with my daughters. Next      confession: My housekeeping would not win any awards either.      Sometimes the food in the refrigerator grew little sweaters.      What housecleaning I did happened when the children were in      bed. And, they had clean clothes and decent food and, most      importantly, they knew their mom loved playing with them.      Legos, play dough, Barbies, puzzles. Whatever activity that      allowed the analytical part of my mind to go into sleep cycle      was welcomed by me. So, don't get so busy making a living      that you forget to make colorful messes and memories.       Number 6: Never, ever coast. After a few years at the      Attorney General's office, the AG asked me to become chief of      the civil division. I was one of two women in the division      and all the men had more years of experience than I as      lawyers. Here's a John Wayne quote: ``Courage is being scared      to death but saddling up anyway.'' Well, I moseyed on into      the AG's office and said, ``Yes, I would be pleased to be      chief of the division. But, I would like a bigger badge.''       To maintain respect and to get the members of the division      to be their best, I had to set an example. I worked as hard      or harder than anyone else. I gave them no reason to complain      about the AG's choice. So if you're running your own business      or supervising employees, it is more important to the bottom      line the quality of work to set a positive example than to      offer token prizes to the employee of the month who actually      manages to get to work on time five days in a row. I expected      the attorneys to be terrific and so they were.       To conclude, what do I know? My children have forgiven me      for most of my blunders, they are fiercely independent, and      can think on their own. I'm proud of my work and even more      proud of my daughters. And, I am grateful for the chances I      have been given and the courage to take them. My main message      to you is: Work hard. Then work harder. And then, work harder      still.       But, I will leave you with another of those pithy homey      sayings from the annoying catalog, and one that makes no      sense to me at all.       ``May the light always find you on a dreary day. When you      need to be home may you find a way. May you always have      courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your      underpants.''                          ____________________
