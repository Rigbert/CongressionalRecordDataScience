 It is impossible to understand, it is a lengthy amendment, and all of the reverberations. I contend and say that it is out of the scope of this bill, and we hope to keep the bill away from these kinds of contentious matters but pass those items within the scope of the bill. I thought there was general agreement with that position. I thought theSenator would recognize, based on the debate Senator Gregg had with Senator Conrad that there were real questions with the amendment that took further study. My impression was the Senator from New Hampshire was willing to go through that process at the time.
