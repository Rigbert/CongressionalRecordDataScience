(b) Clerical Amendment.--The analysis for such chapter (as      amended by this Act) is further amended by adding at the end      the following:       ``44734. Employee criminal history record checks in            domestic and foreign repair stations.''.  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 189, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is quite simple. It would require criminal background checks of mechanics at contract aircraft repair stations, both those domestically and those overseas.  Now, the current law requires that people who repair aircraft at airports undergo criminal background checks that are quite extensive because there's a concern that they have access to airplanes, that we want to know who they are, we want to be sure they don't have a criminal background, and they can be denied employment for a large range of former felonies or problems, let alone any affiliation with terrorist groups.  Not so at domestic contract repair stations or foreign contract repair stations. The employees there undergo no criminal background checks, or only criminal background checks at the discretion of the employer. They can be certified to do the most critical de-check work, overhauls on airplanes.  Now, just think about it. As John Pistole recently said, he's the head of the Transportation Security Administration, ``For more than two decades al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations have sought to do harm to this country. Many of their plots against the United States have focused on the aviation system. It is clear that terrorist intent to strike at American targets has not diminished.''  Yet we're not doing criminal and security background checks of people who have access to the innards of the plane. They could replace one critical component, a bolt that holds on an engine with one that looks like the real bolt but is actually fake and designed to fail. That could easily happen, and yet we are not requiring that they have background checks.  Well, why are we requiring it at airports? If it's so critical a mechanic who can access a plane at the airport, why isn't it critical for people who can get deep inside a plane in an overhaul, overseas, far, far away from any prospective oversight by the TSA or the FAA?  Now, some would say, well, the Transportation Security Administration, rather belatedly, 7 years after the fact, is working on a rule that will require them to adopt general procedures for security, but it will not require criminal or terrorist background checks. They will verify background information through confirmation of prior employment. Yes, I used to work for Osama bin Laden. You can call him. Here's his number. But now I don't work there anymore, and I'm here.  This is, I think, a commonsense amendment. Now, the industry can say, oh, this will drive up the cost of repairs. Come on, it's 60 bucks to do a TSA background check. $60. Now, don't you think it's worth $60, and is that going to drive contract repair stations in the U.S. or overseas out of business if they have to confirm that their employees are not criminals or are not terrorists? I don't think so.  I urge support of the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
