Mr. Chairman, I have a long prepared statement which I will submit for the Record, but I would ask my colleagues today to think about this legislation very strongly. I have talked privately with the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), and they say that the bill that they are proposing does not do the job. That tells me one thing: the bill that they are promoting does not do the job, and this bill does.  We worked very closely to get a bill and came very nearly to having a bill. Some people did not see it that way. But my main goal was to have the best security bill for our people. I believe my bill does that. It is not perfect, but I can tell my colleagues the Senate bill is nowhere as near as my bill.  If my colleagues vote for the substitute, which some of my colleagues are planning on doing, they are not going to have a conference. That has already been decided. It will be on the President's desk, and the American people will be told by certain people that they will be secure in their airports, but we will have the exact same system that is in place right now, which has failed miserably. All of my colleagues know that.  This has become a political football, and I stayed out of that, because I want the best security for the people of America.  I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), who has done an outstanding job, and the staff has done a good job on this issue and, yes, the President of the United States. All he is asking us to do and what my bill does is give him some flexibility. My bill does not federalize, it does not nationalize, it is not a total requirement. But it is a brand new era, a time where we need good security. In all good conscience, there is no way that a substitute is going to be offered that I could even vote for that legislation, because we are kidding the American public.  The Senate keeps referring to a 100 to zero vote. I have had Senate Democrats and Republicans come to me and say, my God, we have to go to conference. And I have had a few people say to me, we will have to straighten this out later on. That is not good legislation. This is the House of the people, not the Senate. To have to accept a Senate bill to me is deplorable. It is beneath us. It is the wrong thing to do.  I do not believe there is a fairer person in this Congress than myself working with each individual. My heart is very deeply in the idea of security. If we do not pass this bill today of mine and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica), we are doing a great disservice to the American people, because they will go to the airport and say, oh, my God, we are now safe because we have passed a bill, and in reality there is no safety in the substitute.  Mr. Chairman, it disturbs me how this thing got so far out of hand that we cannot solve the problem correctly. We must go to conference. We can solve it in conference where the problems are different, but if we do not go to conference, we have nothing and we have kidded the public. I am not about to, and I was accused today of not being a statesman because I said I probably will not review this issue again because my colleagues have made the decision if I lose that they have a safe bill and the people of America are safe. I can tell my colleagues from the bottom of my heart, my colleagues know they are not, and I will not be a part of kidding the American public about how secure they will be if we adopt the substitute. We have to accept the Young-Mica bill for the best for the people of America.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3150, the Secure Transportation for America Act of 2001.  H.R. 3150 is the result of a great deal of hard work by our aviation subcommittee and its chairman, John Mica.  I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for his efforts and the hard work of the aviation subcommittee on this issue.  Chairman Mica and the members of the aviation subcommittee held hearings and conducted extensive research to find out which system of security would work best for our aviation transportation needs.  The American people have every right to be concerned and worried about the inadequate level of security provided at our airports.  This bill will dramatically increase the level of security and will dramatically change the way the system has operated at our airports.  Under the current system, the airlines hire the security screeners at the airports using low cost, low bid security companies.  The airlines in the past have worked to reduce their costs by driving down the cost of airline security. Unfortunately, this has resulted in a low paid, poorly trained and poorly motivated workforce.  I want to make it abundantly clear. This bill changes all of that.  Low paid, poorly trained and poorly motivated screeners in charge of our nation's air security is simply unacceptable.  Under our bill, H.R. 3150, the federal government will take over the job of screening passengers and their baggage at our airports.  It will become a federal government responsibility.  Where we differ with some of our colleagues is how do we best achieve the goal of a truly secure federally controlled aviation screening process.  We do it by insuring that it is the federal government that will set the compensation for the screeners.  It is the federal government that mandates the level of competency and training for the screeners.  It is the government that runs the background checks and works with other agencies to insure that these screeners have a clean record.  And if the screeners don't do their job and perform well, under our bill they can be removed, their certificates can be revoked, and the entire company can be fired and fined for any violations of the rules or regulations.  Our bill gives the President the tools he needs to insure the best possible security for our country.  H.R. 3150 however, does more than just improve airport screening.  It establishes broad authority to deal with threats to all transportation modes, by setting up a new Transportation Security Administration within the Department of Transportation.  The new administration will be headed by an undersecretary whose only job will be to protect our transportation system from terrorists threats.  H.R. 3150 requires the undersecretary of the Transportation Security Administration to assume all responsibility for aviation security within 3 months of final passage of the bill.  Under our bill the undersecretary could assume responsibility even earlier if the transition can be worked out with the airlines.  Unlike the Senate bill and the amendment to be offered, H.R. 3150 does not tie the President's hands by requiring that airport security screeners be 100 percent federal employees.  However, let me make it clear.  Our bill federalizes the screening process.  However, the issue is not federal versus non-federal employees conducting the screening of passengers and their bags.  The real issue is how to achieve the highest level of security for the traveling public, particularly within the next few months while we are at war against the terrorists who used our air transportation system to attack us.  Locking in a system that prohibits the use of any private contract workers at all leaves the air transportation system vulnerable to disruption and reduced security.  There is no guarantee that federal employees will do a better job than private employees, but that is not the real issue.  The real issue is giving the President the flexibility and the money to get the job done.  I also want to make it clear that this issue is not about whether screeners will be unionized.  They are unionized now and under my bill can continue to be members of union and to bargain collectively. However, they cannot go on strike under my bill.  H.R. 3150, the Secure Transportation for America Act, addresses all these security issues to achieve a workable system that provides for real security as quickly as possible.  I urge support of H.R. 3150, which is to bring real security to the traveling public in as short a period of time as possible. Section-by-Section Summary--Secure Transportation for America Act of                             2001--H.R. 3150       Section 1 is the short title.           section 2--transportation security administration       Subsection (a) adds a new section 114 to Chapter 1 of title      49 of the U.S. Code creating the new Transportation Security      Administration (TSA).       Subsection (a) of this new section 114 states that the new      TSA shall be an Administration in the Department of      Transportation (DOT).       Subsection (b) creates the new position of Under Secretary      to head this new Administration.       Paragraph (1) states that this Under Secretary shall be      appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the      Senate.       Paragraph (2) states that the Under Secretary must be a      U.S. citizen and have had prior experience in transportation      or security.       Paragraph (3) gives the Under Secretary a 5-year term.       Subsection (c) prohibits the Under Secretary from having an      interest in a transportation or a security company or a      company that makes security equipment.       Subsection (d) describes the functions of the Under      Secretary.       Paragraph (1) states that the Under Secretary will be      responsible for security in all modes of transportation. This      involves the assumption of the powers now exercised by the      Associate FAA Administrator of Civil Aviation Security and      the DOT Director of Intelligence and Security as well as the      security functions of other Administrations within DOT. It      does not involve the Coast Guard. The bill does not      explicitly assign the hazmat function leaving that up to DOT      to decide whether to move that into the new Administration or      keep it in FAA.       Paragraph (2) requires a schedule to be developed for the      transfer of the security functions in consultation with the      affected carriers.       Paragraph (3), in the meantime, allows airlines to assign      their contracts with private security companies to the Under      Secretary.       Subsection (e) lists in more detail the duties and powers      of the Under Secretary. These duties and powers are--       (1) Receiving, assessing, and distributing intelligence      information to the appropriate people in the transportation      community.       (2) Assessing threats to transportation.       (3) Developing policies to deal with these threats.       (4) Coordinating with other agencies.       (5) Serve as the liaison with the intelligence community.       (6) Supervising airport security using Federal uniformed      personnel.       (7) Manage the Federal security personnel in the field.       (8) Enforce security regulations.       (9) Undertake research to improve security.       (10) Inspect, maintain, and test security equipment.       (11) Ensure that adequate security is provided for the      transportation of cargo, including cargo as defined in      section 40102(a)(12).       (12) Oversee the security at airports and other      transportation facilities.       (13) Perform background checks on screeners and those who      work at airports.       (14) Develop standards for the hiring and firing of      screeners.       (15) Train and test screeners.       (16) Carry out other duties and powers authorized by law.       Subsection (f) gives the Under Secretary the same powers to      acquire and maintain property as the FAA.       Subsection (g) allows the Under Secretary to accept      transfers of funds.       Subsection (h) allows the Under Secretary, if the situation      warrants, to issue a security rule on an expedited basis      without Secretarial or OMB review and without notice and      comment as would otherwise be required by the Administrative      Procedure Act. Such a rule would be in effect for 30 days and      would remain in effect unless disapproved by the Oversight      Board established in section 13.       Subsection (i) gives the Under Secretary the same authority      over personnel and services as the FAA. This includes the      authority to contract for services such as the screening      service.       Subsection (j) allows the new Transportation Security      Administration (TSA) to set up its own personnel system.       Subsection (k) allows the new TSA to set up its own      procurement system.       Subsection (l) makes clear that the DOT Inspector General      can investigate the TSA in the same way that he can      investigate other Administrations within DOT.       Subsection (c) establishes the compensation for the Under      Secretary.       Subsection (d) allows other agencies to provide personnel,      such as sky marshals, to the FAA and the TSA.       Subsection (e) transfers responsibility for security      research from the FAA to the TSA.       Subsection (f) changes statutory references from the FAA      and the Administrator to the TSA and the Under Secretary to      reflect the transfer of functions.            Section 3--Screening of passengers and property       This section requires the Federal government to take over      responsibility for the screening of passengers and property      (both checked and carry-on baggage) on passenger aircraft in      the United States. The Federal government could do this      either by hiring Federal employees to do the screening or by      contracting with a security company to perform this task with      Federal oversight. All screening must be supervised by      uniformed Federal employees of the TSA. A supervisor can      order the dismissal of a screener who is not performing      adequately. Screeners are prohibited from striking.                      Section 4--Security programs       This section requires that there be a law enforcement or      military presence at each screening checkpoint, not merely at      each airport. The law enforcement presence could be either      Federal, State, or local officials.             Section 5--Employement standards and training       Strengthens the employment and training standards for those      who screen passengers and property.       Subsection (a) requires that screeners be U.S. citizens. It      permits the Under Secretary to establish minimum pay levels.      Veterans should be given preference in the hiring of     screeners. The veterans preference was a suggestion of      Congressman Duncan.       Subsection (b) requires the final rule of the certification      of screening companies to be issued within 6 months of the      date of enactment of this Act.       Subsection (c) establishes the training standards for      screeners and requires all screeners to be in uniform.       Subsection (d) establishes the minimum employment standards      for screeners (which were taken largely from the FAA's      proposed rule at 65 FR 560, January 5, 2000). These shall      remain in effect until the final rule for the certification      of screening companies is issued as required by subsection      (b).             section 6--deployment of federal air marshals       Requires the deployment, at no cost to the government, of      sky marshals on flights of U.S. airlines. This section is      based on H.R. 2906 introduced by Congressman Baker.                 section 7--enhanced security measures       Subsection (a) requires the Under Secretary to address the      following issues:       (1) Develop procedures (such as barrel roles or      depressurizing the aircraft) and authorize equipment (such as      lethal or non-lethal weapons) to help the pilot defend the      aircraft against hijackers;       (2) After consultation with the FAA, find ways to--       (A) limit access to the cockpit;       (B) strengthen cockpit doors;       (C) use video cameras to alert pilots to problems in the      passenger cabin without having to open the cockpit door;       (D) ensure that the aircraft transponder cannot be turned      off in flight.       (3) Impose standards for the screening or inspection of      vehicles and employees of aircraft fuelers, caterers,      cleaners, and others who have access to aircraft and secure      areas of airports;       (4) Require airlines to provide emergency call capability      from aircraft and trains (This was suggested by Congressman      Kirk);       (5) Use various technologies, such as voice stress      analysis, to prevent a dangerous person from boarding a      plane;       (6) Develop certification standards for individual      screeners;       (7) Use Threat Image Projection (TIP) or similar devices to      test whether screeners are meeting those standards;       (8) Develop ways for airlines to have access to law      enforcement and immigration data bases to ensure that      dangerous people do not board their planes;       (9) Use the profiling system known as CAPS to not only give      special scrutiny to selected checked baggage but also to the      passengers who fit the profile and their carry-on baggage;       (10) Use technology to ensure that airport and airline      employees and law enforcement officers are who they claim to      be;       (11) Install switches in the passenger cabin so that flight      attendants can discreetly notify a pilot if there is a      problem;       (12) Change the training of airline personnel in light of      the change in the methods and goals of hijackers as evidenced      by the attack of September 11th;       (13) Provide for background checks for those seeking flying      lessons on large aircraft or flight simulators of such      aircraft.       (14) Enter into agreements allowing trained law enforcement      personnel of other agencies to travel with guns in order to      assist a sky marshal. (This was suggested by Congressman      Cooksey).       (15) Perform more thorough background checks of airport      screeners, student pilots, and others who have unescorted      access to secure areas of the airport. This should include      more than merely a fingerprint check. It should also include      examination of other agency databases to determine whether      the individual may be a terrorist or a threat to civil      aviation.       Subsection (b) prohibits the Under Secretary from taking      one of the actions listed above if the FAA believes it might      adversely affect the safety of the aircraft unless the      Secretary approves the action.       Subsection (c) requires the Under Secretary to consult with      the NTSB on safety issues.       Subsection (d) requires the Under Secretary to do bag      matching, screen 100% of checked bags, or take some other      action to minimize the risk of explosives in checked luggage.      Paragraph (2) requires the Under Secretary to ensure that      explosive detection equipment already at airports is fully      utilized.       Subseciton (e) requires the Secretary to permit pilots to      carry guns in the cockpit if the airline permits its pilots      to carry guns and the pilot has completed an appropriate      training program.       Subscetion (f) requires the Under Secretary to report 6      months after the date of enactment on the progress being made      in implementing the above items. A similar report would have      to be submitted each year thereafter until all the items had      either been implemented or rejected. An existing security      report is repealed.   section 8--criminal history record check for screeners and others       Authorizes airports to begin fingerprint checks before the      deadline now in the law.             section 9--passenger and baggage screening fee       Requires the imposition of a security fee on passengers to      pay up to 100 percent of the cost of the screening      passengers. These costs include the salaries and training      costs of screeners and the cost of the equipment they use.      The fee could not be used to defray the general operating      costs of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).      The per passenger fee must be based on the cost of providing      the screening service but could not be more than $2.50 per      passenger. The fee that is set would be based on the total      costs of screening passengers and property, not on the      specific costs associated with each airport, and therefore      the fee would be the same for every passenger. The fee would      be assessed on a one-way flight rather than on an enplanement      as the one-way trip most closely related to the way screening      services are provided to passengers. Full year revenue for      fiscal year 2002 is estimated to amount to about $900 million      for domestic departures and about $100 million for      international departures. Future year revenue could be higher      when air travel reverts to the levels prior to September 11,      2001. Any additional money required to pay the costs of      screening not covered by the passenger fee may be raised by a      fee assessed directly on the airlines or could be      appropriated under the authority provided by section 10(a).      Passengers using airports in Alaska where screening is not      required could be exempted from the fee.       It is Congress' intent that the Undersecretary be able to      impose this fee as expeditiously as possible to begin to      recover the costs of the functions assumed by the Federal      government. To ensure that the Undersecretary is able to      begin collecting the fee within 60 days, the Undersecretary      is exempted from section 9701 of title 31, United States      Code, related to general requirements related to fees and      from section 553 of title 5, United States Code, related to      rulemaking. The Undersecretary is authorized to publish a      notice in the Federal Register to set and impose the fee. The      calculation of costs of the functions and the fees to be      imposed is left to be determined at the discretion of the      Undersecretary.              section 10--authorizations of appropriations       Subsection (a) authorizes appropriations to operate the new      TSA and to pay for any screening costs not covered by the      fee.       Subsection (b) authorizes the Secretary to utilize $500      million of the emergency supplemental (Public Law 107-38) to      make grants to U.S. airlines to help them strengthen their      cockpit doors, install video monitors, or modify their      aircraft transponders so that they cannot be turned off in      flight.       Subsection (c) authorizes $1.5 billion to help airports      defray the cost of new security requirements imposed after      September 11, 2001.    section 11--limitation on liability for acts to thwart criminal                       violence or aircraft piracy       Protects passengers and crew from liability for any injury      they cause a person who they, in good faith, believe is      hijacking or about to hijack an aircraft.                    section 12--passenger manifests       Requires U.S. and foreign airlines to provide information      to the U.S. government about their passengers and crew on      international flights before they land in the U.S.          section 13--transportation security oversight board       Creates the new Transportation Security Oversight Board. It      will be composed of the Secretaries of Transportation,      Treasury, and Defense (or their designees), the Attorney      General (or his designee), and a person appointed by the      President from either the National Security Council or the      new Office of Homeland Security. The DOT Secretary or his      designee will be the Chairman. The Board's duties include      reviewing the Under Secretary's emergency regulations and      other actions of the TSA. This section also creates an      advisory council composed of industry representatives to      advise the Under Secretary on transportation security      issues.                section 14--airport improvement program       Section 12 makes changes to the airport improvement program      (AIP) and the passenger facility charge (PFC) related to      security.       Subsection (a) excuses an airport from having to submit a      competition plan in fiscal year 2002 for AIP grants or PFC      approvals that will be used to improve security.       Subsection (b) allows AIP or PFC money to be used at small      airports to pay the cost of law enforcement personnel      required by section 4. It also allows AIP money to be used to      pay for any expense in fiscal year 2002 at a general aviation      airport that was effectively shut down as a result of the      restrictions on VFR flight in enhanced Class B airspace. It      also allows AIP and PFC money to be used for debt service in      order to prevent the airport from defaulting on a bond.       Subsection (c) allows AIP money to be used for the costs      described in subsection (b) even if that cost was incurred      before the grant was issued.       Subsection (d) waives the local share for the costs      described in subsection (b).                    section 15--technical correction       Subsection (a) changes the due date of a report from      February 1 of this year to February 1 of next year.       Subsection (b) makes a change in the war risk improvement      program.       Subsection (c) corrects a misspelled word.          section 16--alcohol and controlled substance testing       Transfers responsibility for drug and alcohol testing of      security personnel from the     FAA to the new Transportation Security Administration.           Section 17--conforming amendments to subtitle vii       This section makes technical changes.       Subsection (a) retains responsibility for the Pilot Records      Improvements Act in the FAA.       Subsection (b) moves certain civil penalty responsibilities      to the new Administration.       Subsection (c) and (d) make similar administrative changes.                     Section 18--Savings provision       This section ensures that there is a seamless transition of      responsibilities from the FAA to the new Transportation      Security Administration (TSA).                     Section 19--Budget Submissions       Requires budget submissions to list the budget of the TSA      separately.      Section 20--Aircraft operations in Enhanced Class B airspace       Lists the restrictions on general aviation flights in      Enhanced Class B airspace (the airspace near major cities)      unless a notice is published in the Federal Register      explaining the rationale for those restrictions.          Section 21--waivers for certain isolated communities       Subsection (a) allows the Under Secretary to grant waivers      for certain essential flights to communities in Alaska,      Hawaii, and others far from a big city.       Subsection (b) allows the Transportation Security Oversight      Board to rescind these waivers.       Subsection (c) allows the Board to impose limitations on      the waivers.             Section 22--Assessments of Threats to Airports       This section allows airports to rescind the current      restriction that prohibits cars from parking within 300 feet      of an airport terminal if the airport and local law      enforcement certify that there are safeguards in place to      sufficiently protect public safety.                                  ____                                       Committee on Transportation                                           and Infrastructure,                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 2001.     Hon. Sherwood L. Boehlert,     Chairman, Committee on Science,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Boehlert: Thank you for your letter of      October 31, 2001, regarding H.R. 3150, the ``Secure      Transportation for America Act of 2001'' and for your      willingness to waive consideration of provisions in the bill      under your Committee's jurisdiction. Regarding provisions in      the bill that are referenced in your letter, the bill      essentially ensures the orderly transfer of certain existing      functions within the Department of Transportation and assures      continuity of operations. However, I acknowledge the Science      Committee's jurisdiction under the House Rules over      provisions that may affect ``civil aviation research and      development.''       I agree that your waiving consideration of relevant      provisions of H.R. 3150 does not waive the Science      Committee's jurisdiction over those provisions. I also      acknowledge your right to seek conferees on any provisions      that are within the Science Committee's jurisdiction during      any House-Senate conference on H.R. 3150 or similar      legislation, and would support your request for conferees on      such provisions.       Your letter and this response will be included in the      record during floor consideration of the bill.       Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,     Chairman.                                  ____                                             Committee on Science,                                Rayburn House Office Building,                                 Washington, DC, October 30, 2001.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: On October 17, 2001, you introduced      H.R. 3150, the ``Secure Transportation for America Act of      2001.'' Section 2(e)(9) of H.R. 3150 requires the newly      created Under Secretary of Transportation for Security to      ``identify and undertake research and development activities      necessary to enhance transportation security.'' Additionally,      secs. 2(f)(1)(D) authorizes the Under Secretary ``to acquire      (by purchase, lease, condemnation, or otherwise) and to      construct, repair, operate, and maintain research and testing      sites and facilities; and (E) in cooperation with the      Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, to      utilize the research and development facilities of the      Federal Aviation Administration located in Atlantic City, New      Jersey.'' These three provisions contain subject matter that      has traditionally fallen under the jurisdiction of the      Committee on Science pursuant to House Rule X(n)(3), which      grants the Committee on Science jurisdiction over ``Civil      aviation and research.'' I ask for your assurance that the      creation of the new Under Secretary position and that the      duties and functions of his position do not alter in any way      the traditional jurisdiction of the Science Committee granted      pursuant to House Rule X(n)(3).       In deference to your desire to bring this legislation      before the House in an expeditious manner I will not exercise      this Committee's right to consider H.R. 3150. Despite waiving      its consideration of H.R. 3150, the Science Committee does      not waive its jurisdiction over H.R. 3150. Additionally, the      Science Committee expressly reserves its authority to seek      conferees on any provisions that are within its jurisdiction      during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on      this or similar legislation which falls within the Science      Committee's jurisdiction. I ask for your commitment to      support any request by the Science Committee for conferees on      H.R. 3150 as well as any similar or related legislation.       I request that you include this letter as part of the      Record during consideration of the legislation on the House      floor. Thank you for your consideration and attention      regarding these matters.           Sincerely,                                             Sherwood L. Boehlert,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
