 President, I have a few observations about the events of the day.  We are all thinking about today's tragic shootings at the Navy Yard, about the victims and their families.The men and women of the military courageously put their lives on the line in many dangerous places around the world. It is painful for all of us to think about and having to worry about their safety when they come home too.  Many people in the area, and across the country, will be directly affected by this terrible tragedy and we pray for them all. These kinds of incidents always remind us how fragile life is. They also remind those of us who work in and around the Capitol how much we all owe to the men and women who work so hard to keep us safe every day.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank Terry Gainer and his team, Chief Dine, and the entire Capitol Police force for all they do day in and day out, and for everyone else who is working through this tragedy, including the first responders, the medical personnel, and DC police. I want them all to know one thing: We are all thankful for your hard work and your sacrifice. Everyone is deeply grateful, especially on days such as this.
