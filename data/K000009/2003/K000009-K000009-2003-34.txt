Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for the opportunity to urge my colleagues to vote no on this rule which restricts debate today to 2 hours, as has happened on every so-called free trade agreement that has come before this body in the last 20 years. Restricted time means no opportunity to really take a look at what has happened.  Many of us have served here long enough to know that the NAFTA idea of trade does not work. The gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), my good friend, you told me when you voted for NAFTA back in 1993 it would create jobs. In fact, it has done exactly the opposite. We have historic trade deficits with Mexico, this year alone close to $50 billion.
