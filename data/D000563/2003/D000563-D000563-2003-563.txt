You eliminate Medicare as a competitor to these private insurance companies. The Medicare agency itself cannot offer this prescription drug plan other than through a private agency with which they contract.  What I am saying to the Senator from Pennsylvania is: Take a look at the Veterans' Administration. The Veterans' Administration is a good indication of what can happen when a Federal agency such as the Veterans' Administration wants to bring down costs; it bargains on behalf of the people it represents and lowers prescription drug costs.  Under this bill, S. 1, as I understand it, you have to have two private insurance companies offering in a region or there is a Medicare fallback, which turns out to be a plan that they contract out to some private provider.
