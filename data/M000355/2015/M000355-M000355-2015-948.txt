 President, yesterday I joined Speaker Boehner, Senator Cotton, and Congressman Pompeo in sending a letter to the administration with a simple request: that the administration meet its full obligations to Congress under the terms of the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act--a law both parties supported overwhelmingly just this spring. The law gives Congress the right to review all of the elements of an agreement struck between the White House and Iran and then take a vote on it.  The law is clear, but the administration has not submitted the side agreements between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran to the Senate, withholding the text from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. And since the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act was signed into law prior to the completion of the negotiation in Vienna, Secretary Kerry was fully aware--fully aware--of the requirement in law to submit the side deal to Congress.  Congress cannot properly carry out its obligation to the American people until the administration fulfills its legal obligation to the American people and to Congress, so we are calling on the administration to do that immediately.                          ____________________
