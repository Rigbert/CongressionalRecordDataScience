 President, I thank my good friend from Nebraska for his comments about OPIC. With all due respect to our colleague from Colorado, I, too, oppose the amendment. OPIC does not cost a single taxpayer dollar. OPIC is required by law to operate on a self-sustaining basis. Since 1971, it has reimbursed the U.S. Government for every dollar it has received and has reported positive net income every year since its inception. As the Senator from Nebraska pointed out, last year it returned $209 million to the Treasury. OPIC creates American jobs and exports. All major U.S. economic competitors have similar export promotion agencies. Scuttling OPIC would put our companies at an even further disadvantage than they already are.  Today, for example, at least 36 percent of Japan's exports enjoy Government subsidies compared with just 2 percent of American exports. In addition, Japan and France provide 77 percent of the total amount of export subsidies made available around the world.  As Senator Hagel pointed out, that is what American businesses typically are up against in the international market. OPIC is not corporate welfare. OPIC charges market and risk-based interest rates and fees for all of its services, and all loans must be paid in full. All clients must pass industry standard and OPIC policy reviews. This is an agency that has functioned verywell in behalf of American interests and is actually returning money to the American Treasury. OPIC strongly supports small business, which is the heart of America's economic engine. The source of 6 out of every 10 jobs in this country is directly attributable to small business.  We have had this amendment every year and so far have been able to defeat it. I certainly hope we will be able to again, because OPIC is an important part of what makes American business competitive overseas.  I yield the floor.
