President, I second Senator McCain's comments about the cooperation and collaboration. We hope that tomorrow we can move forward on several amendments, and I want to join him in commending and thanking our colleagues for their help.  Thank you.  Mr. President, I believe we have both yielded the floor.                          ____________________
