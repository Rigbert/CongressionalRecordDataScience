President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska for working with Senator Lieberman and me to resolve these three amendments. I very much appreciate the good-faith suggestions that were made on both sides, and I am grateful to him for working with us to address his concerns.  I think we have come up with very good suggestions, and I am pleased that the amendments have been adopted.
