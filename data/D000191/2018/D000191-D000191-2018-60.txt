Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Amodei). The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I have in my district office something called the ``casework staff.'' We do have disasters in Oregon, particularly floods. And we have had instances, apparently like the one that this legislation is trying to address, where we have gotten these improper decisions reversed and my communities reimbursed, handled by my casework staff.  Here, we are going to legislate. Now, apparently, there was a problem in the gentleman's district. Too bad his casework staff didn't take care of it. But the way this is written, here is the language: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, FEMA shall deem any covered disaster assistance to have been properly procured, provided, and utilized, and shall restore any funding of covered disaster assistance previously provided but subsequently withdrawn or deobligated.''  It isn't specific to the gentleman's problem. This would be any community, anybody anywhere who might have legitimately misspent some disaster assistance, gets it back. This is so global. We might as well just not have a process to review disaster assistance and see whether it was properly spent, because this says, if you have got it and you spent it, that is all proper. I mean, it is deemed--deemed that every expenditure is legitimate, even if the money was diverted somehow.  So, again, I am not certain who the other side is using for drafting assistance, but I recommend leg counsel.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
