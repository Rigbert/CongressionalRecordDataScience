 President, also, as a matter of procedure, we are getting down to five or six amendments. I hope the minority whip or somebody on that side has a list of amendments that may be proposed but have not been seen on this side. I ask if we can have that shared with us so we can get a better idea of what we have left to do.  Quite frankly, for Senator Baucus and me, it is a little difficult to manage all these amendments when we do not know what they are or when they are coming up. I would also like to pursue an agreement to finalize a list so we can get our work done.  I wonder if somebody on the other side of the aisle can help us with that?  In that regard I know there are people who think this bill came up too soon after it came out of committee, but the leader was asking me Tuesday night to bring this up Wednesday, after we voted it out of committee. I thought that was too soon. Senator Baucus said he did not want to bring it up that early. I just took it upon myself to say I would not file the papers until it came up on Thursday so we would have an opportunity for people to have access to the language of the bill to write amendments.  I hope we will have the courtesy, then, of seeing the amendments that might come up and know how many there are. I see the distinguished Democratic whip, and I wonder if he can respond to my request. My request is, if there is a list of amendments, could we have that list of amendments so we know what our work is going to be.
