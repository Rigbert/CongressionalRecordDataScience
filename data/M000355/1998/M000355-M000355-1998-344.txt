 President, 50 years ago this month, the University of Kentucky accomplished a feat still unmatched in college basketball history. As every backyard all-star in the Commonwealth can tell you, that was the year of the original Fabulous Five.  You see in Kentucky, we have a habit of naming our most special Wildcat teams, and 1948 may have been the most special of the bunch. That group, led by Alex Groza, Ralph Beard and Wah Wah Jones not only earned Kentucky's first NCAA men's college basketball championship trophy but went on to bring home a gold medal from the 1948 Olympics.  Flash forward Fifty years into the future, to see another edition of the Wildcats, and equally high expectations. Led by seniors Jeff Sheppard, Allen Edwards, and Cameron Mills, the 1998 Cats came into the season facing an uncertain future. While expectations are always high at Kentucky, this year's squad exceeded even the most optimistic fan's hopes.  Under the expert leadership of first-year head coach, Tubby Smith, these Wildcats will be raising the school's 7th NCAA championship banner to the rafters of Rupp Arena. But Mr. President, there is so much more to this story than wins and losses.  While the '48 team was appropriately known as the Fab Five, this year's national champions will go down in Wildcat history as maybe the most perfect embodiment of the word ``team'' in Kentucky's legacy of excellence. Time after time when the odds seemed insurmountable this team willed itself to victory.  A quick review of the final three games of this year's tournament reveals the heart of a lion. Down 17 points with less than 10 minutes to play against a Duke squad that had been ranked #1 for most of the year, the Comeback Cats put together a frenzied charge, outscoring the Blue Devils 17 - 1 during a crucial stretch. What made the feat all the more impressive was that every player contributed.  In the Final Four, the Cats squared off against the Stanford Cardinal, the West Coast power that spent the majority of the season undefeated. Down by 5 at half, the Cats did what was natural for them, they put together a rally, eventually winning the contest in overtime. This victory was fueled by one of the most gritty performances in Final Four history, as senior Jeff Sheppard poured in 27 of the Cats 74 points.  What could top this effort in the finals? How about the greatest come-from-behind victory in the history of the NCAA championship. Down 10 at the half, and 12 early in the second half, this selfless group of young men redoubled their efforts and chipped away at the Utah lead. Steadily the tide began to shift behind three point baskets from Heshimu Evans, and Kentucky natives Cameron Mills and Scott Padgett. Refusing to wilt under the pressure of facing the hottest team in the nation, Kentucky hammered away defensively and converted on the offensive end. In the end, Utah's game effort was not enough and the Cats posted a 78 - 69 victory in seizing their second national title in three years.  In what has become habit for the Comeback Cats, the team drew on its strengths and refused to panic. Under the masterful eye of Coach Smith and the intelligent play of a host of stars, the team accomplished its dream of bringing home the title.  So, Mr. President, while we look back fondly on the Fabulous Five of 1948, I am content to take senior Jeff Sheppard's advice to ``appreciate the precious present,'' and embrace these Comeback Cats as the greatest ``team'' to ever put on the Kentucky uniform. It is impossible to appreciate the intensity and effort these young men put forth as they met and exceeded every challenge in their path during the 1997-98 season.  Mr. President, I ask each of my colleagues to join me in honoring the University of Kentucky, history-making coach Tubby Smith, athletic director C. M. Newton, and most importantly each and every talented player on the 1998 Championship Wildcat team.                          ____________________
