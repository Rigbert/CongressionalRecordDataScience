 The committee takes invasive species threats seriously. We spent a lot of time on Asian carp in our committee in prevention efforts throughout the bill. It is a bipartisan effort. Everyone is very concerned about this. We are talking about a bounty program, possibly, to go after these things. Let's go do it.  I accept the gentleman's amendment, but I will be working with him and the rest of my colleagues to ensure that Asian carp and grass carp control and prevention efforts are effectively coordinated across the agencies within our jurisdiction.  Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
