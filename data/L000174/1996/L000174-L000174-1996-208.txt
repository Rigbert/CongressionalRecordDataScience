President, I do not have a particular position on this one. I would be delighted with whatever time agreement we might enter into. But I see the deputy Republican leader on the floor. I am just wondering with time agreements and all if we might have some idea. What is the schedule tonight? For those of us who have faint glimmers of family-friendly situations, I just wonder. I am perfectly willing to continue to vote for the rest of the evening, or stack votes. I am not the one to make that choice. I wonder if someone could give us an idea.  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for purposes of answering.
