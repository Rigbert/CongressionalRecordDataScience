 President, colleagues, it is my understanding that the four corners who are working on the omnibus appropriations are very, very close to agreement. We still need a few days to process the larger bill. The House has posted a 1-week CR to keep the government open. We are prepared to clear the 1-week CR on this side of the aisle.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the text of a joint resolution, which is at the desk--that is, a 1-week continuing resolution--be printed in the Record; further, that if the Senate receives a joint resolution from the House, the text of which is identical to the text of the joint resolution printed in the Record, the joint resolution be considered to have been read three times and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered to have been made and laid upon the table; provided further, that if the language is not identical, then this order be vitiated.
