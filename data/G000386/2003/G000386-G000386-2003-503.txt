  First of all, I need to thank the Senator for his cooperation in working with us on this amendment so we can expedite the bill. Also, I make clear I am a strong supporter of the Senator's legislation and the expansion of it and would agree to make sure we get this done before the end of the calendar year, so that would involve extending it and expanding these teacher provisions.  This all deals--so everyone knows what we are talking about--with the extension of legislation passed within the last 2 years. It sunsets. We make these permanent, and there would be a significant increase in the above-the-line deduction for teachers.
