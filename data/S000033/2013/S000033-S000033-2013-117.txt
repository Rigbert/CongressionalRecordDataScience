 The time has come for the Senate to send a very loud and clear message to the American people. It is the message Senator Harkin has just articulated, that is, we are not going to balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, on the backs of disabled veterans, on the backs of those people who are already, in the midst of this terrible recession, hurting so much.  As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, let me make it very clear that I will do everything I can to make sure we are not balancing the budget on the backs of disabled veterans, men and women who have lost their arms, their legs, and their eyesight defending this country. That is morally unacceptable.  The chained CPI--and this is an important point to make. Sometimes you hear the crescendo inside the beltway, and all of the lobbyists talking: This is the right way to go. But as Senator Harkin mentioned, go across America, from Iowa to Vermont, California to Maine, the American people are saying in poll after poll: No, do not cut Social Security. Do not cut benefits for disabled vets.  The organizations that represent tens of millions of people are saying the same thing. The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the Gold Star Wives, the Disabled American Veterans, they are on record--and I have submitted their testimony into the Congressional Record--they are in opposition to this chained CPI.  But it is not just veterans organizations. The chained CPI is opposed by every major senior citizens group in this country--the AARP, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the Alliance of Retired Americans, and other groups. The chained CPI is opposed by every major trade union in America, including the AFL-CIO. The chained CPI is opposed by every major disability group in the country. It is opposed by the National Organization for Women because they understand that cutting Social Security impacts women more than it does men.  Maybe once in a while the Senate might want to listen to ordinary Americans, people who do not have well-paid lobbyists, people who do not own the local newspapers, and do what is right for the American people. There aresome who believe that lowering cost-of-living adjustments, COLAs, through the adoption of a so-called chained CPI would be a minor tweak in benefits, hardly worth discussing.  But let's be clear. For millions of disabled veterans and seniors living on fixed incomes, the chained CPI is not a minor tweak. It is a significant benefit cut that will make it harder for permanently disabled veterans and the elderly to feed their families, heat their homes, pay for their prescription drugs, and make ends meet. This misguided proposal must be vigorously opposed.  What I find truly disturbing is that folks such as Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and my Republican colleagues who refer to the chained CPI as ``a more accurate measure of inflation.'' That is their argument.  Senator Harkin, when I speak to seniors in Vermont and I tell them there are some people in Washington who think the current COLAs are too generous, do you know what invariably happens? They start laughing. They should laugh. Two out of the last 4 years they got zero. I think the last COLA was 1.7 percent. There are some in Washington who think that is too generous.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement from 250 Ph.D. economists and 50 social insurance experts who wrote:       No empirical basis for reducing the Social Security COLA.  No empirical basis.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Economist and Social Insurance Expert Statement on Social Security COLA        No empirical basis for reducing the Social Security COLA       November 20, 2012--250 Ph.D. economists and more than 50      social insurance experts with doctorates in related fields      oppose proposals to reduce the Social Security cost-of-living      adjustment by tying it to an index (the chained CPI-U) that      does not reflect the spending patterns of beneficiaries.       As economists and social insurance experts, we agree that      the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)      should be based on the most accurate measure possible of the      impact of inflation on beneficiaries. For this reason, we      oppose proposals to reduce the Social Security COLA by tying      it to a chained consumer price index that does not directly      measure the actual expenditures of beneficiaries. Such a move      would lower the COLA by an estimated 0.3 percentage points      per year, translating into a 3 percent benefit cut after 10      years and a 6 percent cut after 20 years. The oldest      beneficiaries, who are often the poorest beneficiaries, and      persons receiving disability benefits for more than 20 years      would see even larger cuts over time.       Arguments in favor of reducing the COLA are premised on the      assumption that the current COLA overcorrects for inflation.      However, it is just as likely that the current COLA fails to      keep up with rising costs confronting elderly and disabled      beneficiaries. For historical reasons, the current COLA is      based on a consumer price index for workers, excluding      retirees and other Social Security recipients who are not in      the labor force. It and other indices based on the spending      patterns of workers or the general population likely      understate the impact of cost increases faced by Social      Security beneficiaries because seniors and disabled people      spend a greater share of their incomes on out-of-pocket      medical expenses than do other consumers, and health costs      have risen faster than overall inflation in recent decades.       A chained price index is supposed to more fully reflect the      ability of consumers to substitute cheaper goods and services      in response to price changes. Whether or not such      substitution preserves consumers' standards of living,      different consumers have varying ability to make such      adjustments. Since elderly and disabled people spend a      greater share of their incomes on necessities such as health      care, rent, and utilities, and since this population is also      less mobile, a chained COLA based on the spending patterns of      workers or the general population may overestimate the      ability of Social Security beneficiaries to take advantage of      cheaper substitutes.       The actual spending patterns of Social Security      beneficiaries have not been comprehensively studied. However,      an experimental index computed by the Bureau of Labor      Statistics suggests that the current COLA may not keep up      with seniors' costs of living. Until direct evidence is      gathered, there is no empirical basis for reducing the Social      Security COLA, which could exacerbate, rather than correct,      an existing problem.  MR. SANDERS. This is what these 250 economists write:  As economists and social insurance experts, we agree that the annual Social Security cost of living adjustment should be based on the most accurate measure possible of the impact of inflation on beneficiaries. For this reason, we oppose proposals to reduce the Social Security COLA by tying it to a chained consumer price index. Arguments in favor of reducing the COLA are premised on the assumption that current COLA overcorrects for inflation. However, it is just as likely that the current COLA fails to keep up with rising costs confronting elderly and disabled beneficiaries.  The reason for that is pretty clear. If you are a senior citizen or disabled vet, the likelihood is you are not buying iPads or flat-screen TVs or other types of things such as that. What are you buying? You are buying health care, you are buying prescription drugs, you are trying to heat your home. For seniors' purchasing habits, in many ways inflation has been higher, not lower, than general inflation. Senator Harkin made reference to this.  Let's be very clear. There are millions and millions of seniors who are economically struggling, struggling to keep their heads above water to buy the prescription drugs they need, to pay for the health care costs they need, to keep their homes warm in States such as Vermont or Iowa in the winter.  Nearly one-quarter of seniors depend on Social Security benefits for 100 percent of their income. Two-thirds depend on Social Security for a majority of their income. We are talking, and I hear from the White House and elsewhere, they are going to protect the poorest of the poor. Well, to my mind, when someone in Vermont is trying to get by on $15,000 a year, that person needs protection. Anyone who thinks that is a lot of money clearly does not have any sense of what is going on in the real world.  According to the Social Security Administration, under the administration's chained CPI proposal, average 65-year-old retirees would lose $658 a year in Social Security benefits by their 75th birthday, a cumulative loss of over $4,500. Once again, I understand that people here go for lunch, take a few friends out, you can spend $600. But for senior citizens struggling on $14,000 or $15,000 a year, $658 dollars is a lot of money and means the loss, if you do not have that money, of a very basic need.  For veterans, if we go in the route of the chained CPI, disability benefits for veterans at age 30, they would have their benefits reduced by $1,425 a year; at age 45, $2,300 a year; at age 55, $3,200 a year; at age 65, benefits for surviving spouses, the wives who lost their husbands in Iraq and Afghanistan, and their kids would also be cut.  I think as a Senate, as a Congress, we should take a deep, deep breath, if we think we should be balancing the budget on those people who have already given so much to this country.  Let me conclude by again making the point Senator Harkin so ably made. Many of us want to make sure Social Security is strong not just for the next 20 years in which it can pay out all benefits but for the next 75 years. The way to do that is not to cut benefits; the way to do that is exactly as Senator Harkin and I and many other people have suggested--that is, understanding that there is something absurd when somebody who makes $5 million a year contributes the same exact amount of money into the Social Security trust fund as somebody who makes $113,000 a year.  There are different ways to approach that issue, but by lifting the cap--and do it one way or the other--we can make Social Security solvent for the next 75 years for our kids and for our grandchildren.  The last point--and Senator Harkin has been a leader on this issue--pointing out about how many Americans have lost their pensions. We are probably in worse shape than at any time in modern history for the average person to go into retirement. Social Security is and has been the pillar for those people. They have lost their pensions, and their 401(k)s have also been troubled. Social Security has been there for the last 75-plus years in good times and bad times. It paid out every nickel owed to every eligible American.  People are nervous about their retirements. Let's stand united and say we are not going to cut Social Security benefits for seniors or disabled vets. There are other ways to go forward and make sure Social Security is strong for the next 75 years.  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.
