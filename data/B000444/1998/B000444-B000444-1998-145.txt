 And now he is telling us that it violates the budget because we passed on this floor what he asked us to do.  I want to tell you, I find that incredibly fascinating. I don't find it unusual, I find it fascinating. I have to get this straight. Here is my question, and I will not object if I get an answer: Is one of the reasons why the Republican leader will argue that this is a violation of the budget agreement the fact that this bill now contains a tax expenditure of tens of billions of dollars to correct the marriage penalty, which all the Republicans voted for and told us we had to have? Is that one of the reasons why we violate the Budget Act? I ask that as a question of my friend.
