This ought to be a bipartisan bill. Mr. Peterson wants it to be a bipartisan bill and many of our people and, as a matter of fact, a majority of our people supported it in committee.  I think the chairman wants it to be a bipartisan bill. I understand he has to deal within the framework of his caucus like every chairman has to do on either side of the aisle. I understand that. But it is a shame.  A bill that ought to be bringing us together for people who provide this country with food and fiber and, indeed, provide a lot of the world with food and fiber, that we have put this almost poison pill--I don't know whether it's going to be a poison pill--but almost poison pill in it, I regret that. It's not worthy of our country. It's not worthy of the morals of this Nation.  But I thank the chairman and I thank the ranking member for their efforts to try to bring us together. Whether they've done so or not, we'll have to see.
