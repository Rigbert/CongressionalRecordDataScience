Chairman, I yield one minute to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. McIntyre].  Mr. McINTYRE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the gentleman from New Mexico [Mr. Skeen], the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture Appropriations, if he would engage me in a colloquy.  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that the sum of approximately $24 million has been appropriated to the Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of implementing new regulations concerning tobacco sales to minors. In light of the fact this funding represents a $20 million increase over similar funding in the prior fiscal year budget, I would ask the chairman if it is his understanding and the understanding of those on the committee that none of this funding is to be used to monitor or regulate the growing, cultivating, or use of raw tobacco?
