 What this bill does is cut funding that States, schools, parents, youth and children were assured of last September.  And these cuts are not going to reduce the deficit, but will go to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.  In the middle of the year, Congress is taking away funds that States are using to implement major reforms to improve our children's education.  Taking away funds from towns that have already set their school budgets for the year.  Taking away funds from programs that bring local police to work in schools to prevent drug use.  Taking away from parents that are counting on child care so that they can go to work.  Taking away from AmeriCorps participants and the communities that they work in around the country.  This bill has brought our communities to a screeching halt. I question the logic of cutting these programs now; 6 months after the fact.  I support efforts to restore funding to important education programs for disadvantaged children, programs which are designed to prevent drug use and create a safe school environment, education reform, Head Start, child care, AmeriCorps, and other programs that educate and invest in America's children and families.  Decisions to cut these programs are based solely on shortsighted politics.  The sad thing is that the House has made it clear that cuts in these programs are not going to deficit reduction.  Instead, the cuts we are making today in programs that give children the skills to compete in the next century are going to pay for tax cuts for the walthy. In fact, the wealthiest 12 percent of Americans would receive over half of the benefits under the House proposed tax cuts.  I hope that we will be able to restore logic and common sense to the cuts we are making in this bill.
