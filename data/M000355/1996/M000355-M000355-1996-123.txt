 President, there is going to be further debate on this amendment. But it is my plan, when Senator Cohen has completed, if there are no other speakers at this moment, to lay this amendment aside. I understand Senator Smith is ready to offer an amendment that he will need a rollcall vote on. We will move to the Smith amendment.
