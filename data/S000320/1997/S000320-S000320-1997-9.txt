 President, I rise today to honor Dr. Joseph Barry Mason, the Dean of the College of Commerce at my alma mater, The University of Alabama, in my hometown of Tuscaloosa. Dean Mason is a remarkable man, a distinguished educator and a good friend.  Joseph Barry Mason received his undergraduate degree from the Louisiana Tech University College of Administration and Business. Upon receiving his Ph.D. in marketing from The University of Alabama in 1967, Dr. Mason joined the faculty of The University and, since that time, he has served that institution with distinction. During his tenure, Dr. Mason has served as the Chairman of the College of Commerce Department of Management and Marketing, and since 1988, as the Dean of the College of Commerce and the Russell Professor of Business Administration.  Dr. Mason's professional associations extend beyond the campus of The University. He is a former chairman of the board of the American Marketing Association and the 1976 Beta Gamma Sigma National Scholar.  Further, in 1984 Dr. Mason served as the Chairman of the UA Task Force on Cost Savings. In that capacity, Dr. Mason worked with the General Motors Rochester Products Plant and the United Auto Workers in Tuscaloosa in order to identify cost savings and prevent the closure of the 200-employee facility. As a result of his successful efforts, the groundwork for future academic-industrial partnerships was laid.  For his excellence in education, Dr. Mason has received numerous distinguished awards. Dr. Mason received the Leavey Award for Excellence in Private Enterprise Education from the Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge, PA. In 1986, he was named the first annual recipient of the Academy of Marketing Science Outstanding Educator of the Year Award. And in 1994, Dean Mason was designated a Distinguished Fellow of the Academy of Marketing Science.  At various points in his career, The University has honored Dean Mason, as well. For bringing distinctive credit to the academic community, Dean Mason was awarded the John F. Burnman Distinguished Faculty Award and The University of Alabama National Alumni Association Outstanding Commitment to Teaching Award.  Recently, Dean Mason was honored by Louisiana Tech University as its 1997 Distinguished Alumnus. As many of my colleagues know, on Saturday, November 1, 1997, The University of Alabama will play Louisiana Tech at our Homecoming Football game.  On that day, Dean Mason, loved and respected by all who have known him, will be honored as a friend and leader to not only The University of Alabama, but also to Louisiana Tech. On this day, on behalf of my wife, Annette, we wish Joseph Barry Mason our sincerest thanks and congratulations for his dedication to making a difference.                          ____________________
