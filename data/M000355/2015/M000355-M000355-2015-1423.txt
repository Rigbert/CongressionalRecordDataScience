 President, yesterday, we were reminded yet again of Iran's determination to use every element of national power to expand its sphere of influence and undermine international law.  What we saw in the Strait of Hormuz simply underlines the danger posed by Iran, along with the pressing need for a clear-eyed understanding of the Iranian threat.  It is appropriate, then, that the Senate will resume consideration of the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act later today. I encourage Members to come to the floor, offer amendments, and work with the floor managers to schedule votes.  We have voted on one amendment to this bipartisan bill. I am sure we will take votes on several more significant amendments before the week is over.                          ____________________
