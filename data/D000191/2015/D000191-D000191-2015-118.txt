Chairman, there are three preemption sections in this bill: one prohibits States from labeling GMOs; another establishes something for a label called ``natural,'' which will contain GMOs and can contain GMOs and still be labeled ``natural''; and thenfinally, a very poorly written big section that seems to preempt all State regulations and tribal regulations.  The Navajo Nation has a ban on the cultivation of genetically modified crops. They are trying to preserve their indigenous crops.  States have provided for buffer zones in 30 States. This bill, I believe, will preempt those 30 States from establishing buffer zones to protect conventional crops.  We had conventional wheat in Oregon that was banned from export because of GMO pollution--conventional wheat, let alone organic wheat, which would be worthless if it had GMO pollution.  So in this bill I had an amendment to clarify this section and say, no, no, no, not preempting State Departments of Agriculture establishing reasonable rules to protect conventional and organic farmers from preemption. They say they fixed it. I don't believe they have. That part of the bill is very vague. This, I believe, could both preempt tribal sovereign entity, State sovereign entity, and reasonable regulations to protect other farmers.
