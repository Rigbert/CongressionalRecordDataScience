. 6003, rollcall 400, I would have voted ``yes'' on the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act as I have fully supported its intent and worked with the distinguished chairman, Mr. Oberstar, to include the Cleveland-Toledo-Chicago Corridor in that bill, and as a member of the Transportation Housing Subcommittee of Appropriations with responsibility for funding the effort. However, at the time of the vote, after voting ``no'' on the prior motion to recommit, when that vote was held open for 15 minutes I left the Chamber to locate 226 high school students from Timber Stone Junior High School in my district, who were nowhere to be found on either the east or west side of the Capitol. When I came back to the floor, the vote had been reduced to 5 minutes and I was not able to record my final vote as ``yes'' on the final vote. I wanted to place that on the Record.                          ____________________
