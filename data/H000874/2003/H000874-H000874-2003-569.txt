Speaker, it's with great regret that I come to the floor today to note the untimely passing on October 22 of Corinne Michel, a friend of so many of us privileged to serve in this House, and the wife of former House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois.  As Mike Johnson, a former Chief of Staff for Bob Michel, told Copley News Service: ``[Corinne] was never affected by all the limelight. Bob used to say people in politics have their feet planted in midair. Hers were always planted firmly on the ground.''  And as Millie Arends, the city treasurer in the Michel's home city of Peoria, Illinois, noted: ``She was well-read on everything. Her husband said she was one his best assets.''  Corinne Michel was born in Onida, South Dakota, and was raised in St. Paul, Minnesota, Pittsburgh and Peoria, Illinois, where her father managed the Livestock Market News. In 1943, she graduated from Peoria High School, and then met Bob when the two sang in the a cappella choir at Bradley University.  Corinne was an accomplished classical pianist who graduated with two music degrees and then taught music in the Peoria public schools. In 1948, the Michels were married and eight years later Bob was elected to the House, where he served with distinction for 38 years--including 14 as the Republican leader--before retiring in 1995.  While Bob served his constituents and nation in Washington, Corinne raised the couple's four children back in Peoria. She was active in Peoria Players and Central Illinois Youth Symphony and helped bring opera and ballet to Peoria. She also represented Bob at events in his home District.  In Washington, she was active in Congressional spouse organizations and chaired the Republican Women's Federal Forum.  The Michels' son Scott told the Chicago Tribune: ``Music played a huge role in her [his mother's] life and she passed it on [to her children]. I would come home from school and there would be classical music on the stereo and she would be playing the piano.''  And said our colleague Ray LaHood, a former Chief of Staff for Leader Michel and the successor in his seat, said: ``She was one of the loveliest persons I have ever met.'' A sentiment that all who knew her shared.  He continued: ``She never sought the limelight . . . but her husband sought her advice and she gave it to him in her own quiet way.''  Mr. Speaker, I want to extend my sincerest condolences to my friend, the former Republican Leader, who not only is a great credit to this institution but also an American of unquestioned patriotism and courage.  Bob Michel, who was wounded as an infantryman in World War II and received two Bronze Stars, the Purple Heart and four battle stars, laid his life on the line so that succeeding generations could experience the freedoms that we enjoy--and too often take for granted--today.  Let's recognize today that while Bob Michel soared to great heights throughout his career, he always had a steady, able partner on that journey--his beloved wife, Corinne, whose loss we mourn today.  I also want to express my condolences to the Michels' sons, Scott, Bruce and Robin; daughter, Laurie; and three grandsons. Our thoughts and prayers are with them.                          ____________________
