President, let me first commend my colleague from Texas. We sit on opposite sides of the aisle, but there are many things that bring us together, and I certainly support what he has said about the impact of human trafficking.  In a hearing before the subcommittee on the Constitution, which he now chairs, during this session of Congress, we brought in law enforcement victims and talked about some of the outrageous things which are occurring in exploiting young people, particularly young women. One of the points which my colleague has made, and I have listened carefully, is that we should consider these human trafficking victims as victims.  Many times, sadly in the past, they have been prosecuted as if they were complicit, and many times they are children. They have no knowledge of their rights or obligations and are being exploited and, as a consequence, they are very reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement if they feel they too might end up in jail, having been victimized twice in the process.  I thank him for his leadership and I look forward to looking closely at his legislation and I hope we can work closely together on that.                            Amendment No. 67  Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a pending amendment which troubles me. I don't know if there will be much time for debate should we actually consider this amendment, and I want to make my feelings a matter of public record.  This is amendment No. 67 offered by Senator Sullivan. This amendment would require--would require--the disarming of Federal law enforcement officers who work for the Environmental Protection Agency.  There are currently about 180 law enforcement agents working for the Environmental Protection Agency. They are trained professional officers and are tasked with investigating and enforcing our Nation's environmental laws. They conduct investigations, execute warrants, and make arrests for misdemeanors and felonies under the laws of the Environmental Protection Agency.  This is law enforcement work and it is dangerous work. Many times these officers face the same threats as all law enforcement officers face. According to the Bureau of Justice statistics, there are 73 Federal agencies with law enforcement officers, ranging from the FBI to the Food and Drug Administration and NASA.  EPA's criminal investigators were given law enforcement powers in a law signed by President Reagan in 1988. President Reagan stated his administration actively sought this authority and he was pleased to sign it into law.  The amendment No. 67 of Senator Sullivan would prevent these EPA law enforcement officers from being armed while they are carrying out their law enforcement responsibilities. A lot of what these EPA agents do is to investigate suspected cases of illegal dumping of hazardous materials. This can lead to dangerous confrontations. The EPA reports its agents have frequently encountered weapons and armed individuals when they have conducted their work.  I took a look at some of these cases. Many people mistakenly believe the Environmental Protection Agency is a group of government employees sitting behind desks and computers in Washington and regional offices who don't get out and about to see the actual violations that are taking place. They are mistaken.  Let me give a few examples for the record. In Marathon, FL, EPA special agents, along with local sheriff's deputies, shot and arrested Larkin Baggett, a Federal fugitive from Utah, after he pointed an assault rifle at them. Baggett was initially arrested by the EPA on pollution-related crimes in the State of Utah. During the initial arrest of Mr. Baggett, a knife and handgun were recovered off his person. Mr. Baggett was considered armed and dangerous due to the amount of firepower he had in his possession.  Firearms recovered from Mr. Baggett included an AR-10 assault rival, a 12-gauge shotgun, several rifles and handguns, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Mr. Baggett was ultimately sentenced to 13 years in prison for his assault conviction and his environmental crimes conviction.  The Sullivan amendment would say the environmental officer who was trying to arrest this man had to be disarmed. In other words, the environmental law enforcement officer would have no firearm while Mr. Baggett would be holding an arsenal. That is what the Sullivan amendment would do.  During a Mississippi search warrant, seven handguns and a sawed-off pistol-grip shotgun were secured during the warrant. During that same warrant, two handguns were removed from the sweatshirt pocket and hip holster from one subject. Another handgun was removed from the purse of another subject. The sawed-off pistol-grip shotgun was found stored in the cavity of a desk where a drawer was removed and the weapon was pointed directly at the agents of the Environmental Protection Agency when they entered.  If you read the amendment offered by Senator Sullivan, he has removed the ability and right of these agents to be armed to protect themselves and to enforce the law, but he continues to require them to do the most basic things under the law. He requires them--continues to require them--to execute andserve any warrant or other process unarmed. He continues to require them under the statute to make arrests without warrant for any offense against the United States, including felonies. Under the Sullivan amendment they are to do so unarmed.  I can go through a lengthy list here of real-life circumstances where people working for the Environmental Protection Agency literally risked their lives, and they did it at least with the comfort of being trained professional law enforcement officers equipped with firearms to protect themselves and enforce the laws of the United States.  Senator Sullivan wants them to enforce the laws, but he doesn't want them to carry a firearm. That to me is ridiculous. In fact, it is dangerous. It is dangerous to send these men and women with the responsibility of doing their job into circumstances where they could literally lose their lives because of the Sullivan amendment.  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated January 24, 2015, signed by Jon Adler, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Federal Law Enforcement                                         Officers Association,                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2015.     Hon. Richard Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the 27,000 members of the      Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA), I am      writing to express our strong opposition to the misguided      ``Keystone'' amendment put forth by Senator Sullivan that      calls for the disarming of EPA Criminal Investigators.       EPA-CID currently employs approximately 180 sworn Criminal      Investigators, all of whom have completed the mandatory      Criminal Investigator Training Program at the Federal Law      Enforcement Training Center. These highly trained law      enforcement officers complete the same basic academy training      as their counterparts at the U.S. Marshals Service, the      Secret Service, NCIS, ICE and other credible federal law      enforcement agencies. They receive quarterly tactical      training to ensure firearms proficiency, defensive tactics      capability, and enforcement operation readiness. They should      not be denigrated and belittled like some Barney Fife      aberration gone wild.       Unfortunately, Senator Sullivan has opted to employ      inflammatory language to mischaracterize EPA-CID 's execution      of court-issued search warrants as stampede-styled ``raids.''      EPA Criminal Investigators employ proper law enforcement      tactics and techniques, while wearing the appropriate      protective equipment during field work. They issue proper      verbal commands, and do not scream ``Charge!'' like some      reckless group of bandits. Contrary to Senator Sullivan's      alarmist assertions, EPA Criminal Investigators invoke a      proper command presence in order to protect their safety as      well as those around them.       While Senator Sullivan seeks to minimize the law      enforcement relevance of the EPA-CID mission, it is important      to note that the Criminal Investigators enforce the criminal      statutes of the United States Code, and investigate alleged      violations of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the      Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. If Senator Sullivan      takes exception to a particular statute, he should focus on      amending the law and not disarming and jeopardizing the      safety of those who risk their lives to enforce it.      Furthermore, he should respect the fact that there are      criminals who knowingly and willfully harm our environment,      and EPA Criminal Investigator's expertise is needed to      investigate and apprehend these criminals.       Recent current events, both domestic and abroad, have made      clear that terrorist groups are targeting law enforcement      officers. In New York City, a lone-wolf terrorist      assassinated two heroic NYPD Police Officers. In France, a      terrorist cell brutally murdered three law enforcement      officers, as well as civilians. So how does Senator Sullivan      come to any rational conclusion that it's appropriate to      disarm law enforcement officers who are protecting our      homeland? Perhaps Senator Sullivan is unaware of terrorists'      intent to deploy biological, chemical and radiological      weapons to harm our citizenry and institutions? EPA Criminal      Investigators are an integral, indispensable component of our      homeland defense against such attacks. Does Senator Sullivan      maintain in good faith that EPA Criminal Investigators should      conduct their criminal investigations unarmed in support of      the FBI Joint Terrorist Task Force?       Each cabinet entity has an Inspector General's office that      employs highly trained Criminal Investigators to investigate      allegations of excessive force or misconduct. This includes      the EPA. In reaching his ill-advised conclusion to disarm EPA      Criminal Investigators, did Senator Sullivan draw upon any      Inspector General report to substantiate his position? While      there is no evidence to suggest any widespread incidents of      excessive force or misconduct by EPA Criminal Investigators,      a reasonable person is left to question the rational      motivation of Senator Sullivan's amendment.       In closing, I reference a statement a FLEOA member who      serves honorably as a Criminal Investigator with EPA: ``We      conduct search warrants, arrest warrants, and interviews      which brings us into contact with individuals who may be      armed or have access to weapons. There is no way we can      accomplish our mission safely without a means to protect      ourselves.''           Respectfully submitted,                                                        Jon Adler.
