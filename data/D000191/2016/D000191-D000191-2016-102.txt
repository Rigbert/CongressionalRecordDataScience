  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, so-called flags of convenience have decimated the U.S. maritime industry to a tiny fraction of its former size. It is a system where owners chase the cheapest, most exploitable labor, and the least regulation around the world.  Now the Department of Transportation under the Obama administration, in its infinite wisdom, wants to bring that system to aviation. Won't that be great when we are all flying in planes with crews coming out of Indonesia or India or somewhere else where they can be exploited, paid less, and maybe have kind of questionable credentials.  Actually, they are issuing pilot certificates in India to people who have never ever flown a plane. That will just be dandy. But, hey, the tickets will be cheap. You might not get there, but you paid less to get on.  This is absolutely absurd. We have the safest and best system of aviation in the world with our proud domestic airlines. Their employees get decent wages, we fly safe, and we want to now go to flags of convenience?  They are ignoring the clear language of the Open Skies Agreement in making this decision. No to the Obama administration.                          ____________________
