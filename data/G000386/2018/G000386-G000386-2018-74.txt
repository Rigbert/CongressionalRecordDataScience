 President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute to an outstanding businessman and citizen John G. Deery, Sr., of Cedar Falls, IA. Mr. Deery passed away recently at the age of 88. He leaves behind a close-knit and loving family--his beloved wife, Marlene; his two sons, John and Dan, both of Cedar Falls, IA; and a host of children and great-grandchildren, nieces and nephews.  A veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, John was an active parishioner of St. Patrick Catholic Church and a respected civic and business leader who left his mark throughout Cedar Valley. Following his military service--1948/ 1951--and startup ventures in the Quad Cities and Wisconsin, John purchased a Buick dealership in the late 1960s in Cedar Falls. This Wisconsin native became an Iowa transplant and never looked back. From then on, he and his family business paved a road to prosperity by winning the business of generations of satisfied customers.  A look back through the rearview mirror shows a life well lived. He was a member of the Cedar Falls AMVETS Post 49, Iowa Auto Dealers Association, Knights of Columbus, and a founding father of Community National Bank.  The patriarch of the family, John carved out his slice of the American dream. After opening the Buick dealership, the business eventually grew into a series of enterprises, eventually employing a workforce of more than 200 people. For six decades, he owned the Deery Automotive Group, encompassing John Deery Motors, Dan Deery Motors, and Deery Brothers Collision Center that provided livelihoods for generations of local families and a trusted place to buy and repair the family car.  After turning the reins of the automobile business over to the next generation, John launched yet another successful enterprise in real estate development. An active octogenarian, John didn't let any grass grow underneath his feet and continued looking for ways to make his community a better place to live. A decade ago, he was nominated for the Waterloo Courier's inaugural Eight Over Eighty Award.  The residents of Cedar Valley have benefited from John and Marlene's generous commitment to giving back their time, talent, and treasure. A number of nonprofit agencies and community organizations have benefited from their philanthropic pursuits, including my alma mater, the University of Northern Iowa, the Black Hawk County Sheriff's Office, the Cedar Falls and Waterloo police departments, St. Patrick Catholic Church and School, and El Kahir Shrine.  Today I pay my respects to this American veteran, successful Iowan, and civic leader. John Deery, Sr., steered a steady and honorable journey on the road of life and he will be greatly missed by those who loved him the most.                          ____________________
