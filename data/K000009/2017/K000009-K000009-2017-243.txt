Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Mrs. Desiree Langston Carn, a revered member of our Toledo community. Mrs. Carn passed from this life on June 26, 2017 surrounded by her family.  Desiree Langston Carn graduated from Jesup W. Scott High School in 1973 and earned her Bachelor's Degree from the Ohio State University and a Master's Degree from Bowling Green State University in guidance and counseling.  She served the Toledo community and touched the lives of countless students as a Counselor, retiring after 34 years from the Toledo Board of Education. Her compassion, her smile, and her words of wisdom guided many young people on paths forward.  Desiree had a beautiful voice which she used in worship at Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church in Toledo. So special was her gift, that a citywide musical celebration was held at the church as part of her homegoing.  Desiree leaves to cherish her memory her husband, Ernest Carn, Jr., her sons Jamal and Jasyn, her five grandchildren, her mother, Elzena Langston, her brother Calvin Thompson, her sister Antoinette Langston, and many loving relatives. We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of what Desiree had meant to each of the people who shared in her life.  Psalm 59: 16-17 sings, ``But as for me, I shall sing of Your strength; Yes, I shall joyfully sing of Your loving kindness in the morning, For You have been my stronghold and a refuge in the day of my distress. O my strength, I will sing praises to You; For God is my stronghold, the God who shows me loving kindness.'' Desiree Langston Carn shared this message through her angelic voice. Now she joins the Angels in song.  Desiree led a full life and gave so much to all those who knew her. Her legacy grows in the wisdom she shared and the hope she inspired in the young people she counseled. Her voice still shines as it is carried forth.                          ____________________
