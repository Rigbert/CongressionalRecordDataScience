President, I want to reiterate what I said before about Senator Murkowski and Senator Begich for their support of this woman for the Ninth Circuit. I appreciate the work they have done on this nomination. I also appreciate the personal comments the senior Senator from Alaska made, going back to her law school days. I think sometimes we forget that these judicial nominees are real people and they have a real life and are a real part of the community. So I appreciate that.  I yield back the remainder of the time on our side.
