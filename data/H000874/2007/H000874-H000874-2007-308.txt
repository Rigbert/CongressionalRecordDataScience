Speaker, I want to inform the House of what I perceive to be the schedule for the coming balance of the week.  It is our intention to go until 1 o'clock tonight on debate only. We will roll votes. There will be no further votes. I've talked to the leadership on the other side. There will be no votes for the balance of the evening.  It is my expectation, barring some unforeseen action in conferences, that we will conclude this bill tomorrow, hopefully, with the consideration of all Members, relatively early, in the late afternoon. And that would conclude the week's business if we don't have any conference reports.  Now, I want to make it clear, should the unforeseen happen in the conference, there are a couple of conferences pending, if they move, that would change. I don't expect that to be the case, but I want everybody to understand that we do have some conferences that may go forward. I doubt that they would be in shape to come here, but if they did, that would change.  But presently, Mr. Speaker, I believe the schedule would be we go until 1 o'clock, debate amendments, offer amendments. Those amendments that called for votes would be rolled until tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. We would vote on those. And then we would complete the bill and be complete for the week and take leave for the July work period at that point in time.                          ____________________
