Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, what I told Roll Call, and what I repeat now, is that we are not whining. We are reminding our Republican colleagues, who said when they were in minority, that fairness was one-third of the resources of the committees. We are now reminding them of their statement and saying, if they want fairness, do fairness. Do it tonight.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), ranking member of the Committee on Small Business.
