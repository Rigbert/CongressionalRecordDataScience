Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Arizona is, in my opinion, one of the most decent, hard-working Members of the House, and he is continually. Because this is a difficult bill to handle, plays in very difficult situations, and I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his bipartisanship in handling this bill.  I also want to join him in congratulating the staff at the beginning of my remarks. He mentioned, and I will mention them again because that deserves such: the Chief Clerk of our committee, Michele Mrdeza, with whom I have had the opportunity to work for 7 years now, Bob Schmidt, Jeff Ashford, Tammy Hughes, Frank Larkin and Jason Isaac who is, although not on the committee staff like Cory Alexander of my personal staff, of my leadership staff, a critical component of the consideration of this bill, and Pat Schlueter and Kim Weaver, who work respectively for the committee and for the Committee on Appropriations' associate staff.  Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by saying that this bill in many respects is a very good bill given the fiscal constraints that confront the Committee on Appropriations. This subcommittee's commitment of over $4 billion tothe Treasury's very important law enforcement activity is present in this bill. Almost one-third of the $13.2 billion in discretionary budget authority in this bill is targeted at law enforcement.  I am pleased that the bill fully funds the President's request for the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative. The $27 million program is an important part of the administration's overall strategy to curb youth violence. This administration has been successful in presenting to the American public in its first term a program to reduce crime in America. The good news is they have been successful.                              {time}  2145  This bill will continue that progress. This bill funds antidrug activities totaling over $1.8 billion. Over $400 million is provided to the drug czar for a variety of drug-fighting efforts, including $162 million for the very successful high-intensity drug trafficking areas.  I am pleased that we are able to maintain IRS funding at a level that will enable Commissioner Rossotti to continue progress with reform.  I want to speak briefly of the changes that had been effected in IRS. Secretary Rubin and Deputy Secretary Sommer should be given great credit for rescuing the failing tax system's modernization program. They provided the needed high-level oversight for IRS to make a sharp turn in this computer systems area. They appointed a new chief computer systems officer who, after months of intense work, released a blueprint for technology modernization. This multibillion dollar program is now on the right track and it has been put on the right track by a bipartisan effort of this Congress and by the leadership and through the leadership of Secretary Rubin and Secretary Sommer and members of the IRS staff.  The appointment of Commissioner Rossotti was another clear change, Mr. Chairman, for IRS. Commissioner Rossotti is a tough-minded business manager. During his brief tenure, together with Secretary Rubin, IRS has improved customer service in a number of ways. Telephone access has been increased from 69 percent to 90 percent. Problem-solving days were instituted in all 33 IRS districts, allowing taxpayers to cut through the red tape and resolve difficult problems. National and local taxpayer advocates were established.  In addition to Treasury, this bill, Mr. Chairman, funds many smaller agencies, including Archives, OPM, GSA, the Federal Elections Commission and the Executive Office of the President. We will be talking about those agencies as we proceed through the markup of this bill. They are critically important agencies of our government; and, for the most part, we have tried to fund them so that they can perform their responsibilities as appointed by this Congress through legislation and as is expected by the American public.  For GSA, I am pleased that we are able to include money for absolutely essential courthouse construction projects. One of the reasons crime has gone down is because prosecutions are up, and we are processing criminals and letting them know that prosecution will be swift and sure. It is obvious that we need facilities to accomplish that objective.  I want to congratulate the gentleman from Arizona (Chairman Kolbe) because he disciplined our committee to taking the priorities of the Judicial Conference and the General Services Administration. These are not political choices. These are choices by the experts who know the needs and the abilities of the GSA to perform the responsibilities assigned to them by this Congress.  I remain concerned, however, about authorizing language for the FEC that would essentially establish term limits for the staff director and general counsel. I presume that will be struck, and I expect it to be struck.  Finally, I am pleased that this bill contains special emphasis in funding for solving the century date change problems with computers government-wide. We talked about that in the consideration of the rule. I hope that it stays in this bill. The chairman has pointed out it is a critical need, and our committee has responded to that need, not just on behalf of the agencies in our bill but the agencies throughout government.  As I pointed out in my opposition to the rule, which did not protect this, that was absolutely essential as we confront, as the chairman said, January 1 of the year 2000, because if we fail to solve this problem, not only will government shut down, not only will Medicare and Social Security be put at risk, not only will veterans benefits be put at risk, not only will the FAA, who controls our airplanes and our flight patterns and safety in the skies be at risk, but private commerce, which relies on the operations of government, will also be put at risk. I would hope, but do not expect, that we will protect that item.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank again the chairman and the staff for their work on this bill. We will see how it proceeds, and we will see what is left of the bill after the Members in this House or this House works its will on it within the framework of this unfortunate rule.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
