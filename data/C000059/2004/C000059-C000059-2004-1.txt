Speaker, I strongly support this Resolution and to recognize the Festival of Children Foundation for its valuable service to the Orange County and Southern California communities.  As my colleagues said, the Foundation is an umbrella group with the specific purpose to improve the lives of children and families. Sandy Segerstrom Daniels, the founder, has had the vision and commitment to create the Festival and the ability to bring together people and organizations devoted to children's issues.  Groups involved in the fields of health, education and the arts all collaborate in the Festival. Lectures, exhibits and information booths at South Coast Plaza take place for the entire month of September. I credit the Festival for increasing public awareness of children's issues and for providing opportunities for the public and non-profit organizations to donate their time and resources. I am told that over two million visitors have seen the Festival's exhibits in the past.  Because of the success of the Festival, the California State Assembly and the Orange County Board of Supervisors have taken official actions commending the Festival. I believe it is now fitting and timely for the U.S. Congress to also recognize the Festival of Children by this Resolution.  I encourage all my colleagues to support the Resolution and thank my colleague Dana Rohrabacher for presenting the Resolution.
