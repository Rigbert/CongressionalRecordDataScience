Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) control the remaining amount of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. Putnam). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska?  There was no objection.  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, how much time do we have left on our side?  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from New Jersey has 5\1/2\ minutes remaining.  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I want to thank Mr. King, Mr. Lungren, Mr. Oberstar, Mr. Thompson, all of those involved in helping to make this happen. I think it is a very good step in the right direction.  Mr. Chairman, it makes several additions to our Nation's maritime security program that enhances the law that we passed a couple of years ago. I am very pleased that the bill in the manager's amendment includes several provisions that I and Representative Pascrell from New Jersey worked on that will help enhance maritime security.  These provisions will amend the law to require American citizens to be in charge of security at each of our ports, require the Coast Guard to reexamine each port terminal security plan when the facility undergoes a change in ownership, and require the periodic reevaluation of security at foreign ports. This will also establish deadlines for the implementation of important maritime security programs that we included in the original bill, including the Transportation Worker Identification Credential program, which the Department has been woefully behind on.  It enhances identification credentials for foreign mariners calling on U.S. ports and also a long-range vessel tracking system to improve our awareness of activities.  These programs will dramatically enhance our ability to protect our ports, will help the Department, and help the Coast Guard. I want to again thank all of the Members responsible.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
