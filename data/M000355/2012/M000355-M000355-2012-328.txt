 Mr. Jimmy Lee Vance of Corbin, KY, encompassed every aspect of a tried and true entrepreneur, and he had the special quality of a generous heart.  Mr. Vance was a religious man who cherished the words of the ``red letters'' in the Bible, words spoken by Jesus Christ. Those who knew him believe he exemplified the attributes that those letters described, and that it was a creed of love, forgiveness, and grace by which he lived. Sadly, Jimmy Lee Vance left this world on December 20, 2011, due to complications from cancer. He was 70 years old.  Originally from Hart County, KY, Mr. Vance held an array of jobs before settling down in Corbin permanently. He served his country in the U.S. Navy, and later received a degree in accounting from Western Kentucky University on the GI bill. Jimmy took a job with the Internal Revenue Service's office in Louisville, KY, and then purchased a Corbin CPA firm, which he spent the next few years building up before eventually selling it to Ms. Mary Lynn Long. Next, Jimmy set his sights on the areas of real estate and business management, and in these fields he would make his greatest contribution to the Commonwealth.  Jimmy honed in on the area surrounding Interstate 75 near Corbin. He and his friends put a major effort into breaking new ground and building from the ground up. After years of planning and construction lead by Mr. Vance, Corbin's Exit 25 has become one of the most popular stops on I 75. The restaurants, movie theaters, shopping centers, and hotels just off of the exit bring in thousands of travelers each year, courtesy of Jimmy and his innovation and hard work.  Next came the billboards. Mr. Vance knew that in order to entice travelers to enter the city of Corbin, he had to let them know what was waiting for them. Jimmy was really the first man in the area to get into the billboard business. The billboards undeniably led to massive tourism in the area, and Jimmy knew this. It is amazing that advertising in its simplest form, along with Jimmy's innovative imagination and hard work could combine for such a home-run success for the area's economy.  Mr. Vance was instrumental in virtually every field of business in Corbin. He had help in large part from his wife Donna Barton, who was one of his best business assets. Together they owned and operated the Landmark Inn, and Donna was notorious for catering to the needs of all the Landmark Inn's guests. The couple's customer service was unmatched, and the family atmosphere they provided was an experience unlike any other to the people who would stay the night while traveling on I 75.  Along with hotels, Jimmy was responsible for bringing many different businesses to the area, which resulted in hundreds of new jobs for the residents of Corbin. But what truly stood out about Jimmy to the locals was his remarkable character. One Corbin-area leader said, ``Sometimes when Jimmy and I had lunch, someone would come up needing money for a meal or pay bills, and Jimmy without any fanfare gave them help. Those were things about Jimmy you didn't read in the papers.''  Jimmy Lee Vance was a humble servant of God, a beloved family man, anda dear friend to many. All of us could learn a thing or two from Jimmy. His moral code and business skills were an inspiration to young entrepreneurs of all types. He lit a fire inside them, and that is what true leadership is all about. Jimmy's life may have come to an end, but his legacy will continue to live on; he inspired others to do great things.  At this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in commemorating the life and times of Mr. Jimmy Lee Vance, a true American entrepreneur and philanthropist.  A news article was recently published in Corbin, Kentucky's own Times-Tribune newspaper, recognizing the achievements Mr. Vance made throughout his lifetime. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Times-Tribune, Feb. 13, 2012]            Jimmy Lee Vance--Remembrances of Jimmy Lee Vance            Born September 29, 1941--Died December 20, 2011       Jimmy Lee Vance was born in Hart County September 29, 1941,      and raised on a small farm by his parents, the late Lee      Walter and Eva Vance. He was preceded in death by his sister,      Norma Reed. He graduated from Canmer High School and served      in the U.S. Navy. He received an honorable discharge and used      a military G.I. Bill scholarship and graduated with a BS      degree in accounting from Western Kentucky University. Jimmy      and his first wife, Mildred, had two children: Jason Vance      (wife Kim) of Corbin, and daughter Kim (husband Shannon Rahn)      of Richmond Hill, Georgia. Jimmy later married Donna Barton      in 1990, and they were together until his death December 20.      He left two step-children, Amber Noell and Kari Moore, and      eight grandchildren, Erika Vance, Hunter Rahn, Wes Rahn, Lee      Vance, Jaci Beth Noell, Lauren Moore, Jaken Noell, and Ryan      Moore, and a sister, Virginia Patenaude and husband Pat of      Canmer, Kentucky.       Jimmy worked for the Internal Revenue Service's Louisville      office and later purchased Henry Martin's respected Corbin      CPA firm. Jimmy continued the growth of the business and      later sold it to Mary Lynn Long. Jimmy then focused his      attention on real estate and business development. He and his      partners transformed the land near Corbin's I 75 Exit 25 on      Cumberland Falls Highway. This is one of the most formidable      business areas off the I 75 Expressway, with the opportunity      for continued growth. He was a business leader willing to      take risks, with a vision of not just seeing how things are      now, but how they could become with initiative and      creativity.       A major Technology Center now managed by Corbin High School      was one of Corbin's first major operations built on land      Jimmy and his partners developed. Many meetings and training      sessions have been conducted in this facility, including      Chamber of Commerce luncheons, wedding receptions, and      political events which have brought many people to our area.      The Technology Center is impressive and will be a key asset      to our area for many years.       The Corbin Arena rests on top of a mountain facing across      Cumberland Falls Highway toward the Baptist Regional Medical      Center and west to I 75 Exit 25. This majestic entertainment      center would never have happened if Jimmy and his partners      and government leaders had not worked together to make it      possible. The location of the arena on top of the mountain,      right or wrong, can't be blamed on Jimmy. His group helped      make this location for the arena possible. The challenge in      making it a success rests on the shoulders of our local      leaders and all of us.       Many of us enjoy visiting Applebee's or Dino's or Fiesta      Mexicana for an enjoyable meal. Exit 25 has 40,000 cars and      trucks pass by each day on I 75, and many stop off to eat,      shop, buy gasoline, or stay in our motels. PT Pro's      attractive Therapy Center adorns this property developed by      Jimmy and his group. Several young business leaders such as      Darryl and Mark Lawson told me, ``Jimmy wasn't too busy to      give us good suggestions on real estate, or tax issues, or      good business ideas. He helped us so much.'' Sometimes when      Jimmy and I had lunch, someone would come up needing money      for a meal or pay bills, and Jimmy without any fanfare gave      them help. Those were things about Jimmy you didn't read in      the papers.       For years he and Donna owned and operated the Landmark Inn,      which has been a key place for many travelers to stop for      rest on tiring trips. A good Redhound buddy, Bob Coleman, who      passed away last year, often came to Corbin from Bristol to      see Redhound games and friends. Employees at Landmark took      good care of Bobby. Jimmy and his family also owned at one      time the Best Western Motel. Jimmy told me about Donna's      knowledge in handling business decisions. Donna has been a      valuable person in Jimmy's businesses program.       When Jimmy purchased the Holiday Inn in Williamsburg, he      had a billboard on the property. It wasn't long until Jimmy      was in the billboard business, and soon there were many      billboards in our area. We take for granted that people will      stop off the interstate and do business in our area. Jimmy's      billboards brought many travelers off the interstate to      businesses.       Jimmy purchased the Eagle Falls property, which could have      been a great addition for Cumberland Falls State Park. Jimmy      drove me on a tour of the Cumberland Falls State Park Camping      and Recreation Vehicle area, and it was running out of space.      Jimmy's property near the Falls area could have provided      additional space to enhance the ability of Cumberland Falls      to grow and offer more services. This dream of Jimmy's wasn't      completed. Jimmy focused attention on the fact that      Cumberland Falls State Park for years has not been promoted      and expanded into the type of great attraction it could be.      This beautiful and scenic place could become a major      attraction for a large segment of the eastern part of our      nation. It needs a golf course and some remodeling. Eighteen      Kentucky State Parks have golf courses, but the big one      closest to a highly travelled interstate highway, Cumberland      Falls State Park, has no golf course. Some of Jimmy's close      business partners have been Dr. Don Barton, David Myers,      Harold Huddleston, David Rossi, Boyce Worley, Darrell      Sanders, Becky Myers, and John Warren. Also included was the      late Dave Hudson, who was a special friend with Jimmy.       Today many of us enjoy seeing movies at the Tri-County      Cineplex, and Nelda Collings Barton, her daughter Suzie, and      son-in-law Greg Razmus built this impressive complex on a      site developed by Jimmy and his partners. Nelda and the      Razmus family are a valuable entrepreneur team that has been      so helpful in many ways to our community. It hurts when you      lose entrepreneurs in local communities and areas. They      create jobs in your own hometown. They help create other      small business leaders who learn from them and take on that      same spirit. Jimmy, Donnie Witt and I had lunch each month      and sometimes talked about the Bible. Jimmy said, ``I love      the `Red' Letters in the New Testament because they are a      simple message from Christ. They are words built on love,      forgiveness, and grace.''       Jimmy suffered a very damaging stroke in 2008, but with the      help of his family was soon back working on his projects.      Sometimes it was a struggle, but Jimmy kept going. A short      time prior to his death, tests determined he had an advance      problem with lung and bone cancer.       During Jimmy's last days in Baptist Regional Medical      Center, he was well cared for by the medical staff and his      family. Rev. Bobby Joe Eaton, Chaplain of the Medical Center,      ``ministered unto Jimmy with love and prayer.'' Bobby Joe is      a wonderful blessing in our community.       Each time I visited Jimmy in the hospital in his last days,      son Jason was by his side and Jimmy's daughter, Kim, came      from Savannah to be with him. Frequently Jimmy's handsome      red-headed grandson Lee was there giving support to his      grandpa. Soon after Jimmy's death, Donna had a liver      transplant and is recovering very well. The Barton family has      shown great courage these last years as they have dealt with      those difficult experiences in life we will all face at some      time. Joan Barton has been an inspiration to all of us as she      has recovered from a serious accident and has stood strong      with her husband Don and their family.       In closing, there is an old song that sometimes comes to      mind during times of sorrow and sadness. It is titled,      ``Jesus Walked this Lonesome Valley.'' The words of one verse      remind us of a journey we will face at the end of our lives      when we say goodbye to family and friends and cross over to a      new life with God.       ``We must walk that lonesome Valley,       We have to walk it by ourselves.       Oh, nobody else can walk it for us,       We have to walk it by ourselves.''       Our God walks that lonesome valley by our side and loved      ones and friends give us comfort and love as we depart. God      is with us as we begin our new life.                          ____________________
