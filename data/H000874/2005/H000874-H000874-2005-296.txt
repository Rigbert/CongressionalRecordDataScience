 Mr. DeLAY. I guess the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters) forgets or has a short memory. I think we came into special session to spend $10.5 billion just a few days after the disaster hit, came back the next week and spent $51 billion to go to immediate relief.  We have passed some six to eight bills in the last few days that directly affect people and their ability to get their lives back together. I do not think anybody, and certainly not this House, is dragging its feet on anything.  What the gentlewoman is talking about is a process that, frankly, will take months to get the money that we are talking about in order to build the houses that she wants; and being able to negotiate a few weeks or days to get this bill right and not get it wrong I think is very much the responsible way to proceed.
