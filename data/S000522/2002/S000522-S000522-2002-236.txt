Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to rise today to pay tribute to Elsie Bailey, a constituent of mine from Whiting, New Jersey, who was recently elected President of the American Legion Auxiliary.  Mr. Speaker, on August 28th, in Charlotte, North Carolina, Elsie Bailey was sworn in as President at the American Legion Auxiliary's 82nd National Convention. The American Legion Auxiliary is the world's largest women's patriotic service organization, with more than 10,500 units in every state and some foreign countries.  Founded in 1919, the Auxiliary consists of women whose husbands or other male relatives are members of the American Legion. The Auxiliary has over a million members today, including more than 15,000 in New Jersey, and operates hundreds of volunteer programs. Their dedicated and generous members provide thousands of hours of service to our Nation's veterans and to the communities in which they live. Through their efforts, millions of dollars have been raised to support veterans programs, as well as to support both national and local charities.  Mr. Speaker, I am especially proud of the fact that Elsie Bailey is the first woman fromNew Jersey in more than 75 years to serve as President of the Auxiliary. And the American Legion Auxiliary could not have found a more caring, compassionate and capable woman to lead them.  Elsie Bailey was born in Hillsborough, New Jersey, later lived in both Somerville and Bridgewater, and is now a resident of Whiting, in the heart of my congressional district. She worked for 23 years at the Somerset Medical Center, retiring as personnel director.  Throughout her life, Elsie has been active in her communities, having served on the Somerset County Teacher Credit Union, the Parent Teachers Association and the Employees Activities Committee. She is currently a volunteer mentor, a member of the Whiting Rescue Squad Auxiliary, and a parishioner of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church. But perhaps her proudest accomplishments are her two children and four grandchildren.  In 1961, Elsie Bailey joined the Stevenson-D'Alessio Auxiliary Unit 12 in Somerville, quickly becoming secretary of that unit. She has continued to serve in leadership roles at the unit, department and national levels, including serving as state President for New Jersey and as National Vice President.  Now as National President, Elsie has already begun implementing an ambitious agenda for the Auxiliary. She plans to travel across the country to every state and perhaps even to some foreign countries, in an effort to boost the Auxiliary's already impressive membership rolls. A lover of country music, Elsie has established a membership theme called ``Country Hearts in Celebration,'' which she intends to use to recruit new members.  She has also taken on a special project called ``Veteran's Pot of Gold'' designed to raise funds to assist homeless veterans, an issue that has been a large part of my agenda as Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I look forward to working with Elsie in this most noble mission to help the estimated 275,000 veterans who are homeless today.  Mr. Speaker, as our Nation fights a war on terrorism to keep America free and secure, it is comforting to know that there are people like Elsie Bailey supporting our veterans and our communities. I am confident Elsie Bailey will serve as new National President of the American Legion Auxiliary with the same distinction she has demonstrated her entire life. Through her service to our veterans, our communities and our Nation, Elsie Bailey has earned our respect and I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to her today.                          ____________________
