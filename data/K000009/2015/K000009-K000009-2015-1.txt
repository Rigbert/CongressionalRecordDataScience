Speaker, there is $1.275 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation for western drought response, WaterSMART programs, and river restoration.  The increased funding for science is equally important, up to $5.3 billion, which will support American innovation, critical for manufacturing competitiveness, and job creation.  The $2 billion in the bill for energy efficiency and renewable energy sets us on a path toward greater energy independence.  Let me end with this. When our foes decide to flood our global market with excess crude oil and push prices below $2 a gallon, they try to snuff out emergency energy sectors like natural gas.  Our bill attempts to move America and the world in a different direction. We don't want any more recessions caused by those who control the spigot raising gas prices over $4 a gallon.  Though this bill is not perfect, it reflects a compromise. I urge my colleagues to vote positively and support this measure to move America forward again.
