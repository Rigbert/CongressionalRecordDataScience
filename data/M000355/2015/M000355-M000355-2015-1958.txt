 President, this resolution concerns a request for testimony in a criminal case under way in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In this case, a former CIA officer has been charged with unlawfully disclosing classified information. In 2010, the Senate agreed to S. Res. 600, in the 111th Congress, which authorized the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to provide evidence in the investigation that preceded this indictment.  In addition to Senate Intelligence Committee staff, testimony as a fact witness has been requested from a former employee of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The chairman and ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee would like to cooperate with the request for testimony in this case.  Accordingly, this resolution would authorize the former Judiciary Committee employee to testify at trial with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
