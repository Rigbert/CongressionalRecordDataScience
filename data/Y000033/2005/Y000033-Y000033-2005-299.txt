Mr. Speaker, beginning in Fiscal Year 2001 Congress began providing funds for a vessel time charter for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, to use in addressing the critical hydrographic survey backlog. The vessel time charter added a third method of acquiring the data needed to update and improve the hydrographic charts of our nation's waterways. These charts are essential for our national security, defense and economy. NOAA now uses (1) its own hydrographic survey vessels, (2) data--contracts under the Brooks Act, and (3) a long-term, multi-year, vessel lease/charter of a private sector vessel with contract hydrographers.  The long-term vessel lease/charter, is now completing its first year of operation. I rise today to urge NOAA to reprogram funds to extend the current charter through the end of this calendar year. This extension will allow enough data to be gathered to determine whether the continued use of the time charter is cost effective, and competitive with other methods of acquiring hydrographic data. It will also keep the contract going long enough to determine if fiscal year 2006 funds are available for continued long term vessel charters. To emphasize the bipartisan importance of this issue, I ask that the May 31, 2005, letter to the NOAA Administrator that my good friend and colleague, Norm Dicks signed with me, be entered into the Record.                                Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, May 31, 2005.     Vice Admiral Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr.,     Undersecretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, National Oceanic          and Atmospheric, Administration, Herbert Clark Hoover          Building, Washington DC.       Dear Admiral Lautenbacher: As you are aware, the Nation      faces a huge backlog of critical hydrographic survey work. To      reduce this backlog, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric      Administration (NOAA) had developed a three-pronged approach.      NOAA is using 1) its own hydrographic survey vessels and      personnel; 2) data acquisition contracts; and 3) a leased      vessel staffed by contract hydrographers.       In fiscal years 2002 through 2005, Congress provided      funding and specific direction to NOAA to enter into a multi-     year vessel lease. After a lengthy bid process, the Military      Sealift Command entered into a lease on NOAA's behalf that      included a base year, and 4 one-year options. The first year      of that lease will soon end, and unless it is extended this      portion of the hydrographic surveying initiative will end.      The bidders, including the winning bidder, based their bids      on a 5-year lease period. Therefore, it was very      disappointing to learn that NOAA does not intend to exercise      even its first annual lease option, especially since NOAA      appears to be satisfied with the work that has been done by      the leased vessel.       We have requested that the Appropriations Committee include      funding to continue the vessel lease program in fiscal year      2006. This will allow NOAA time to acquire and examine cost      data on the lease to determine if vessel leasing is a cost      effective method of acquiring hydrographic data. While this      request is pending, we urge you to extend the vessel lease      with the roughly $1.6 million remaining of the amounts      already appropriated for that purpose. This will hold open      the door to allow NOAA to exercise the first annual contract      option if Congress appropriates vessel lease funds in Fiscal      Year 2006.       Both Congress and NOAA deliberated long and hard before      establishing the longterm vessel lease program as an      additional method to reduce the survey backlog. Given the      time and effort it has taken to get that program under way,      it would be very inefficient for NOAA to kill the program      this year, and then go through another multi-year contract      bidding process starting next year. Therefore, we urge you to      use the remaining funds to extend the vessel contract.       Thank you for your expeditious consideration of this      request. We look forward to your prompt response.           Sincerely,     Don Young,       Congressman for All Alaska.     Norman D. Dicks,       Member of Congress.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E1286]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                        NOAA VESSEL TIME CHARTER                                 ______                                                              HON.
