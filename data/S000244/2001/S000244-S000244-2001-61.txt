Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 243) expressing the sense of the Congress that the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor should be presented to the public safety officers who have perished and select other public safety officers who deserve special recognition for outstanding valor above and beyond the call of duty in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 243       Whereas on September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked and      destroyed 4 civilian aircraft, crashing 2 of them into the      towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, a third      into the Pentagon, and a fourth in rural southwest      Pennsylvania;       Whereas thousands of innocent Americans and many foreign      nationals were killed and injured as a result of these      surprise terrorist attacks, including the passengers and      crews of the 4 aircraft, workers in the World Trade Center      and the Pentagon, firefighters, law enforcement officers,      emergency assistance personnel, and bystanders;       Whereas hundreds of public safety officers were killed and      injured as a result of these terrorist attacks because they      immediately rushed to the aid of innocent civilians who were      imperiled when the terrorists first launched their attacks,      many of whom would perish when the twin towers of the World      Trade Center collapsed upon them;       Whereas thousands more public safety officers are risking      their own lives and long-term health in sifting through the      aftermath and rubble of these terrorist attacks to recover      the dead;       Whereas the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of      2001 (Public Law 107-12; 115 Stat. 20) authorizes the      President to award and present, in the name of Congress, a      Medal of Valor to public safety officers for extraordinary      valor above and beyond the call of duty;       Whereas the Attorney General of the United States has      discretion to increase the number of recipients of the Medal      of Valor under that Act beyond that recommended by the Medal      of Valor Review Board in extraordinary cases in any given      year;       Whereas the terrorist attacks in the United States of      September 11, 2001, and their aftermath constitute the single      most deadly assault on our American homeland in our Nation's      history; and       Whereas those public safety officers who have perished and      those who lead the efforts to rescue innocent civilians from      the terrorist attacks, are the first casualties and veterans      of America's new war against terrorism, which was authorized      by the authorization for use of military force enacted      September 14, 2001: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the President should award and present, in the name of      Congress, a Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor to those      public safety officers who were killed in the terrorist      attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001; and       (2) the President should award and present a Public Safety      Officer Medal of Valor to those public safety officers who      have earned special recognition for outstanding valor above      and beyond the call of duty as named--       (A) in consultation with the Mayor of the City of New York      and Governor of the State of New York for the attacks on New      York--       (i) Commissioner of the New York City Police Department;       (ii) Commissioner of the New York City Fire Department; and       (iii) Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York      and New Jersey;       (B) in consultation with the Chair of the Washington      Metropolitan Council of Governments, including the sitting      Chairs of the Police and Fire Chief Committees; and the Fort      Myer Federal Fire Chief, and the Governor of the Commonwealth      of Virginia for the attack at the Pentagon--       (i) Fire Chief of Arlington County, Virginia; and        (ii) Police Chief of Arlington County, Virginia; and       (C) in consultation with the Governor of the Commonwealth      of Pennsylvania for the plane crash in Pennsylvania--       (i) Commandant of the Pennsylvania State Police; and       (ii) Adjutant General of the Pennsylvania National Guard,     or any of their designees, for their heroic actions on      September 11, 2001, and thereafter during the rescue and      recovery missions.
