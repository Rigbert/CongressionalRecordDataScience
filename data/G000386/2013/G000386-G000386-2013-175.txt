 President, I oppose the nomination of David Medine to be the Chairman of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which is commonly referred to as the PCLOB.  Mr. Medine was nominated for this position during last Congress and the Judiciary Committee, where I serve as the ranking member, held a hearing on his nomination in April 2012.  At the hearing, I asked a number of questions about the various national security statutes that the Board is tasked with overseeing. This included questions about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the PATRIOT Act.  Specifically, I asked for his views on these laws. Unfortunately, the responses I received failed to provide his views. He simply stated that he would balance the views of the government against the Board's mandate to review privacy.  I also asked Mr. Medine about his views on the use of law enforcement versus military authorities for combatting terrorism.  I was disappointed that he failed to answer a basic yes-or-no question about national security law: ``Do you believe that we are engaged in a war on terrorism?''  Instead, of a simple yes or no, he opted for a more limited answer that military power is permissible in appropriate cases.  This technical answer gives me pause especially in light of the continued threat we face from international terrorist organizations.  Perhaps the most concerning response he provided was to another simple constitutional law question. I asked all the Board nominees an important question about the use of profiling based upon country of origin for immigration purposes.
