 President, last night and earlier today the Senate debated the Hagel-Ensign prescription drug amendment. During the course of that debate, some Members on the other side made a comparison of the cost of the Graham-Kennedy prescription drug amendment and the revenue loss of a proposal to repeal the ``sunset'' of death tax relief provisions in last year's bipartisan tax relief bill.  The essence of the argument was that the budget effects of these proposals are roughly equal. As we heard many times, the Senate was supposedly making a choice between these two proposals. Senator Schumer claimed, during the argument, two different figures for repeal of the sunset. At one point, the Senator from New York claimed the revenue loss was $670 billion. At another point, a few moments later, the Senator from New York claimed the revenue loss was $600 billion.  The Congressional Budget Office scored the Graham amendment as a spending increase of $594 billion. This figure covers the 8-year proposal's 10-year budget effect. Now, if you accepted Senator Schumer's figures as is, then there might be some basis for his argument. That is, if, in fact, the Joint Committee on Taxation scored the proposed permanent death tax relief proposal at $600 billion or $670 billion, then Senator Schumer's argument might be worth debate.  The facts are different. I don't know where Senator Schumer got his figure. Maybe it was a liberal think tank, such as the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Maybe it was a partisan liberal communications shop, like the Senate Democratic Policy Committee. I don't know where he got the number.  I do know this: The number doesn't apply. For purposes of the Congressional Budget Act, tax provisions are to be scored by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.  According to Joint tax, the permanent death tax relief proposal scores at $43.6 billion if you use the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution. That is the one the Senate is currently operating under. If you use the fiscal year 2003 budget resolution, the one under which the House is operating, permanent death tax relief scores at $99.4 billion.  So the real number is, at most, $99.4 billion, for permanent death tax relief. That is one-sixth the cost of the Graham amendment.  It is interesting to note that during last month's debate on the death tax that the Senator from New York supported Senator Dorgan's amendment. That amendment was scored by Joint Tax as losing $111 billion over 10 years. Basically, Senator Schumer voted for death tax relief of $11 billion more than the proposal he criticized last night and today.  So if we are talking about choices between resources for prescription drugs and death tax relief, let's review the record. Let the record reflect that Senator Schumer and 39 other members of the Democratic Caucus voted for $11 billion more in death tax relief thantheir colleagues. For reference, that's rollcall vote No. 149. It is set out in page S5412 of the Congressional Record of June 12, 2002.  The Senator from New York's use of erroneous data on the bipartisan tax relief package is unfortunately part of a coordinated strategy on the part of the Democratic leadership. It is also data unchallenged by many in the media. In fact, many in the media parrot another of the Democratic Leadership's equally erroneous statistics. We keep hearing and reading that the bipartisan tax relief package yielded 40 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. This statistic, like Senator Schumer's other tax relief statistics, is dramatically at odds with Joint Tax, the official scorekeeper for Congressional tax relief.  According to Joint Tax, the bipartisan tax relief package makes the Tax Code more progressive.  I make this statement for one basic reason. The issues of prescription drugs and death tax relief are important matters. Certainly every one of us hears about both of these issues when we are back home. They are issues that our constituents expect us to resolve. Folks back home expect us to be intellectually honest in debating these important matters. When we debate these issues, we ought to use intellectually honest figures.  I ask unanimous consent to print the Joint Committee on Taxation's revenue estimate of the proposed estate tax relief and the distribution analysis in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                               ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF H.R. 2143, ``PERMANENT DEATH TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2001'', FISCAL YEARS 2002-2012                                                                                                          [Billions of Dollars]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                   Provision                                    Effective                     2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007       2008       2009       2010       2011       2012     2002-07    2002-12----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Make Permanent the Repeal of the Estate Tax     dda & gma 12/31/10.......................  .........       -1.2       -1.5       -1.8       -2.3       -2.5       -2.7       -2.8       -4.0      -24.9      -55.8       -9.2      -99.4 and the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

This distribution has been updated to reflect      changes enacted in the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation      Relief Act of 2001 (Public Law 107-16).       The first table shows the distribution of the Federal      individual income tax and the second table shows the      distribution of the Federal individual income tax, Federal      excise taxes, and Federal employment taxes.       For purposes of these tables, the income concept used for      classifying taxpayers is adjusted gross income (``AGI'')      plus: (1) tax-exempt interest, (2) employer contributions for      health plans and life insurance, (3) employer share of FICA      tax, (4) worker's compensation, (5) nontaxable Social      Security benefits, (6) insurance value of Medicare benefits,      (7) alternative minimum tax preference items, and (8)      excluded income of U.S. citizens living abroad.       The first table shows the distribution of the Federal      individual income tax, including the outlay portion of the      earned income credit (``EIC'') and the child credit. The      table shows, by income category, (1) the number of returns      and the percent of all returns represented by the category,      (2) the aggregate income and the percent of all income      represented by the category, (3) the aggregate individual      income taxes paid and the percent of all individual income      taxes paid by the category, and (4) the number of returns      with zero or negative tax liability and the percent of all      returns with zero or negative tax liability represented by      the category.       The second table show the distribution of the combined      Federal individual income tax (including the outlay portion      of the EIC and the child credit), Federal excise taxes, and      Federal employment taxes (those taxes required under the      Federal Insurance Contributions Act and Federal Unemployment      Tax Act). The table shows (1) the number of returns and the      percent of all returns represented by the category, (2) the      aggregate income and the percent of all income represented by      the category, and (3) the aggregate Federal taxes paid and      the percent of all Federal taxes paid by the category.
