 President, I have spoken many times on this floor about the threat that opioid abuse represents to our country. Rates of substance abuse have been on the rise in recent years, and Kentucky has been hit particularly hard by this epidemic. A recent State report from the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy said that, last year, over 1,200 deaths in the Commonwealth were caused by drug abuse.  Well, I am glad to share with my colleagues some good news in the fight against opioid abuse in Kentucky. This August, I visited with and saw up close a program that is changing how law enforcement deals with drug addiction, a program that is saving lives. It is the Jeffersontown Angel Program, an initiative spearheaded by the Jeffersontown, KY, Police Department.  At the Jeffersontown Police Department, a priority has been placed on getting treatment for folks who request help for their addiction to opiates by connecting them with local treatment facilities. In many cases, those with substance-abuse disorders can be taken immediately to a treatment facility to start their recovery. People who abuse drugs can also turn over their drugs or drug equipment without being charged with a crime.  The new Jeffersontown Police Department Angel Program is the first of its kind in Kentucky. It is modeled after a successful program launched in Gloucester, MA, in 2015, which has so far referred more than 450 people to treatment and produced a 33 percent reduction in property crime rates.  That evidence was enough to convince Jeffersontown Police Chief Ken Hatmaker. ``When you can have a 33 percent drop in property crime,'' he says, ``I'm going to listen.''  While the Jeffersontown Police Department remains strenuously committed to investigating, pursuing, and arresting drug traffickers to the fullest extent of the law, the Angel Program helps reduce those traffickers' clientele by working to remove the stigma of addiction and making it easier to access recovery programs.  Fighting drug abuse is a cause I have embraced here in the Senate as well, and it has been a focus of mine for many years. I have traveled throughout the Commonwealth speaking with people, learning about the scope of substance abuse in my State, and working with Kentuckians to combat it.  A few years ago, I convened a listening session in northern Kentucky, a region particularly hard hit by this epidemic, to hear from informed Kentuckians in the medical, public health, and law-enforcement fields. I testified before the Senate's Drug Caucus to share my findings with my colleagues.  I have also met with the Nation's Director of National Drug Control Policy--better known as the drug czar--and successfully persuaded him to visit Kentucky to see firsthand the damage done by drugs. His visit and greater Federal funding for law enforcement in Kentucky have both been a part of a multilayered strategy to stop drug trafficking.  I also made it a priority to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, a bill I was proud to see recently signed into law. CARA is a comprehensive approach to tackling the opioid drug epidemic that bolsters treatment, prevention and recovery efforts, and gives law enforcement tools to help those already suffering with addiction and help prevent more senseless loss of life.  CARA authorizes new grants for vital, lifesaving programs to help treat those suffering from drug addiction. It also includes several important policy reforms. It will expand treatment by giving prescribing authority to nurse practitioners and physician assistants to administer medication-assisted treatments for opioid addiction. It will increase the availability of naloxone, which can instantly reverse a drug overdose, to law enforcement agencies and other first responders. And it will strengthen and enhance prescription drug monitoring programs to crack down on ``doctor shopping.''  Substance abuse destroys lives. It increases crime, rips apart families, and leaves too many bodies in its wake. I want to commend the Jeffersontown Police Department for launching the Angel Program and leading the way in Kentucky in efforts to battle substance abuse. With the good work done by the Jeffersontown Police Department, along with the continued efforts we are doing here in Congress, I believe we can fight back against this scourge of addiction, and reduce its devastating effects.  The Louisville Courier-Journal recently published an article describing the Jeffersontown Police Department's Angel Program. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From The Louisville Courier Journal, Aug. 25, 2016]               J-Town's New Strategy To Combat Addiction                            (By Amanda Beam)       Sgt. Brittney Garrett wants to save lives through changing      attitudes.       Her influence can be seen in the waiting area inside the      Jeffersontown Police Department, the law-enforcement agency      for which she works. Pamphlets about overcoming substance      abuse and local addiction support groups can be found on most      every table there.       This lobby welcomes with acceptance, not doubt, supporting      the revolutionary initiative Garrett has embraced.       It's called The Angel Program, and it's redefining the way      law enforcement views drug addiction.       Through cooperation with community partners, the initiative      gives resources to people searching for sobriety.       During their intake hours of 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday      through Friday, the J-Town PD serves as a conduit to connect      those who seek therapy for their addiction with providers who      can access and provide treatment for their needs. Folks, in      most cases, will be immediately taken to a treatment facility      to begin their recovery.       People who use can also turn over drugs for disposal to the      police without fear of reprisal.       ``The hard part isn't coming in,'' Garrett said of those      who enter the station to obtain assistance. ``The hard part      is getting through your treatment.''       Certain exclusions do apply. If you have an active warrant,      a felony sex conviction, a violent history or are under 18      years old, you may not qualify. Garrett invites those with      questions to phone the station at (502) 267-0503.       Since the program's August 1, 2016 start, seven people have      entered the program and been placed directly into residential      rehab facilities.       No wait lists. No jail. No criminalization of their      illness. Just help is received.       ``We have to find innovative ways to deal with the heroin      problem,'' said Garrett, the Angel Program Coordinator. ``A      lot of it comes down to just being empathetic, compassionate      and educated of what we're dealing with.''                           A national scourge       What J-Town and other communities across the nation are      dealing with is an epidemic. Heroin use continues to rise,      and overdoses soar. Jefferson County on average experiences      one overdose death each day.       In addition to health concerns, crime has risen in the town      of about 27,000. Increased thefts, general incidence reports      and car accidents occur as ramifications of drug use. Garrett      has even seen an uptick in more serious offenses as well.       ``Especially on the level of law enforcement, when you deal      with people with substance abuse disorder on the street, it's      always bad. It's never good. It's someone committing a      crime,'' Garrett said.       ``It's hard for us to see the human side of addiction, that      you committed a crime because of your addiction.''       But humanizing those with substance-abuse issues is a      hallmark of the program's creation.                             The beginning       The Gloucester Police Department in Massachusetts      established the now national initiative in 2015, with the aim      of targeting the demand side of the drug problem. Get help      for those who are addicted so they stop using, and both      supply and crime should go down too. Furthermore, law-     enforcement agencies would face less strain on their limited      resources, and be able to concentrate on serious criminal      cases.       Not only did they find these actions more compassionate,      but also more successful.       So far, roughly 400 people have been referred to treatment      facilities through the Gloucester program. As predicted,      drug-related crimes in the surrounding area fell by more than      30 percent. Costs for treatment also fall far below the price      of housing prisoners, providing another incentive.       ``If you have a choice between a bed in incarceration, or a      bed in treatment, I'm for the bed in treatment,'' said      Jeffersontown Police Chief Ken Hatmaker.       Enforcement still remains important, he added. When people      break the law, consequences must be faced.       But providing treatment opportunities to those suffering      from substance-use disorder can stop many of the more serious      crimes from happening in the first place, a balancing act      between service and enforcement that Hatmaker has learned to      embrace.       ``That's what it took for me to buy in was the education,''      the chief said. ``When you can have a 33 percent drop in      property crime, I'm going to listen.''                               The impact       Changing perceptions isn't always easy for law enforcement      or those who find themselves addicted. At times, both face      stereotypes. The program aims to correct these biases and      facilitate greater communication between the police      department and the larger community.       ``People tend to believe that (substance-abuse disorder) is      a moral failing, that people chose to have a life of      destruction, which couldn't be further from the truth,'' said      Tara Moseley, a recovery advocate and Angel Program      volunteer.       Moseley understands the impact of addiction. For more than      five years, the 30-year-old Louisville resident has been in      recovery. Now, through her work in organizations like Young      People in Recovery and the Angel Program, she tells others      with the illness that better days can be in their future.       ``People need to know there is a way out and that there is      hope,'' she said. ``A program like the Angel Program, they      actually do all that stuff for you. They're going to help you      and take you where you need to go and make sure you are in      somewhere and it's right now.''       The immediacy of the initiative plays a key role in its      ingenuity. Those seeking assistance oftentimes face long wait      lists to get into residential treatment. Not so with the      Angel Program.       ``Unfortunately, as it relates to the drugs of choice      today, it's very possible they are risking their lives by      waiting on a waiting list,'' said Jennifer Hancock, president      and CEO of Volunteers of America (VOA) Mid-States, a non-     profit partner of Angel Program.       In addition to providing a staff member to help with the      station's intake center three days a week, VOA also has      placed several of the referrals from the program into its      facilities.       ``It's important that we strike while the iron is hot and      make sure we're providing them with immediate access.      Otherwise . . . then they're waiting without the security and      safety net of a very structured and accountable program, and      it's extremely common that they will continue using.''       Through several different initiatives that focus on      specific populations, VOA maintains 185 residential treatment      beds in Louisville and Lexington. More, though, are needed.      Only additional funding can alleviate the overwhelming      demand.       And that's the tricky part.       The J-Town Angel Program only facilitates people finding      treatment. Funding of that treatment remains with the patient      and the medical provider. Some facilities have pledged      scholarships to the program, and many others can enroll      patients in Medicaid or work with them to manage costs if      they can't afford the treatment.       But funding doesn't come close to meeting the demand.       ``If we have people lined up at our door, that's great,''      Garrett said. ``But if we can't take them somewhere because      there are no beds available, no funding for these treatment      centers, we're just turning people away at that point and      doing the opposite of what we're wanting to do.''       Current legislation in Congress called the Comprehensive      Addiction and Recovery Act could give more money to address      these broader funding problems for treatment initiatives. But      until that occurs, the Angel Program will do its best to      continue combatting the effects of the addiction epidemic one      life at a time.       ``We've always been counselors and social workers as law      enforcement, mediating conflict and these types of things,      but this is a whole new level,'' Garrett said. ``We're      entering into a new realm.''                          ____________________
