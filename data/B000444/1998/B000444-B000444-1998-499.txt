 We worked closely together on the Foreign Relations Committee.  I say to the Senator, I have an opening statement in the hope and expectation that we really will debate NATO now for some time. To make it clear to my colleagues who are listening, I have no strong preference whether we have education on the floor or NATO expansion on the floor; I just hope whatever we have, we stick with it, so there is coherence to the debate. That is my overall point.  I ask my friend from Nebraska, as the manager for the Democrats on the NATO expansion issue, I have what we might call the obligatory very long and detailed statement. My statement is probably the better part of a half hour to 45 minutes. I don't want to begin if my friend would rather speak now. I want to accommodate the Senator. When I begin, I would like to be able to begin and, in an attempt to be coherent, lay out in detail my position on NATO expansion.
