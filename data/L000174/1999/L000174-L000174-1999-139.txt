President, I am very pleased to join with Senator Hatch in introducing the ``American Inventors Protection Act of 1999,'' which I hope can be enacted into law this year.  This patent bill is important to America's future. I have heard from inventors, from businesses large and small, from hi-tech to low-tech firms that this bill will give American inventors and businesses an improved competitive edge now enjoyed by many European countries.  We should be on a level playing field with them.  This bill reduces patent fees for only the second time in history. The first time that was done was also in a Hatch-Leahy bill passed by the Senate in the 105th Congress.  All the concepts in this bill--such as patent term guarantees, domestic publication of patent applications filed abroad, first inventor defense--have been thoroughly examined. Indeed, they have been included in several bills that the Congress has carefully studied.  Chairman Hatch and I have worked closely on this bill. I believe that we can get a good patent bill to the President before we go out of session this year. I look forward to working with the House on these issues and appreciate the hard work and careful crafting that went into their bill--H.R. 1907.  I wish to point out that the Senate Judiciary Committee last year also developed a strong bill--S. 507--which contained many of the same concepts and approaches found in H.R. 1907 and S. 1798.  It is long past time for the Senate to consider and pass this patent reform legislation. Our patent bill will be good for Vermont, good for Utah and every state in the Nation, good for American innovators of all sizes, and good for America.  We will be working with the Administration, the full Senate and with the House to move this bill along quickly. I hope we can keep this bipartisan coalition together because otherwise this bill will die, as past efforts have.  The patent bill will reform the U.S. patent system in important ways.  It will reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies; eliminate duplication of research efforts and accelerate research into new areas; increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and commercialization of inventions.  In Vermont, we have a number of independent inventors and small companies. It is, therefore, especially important to me that this bill will be one that helps them as well as the larger companies in Vermont like IBM.  Over the past several years, Congress has held eight Congressional hearings with more than 80 witnesses testifying about the various proposals incorporated in the bill. Republican and Democratic Administrations alike, reaching back to the Johnson Administration, have supported these similar reforms.  I also thank Secretary Daley and the administration for their unflagging support of effective patent reform. I also know that they worked closely with the House on H.R. 1907. I will submit a more detailed statement on S. 1798 before we proceed to Senate consideration.                                 ______                                       By
