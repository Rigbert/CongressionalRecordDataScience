Speaker, on behalf of students across America, I would like to award a dunce's cap to my colleague from Texas. Mr. Armey, the acting Speaker of the House, suggested we could pay for repeal of the gas tax with cuts in education. Where does he think the money will come from?  We could cap college assistance--and take Pell grants away from more than 3 million college students. We could cap Head Start--take education, nutrition, and health care away from every one of the 760,000 preschoolers who participate--and we still wouldn't get enough. We could cap funds to elementary schools--and take reading and math help away from 5.5 million students who are struggling to catch up with their peers.  Mr. Armey, if you think the American people want to cut our children's education to save themselves 4.3 cents at the gas pump, you haven't done your homework.                          ____________________
