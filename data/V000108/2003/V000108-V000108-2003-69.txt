Speaker, it is with great sincerity and enthusiasm that I congratulate the employees of Serenity House of Gary, Inc. as they celebrate 25 years of assisting those in the Gary, Indiana community as they recover from alcohol and drug addiction. These devoted individuals will commemorate their Silver Anniversary at a banquet to be held on April 26, 2003.  Serenity House of Gary, Inc. is a transitional facility that nurtures residents as they recover from the mental, physical, and spiritual effects of alcohol and drug addiction, as well as providing employment counseling and referrals to ensure that the reintegration into the community is successful for both the patient and those in the surrounding area. The employees at Serenity House are committed to supporting addicts and their families through every step of the recovery process. By promoting each individual's talents and skills, these employees teach all those committed to recovering to develop meaningful, productive lives without the reliance upon narcotics and alcohol.  Mr. Speaker, Serenity House opened in August 1980 to fulfill the need for a residential treatment facility in Lake County, Indiana. It provides a supportive environment for patients to recover from their addiction as they simultaneously learn important life skills, such as obtaining and maintaining both employment and housing in order to enrich the quality of their lives. The employees are trained to counsel and assist those who are recovering from dependency, and are therefore able to create a positive atmosphere in which the patients are prepared to enjoy the benefits of their success.  The physical and emotional suffering caused by addiction affects not only the individual, but also hovers like a storm cloud over all those who have a vested interest in his or her well-being. Serenity House provides a safe haven for those who wish to recover from their dependency but are unable to do so on their own. It is within these walls that those who are looking for the opportunity to improve their lives can find solace.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the employees of Serenity House of Gary, Inc. for 25 years of service to the residents of Lake County, Indiana. Through their efforts, many in the Northwest Indiana community have had the opportunity to enhance their lives and recover from a debilitating illness. It is this compassion and commitment to their fellow man that makes Northwest Indiana a great community, and I am honored to represent these outstanding individuals in Congress.                          ____________________
