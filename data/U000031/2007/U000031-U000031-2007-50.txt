 Since 1907, the Kalamazoo Public Library has safeguarded the public's right to know by accepting, organizing, and maintaining all publications released by the U.S. Federal Government. Furthermore, the Kalamazoo Depository has provided the public of Southwest Michigan with free access to these government documents in an impartial environment along with professional research assistance.  From census records and court rulings to financial aid forms and the federal tax code, the Kalamazoo Depository has become an easily accessible resource for those seeking information relating to the federal government.  As a republic founded upon the ideals of governmental accountability and democratic participation, public access to such information is invaluable. The public's ability to know, question, and participate is the lifeblood of a free and open society such as ours, and not something to be taken for granted.  Once again, I would like to personally recognize and thank the Kalamazoo Public Library and its staff for providing such an invaluable service to the citizens of this community. Southwest Michigan is truly a better place because of their contributions.                          ____________________
