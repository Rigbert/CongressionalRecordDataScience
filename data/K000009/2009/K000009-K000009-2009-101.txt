No human being can watch this carnage and not be reminded of the festering hatred that grows with each successive unleashing of violence in Israel, the Gaza, in the Palestinian territories that sadly rescars that tragic region.  In voting for the resolution today, I want to be clear I did not do so because I believe more war or violence is the solution to stability. In fact, more war will breed more retribution, as history surely demonstrates. I voted for the resolution because its preamble clearly states our goal is supporting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  The proportionality of Israel's response to Hamas' incessant terrorist rocket launches is lamentable. Over 750 Palestinians have now died, one-third of them women and children; there have been four Israeli soldiers killed; and in the last 7 years three Israeli casualties from the rocket launches from the Gaza into Israel. Immediately, there is a lack of adequate humanitarian relief from the world community, and for the victims, that is appalling. Two wrongs do not make a right.  My view is, the current administration has left Israel more vulnerable and less stable as hatreds grow toward it regionally. Our Nation's reputation, too, has been badly damaged globally.  I would like to enter into the Record today an editorial written by President Jimmy Carter called ``The Unnecessary War,'' the only President in the last 3 decades to achieve real, lasting peace in the Middle East. There is a road forward. His life is proof the future of that region can be better than the past as development replaces war as the common denominator. But that will take courage. It will take perseverance. It will take more than congressional resolutions. It is why our hopes ride high at this moment with the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama.                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 8, 2009]                           An Unnecessary War                           (By Jimmy Carter)       I know from personal involvement that the devastating      invasion of Gaza by Israel could easily have been avoided.       After visiting Sderot last April and seeing the serious      psychological damage caused by the rockets that had fallen in      that area, my wife, Rosalynn, and I declared their launching      from Gaza to be inexcusable and an act of terrorism. Although      casualties were rare (three deaths in seven years), the town      was traumatized by the unpredictable explosions. About 3,000      residents had moved to other communities, and the streets,      playgrounds and shopping centers were almost empty. Mayor Eli      Moyal assembled a group of citizens in his office to meet us      and complained that the government of Israel was not stopping      the rockets, either through diplomacy or military action.       Knowing that we would soon be seeing Hamas leaders from      Gaza and also in Damascus, we promised to assess prospects      for a cease-fire. From Egyptian intelligence chief Omar      Suleiman, who was negotiating between the Israelis and Hamas,      we learned that there was a fundamental difference between      the two sides. Hamas wanted a comprehensive cease-fire in      both the West Bank and Gaza, and the Israelis refused to      discuss anything other than Gaza.       We knew that the 1.5 million inhabitants of Gaza were being      starved, as the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food      had found that acute malnutrition in Gaza was on the same      scale as in the poorest nations in the southern Sahara, with      more than half of all Palestinian families eating only one      meal a day.       Palestinian leaders from Gaza were noncommittal on all      issues, claiming that rockets were the only way to respond to      their imprisonment and to dramatize their humanitarian      plight. The top Hamas leaders in Damascus, however, agreed to      consider a cease-fire in Gaza only, provided Israel would not      attack Gaza and would permit normal humanitarian supplies to      be delivered to Palestinian citizens.       After extended discussions with those from Gaza, these      Hamas leaders also agreed to accept any peace agreement that      might be negotiated between the Israelis and Palestinian      Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who also heads the PLO,      provided it was approved by a majority vote of Palestinians      in a referendum or by an elected unity government.       Since we were only observers, and not negotiators, we      relayed this information to the Egyptians, and they pursued      the cease-fire proposal. After about a month, the Egyptians      and Hamas informed us that all military action by both sides      and all rocket firing would stop on June 19, for a period of      six months, and that humanitarian supplies would be restored      to the normal level that had existed before Israel's      withdrawal in 2005 (about 700 trucks daily).       We were unable to confirm this in Jerusalem because of      Israel's unwillingness to admit to any negotiations with      Hamas, but rocket firing was soon stopped and there was an      increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel. Yet      the increase was to an average of about 20 percent of normal      levels. And this fragile truce was partially broken on Nov.      4, when Israel launched an attack in Gaza to destroy a      defensive tunnel being dug by Hamas inside the wall that      encloses Gaza.       On another visit to Syria in mid-December, I made an effort      for the impending six-month deadline to be extended. It was      clear that the preeminent issue was opening the crossings      into Gaza. Representatives from the Carter Center visited      Jerusalem, met with Israeli officials and asked if this was      possible in exchange for a cessation of rocket fire. The      Israeli government informally proposed that 15 percent of      normal supplies might be possible if Hamas first stopped all      rocket fire for 48 hours. This was unacceptable to Hamas, and      hostilities erupted.       After 12 days of ``combat,'' the Israeli Defense Forces      reported that more than 1,000 targets were shelled or bombed.      During that time, Israel rejected international efforts to      obtain a cease-fire, with full support from Washington.      Seventeen mosques, the American International School, many      private homes and much of the basic infrastructure of the      small but heavily populated area have been destroyed. This      includes the systems that provide water, electricity and      sanitation. Heavy civilian casualties are being reported by      courageous medical volunteers from many nations, as the      fortunate ones operate on the wounded by light from diesel-     powered generators.       The hope is that when further hostilities are no longer      productive, Israel, Hamas and the United States will accept      another cease-fire, at which time the rockets will again stop      and an adequate level of humanitarian supplies will be      permitted to the surviving Palestinians, with the publicized      agreement monitored by the international community. The next      possible step: a permanent and comprehensive peace.                          ____________________
