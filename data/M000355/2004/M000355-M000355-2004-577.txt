 President, this morning the Senate will conduct a period of morning business until the hour of 10:30, with the first half of that time under the control of the majority leader or his designee and the second half under the control of Senator Daschle or his designee.  Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act. That bill will be considered under a consent agreement which allows for two amendments to be offered. The debate is limited on the amendments and the underlying bill. Therefore, we will vote throughout the day and complete action today on the Unborn Victims bill. Senator DeWine will be here to manage the bill on this side of the aisle. I understand Senator Feinstein may offer her substitute amendment first. There will be up to four hours of debate in relation to the Feinstein amendment.  Senators should expect the first vote to occur sometime just after the lunch hour. As always, we will notify all Senators when votes are about to occur.                          ____________________
