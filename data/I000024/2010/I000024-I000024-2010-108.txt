 I said: If we were to pass this, any of these cap-and-trade bills, or if we were to do this through the Clean Air Act through the Environmental Protection Agency, how much would that reduce the worldwide CO2 emissions?  Her answer was, Well, it wouldn't reduce it because this would only apply to the United States.  What I am saying is, if you want to invoke all of this money spent, all of this cost on the American people, on every farmer in America, even if you believe the concept is there, it still wouldn't reduce the emissions. You could argue it could increase the emissions because our manufacturing base would have to go to places such as China, India, Mexico, places that didn't have the standards we have, and it would have the effect of increasing--actually increasing--CO2.  So I just hope those individuals will realize if they think the problem is real, this isn't going to solve it.  I yield back.
