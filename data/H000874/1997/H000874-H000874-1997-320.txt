Speaker, today we solemnly commemorate the massacre of Armenians in Turkey during and after the First World War. We mourn the dead, and express our condolences to their living descendants. During that terrible tragedy, an estimated 1.5 million people were killed in what historians call the first of this century's state-ordered genocides against a minority group.  While the tragic events leading to the deaths of millions of Armenians occurred at the beginning of this century, their impact on the psyche of the Armenian people, and indeed the entire world are still apparent. The effects of such atrocities on a people are never overcome. Many can still testify to the deportations and massacres of family members and friends. Others can read or view pictures of the abominations, and all Armenians, young and old, live with the knowledge that their people's existence was seriously jeopardized during the last years of the Ottoman Empire.  Mr. Speaker, the world must be reminded over and over of the brutal crimes perpetrated against the Armenian people. Unfortunately, history's lessons are not easily learned and put into practice. This century has been witness to unparalleled human suffering and unmatched human cruelty. The Armenian genocide was the first attempt to wipe out an entire people. The failure to recognize it gave Hitler confidence. Since then, we have seen the killing fields of Pol Pot, the horrors of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and the tragedy of Rwanda.  Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that each of us work to ensure that our generation and future generations never again have to bear witness to such inhuman behavior and feel the pain and suffering of an entire people. The crime of genocide must never again be allowed to mar the history of humankind, and today we stand with our Armenian brothers and sisters, not only to remember and share in their grief for those who died, but to celebrate those who are living.                          ____________________
