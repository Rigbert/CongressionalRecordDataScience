 President, today I am introducing legislation to allow Regine Beatie Edwards, an 18 year old German-born legal resident of the United States, to realize her lifelong dream of becoming a United States citizen.  Miss Edwards is the adopted daughter of Mr. Stan Edwards, a U.S. citizen who married Regine's mother while engaged in military service in Germany. Regine moved to the United States with her mother on October 16th, 1994. In 1997, Mr. Edwards contacted the INS on several occasions, attempting to obtain the proper form to apply for Regine's naturalization. The INS sent Mr. Edwards form N-643, Application for Certificate in Behalf of an Adopted Child. The INS informed Mr. Edwards that the adoption had to be completed by the time Regine turned 18. The adoption was completed on January 13th, 1997, when Regine was 16\1/2\ years of age. Mr. Edwards delivered Regine's application to the INS office in Omaha, Nebraska on March 27, 1998.  The INS reported in January of 1998 that the application was to be denied since the adoption of Ms. Edwards had not been completed prior to her 16th birthday, and therefore form N-643 was the incorrect form for application. Previously, the INS had told Mr. Edwards that the adoption need only be completed by Regine's 18th birthday. The INS then refunded to Mr. Edwards the application fee and informed him that, because of her age, Regine met only three of four qualifications to apply for citizenship. Had the INS told the Edwards that Regine needed to be adopted by the age of 16 in order to qualify for citizenship, the Edwards would have expedited the adoption process, and Regine would be closer to her dream of citizenship.  This bill, passed during the last Congress by the Senate but not acted on by the House, would reclassify Regine as a child pursuant to section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, thereby allowing the processing of her citizenship application.  Regine has stated that it has always been a goal of hers to live in the United States, and to become a citizen of, as she puts it, ``a land of freedom and individual opportunity to seek out your dreams and realize them.'' It would be tragic if we were to let a simple mistake on the part of the INS prevent such a promising young woman from becoming a U.S. citizen. I urge my fellow colleagues to support Regine by allowing her to make her dream of U.S. citizenship a reality.                                 ______                                       By
