 President, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, has just passed an important milestone, her 5,000th consecutive rollcall vote, a tenacious accomplishment indeed that represents the work ethic and dedication Senator Collins has for the people of Maine and for the Senate. We all know she is one of the hardest working Members of the Senate.  Listen to this. Since she was sworn in, in January, January 3 of 1997, she has been present for every single rollcall vote. That is over 15 consecutive years, never missing a vote.  Senator Collins is actually in quite an elite company. Recently, she passed Senator Byrd and is now third all time behind Senator Chuck Grassley and the late Bill Proxmire from Wisconsin. I know she took great pride also in being in the company of her role model, a woman who played a major role in her decision to run for public office in the first place, fellow Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who is currently No. 5 on the list.  On behalf of the entire Senate, I congratulate Senator Collins for this milestone.  (Applause, Senators rising.)
