Mr. Speaker, as an outspoken supporter of NATO expansion, I am pleased to join Chairman Gilman and others in introducing legislation designed to move this important process ahead in a timely manner. Regrettably, the Clinton administration's professed commitment to expansion of NATO has not been adequately matched by concrete deeds. The Partnership for Peace program, meant to deepen and strengthen the links between the Alliance and the emerging democracies of East Central Europe, appears stalled. The legislation we introduce today is designed to move the program forward, making much-needed resources available to Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and others, helping them to meet the obligations which NATO membership would entail.  The United States must provide the determined leadership necessary to advance NATO enlargement and check those bent on blocking the inclusion of new states in the Alliance.  Mr. Speaker, the peoples of East Central Europe have made tremendous strides in working to overcome the legacy of communism. Many of the countries have undertaken significant steps to consolidate democracy, to protect human rights, and to rebuild economies based on market principles.  At the same time, my endorsement of an expanded NATO is tempered by a recognition of the fact that progress in the region has not been even. There is room for further improvement in each and every one of the states concerned. I would note that all 27 states which have joined the Partnership for Peace to date are participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe [OSCE]. That membership has committed each to act in accordance with all OSCE documents, including the Helsinki Final Act.  As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am convinced of the fundamental role of human rights in advancing genuine security and stability, and, as such, must be an integral aspect of the expansion process. The human rights record of prospective candidates for NATO membership deserves close scrutiny. In fact, I would argue that a country's record should be subjected to more--not less--scrutiny the closer that country comes to being admitted into full membership in NATO. I would emphasize that none of the countries seeking NATO membership, including those considered to be leading contenders, is without problems.  The Government of Poland, for example, still has an arcane defamation law that provides criminal penalties against those who allegedly ``slander'' the state, similar to the laws previously used by Communist regimes to silence their opponents. In response to a letter from members of the Helsinki Commission on this issue, authorities in Warsaw have recently indicated their intention to repeal this provision as part of a general overhaul of the penal code. This step will, in my view, remove one of the last remaining vestiges of the Communist system from Poland's generally outstanding human rights record.  In the case of Hungary, there is continued concern over the use of excessive force by police, including harassment and physical abuse of Roma, Hungary's largest minority group. Some human rights organizations have suggested that Roma are also kept in pretrial detention more often and for longer periods than non-Roma.  The Czech Republic, although a human rights leader in many respects, passed a citizenship law after the dissolution of the Czechoslovak Federation that leaves thousands of people without citizenship. Regrettably, a recently passed amendment to the law failed to resolve this problem. Also, the Czech Republic has used a criminal defamation law to restrict free speech.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the tremendous progress which each of these states has made since the revolutions of the late 1980's and early 1990's which toppled the dictators of East Central Europe and the former Soviet Empire. I urge the leaders of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to take concrete steps to address the remaining human rights concerns in a manner consistent with OSCE principles as they pursue their goal of full NATO membership.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress has sought to play an active and constructive role in moving the NATO expansion process forward. The NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act, which we introduce today, demonstrates our firm commitment to the people of East Central Europe, including those from the Baltic States and Ukraine, as they strive to overcome the legacy of Communism and pursue democracy rooted in respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual.                          ____________________
