In places very far from home, friendship is a matter ofthe heart, and it is a matter of the mind. And thus it was with some dismay that I read a poll last week, the results of which I wish to place in the Record tonight, done by the Pew Research Center going and interviewing over 16,000 people across the globe, largely in the Muslim world, but also in Europe and other places, asking them whether they had a favorable opinion of the United States or not. And in the very places where we need to make friends, the numbers are not good.  Take Morocco, a country of 31 million people, where there have been, unfortunately, some terrorist attacks, 73 percent of the people have an unfavorable opinion of the United States. In Lebanon, so key to regional peace, 73 percent of the people have an unfavorable opinion of the United States. In Turkey, where the future remains uncertain, one of our staunchest allies from a military standpoint, but 85 percent of the people with an unfavorable opinion of the United States. That is a country of 67 million people. In Pakistan, where we know there are al Qaeda cells, where we know we have madrasas operating, spewing hate every day and instilling young children that they should give their lives in the cause of terrorism, a country of 147 million people, 87 percent, 87 percent have an unfavorable opinion of the United States. In Jordan, right next door to Iraq, a country of 5 million people, over 5 million people, 99 percent of the people have an unfavorable view of this country. And in the Palestinian Authority, where we continue to see such great violence, there really is not any support for the United States. In fact, the number shows zero percent favorable rating for the United States.  I must ask the question, how does one make peace in these circumstances, lasting peace? In that regard, I wish to place in the Record a really beautiful article written by David Ignatius in The Washington Post last Friday. I will not quote all of it here, but I will just read it to you in part. It was written from the steps of the American University of Beirut, a place I have personally visited, the university in that region that has produced the leaders, the leaders that have tried to make ties to the West.  The writer says he found himself sitting on the steps talking to some of the students whose generation will have to transform our hope for peace into reality. And the most hopeful thing he could say after visiting with them was that they had an understanding of how powerful America is. But the question seems to be in his mind after speaking with the students that we have a long way to go to restore America's credible role as a peacemaker. The students, to put it bluntly, he says, do not believe that America is serious about its values. Suggest to them, for example, that America really wants to advance democracy and freedom in Iraq rather than grab the country's oil and you get smirks and guffaws from the students. For these students, America has come to stand for jobs and income, not human rights. It is a way to get paid, they say. That is why these kids are happy to be going to an American university because it is the best way to get on the global gravy train.  For them, America is a good market, one of the students he talked to said, rather than a place with admirable values. In fact, one of the students told him, might makes right in America, does it not?  We were talking under the main gate, he says, of the American University of Beirut, which is inscribed with the words of its founders: ``That they may have life and have it more abundantly.'' But this is the generous spirit that educated generations of Arab leaders, and for decades the United States has been living off the good will that that helped to create, and it is beginning to wane.  He talks about how former presidents of the American University of Beirut have been killed, have been kidnapped and always live under threat. And yet, students are saying to him today, freedom in America has been abolished. One of the young girls said, Look at civil liberties. They do not exist any more in the United States. He says the degree of cynicism among these students is frightening.  Madam Speaker, as I close my remarks tonight, the writer encourages us to look at our basic values of human rights, of freedom and democracy, and give those precedence in all of our efforts towards peace, not just making money in the marketplace.                [From the Washington Post, June 6, 2003]                      America's Doubters in Beirut                          (By David Ignatius)       Beirut.--As President Bush was proclaiming America's role      as a peacemaker between Arabs and Israelis this week, I found      myself sitting on the steps of the American University of      Beirut, talking to some of the students whose generation will      have to transform this vision into reality.       The most hopeful thing I can say is that the students seem      to understand how powerful America is. And while Bush is far      from popular here, there seems to be growing respect for his      orneriness--for that laconic manner that just possibly might      be a match for the stubbornness of the Israelis and the      Palestinians.       But judging by the students' comments, Bush has a long way      to go in restoring America's status as a credible peacemaker.      These students, to put it bluntly, don't believe that America      is serious about its values. Suggest to them, for example,      that America really wants to advance democracy and freedom in      Iraq, rather than grab the country's oil, and you get smirks      and guffaws.       For these Arab students, America stands for jobs and      income, not human rights. It's a way to get paid. That's why      these kids are happy to be going to an American university--     because it's the best way to get on the global gravy train.       ``We still feel proud to be here. We're getting the best      degree in the best university in our region,'' says Maurice      Haddad, a bright 24-year-old majoring in information systems.      Like almost all the students I met, he wants to go to      graduate school in the States. But for him, America ``is a      good market,'' rather than a place with admirable values. In      America, ``might makes right,'' said one student bluntly.       We were talking under the main gate of AUB, which is      inscribed with the words its founders used in 1866 to      describe its mission: ``That they may have life and have it      more abundantly.'' The generous spirit educated generations      of Arab leaders, and for decades the United States has been      living off the goodwill it helped create.       I am a shameless fan of AUB. I sat here more than 20 years      ago with AUB President Malcolm Kerr shortly before he was      assassinated; I talked with AUB President David Dodge before      he was kidnapped; I began debating Arab bureaucracy with the      current AUB president, John Waterbury, in 1981. I deeply      admire these men and the university they have bravely      struggled to maintain.       But I had the sense this week that for the students, the      tank is beginning to run dry. ``Freedom in America has been      abolished,'' said a 21-year-old medical student named Lamia.      She offered a summary of court cases to buttress her argument      that civil liberties in America have been compromised in      Bush's jihad against terrorism.       The degree of cynicism among students is frightening. We      began talking about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, for example,      and nearly every student expressed doubt that Osama bin      Laden's suicide bombers had really toppled the twin towers.      ``It was a play to make it look like the Arabs did it,'' said      a young woman named Natalia.       When I asked the students how they could believe such      conspiratorial nonsense even though they had seen the      buildings collapse on television, they shouted our      alternative theories. ``The tape was altered,'' said one.      ``Technically those two buildings couldn't have collapsed      unless there were bombs set at the bottom,'' insisted      another. ``How could someone in a cave in Afghanistan have      done all that?'' Asked a third.       ``It's your fault!'' argued one young woman in a ponytail.      ``Your movies have taught us that any image can be      manipulated.''       Students can be forgiven for saying crazy things. But I      worry that their comments reflect a deeper problem.      Sociologists distinguish between the ``normative'' and      ``instrumental'' attributes of an institution or nation. For      past AUB students, America appeared to stand for normative      values. For this more cynical generation, America is instead      an instrumental machine for getting jobs and making money.       Waterbury took a laudable step this week in trying to      reconnect the Arab world with America and its values. Thanks      to a $5.2 million gift from Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal,      AUB will soon found a new center for American studies. Maybe      that will help.       AUB is an example of what people mean when they say ``soft      power.'' All the armor in America's awesome hard-power      military will end up rusting in the sand if Arabs don't come      to believe that those tanks represent a culture that promotes      freedom and democracy--and that America lives by those      values.
