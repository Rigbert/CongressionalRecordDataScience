 President, I thank the manager of the bill, my colleague from Ohio. I appreciate his sentiments.  Once in a while, by something we do, we can make a tangible and immediate difference in the lives of others. This is one such instance. In this case, what I hope to do is send an amendment to the desk, have Senator DeWine's second degree, and then I would like to speak to the underpinnings of this scholarship program, which some people call a voucher program, and my rationale as to why I think this Mayor's request to try a pilot small voucher program in the District of Columbia should be granted.  I begin by sending the amendment to the desk.
