Speaker, I thank Chairman Camp for his courage. I am not going to thank him for this bill, however, but I am going to vote for this bill.  Mr. Speaker, American families and businesses deserve certainty from their tax system--confidence, stability. I am glad we are able to move forward on this legislation rather than pursue a plan to make certain tax preferences permanent while ballooning our debt.  While I am supporting this tax extender package, Mr. Speaker, I do so with two very serious reservations. First, it adds the cost of extending this preference to our deficit. It is good, however, that we did not make unpaid-for extensions on a permanent basis, as the ranking member has just discussed.  Second, this is a very short-term fix when Congress needs to work toward a long-term solution. I join the ranking member in congratulating Mr. Camp for bringing that forward--well, at least he put it on the table. It didn't come forward.  We ought to make the research and experimentation tax credit permanent, but we need to pay for it. While this legislation allows teachers to deduct their out-of-pocket expenses, it does not give them the certainty that they will be able to do so in 2015 or beyond. To that extent, they are in the same position as everybody else covered by this bill will be.  Neither does this bill provide appropriate tax support for renewable energy, biofuels, and energy efficiency--sadly, the failure to extend this for at least 2 years may result in the loss of up to 30,000 jobs--nor, Mr. Speaker, does it provide long-term clarity on long-term bonus depreciation or small business expensing, all of which would give greater confidence to the growth of jobs.  This all speaks to a larger challenge that Congress has an opportunity to address in the new year; instead of this annual ritual of extending individual credits and deductions, we ought to engage in meaningful, comprehensive, and pro-growth tax reform that provides greater certainty across our economy to businesses and individuals alike.  We all know that doing so will not be easy. It will involve difficult choices on both sides of the aisle.  Again, Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate you. You had the courage to put forward a bill earlier this year that made tough decisions in order to show a path to lower rates and a simpler Code without adding to the deficit, but that path wasn't the path taken by the majority in this Congress.  Instead, the House voted on bill after bill after bill to cut taxes recklessly without any plan to stabilize the debt, invest in our future priorities, and create jobs in a meaningful way.  This package we will be voting on today is the least we can do. It isn't what I hoped for, and it isn't what I hoped I would stand in this well and urge my colleagues to support at the beginning of the 113th Congress, but it is better than many of the cynical alternatives that we have heard about.                              {time}  1630  I want to congratulate the ranking member and, frankly, the President of the United States for saying ``no'' to an irresponsible package.
