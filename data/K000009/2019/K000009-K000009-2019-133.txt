Foxx) for helping to organize this evening, as well as the dean of the North Carolina delegation,   David Price.  Truly, so many of us miss Walter Jones among us already. And we thank them for this Special Order, this order to celebrate the honorable life and service of the late Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina, a man of deep conscience and integrity. His word was his bond.  Madam Speaker, it is with a sense of true sadness, but abiding gratitude, that I rise tonight to join all of you as we pay tribute to our cherished friend and colleague, Walter, and offer sincerest condolences to his beloved wife, Joe Anne and daughter Ashley, to their friends, to their family, to his constituents in North Carolina, and friends across the country.  I also rise this evening in memory of his father, Walter Jones, Sr., with whom I had the privilege to serve when I was first elected to the Congress.  We both shared a great interest in maritime commerce. And so when Walter arrived in Congress, it was my great privilege to serve with his son.  So I was able to serve with Walter during his entire quarter century of exemplary service here in the House. And, yes, he was a man of deep conscience in an era of utter distraction. He exemplified exceptional honor, kindness, and a steady conviction that always stayed true.  I brought with me today a book Walter gave me entitled, ``Extortion'' by Peter Schweizer. And in it Walter inscribed the following message:       Marcy, may those of us who serve in the U.S. House work      together to return the House to the people and not let      ``special interests'' continue to influence policy. Thank you      for your friendship. God bless America.       Walter Jones.  At the time Walter wrote these words, he and I had been talking about a bipartisan effort to clean up Congress using our joint efforts, traveling to appropriate venues along the way to advance reform of our democracy, and get big money out of politics.  But as the months went by, it became clear that Walter would not be able to make this journey, and he bore his wounds with great dignity and in silence.  What a man of courage.  Walter, as others have said, had a deep passion for the people he represented--surely, the Marines of Camp Lejeune and their families and colleagues, as these photos attest.  He would always take to this House floor to compassionately recall their patriotic service. He never, ever forgot them.  The war in Iraq weighed so heavily on him, and his integrity required him to speak out. And he did, often.  His constituents knew the measure of this committed, modest man of sterling conviction.                              {time}  2015  Walter is held in highest esteem by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and he will be sorely missed.  A grateful nation thanks the people of the Third Congressional District of North Carolina, and I know all of his constituents join us in thanking Walter for his decades of public service and his family for all of their sacrifices because he so conscientiously and selflessly dedicated himself to our Nation.  He was true; he was reflective; he was faithful; and he was a patriot. His spirit lives right here. I can feel it myself as a beacon across this Congress and as a shining star for all to come with integrity and moral conviction.  May God bring comfort to his family, and may his strength shower them to move through this period of deep mourning and come into the sunlight again.
