 President, Congress has increased the priority of the war on drugs in recent years. We've allocated nearly $300 million in additional funds to the U.S. Customs Service since 1996.  And I think all of us know that the Southwest Border is still, without question, ground zero in U.S. drug interdiction efforts, with more than 70% of the cocaine and other narcotics entering this country across the 2,000 mile stretch of border between our country and Mexico.  To meet this threat Congress authorized more than $100 million over the last two years to add 650 inspectors and employ state of the art technologies along the Southwest border. The President's budget in fiscal year 1999 calls for an additional $104 million for Southwest Border narcotics efforts.  So you can imagine my surprise when I opened yesterday's edition of the Los Angeles Times to read the following:       The amount of cocaine seized at the commercial ports of      entry along the U.S./Mexico border plummeted 84% in 1997,      forcing U.S. Customs Service officials to develop a new drug      fighting strategy and leaving them concerned about a backlash      in Congress.  Well, Mr. President there is a backlash from this United States Senator because for five and a half years now I have sounded a constant drumbeat on Treasury and on Customs to stop the mixed missions of the Customs Department and understand that there is a major problem with cocaine coming across the Southwest Border. Frankly an 84% drop in seizures last year indicates that all of the money and all of the personnel we have been pumping in has simply not done the job. 84% at the Southwest border, and cocaine seizures are down 15% across the nation.  If someone could tell me the reason for the drop is because, overall, there is less cocaine coming into the country--I'd say, congratulations, our efforts have been successful.  But that doesn't appear to be the case. Narcotics intelligence officials continue to warn that an estimated 5 to 7 tons of cocaine enters this country every single day of the year. We are just not getting it.  If someone could tell me that the drop along the Southwest Border is because our efforts have been so successful, that the drug smugglers are going elsewhere--I'd say bravo, the taxpayers' money has been well spent.  But, again, that does not appear to be the case. Customs officials are widely quoted in news reports saying the problem is that the drug traffickers continue to stay two steps ahead of our interdiction efforts. And in fact, that is the case.  Let me again quote from this article:       Customs officials received a warning in June 1997 that      portions of the agency's enforcement strategy at the ports      had been compromised. A June 20, 1997 memo from Assistant      Commissioner Robert S. Trotter to all Southwest border port      directors warned that ``traffickers have developed detailed      knowledge and profiles of our port operations''.  More than once, Customs officials have come into my office to tell me that--not only is it not possible to increase inspection of trucks and cars entering our border, obviously because there are so many of them--it is not really necessary, because today we are applying sophisticated technology, including electronic technology, random searches, and Customs' vast intelligence operations and all of that combined is enough to do the job.  Four years ago I went and spent a day at the Otay Mesa port at the Southwest border. I observed, directly adjacent to our Customs facilities, ``spotters'' who are individuals standing out on the street with radios and cellular telephones. I then went up to a hill overlooking the Customs facility and I watched the spotters work. They get on their phones and they talk to the trucks waiting to cross the border and they direct the trucks as to which lines they should be in to get through the border.  I mentioned this at the highest levels of the Treasury, both verbally and in writing. I said that we must do something about the spotters. Four years later, the spotters are still there, they are still operational. I am told that there is no law under which we can do anything about it. Unfortunately, at no time has Customs come forward in this four year period with any recommendations for any laws to be passed to deter this activity which is almost certainly an illegal conspiracy to bring cocaine into this country across the Southwest border.  The ``random'' searches that I have heard so much about are supposed to keep traffickers trembling in their big-rigs. But they have become so predictable that, by Customs' own admission, ``traffickers know what cargo, conveyances, or passengers we inspect, how many of those conveyances are checked on an average day, what lanes we work harder, and what lanes are more accessible for smuggling.''  Now, Mr. President, I am not insensitive to how difficult this task is, and I want to commend the extremely hard working men and women of the United States Customs Service. I know many of them personally. I know they work hard. I know they try to do their job. They put on those uniforms every day, they inhale all of these exhaust fumes, and they try to keep up with what has been a massive increase in traffic coming across the border.  But, Mr. President, I do not like to be told how effective our intelligence is, and how sophisticated our technology is, and how tough our enforcement efforts are--and then read reports in the newspaper from Customs' officials about how easily the traffickers are walking all over us.  I do appreciate the candor from Acting Commissioner Sam Banks on the weaknesses in our efforts. And I understand that Customs is moving very rapidly to counter this 84% drop in seizures with a new operation entitled ``Operation Brass Ring''. They clearly know that what they are doing is insufficient.  For some time, I have believed that the mixed mission given by the Administration to the United States Customs Service creates a situation whereby the law enforcement functions of the United States Customs Service cannot be carried out properly.  You cannot run an agency with a mixed mission, especially a mission that has the kind of a diametrically different goals that Customs faces. Move the trucks by the millions, just do random searches, depend only on technology, and avoid statistics like the one that just appeared in the Los Angeles Times with an 84% drop in seizures in cocaine coming across the Southwest border.  I have urged the Administration to appoint a law enforcement person as the new Commissioner of Customs. I am heartened to understand that the Administration has just signed off on the appointment of Ray Kelly as the new Commissioner of the U.S. Customs Service.  I have worked with Mr. Kelly over the past few years as he has been the Secretary for Enforcement in the Treasury Department. I believe he is a straight shooter. He is a law enforcement person. He has an exemplary background. I hope that he will be able to redirect the Customs Service to understand that they do have a law enforcement mission. And, in fact, that that mission is to deter contraband from coming across the border of the United States.  We also know, Mr. President, that guns in large supply are moving from this country down to Mexico. These guns are used for two purposes. One is to give them to the cartels for their use and the second is for revolutionary insurrection against the government of Mexico.  I believe that the work of the United States Customs is really cut out for them. In the best of all worlds, trade will continue to increase across the Southwest Border, providing jobs and income for those on both sides of the border.  But if we are serious about the drug threat--as we say we are--we must demand that the law enforcement functions of deterring contraband be made the highest mission of the United States Customs Service.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``Drop in Drug Seizures Worries U.S. Customs'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 4, 1998]               Drop in Drug Seizures Worries U.S. Customs                             (By H.G. Reza)       San Diego--The amount of cocaine seized at the commercial      ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted 84% in      1997, forcing U.S. Customs Service officials to develop a new      drug-fighting strategy and leaving them concerned about a      backlash in Congress.       Bill Heffelsinger, assistant to acting customs Commissioner      Samuel H. Banks, said Tuesday that inspectors working at the      high-risk commercial ports on the Southwest border      confiscated 2,383 pounds of cocaine last year, compared to      15,114 pounds in 1996.       Nationwide, the quantity of cocaine seized by the agency      dropped 15% last year to 159,475 pounds, compared to 187,947      pounds in 1996, Heffelsinger added. The total number of      seizures by customs agents and inspectors of all kinds of      drugs was a record 26,240 nationwide last year, authorities      said.       Acting Commissioner Banks, in an interview Tuesday, said      the drop in cocaine seizures is worrisome. ``You look at      those numbers and you want to be your own worst critic,''      Banks said. ``You're going to be asked questions on [Capitol]      Hill, and we have to provide answers [for how to stop the      flow of drugs].''       Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said Tuesday he was      disappointed by customs' failure to seize more cocaine at the      commercial ports.       ``Congress has directed almost every possible resource      toward drug interdiction efforts, including more agents,      better technology and several hundred million dollars in      additional funding,'' said Packard. ``These are not the      results we expected. If interdiction is down, the American      people deserve some answers.''       Customs officials hope to find answers through Operation      Brass Ring, a new nationwide drug interdiction strategy      launched by the agency this week. Officials said the      operation is part of a broader five-year program by the      Office of National Drug Control Policy to reduce by 50% the      amount of illegal drugs entering the country and, according      to a news release, ``was designed almost entirely in the      field by . . . inspectors, investigators and union      representatives.''       Memos obtained by The Times show that the new strategy      comes at a time of concern among customs union officials over      possible political repercussions resulting from the drop in      the amount of cocaine caught at the commercial ports.       A Nov. 28, 1997, National Treasury Employees Union memo      noted that Congress had authorized $64 million in funding in      1997 for 657 new enforcement positions along the Southwest      border as part of Operation Hard Line, the drug interdiction      plan in effect at the time.       Hard Line was launched in 1995 after The Times reported      that there had been virtually no cocaine seizures at the      biggest commercial ports on the U.S.-Mexico border, where      thousands of trucks cross daily.       The union memo predicted that ``no doubt Congress will be      highly upset with these [1997] figures . . . border drug      interdiction is becoming a major political issue in      Washington.''       Another union memo on Dec. 22 said new ``enforcement      operations'' were needed and urged inspectors to be flexible      and imaginative in their approach to drug interdiction.       ``The objective being to increase our seizures so customs      and [the union] don't get their heads handed to them by the      politicians in Washington when the budget meetings start in      March,'' the memo said.       Robert Tobias, president of the employees union, said he      would not apologize for the blunt talk in the memos.       ``This was me doing my job as president to inform [members]      what the stakes are,'' said Tobias. ``There's nothing wrong      with telling people that if you don't get off your duff      you're in danger of losing your job. Brass Ring is a wake-up      call to all of us involved in fighting drugs.''       On Tuesday, Banks said he was pleased that the president's      proposed customs operating budget for 1999, publicly      announced Tuesday, was $1.8 billion, up from $1.7 billion in      1998. That budget must still be approved by Congress.       Banks said he was willing to publicly admit some of the      agency's enforcement problems ``so we can get the issue out      there, even if it's critical to us.''       ``I'm willing to take it on the chin if necessary to get      the message out, so we can focus on the drug problem,'' said      Banks. ``I want to get the message out to the American public      so they can deal with it in the community and in schools.''       Banks said Brass Ring will ``dramatically increase drug      seizures'' at the 24 points of entry on the U.S.-Mexico      border.       ``The push for Brass Ring is to turn up the heat internally      and get people focused. We're trying to get people focused.      We're trying to put the heat on ourselves,'' Banks said.       A Nov. 28, 1997, report by the union said that      ``intelligence sources are reporting that 5 to 7 tons of      illegal drugs are being smuggled from Mexico to the U.S.      every day.''       In the interview Tuesday, Banks said he does not dispute      the union's figures.       Concern over the declining cocaine interdiction figures      arose in September, when Banks reported in a memo to customs      employees that he had met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, head of      the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The Sept. 18,      1997, memo said that ``we were asked some tough questions      about the effectiveness of our various operations, and we did      not always have convincing answers.''       Heffelsinger said the biggest problem in customs'      interdiction plan had been its predictability.       In 1997, 3.5 million trucks and rail cars crossed into the      United States from Mexico at the commercial ports along the      border from Texas to California and about 30% were inspected      for narcotics, customs officials said. An equal number of      trucks and rail cars crossed in 1996, and 25% were inspected      for drugs that year, they added.       However, ``we aren't as unpredictable as we would like to      be. The goal of Brass Ring is to get back to being      unpredictable,'' Heffelsinger said.       Customs officials received a warning in June 1997 that      portions of the agency's enforcement strategy at the ports      had been compromised. A June 20, 1997, memo from Assistant      Commissioner Robert S. Trotter to all Southwest border port      directors warned that ``traffickers have developed detailed      knowledge and profiles of our port operations.''       Trotter said that spotters, commonly used by drug rings to      warn of enforcement activity at the ports, ``have determined      what cargo, conveyance or passengers we inspect, how many of      those conveyances are checked on an average day, what lanes      we work harder and what lanes are more accessible for      smuggling.''       Banks acknowledged that customs has still not learned how      to defeat the spotters, who work in the open on the U.S. side      at the gates to the commercial ports.       ``There's no question that people are sitting at the ports,      shepherding loads and acting as guides,'' said Banks. ``We're      trying to turn the tables on them and use them against      themselves. Counter surveillance is part of [the Brass Ring      strategy], but I can't say more.''
