Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Tiberi-Castle amendment.  I visit a school almost every week in my district; and I talk to a lot of teachers, parents, administrators, and, yes, school board officials, too. I have always believed in strong local control, that the folks at the local level know best what they need to do for their students and their teachers and their systems.  This is not a mandate. This amendment allows the school district to participate if they choose to participate. It is their decision, not some boilerplate language that comes down from on high.                              {time}  1615  Now, as I have been listening to the debate for the last few minutes, I hear a number of Members on the other side of the issue in fact saying these words. They talk about we need to look at and define what the needs of our school districts are; ``we'' being, I guess, the Federal Government. No, the locals need to decide what is best for the needs of their school districts, and that is exactly what this amendment does. The school districts themselves determine what their needs are. They alone decide whether they want to participate or not, and whether it be teacher training or the Safe and Drug Free School Act, technology training, or all those things.  No, they cannot steal money from title I, but they can put some of this money into title I to expand that program. The flexibility is there. If my colleagues are for local control, if they want those decisions made at the local level, they need to vote for the Tiberi-Castle amendment.
