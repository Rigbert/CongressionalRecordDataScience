President, today, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia has again held the line-item veto unconstitutional. I respect the decision of Judge Thomas F. Hogan. I respect it not only because his analysis is consistent with that which led me to oppose this legislation when it was being considered by the Senate. I also respect it because it was right as a matter of constitutional law and as a means to preserve the separation of powers that is so central to the checks and balances that preserve our freedoms and liberty.  We hear a lot of speeches around here condemning judges. Here is a Judge who has done his job and stood up for the Constitution against the ill-advised action of the political branches.  It is not our independent federal judiciary that is upsetting the limits of government and fundamental freedoms of us all. Congress has shown a dangerous tendency over the last few years to ignore constitutional limits on Federal legislative branch authority. Maybe it is Members of Congress who need to read the Constitution and consider its wisdom.  The last week of its last term, the United States Supreme Court struck down three congressional actions as unconstitutional, including the so-called Communications Decency Act and the Brady Act, both of which I voted against. The Supreme Court withheld ruling on the line-item veto law at that time, because it held that the plaintiffs in that case were without standing to bring the challenge. It was just a matter of time and occasion. The decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the earlier case had presaged the ruling today. The line-item veto was and is unconstitutional. I proudly stand with Senator Byrd on this matter.  I would ask Congress to step back from this specific decision and consider how unprecedented this is: Four statutes that do not comport with the constitutional limits on congressional authority overturned from a single Congress.  It is unfortunate that Congress is far too often overstepping its constitutional bounds. It is unfortunate that the courts have to rein Congress in from time to time, with increasing frequency as the Republican majority loses its moorings, but that is the thankless responsibility of the courts under our system of checks and balances.  I have come to this floor often in the last several months to defend the judiciary against shrill attacks. I come today to offer my continuing gratitude and respect for our co-equal branch of government. We are the envy of the world in part because our free and independent judicial branch has served our country so well for more than 200 years.  We should be doing more to keep it that way, not less. We are finally beginning to consider longstanding judicial nominations to fill the vacancies that plague the federal judiciary and threaten the administration of justice. We need to do more. We should consider without further delay the judiciary's requests for the resources that they need. We should consider S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act, which I introduced at the request of the Judicial Conference to provide an additional 55 judges where needed around the country. We should act on S. 394, which I sponsored with Senator Hatch to unlink judicial salaries from our own. We should consider and confirm qualified nominees to the 83 vacancies to the federal courts.  Finally, I hope that members of Congress will rethink the rush to propose amendment to our Constitution and consider how well our fundamental charter serves us. We do not need to rewrite the Constitution, we need to respect it and act in accordance with its design.                          ____________________
