Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to cuts in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. There are those who say we should abolish public radio and sell public television to cable. To those of my colleagues, I say to you, there are people in our country who cannot afford to pay $400 a year for cable. There are those who will be left out and left behind, those who will be left in the dark, left in silence.  I know what it is like growing up in rural America. I grew up on a small farm just outside Troy, AL, in the heart of the segregated South.  Radio was my window to the larger world. It was on the radio that I first heard the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. I heard his voice--the voice of the civil rights movement--and it became my cause, my purpose and my mission for the next 30 years of my life. That voice changed my life and the lives of millions of Americans.  Today, public broadcasting reaches out across this country, bringing nonviolent children's shows, news, and job training programs. It brings light and hope into every corner of this Nation. Some of my colleagues say we cannot afford public broadcasting. I say, can we afford to live without it?                          ____________________
