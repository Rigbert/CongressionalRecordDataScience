 Speaker, I became involved in this issue several years ago when I took women who were struggling with breast cancer across the border from Vermont and they were able to purchase the breast cancer drug Tamoxifen for one-tenth of the price that they paid in the United States. Mr. Speaker, tonight we must end the national disgrace of Americans being forced to pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.  Tonight, in terms of safety, we must understand that one million Americans have gone to Canada to buy their medicine without one death, without one problem. To the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin), yes, the death of one baseball player is a tragedy; but it is a far greater tragedy that millions of elderly people in this country are suffering, and in some cases dying, because they cannot afford prescription drugs. And the issue tonight is do we stand up to the money interests and protect the American people or are they going to buy the House of the people? Let us stand tall.
