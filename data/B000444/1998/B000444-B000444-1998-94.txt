 President, prevention works. Giving kids an option works. It works in my State of Delaware, and it works nationwide. The people who recognize it most are the law enforcement community.  Let me give you a quote from William Bratton, former New York and now Boston Police Commissioner. Boston has had a phenomenal--phenomenal--success in controlling murder rates, handguns with youth, and violent crime. Here is what he said:       Those of us who have been on the front lines know that, in      the long run, winning the war on crime also will require      cutting the enemy's key supply line: its ability to turn kids      into criminals. Each day gangs and drug dealers assiduously      recruit our children for their army. To fight back, we have      to utilize other powerful crimefighting weapons--the proven      ``right-start'' programs and strategies that give kids the      armor of values, skills, and positive experiences to ward off      crime and violence.  This is one of the toughest cops in the Nation. He is saying the way we keep this from happening is to go out there and engage in prevention activities.  The Buffalo Police Commissioner--I will not go through it --eight juvenile justice directors, the National Association of Counties, say:       Be it resolved that not less than 25 percent of block grant      funds be set aside for prevention programs.  Prevention programs.  Police Executive Research Forum; the Catholic Charities of the United States of America; Mark Klaas of the Klaas Foundation for Kids; Patrick Murphy, former police commissioner of New York, Detroit, Washington DC, and Syracuse; the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, who is a tough crime-fighting guy --he says:       It's time to invest in the programs proven to cut the      enemy's most important supply line--its ability to turn kids      into criminals.  Prevention.  The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Los Angeles County District Attorney--the list goes on. I will not take my colleagues' time, but I ask unanimous consent that their statements be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: What Police, Prosecutors, Crime Victims and Other Experts are Saying                    About How To Fight Youth Violence     170 Police Chiefs, Sheriffs & Prosecutors, the Presidents of          the Fraternal Order of Police and International Union of          Police Associations, and Leaders of Crime Victim          Organizations       As police, prosecutors, and crime survivors, we struggle      every day against crime and its devastating impact. We are      determined to see that dangerous criminals are arrested and      put behind bars. But anyone who thinks that jailing a      criminal is enough to undo the agony that crime leaves in its      wake hasn't seen crime up close. That is why no one knows      better that we--that the most important weapons against crime      are the investments which keep kids from becoming criminals--     investments which enable all children to get the right start      they need to become contributing citizens, and which     show them that as adults they will be able to meet their      families' basic needs through honest hard work.--Source: A      Call For Action From America's Front Line Against Crime      (February 5, 1998).

Buffalo Police Commissioner Gil Kerlikowske       If Congress is serious about fighting crime, it won't      pretend just building more jails is going to solve the      problem. Those on the front lines know we'll win the war on      crime when Congress boosts investments in early childhood      programs. Head Start, health care for kids, after-school and      mentoring and recreational programs. We'll win when we're      ready to invest our tax dollars in America's most      vulnerable kids, instead of waiting until they become      America's most wanted kids.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest      in Kids, News Release (July 24, 1997).     Sheriff Fred W. Scoralick, President, National Sherrifs          Association       It is becoming ever more apparent that increasing law      enforcement, increasing prosecution of juveniles, and      building more jails and prisons is neither sufficient nor      adequately effective in stemming the tide of youth violence      and crime . . .  We must adopt a three-pronged approach to      juvenile violence--prevention, intervention, and enforcement.      . . . We can no longer afford to focus only on treating the      symptoms while ignoring the disease. . . . The challenge      facing us as sheriffs, parents, and community residents in      America, is to take what is known about youth violence and      apply it now to reach at-risk youth before they take their      first step into the world of crime, and to deal firmly with      those who are already in trouble.--Source: Sheriff Magazine,      President's Message: Addressing Youth Violence (January-     February 1998).     Eight State Juvenile Justice Directors       At-risk juveniles and juvenile delinquents are at a crucial      turning point in their lives. Crime-prevention programs that      target this age group are not only essential but also cost-     effective when considering the alternative--a person who      spends part of all of his adulthood in the state prison      system. The success of federally-supported programs in each      of the states in our region prove, convincingly, the value of      investing in prevention efforts aimed at juveniles.--Source:      Letter from Juvenile Justice Directors of Delaware, New York,      New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey, Rhode Island,      Puerto Rico, and Vermont (March 5, 1998).

Catholic Charities USA       We know prevention programs work. We ask that funds for      prevention be set aside to guarantee funding for prevention      programs. Our children, even our troubled and at-risk      children, are our future. Shouldn't we make the investment to      keep today's children from becoming tomorrow's criminals?--     Source: Letter from Catholic Charities USA (September 23,      1997).     American Red Cross       The American Red Cross believes that at least 30% of any      funds block granted to the states should be allocated      specifically to fun on-going, experienced, non-profit, and      community based youth development, prevention, and after-care      programs.--Source: Letter from Maria Smith, National      Volunteer Specialist, Government Relations (July 7, 1997).     Mark Klaas, Klaas Foundation for Kids       Congress should invest in the proven programs that can help      kids get the right start, not wait for more innocent      Americans to get hurt or killed and then pretend that prisons      are a substitute for prevention. No punishment can undo a      crime. It is a tragedy--and a travesty--that too few      politicians are even talking about making investments that      help children become caring citizens instead of brutal      criminals.--Source: Fight Crime; Invest in Kids, News Release      (July 24, 1997).     Patrick Murphy, Former Police Commissioner in New York,          Detroit, Washington, D.C. and Syracuse       When police chiefs hear someone say we can't afford      investments in programs that help kids get the right start,      we see more bright yellow crime scene tape, more prisons, and      thousands of good men and women and boys and girls lying in      pools of blood.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, New      Release (July 3, 1997).

United States Conference of Mayors       We stand ready to support juvenile crime legislation which      is flexible both in terms of the requirements states must      meet to receive funds and the purposes for which the funds      may be used. Specifically, we believe that the legislation      should . . . increase the portion of the funds which may be      used for prevention and treatment, and assure that there is      sufficient funding available for these purposes.--Source:      Letter from Jerry Abramson, Chair, Task Force on Youth      Violence, February 11, 1998.     Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti       We need a multi-pronged approach. We must attack juvenile      crime before it starts by using effective crime prevention      programming. We also must recognize that there are violent      juvenile criminals, particularly gang members, whose crimes      are very serious, whose punishment should be severe and for      whom lengthy incarceration is appropriate.--Source: Testimony      Before the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth, and      Families, April 7, 1997.     Winston-Salem Chief of Police George Sweat       Our fight against crime needs to start in the high chair,      not wait for the electric chair. When Congress and state      legislatures ignore child care and after-school programs,      they force police to fight crime with one hand tied behind      our backs.     Mecklenburg County District Attorney Peter Gilchrist       Prosecutors know America will never win the war on crime      until it invests more in getting kids the right start. We can      pay now or pay later.--Source: Charlotte Observer (October      28, 1996).     Raleigh Police Chief Mitchell Brown       Politicians need to decide if they'd rather just strut like      gang members out to prove they're the toughest on their turf,      or pay attention to all the overwhelming proof that they      could dramatically cut crime if they'd only invest in      programs for kids.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, News      Release (July 24, 1997).     Jean Lewis, President, National Organization of Parents of          Murdered Children       To make America safe, we need to be as willing to guarantee      our kids space in child care or an after-school program as we      are to guarantee a criminal room and board in a prison cell.      If we want to do more than flex our muscles and talk about      crime--if we want to really keep Americans safe--we must      start investing in the programs we know can steer kids down      the right path.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, Quality      Child Care and After-School Programs (February, 1998).     Knoxville Police Chief Phil Keith       When we know the peak hours for juvenile crime are between      3:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon, it's just common sense to      provide after school programs. When studies show that denying      at-risk kids participation in a high school enrichment      program quadrupled the chance that they would be arrested,      and that excluding them from early childhood programs made      them five times more likely to become chronic lawbreakers as      adults, it's just common sense to include those programs in      our juvenile crime strategy.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest in      Kids, News Release (July 24, 1997).     Ellen Halbert, Crime Victim, Former Vice-Chair Texas Board of          Criminal Justice       When politicians focus only on closing jail doors after a      crime has been committed, they're leaving the door wide open      for more innocent people to become crime victims.      Shortsighted policies like these are a prescription for      disaster.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, News Release      (July 24, 1997).

Bloomingdale Police Chief Gary Schira, President of the          Illinois Association of Chiefs of Police       Our most powerful weapons to make Illinois safe for our      families are investments in the proven programs that help      kids get the right start, so they become contributing      citizens instead of criminals.--Source: Fight Crime: Invest      in Kids (Illinois), News Release (April 30, 1997).     McClean County States Attorney Charles Reynard       I work every day to see that dangerous criminals are behind      bars. But we'll just be on a treadmill, with new kids being      recruited to take the place of the ones we lock up until we      invest in the child development and parenting support and      health care programs that have been proven to keep kids from      becoming criminals in the first place.

John Dilulio, Princeton University       Strategically, the key to preventing youth crime and      substance abuse among our country's expanding juvenile      population is to improve the real, live, day-to-day      connections between responsible adults and young people--     period. Whether it emanates from the juvenile justice system      or from the community, from government agencies or from civil      institutions, from faith-based programs or secular ones, from      non-profits or for-profits or public/private partnerships,      from structural theorists or cultural theorists, from veteran      probation officers or applied econometricians, no policy,      program or intervention that fails to build meaningful      connections between responsible adults and at-risk young      people has worked or can.       [I]f we really care about getting a handle on our present      and impending youth crime and substance abuse problems, then      the time has come to proceed inductively building meaningful      connections between at-risk youth and responsible adults via      existing community-based programs; focusing on the highly      particular and often banal barriers to helping at-risk youth      in particular places with particular people at particular      times; having the money to fix a broken pipe that flooded the      inner-city church basement where a ``latch-key'' ministry      operates; finding a way to transport a young job-seeker from      a public housing site to a private job site; getting police      and probation officers in a particular neighborhood to work      together on a daily basis; funding an incremental expansion      of a well-established national or local mentoring program;      and so on.--Source: Address to the National District      Attorneys Association, July 14, 1997.
