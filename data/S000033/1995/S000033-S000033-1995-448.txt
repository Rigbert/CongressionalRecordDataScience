 Speaker, this week the new memorial on The Mall to the brave Americans who fought in the Korean war was dedicated. It is long overdue that we have lasting tribute in our Nation's Capital to the near 1.5 million Americans from Vermont and all across our Nation who answered the call to stop North Korean aggression in the 1950's.  I hope there will be many occasions when Vermonters will be able to visit this powerful work of art and to honor those who fought and those who died in the Korean conflict.  I also want to call to the attention of my colleagues that Frank Gaylord of Barre, VT, who saw extensive combat action in World War II as a member of the 17th Airborne Division, 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment, is the sculptor of the column of 19 poncho-swathed soldiers featured in the Korean War Memorial.  Frank Gaylord has been a professional sculptor for 44 years, having received his bachelor of fine arts degree from Temple University in 1950. He returned to Vermont where he has worked in his own sculpture studio in Barre, VT for 38 years.  He has been chosen to create sculpture for municipalities, States, and educational institutions throughout the United States and Canada, including statues of Pope John Paul II, U.S. President Calvin Coolidge from Vermont, and Martin Luther King, Jr. He is equally comfortable designing sculpture using granite, marble, resin, or metal as a medium.  Frank Gaylord's latest composition at the Korean War Memorial is a moving reminder to all of us of the power of art. The Washington Post, in applauding his work, affirms that Gaylord's soldiers stand unpretentiously for the common soldiers of all wars.  I am proud that one of Vermont's native sons has bestowed this gift upon all of us, especially our Nation's deserving Korean war veterans.  I also ask that the text of a feature article about the Korean War Memorial that appeared on July 22, 1995, in the Washington Post be reprinted in the Congressional Record following this statement.               [From the Washington Post, July 22, 1995] A March to Remember--Moving Monument to Korea Veterans Surpasses the                      Tortured History of Its Design                          (By Benjamin Forgey)       When the Korean War Veterans Memorial is dedicated next      Thursday--the 42nd anniversary of the armistice ending the      war--veterans and their families will be celebrating an honor      long overdue.       They can also celebrate a work of beauty and power. Given      the tortured history of the memorial's design, this seems      almost a miracle. But there it is. Situated on proud symbolic      turf southeast of the monument to Lincoln, in equipoise with      the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to Lincoln's north, the Korean      memorial is a worthy addition to the national Mall.       Despite some big flaws, our newest memorial is incredibly      moving. And what could have been its most glaring weakness--a      column of realistically sculpted soldiers in combat      formation--turned out to be its major strength. Unheralded      sculptor Frank Gaylord of Barre, Vt., created 19 figures that      are convincing individually and as a group.       It is a case of art rendering argument superfluous. There      were obvious dangers in the concept of a memorial featuring a      column of battle-ready soldiers. If excessively realistic,      they could be off-putting. If strung out in too orderly a      row, they could be deadeningly static. And yet, if      inordinately animated, they could be seen as glorifying war.      Indeed, in one of Gaylord's early versions, they came      perilously close to doing just that.       But in the end, none of this happened. Placed dynamically      on a triangular field of low juniper shrubs and cast in      stainless steel at a scale slightly larger than life, these      gray, wary troopers unself-consciously invite the empathy of      all viewers, veteran and non-veteran alike.       The sculptures and triangular ``field of service'' are one      of three major elements in the memorial. With an American      flag at its point, the field gently ascends to a shallow,      circular ``pool of remembrance'' framed by a double row of      braided linden trees. There also is a memorial wall.'' Made      of huge slabs of polished black granite, each etched with      shadowy faces of support troops--nurses, chaplains, supply      clerks, truck drivers and so on--the 164-foot wall forms a      subtly dramatic background for the statues. High on the      eastern end of the wall, where it juts into the pool of      water, is a terse inscription. Freedom is not free.       The memorial was designed by Cooper Lecky Architects of      Washington--although, in an important sense, the firm acted      like the leader of a collaborative team. Important      contributions were made by Gaylord and Louis Nelson, the New      York graphic designer of the memorial wall, and also by the      Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board and the reviewing      agencies, especially the Commission of Fine Arts.       Not to be forgotten are the four architects from      Pennsylvania State University who won the design competition      back in the spring of 1989--John Paul Lucas, Veronica Burns      Lucas, Don Alvaro Leon and Eliza Pennypacker Oberholtzer.      This team dropped out after it became apparent that its      original design would have to be altered significantly to      pass muster with the advisory board, reviewing agencies and      others. The team sued, and lost, in federal court.       Key elements of the competition design remain in the final      product--particularly the central idea of a column of      soldiers moving toward a goal. But the finished product is a      big improvement over the initial scheme. It's smaller and      more accomodating--not only was the number of soldiers cut in      half (the original called for 38 figures), but also a vast      open plaza was eliminated in favor of the contemplative,      shaded pool. It's easier to get into and out of--the clarity      of its circulation pattern is outstanding. Its landscaping is      more natural--among other things, the original called for a      grove of plane trees to be clipped ``torturously,'' as a      symbol of war. The symbolism of the memorial is now simple      and clear.       Still, Cooper-Lecky and the advisory board went through      many versions, and many heartbreaks, on the way to getting a      design approved--and the finished memorial shows the strain      of the long, contentious process. It cannot be said that this      memorial possesses the artistic grandeur and solemnity of the      Lincoln Memorial. It does not have the aesthetic unity of      Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans wall. It is not quite so      compelling a combination of the noble and the everyday as      Henry Merwin Shrady's Grant Memorial at the other end of the      Mall. But this is to put the new memorial in elevated      company--together with the Washington Monument, these are our      finest expressions      of memorial art. To say that the Korean War memorial even      comes close is a tribute.       Without question, its worst feature is a sequence of      parallel strips of polished black granite in the ``field of      service.'' Unattractive and unneeded, they threaten to reduce      the soldiers' advance to the metaphorical level of a football      game. And on one side of the field, they end in obtrusive,      triangular blocks of granite, put there to discourage      visitors from walking onto the granite ribbons. The junipers      may in time cover the strips--at least, one can hope--but      these bumps, unfortunately, will remain bumps.       The wall gets a mixed review. A clever if somewhat      shameless adaptation of Maya Lin's idea--with faces rather      than names etched in--it honors support troops, who always      outnumber those on the front lines. It is beautifully made.      The heads are real ones from photographs in Korean War      archives, digitally altered so that the light source is      always coming from the direction of the flag. The etching is      wonderfully subtle: The faces seem to float in a reflective      gray mist. The wall tugs the heartstrings, for sure, but it's      also a bit obvious, a bit much. It has the feel of a      superfluous theatrical trick.       Fortunately, the wall does not interfere too much with the      sculpture, which from the beginning has been the primary      focus of this memorial, It was an extraordinary challenge,      one of the great figurative commissions of the late 20th      century, and Gaylord came through. To walk down from the      Lincoln Memorial and catch a first, apparitional glimpse of      the soldiers, as they stalk from under the tree cover, is      quite a thrill. Even from a distance and from the back, the      gray figures are compelling.       And, as choreographed on that field, they become more      compelling the closer you get until, with a certain shock,      you find yourself standing almost within touching distance of      the first figure: a soldier who involves you in the movement      of the patrol by turning his head sharply and signaling--     Beware!--with the palm of his left hand. He is a startling,      daring figure and, with his taut face and that universal      gesture of caution, he announces the beginning of a tense      drama.       It is an old device, familiar in baroque painting and      sculpture, to involve the viewer directly in the action by      posture, gesture, facial expression. Gaylord adapted it      masterfully here: The figures look through you or over your      shoulders, enveloping the space beyond the memorial with      their eyes. The air fairly crackles with the vitality of      danger. The soldiers communicate tersely among themselves,      too--in shouted commands or gestures and glances.       The most critical contact, though, may be that first one,      between the visitor and that initial soldier. His mouth is      open--you can almost hear him hissing an urgent command. You      slow down, and then you behold the field before you. There is      fatigue and alertness everywhere you look. Each figure and      each face is as charged as the next. Appropriately, the gray      metal surfaces are not polished and shined. Gaylord's rough      treatment of the matte surfaces adds to the nervous intensity      of the piece       It is quite a feat to give such figures such a feeling of      movement--they're only walking, after all, and they're      carrying heavy burdens. But Gaylord performed that feat, 19      times--he proved himself a master of contrapposto, another      time-honored sculptural technique. Underneath the gray      ponchos and the weight of the stuff on their backs, these      figures twist from hip to shoulder and neck. Some shift      dramatically, some just enough, so that the ensemble takes on      an extraordinary animation. Every gesture seems perfectly      calculated to reinforce the irony. These ghostly soldiers in      their wind blown ponchos seem intensely real.       Dedicated to the concepts of service, duty and patriotism,      the new memorial stands in sharp contrast to its companion      across the Reflecting Pool. But the Korean and Vietnam      memorials make a complementary, not a contradictory, pair. In      honoring the sacrifices of soldiers in Vietnam, Lin's great      V-shaped wall invokes a cycle of life and death, and      physically reaches out to the Mall's symbols of union and      democracy.       The Korean War Veterans Memorial is more straightforward,      and speaks directly of a specific time and place. Yet it      attains an unmistakable universality of its own. Gaylord's      soldiers (and Marines and airmen) served in Korea, yes. But      they also stand unpretentiously for the common soldiers of      all wars.
