 Mr. LaTOURETTE. I thank the majority leader for yielding.  I just wanted to add on our side, in happier times--and I know you won't agree with me, but I define happier times as when the Republicans were in the majority--a number of us had the opportunity to spend very long evenings in the chair as the Speaker's representative, during the appropriations process in particular.  I know it won't come as a surprise to Members, but when you've heard that 50th speech on the National Endowment for the Arts or the 40th observation about whether or not an IUD is an abortifacient, you have some time on your hands when you're in the chair and you get to know people. And one of the people that you get to know is Gay Topper. Professionalism is right. And I tell Mr. Kildee, I found out she was a Democrat after about 10 years of being up there.                              {time}  1200  But you get to know people. You get to know people, and you also get to know the professionalism.  A lot of us think on each side somehow the Chair is rigged up there. Well, it is not rigged. I can remember a debate one evening when a Member, I won't name the Member, said, ``Hey, I want you to give me a minute like you just gave that Republican.'' And I turned to Gay and I said, ``Give the gentlelady the same minute you gave the Republican,'' and she did.  Gay, we are going to be a poorer institution without you, and I want to thank you on behalf of us during those happier times for your service.
