 President, I rise to support the comments of the distinguished Senator from the State of Maryland. I must say that when I first came to the Senate, I looked at these perhaps with not as full an understanding of them as I have now. But I think the committee supports it, the bill supports it, and the Appropriations Committee supports it. I certainly agree with the Senator and support him.
