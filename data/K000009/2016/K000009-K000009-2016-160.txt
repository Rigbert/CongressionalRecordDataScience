Speaker, on Wednesday, 7 December, I was privileged to participate in the Congressional commemoration breakfast of the 75th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor with the Friends of the National World War II Memorial. The following are my remarks to honor that solemn occasion:       Good morning. Chairman Bunting, thank you so very much and      to all you Americans for being here today and helping us      commemorate, honor and remember. It really is a distinct      privilege to share with you today the remembrance of December      7th 1941, and I must say as we listen to the news reports and      the discussion commemorations and so forth, I've actually      been--I love this country so much and this vision for all      people to live in freedom and to see the American people, and      what they're doing to honor this memory and our heritage. You      are all here because of what happened 75 years ago, December      7th 1941. I've seen on television this week ceremonies this      afternoon and we're actually teaching the new generation by      your presence here today. This, the day that honors the 2,403      US citizens and service members who were killed at Pearl      Harbor, Hawaii in a surprise attack by Imperial Japan that      triggered U.S. entry into WWII one day later.       I want to thank Chairman Bunting for your leadership--you      don't have to do this, you could be on some golf course      somewhere--and all the Friends of the WWII Memorial for      organizing not only this breakfast but all the events this      week. Many of our schools no longer teach this history, and      so your work is even more important. We honor with your      presence those Americans who so justly deserve history's keen      memory. Thank you to Superintendent of the National Mall, Gay      Vietzke, for helping us make these arrangements today. I      understand that Congressman Morgan Griffith, from the great      state of Virginia is also here--thank you so very much. And      importantly, I want to welcome our World War II veterans, and      particularly Pearl Harbor survivors and their families with      us this morning. If any of you wish to just raise your hand--     thank you! What a truly historic occasion it is to be with      you--our nation owes our liberty to your courage, to your      patriotism and to your sacrifice.       In an earlier era, President Abraham Lincoln wrote a letter      to Mrs. Lydia Bixby, that's become pretty famous, a widow      living in Boston and thought to have lost five sons during      the Civil War, and President Lincoln wrote to her: ``The      solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a      sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.'' These words apply to      those of you who remember and whose families have sacrificed      because of Pearl Harbor and WWII.       Today, again, a grateful nation remembers the solemn events      of December 7th, 1941, another time of national testing. We      recognize American heroes who rose out of the ashes to lead      our country to triumphant victory. On that fateful day,      Imperial Japan's surprise attack on the Pacific Fleet also      destroyed almost 20 ships and over 300 planes in just two      hours. The attack on Pearl Harbor served not only as the      catalyst driving America to war, but also as a great rallying      cry to our people--overriding any hesitation and instilling      grim determination to see the mission through, no matter the      cost--and the cost was the greatest the world had ever seen.      The story of that morning is filled with examples of the      finest America has to offer--Sailors risking their own lives      to save their shipmates, nurses tending the wounded as bombs      continued to drop and machine guns sprayed the buildings. It      is the story of young men, never before challenged on the      field of battle, taking up arms to defend their ship, their      comrades and their country. It is the story of America--a      country that, when knocked down, never gets knocked out, and      always gets back up and wins the fight.       Exactly one day after the attack, by a vote of 82 to 0 in      the Senate, and 388-1 in the House, the United States      declared war on Imperial Japan. Three days after that,      Congress declared war on the Axis Powers, Germany and Italy,      as the United States--President Roosevelt's ``great arsenal      of democracy''--engaged in war on two fronts. That vote, to      send America's sons and daughters across an ocean, to fight      an enemy, knowing they may not come home is the hardest vote      of any Member of Congress's life. While we cannot know      exactly what those men and women of 1941 were thinking, we      can understand their feelings, their hesitations, and their      desire to seek justice for the innocent Americans who lost      their lives that day.       In many of my travels, I've had an opportunity to work with      members of the Japanese Diet, and I got to be friends with      some of them, and I finally had the mustard one day to ask      one of them: ``Could you please explain to me why you bombed      Pearl Harbor on December 7th 1941?'' It was a hard question      for me to ask, but the answer came back: ``to stop      colonialism in the Pacific.'' And I said ``Thank you so much      that we can be honest with one another. That we can talk      about what happened in that period of time.'' We ignore those      exchanges. Those of you involved in education, in historical      associations like Friends of the WWII Memorial, we simply      can't dialogue enough in this day and age.       Many of those who survived that fateful morning continued      to serve in the military.     Millions more joined them, in uniform and on the home front      here, taking on the herculean task of evicting Japanese      forces from the Pacific Theater, an awesome undertaking by      any measure. But island by island, the US military and our      allies achieved victory in some of the bloodiest and hardest      fought and sometimes underreported battles, of modern      military history.       Veterans of this harsh theater, survivors of Bataan, Iwo      Jima and Okinawa, became a living history of the cost of war,      and the greatness of unified American willpower. As General      MacArthur said later in the ultimate surrender of Imperial      Japanese ceremony radio address, the war taught us both ``the      bitterness of defeat and the exultation of triumph, and from      both we have learned there can be no turning back. We must go      forward to preserve in peace what we won in war.'' And      indeed, America has been about that task, even before my      lifetime; well maybe just as my lifetime started and      probably yours too!       The memorial at the USS Arizona, the Punch Bowl in Hawaii,      where I have been honored to place wreaths in the Pacific on      behalf of our country, and the National Memorial Cemetery of      the Pacific are permanent memorials to those gave their lives      for us and for the values of our country at Pearl Harbor.       It is in this spirit that the Punch Bowl in Hawaii as well      as the World War II Memorial here in our Nation's capital      were created--to not only pay tribute to those who served      heroically in uniform or steadfastly on the home front, but      to preserve the lessons learned and act as places of living      history. They teach future generations about the sacrifices      of those gone before, and serve as places of remembrance to      the Service Members and their families who gave so much.       And even though we dedicated and opened the WWII Memorial      here in the year 2004, I am still about the task of trying to      work with the Government of the United States to augment the      historical collections that are so very, very important to      honoring those who gave us their substance. It is not an easy      task. We're working with the Library of Congress--I just want      to make you aware of this. We have a veterans' history      project where many Americans like you volunteered their time      to collect the stories of individual veterans. We have a      special place for these at the Library of Congress and our      task is not finished.       One of those veterans was a man named Roger Durbin. He was      an Army tank mechanic who fought in Europe in the Battle of      the Bulge under General Patton's Third Army. He was a jovial      and rather outspoken Ohioan who after the war served as a      rural letter carrier and township trustee in the      Congressional District that I represent. It was Mr. Durbin,      who, almost a quarter century ago, in 1987, in a place called      Jerusalem Township, Ohio, at a fish fry of township trustees,      shouted across a room like this to me, ``Hey Congresswoman      Kaptur! Why is there no World War II memorial in Washington,      D.C.?''       Well, I looked across the room and I saw this kind of      sturdy man, not young, with rimless glasses, standing like      this--I'll never forget it. I had a plate of fish--I was      caught off guard and I thought `I can't believe this is      happening' because everyone in the room of course fell      silent, as they watched this confrontation. I stood there and      said ``Sir, I think there is one.''       And he said ``Oh yeah--where is it?''       So I said ``Iwo Jima'' and he said ``Wrong! That's to one      battle and one service.''       ``Well it must be Arlington.'' ``Wrong!''       And the more I thought about it--and I was a student of      history--I came back to my office and wrote a letter to the      Smithsonian, and to the Department of Defense and several      weeks later the letters of reply came back, I was standing by      my desk and I opened the letter and he was right!       One American, he had travelled the world and he had looked      at what other countries had done to honor those who fought in      World War II--and, he was right. And that began a seventeen-     year quest to complete the WWII Memorial here in our nation's      capital. Think what one citizen can do. And this is the way      Congress should work--often doesn't. But where a citizen of      our country, who is imbued with an idea of profound      significance, changes the face of how we present America to      ourselves and the world.       Of course, he is no longer living, but he said to me before      his death--I went out to his house and he said: ``Marcy,''      (and he had above his fireplace--he died two years before the      memorial was built there--he had above his fireplace a      lithograph that had been done of the WWII Memorial prior to      its construction) ``I want to show you something, just in      case.'' He took me to a room in his home, where the cherry      furniture had been handed down from his grandparents, and he      opened two, he pulled out from under this bed, two big      chests, and he had been a letter carrier so he was very      organized, and he had saved every news article, every letter,      every military organization and veteran organization that had      helped us. He kept these files--each page was in plastic.       He knew how important this was. This was an average      citizen--well he was more than an average citizen. He said,      ``just make sure when the time comes, these get in the right      place.'' I have so many stories I could go on forever, but      when we broke the ground for the site in the 1990s, there was      a flag flying over the site where the WWII Memorial here in      Washington now rests. And the President then--we had to get      three Presidents to help us, but that's another story--the      flag came down and then the President turned and presented      the flag to Mr. Durbin. And Mr. Durbin's back was to all the      people at the ceremony, but he said to his wife and to me ``I      want to be buried with this''--and he was.       I mean this was; this is a great story. It took almost five      years to get a final bill passed here, and then another      decade or more to get the memorial built, as one Congressman      aptly observed, it took longer to build the memorial than      fight the war. But I can say that the final product was well      worth the wait, other than the fact that we still haven't      buttoned down sufficient historical collections and video      presentations so when future generations come, they see not      only this magnificent memorial, but the story behind why      those Americans fought.       We have our work cut out for us. When I was over at      Normandy, I looked at the memorial we have there and all the      video collections and so forth, and we're working with Park      Service now, along with others to try to be able give that      grand presentation to Americans who come to this memorial.      Americans and others from around the world. While almost      every aspect of the memorial has symbolism with both the      Pacific and Atlantic porticos, to me, one of the most      striking features is its location and there is an      announcement stone, a corner stone that talks about this.       Think about this: as we commemorate Pearl Harbor today, the      beginning of that horrendous conflict, that consequential      conflict, you have to the East, the Washington Monument, that      represents yes, the first President, George Washington, but      the father of the Republic, which was the greatest      achievement of the Eighteenth Century, and then on Western      edge of the Mall, you have the Lincoln Memorial, honoring one      of our greatest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, representing the      preservation of the Union, and then right in the center,      between both, the most significant memorial of the Twentieth      Century, the World War II Memorial, which that generation did      not build for itself, but their prodigy did; representing the      victory of liberty over tyranny. It does not represent a      person, but a generation. At certain times of the day, you      can see a shadow of the Washington Monument, fall across the      WWII Memorial and land on the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting      Pool--it is really something--and we had hoped to get a light      feature when we built the WWII Memorial that would reflect      exactly on that spot, where the Eighteenth, Nineteenth and      Twentieth Centuries come together, that still remains a      dream, because those who approve memorial construction didn't      agree with that idea, but I thought it was a great idea. Of      course that victory of liberty over tyranny, was a gift to      all of us.       Second only to its location, is the fact that this memorial      is the only one dedicated to not only the service members,      but the families, the shipbuilders, the factory workers, and      farmers who kept our nation going during that extended      conflict. It is for every yard that had a Victory Garden, and      every pantry managed with a ration card. It is truly      America's memorial, and you can see that on all of the bronze      artifacts that are part of that site, and our entire country      sacrificed for the common good and a universal cause. Our      mother worked in a War Industries factory, and her job was to      make sure that every spark plug that was used in an airplane      wouldn't balk and that the quality was 100%, and she was very      aware as she worked on her tamping machine in Toledo, Ohio      that the life of a pilot and those that the plane would be      carrying were in her hands. That was America's mindset.       In total, over 15 million men and women took up the      Nation's call to arms. Then millions more took up the burden      of maintaining the home front. Millions of women went into      the workplace for the first time; a workplace outside their      home. It changed the culture of our country. There was not a      family who went unaffected by that War.       I'll divert just briefly, in our own family, our father      lost his best friend, in the Marine Corps at Guadalcanal, a      man named Dusty. Our mother's two brothers served in uniform,      in WWII, one on the Atlantic Front and one on the Pacific,      both wounded. Our uncle Stanley served in the Army from 1942      through 1945, in the Battle of the Bulge to free Belgium and      then liberate Paris and he never talked about it, but six      months before his death he came to me in the kitchen of our      home and he said ``I just want you to know, this is in my      billfold, in case something happens.'' Almost the exact words      that Roger Durbin used, `just in case'. He gave me a scapular      that he had tucked in his uniform, the sacred heart, which is      the religious symbol of the denomination to which we belong,      and then he presented me with a Nazi swastika that he had cut      out of a seaplane that had been downed in the English      Channel. I still haven't figured out what to do with that--     it's a rather unusual artifact--as well as one of the weapons      that he had used.       Our uncle Anthony served in the precursor to the CIA, the      Office of Strategic Services, seeing action in China, India      and Burma before being knifed by a Japanese soldier one night      as he caught a few hours sleep in Burma in a foxhole. He      suffered his whole life from war-related injuries. He was so      intelligent. To this day, I have no ideas where he was      trained; I think maybe in Virginia, but I'm not sure.       Their stories, and just imagine how many stories across      America influenced those that followed them to try to help      build liberty     forward. I am one of those. Together, all the lessons that      came from our soldiers and our families create a living      history for us to learn from the past and to build a more      secure future. As General Douglas MacArthur said, ``It is my      earnest hope, and indeed the hope of all mankind, that from      this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge out of the      blood and carnage of the past--a world dedicated to the      dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish      for freedom, tolerance and justice.'' Your being here today      means you understand that you don't forget the importance of      remembrance.       Memorials allow us to look past the present and focus on      those worthy to honor. They link the past to the present and      enable people to frame history and respect the sacrifice of      those who died, fought, participated, or were affected by      conflict. Memorials are an important source of information      for our young people trying to understand the decisions made      by past generations and why the world is the way that it is.      They are a source of national pride, unadulterated by the      politics of the day.       As a nation memorials link us to our allies based on mutual      experiences during times of War--the suffering, the triumphs,      and the universal price of the ideal of liberty. They can      heal the wounds of war, and bring people together. We saw      this, this past May when President Obama visited Hiroshima,      and we know that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be      coming to Pearl Harbor later this month. These are really      significant symbolic actions that still help heal our world.       It's difficult to imagine that only 4 percent of Americans      who served in World War II are still alive today. For those      that are here this morning, we give you applause. When we      built the WWII Memorial, I didn't know that honor flight      would be created; it was in the minds of ordinary Americans      who are extraordinary, who managed to ferry tens of thousands      of our WWII veterans here for their last call in our nation's      capital. I'm sure each of you knows how much that has meant      to the families of our country and to those veterans--many      from my region, but from every State in the Union. The men      and women who helped to do that did it so selflessly. Now      we're bringing many of our Vietnam veterans here, and Korean      War veterans. We have some Vietnam and Korean War veterans      with us here today. Thank you, and thank you for      understanding the intergenerational bonds of our country.       But only about 2.3 percent of Americans have firsthand      memories of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of course we know      that only about 1% of our families have any connection to the      military at all; 99% do not, because we no longer have forced      conscription. So you're being here today, and trying to use      this opportunity to teach and to elevate--do not      underestimate its importance. What you're doing here by your      presence is very important today. These statistics make it      imperative that we maintain our history. Future generations      must know, for liberty's sake, why the Transatlantic alliance      as well as our Pacific bases are so essential, they must know      why the United Nations and NATO are vital, living instruments      of liberty; they must know the amazing potential and      devastating effects that attend to nuclear power, and they      must know the astounding possibilities of a country united in      a common cause.       I would like to thank the Friends of the National World War      II Memorial for your existence--you continue to keep alive      the legacy of World War II and our Greatest Generation. They      never wanted to be called the greatest generation. I consider      them the most unselfish generation, and we can learn a lot      from them--to keep alive in the hearts and minds of our      current and future generations what their lives stood for.      Their carefully developed education programs at Friends      provide opportunities to teach our young citizens about the      values and spirit of unity and shared purpose, which defined      the character of our country during those bitter war years.       I'll tell you something, here in Congress, and I've got to      make a little political comment here, I've served through      many speakers now, and through many leaders here in these      institutions, but I can tell you that when the WWII      Generation exited, and retired or left service, the character      of the place changed. When I was first here during the 1980s,      Democrat Tip O'Neill was Speaker and Republican Bob Michel      was minority leader and at Christmas time, you know what--     they liked one another. They fought like cats and dogs on      political issues, but they were friends. And in December,      when the holidays came, they'd call the President of the      United States and sing to the President over the telephone,      ``We Wish You a Merry Christmas''--and they had terrible      singing voices. You know what--it elevated America, and      America felt unified. That is one of our challenges today and      I think the memories of the WWII Generation can help heal the      fissures across this country that even exist in the      institution in which you are seated this morning. So I want      to thank you for coming this morning, and for doing your part      to honor the history of Pearl Harbor and heritage of this      great country. Most importantly, thank you to our veterans      not only for being here today, but for all you've done for      our country. We stand, America stands, on your strong      shoulders. May God Bless you and may God bless America in the      years ahead.       Thank you                          ____________________
