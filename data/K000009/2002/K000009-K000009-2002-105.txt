Speaker, today I rise to pay homage to a man of my district, Lowell F. Rupp, who passed from this life on Monday, January 7, 2002 at the youthful age of 73. Mr. Rupp was a long-time and much loved civic and business leader in Fulton County, Ohio.  Born on a family farm still operational in Fulton County, Mr. Rupp eventually purchased the farm from his father. He produced corn, soybeans, and wheat, selling the seed as well. Even though I came to know him through politics, for me the picture of Mr. Rupp remains with the land, for he was a farmer in his very soul.  Entering German Township politics, he ``sought elective office out of a love for people and a desire to make a difference in their lives.'' That, indeed, he did. After serving for ten years as a German Township Trustee, Mr. Rupp was elected a Fulton County Commissioner. He served in that position for sixteen years, retiring at the end of his final term in 1994. His tenure as commissioner brought a great deal to the residents of Fulton County: he most assuredly did make a difference in their lives, improving their livelihoods, bringing positive progress to the county and always moving forward. Under his stewardship, the Fulton County Courthouse Plaza, a new county health department building and senior centers in four regions of the county were established. He helped to obtain expansion for water lines into the county and improvements to its fairgrounds.  Those who worked with Mr. Rupp in pursuit of projects benefiting the county--myself included--found him to be a most able and honorable man. One of his colleagues describes him as a ``rock-ribbed Republican'' who never let partisanship get in the way of doing the best job he could for the public good and noted, ``He was a gentleman to work with. We were both opinionated and agreed to disagree.'' Mr. Rupp practiced a style of politicsfrom which all could take a lesson, and though driven to achieve what he thought was right, still understood the art of compromise.  A man of great yet quiet faith who lived his beliefs, Mr. Rupp was a lifelong member of the Evangelical Mennonite Church. He was also a member of Gideons International and the Archbold Rotary.  Lowell Rupp and his wife Ardith celebrated nearly 53 years of marriage together. As deeply as he surely loved his family, words can do little to assuage the grief felt now by Mrs. Rupp, their children Beverly, Pamela, Bruce, Larry, and Leslie, sister, brother, and grandchildren. May the tangible legacy he leaves behind in what his public service gave to his community help them as they find their way now. Lowell Rupp's memory, his talent, his energy, and his service are the gifts he has left to his family, and to us. While we are saddened at his passing, we are grateful for his life.                          ____________________
