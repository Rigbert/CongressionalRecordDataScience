Speaker, well, we heard some amusing speeches earlier about the new Washington Waste Watchers, the gentleman from Texas and some other Republican over there. I guess that their vision does not extend too far.  First of all, the Republicans control the White House, every agency of the Federal Government, the House and the Senate. If there is waste, fraud and abuse, well then, they should take care of it. But they are too busy asking the American people to borrow $87 billion to build Iraq in the vision of the neoconservatives in the White House that put this failed policy on us and pursuing this adventure.  Right here, here it is. The gold-plated guide to war profiteering in Iraq, otherwise known as the Coalition Provisional Authority Request to Rehabilitate and Reconstruct Iraq. Most of it has nothing to do with reconstructing Iraq or war damage that we caused.  Now, there is an argument that could be made that we should repair war damage. But these are things that the Iraqis never had, they have not had ever. We are talking about, well, they have 50-year-old steam boilers, so we have got to spend $6 billion on their electric grid. Guess what? The lights are blinking out here in the eastern United States and on my coast a couple of summers ago, the West Coast, because we are underinvesting here.  The President can ask to borrow $6 billion not only to rebuild the little bit of damage we did, but to give them a state-of-the-art system. The American people will pay for that for 30 years. How much is he asking to invest in the United States of America? A big goose egg.  Yeah, I guess the eye on Waste Watchers on Washington does not go to waste watchers in the war profiteering and the rebuilding of Iraq.  Let us take up a couple of other subjects. $1 billion will be borrowed by the American people at the request of the President and Republican Congress to train the police in Iraq. Certainly and arguably, we should have a trained police force. But it is extraordinarily expensive because they say, Well, first off, they have to build a facility to train them outside the country. They cannot train them in Iraq.  The French, they offered to train the Iraqi police in Iraq for free. But, God forbid, those French, we should accept anything from them. They are a lotbetter at policing, military policing in these sorts of situations, have a lot more experience than we do, but we are going to hire consultants and pay $1 billion, borrow $1 billion to take the Iraqis out of their country to train them.  Then we have got to arm them. Of course, the U.S. military has confiscated hundreds of thousands of weapons, many in the original grease and wrappers. But, no, that is not good enough for the Iraqi police force. We are going to spend $200 million to buy them brand-new weapons. I thought, well, maybe this is good. Maybe it has got a Buy America component to it. Maybe we are going to buy from American arms manufacturers. No, AK-47s, that is what the Iraqi police want. We have confiscated tens of thousands of them, but instead of reissuing the ones we have confiscated, we are going to buy them brand-new ones at more than list price from our friends, the Chinese.  This is not waste, fraud, and abuse. No, the Washington Waste Watchers over there do not have their eyes set on Iraq and this kind of stuff, they are talking about the $100,000 missing over there at the Department of Education that might have fed some hungry kids. But, no, if it is a huge contract, wasting billions of dollars in Iraq; that is just fine. The President asked for it. We have to do this.  Let us talk about the cement plant in northern Iraq. Our estimators looked at it and said $15 million to rebuild that plant. So the Bush administration put out a request for proposal for $15 million. The Iraqis didn't want to wait. They rebuilt it themselves. Cost: $80,000.  Now, there is Mr. al-Barak, who is a member of the Ruling Council which we named. You would think he would be beholden to us since we put him in place. But he has been a little critical of our spending. He says, ``You know what? We can do it for 10 cents on the dollar. The Americans are wasting incredible amounts of money.''  We are going to be asked to borrow nearly $20 billion, indebt Americans for the next 30 years for waste, fraud, and abuse and war profiteering, and the Iraqis say they can do it for 10 cents on the dollar.  There was a contract to feed the Iraqi Ruling Council, which we named, which Mr. Bremer put out, no bid, of course. I guess it was from Sardi's in New York because to feed 25 people a day, $5,000 a day. The Iraqi council was aghast, and Mr. al-Barak said, No, thanks, we can feed ourselves for a lot less than $5,000 a day. They think we are nuts. They really do.  Waste, fraud, and abuse, apparently is only when it might benefit Americans. But when it can benefit war profiteers and no-bid contractors overseas in the gold-plated building, not rebuilding, of Iraq, there is a blind eye being turned here.                          ____________________
