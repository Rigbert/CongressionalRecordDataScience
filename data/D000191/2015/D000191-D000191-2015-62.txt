Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington, a former member of the committee.  Let me be clear. I agree we should be further increasing the funds available for bus procurement. MAP-21 cut bus funding in half--a devastating cut to many smaller and mid-sized transit agencies, including in my district.  We tried to reverse these cuts as much as we could in this bill, but with the severely limited funding that was mentioned earlier today, there was only so much we could do. In total, we increased the bus formula and competitive grant program by 40 percent.  I would also like to mention the bus procurement reforms in the bill that are designed to lower the cost of bus purchases. We provided several different mechanisms that provide bulk buying power for transit agencies. Buses are expensive, and larger purchases will help them to get lower costs.  This amendment will further increase the bus procurement programs and shift money from the high-density-States formula that benefits seven northeastern States. The high-density-States formula is actually an old Senate provision, carefully drafted by the esteemed members of the Senate's Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee sometime ago and is of great benefit to those seven States.  I am very sympathetic to the amendment, but I am obligated, reluctantly and tepidly, to oppose it.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
