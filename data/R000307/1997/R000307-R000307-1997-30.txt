President, I rise today to introduce the Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems Act of 1997. I am pleased to have my colleagues, Senators Sam Brownback, Jeff Bingaman, Pete Domenici, and Daniel Inouye, and Indian Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell as cosponsors. This legislation will provide Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute the administrative authority and flexibility to complete their transitions from two year institutions to a 4-year university for Haskell, and a national community college for SIPI.  Located in Lawrence, KS, Haskell is an educational institution rich in history and opportunity for American Indian and Alaskan Native communities. Founded in 1884 as the United States Indian Industrial Training School, Haskell has grown from a school providing agricultural education for grades one through five to a fully accredited four-year university. In October 1993, Haskell changed its name from Haskell Indian Junior College to Haskell Indian Nations University after receiving accreditation to offer a bachelor of science degree in elementary teacher education. Since its inception, Haskell has provided tuition-free education, culturally sensitive curricula, innovative services and a commitment to academic excellence to federally recognized tribal members. With as many as 175 tribes represented in the student body, Haskell offers Native American history, institutions, arts, literature, and language courses integrating the perspectives of various Native American cultures. Haskell continues development of 4-year programs in other fields, striving to meet the challenge of enriching the lives of young native Americans and Alaska Natives.  I support Haskell's vision to become a national center for Indian education, research, and cultural programs; increasing the knowledge and supporting the educational needs of American Indians and Alaskan Natives. This legislation, which allows the institution to remain within the Bureau of Indian Affairs and employees to continue participation in Federal retirement and health benefit programs, provides the Haskell president and Board of Regents authority over organizational structure, classification of positions, recruitment, procurement, and determination of all human resource policies and procedures. In short, this legislation completes Haskell's transition by giving the school the autonomy enjoyed by the tribally controlled community colleges and BIA elementary and secondary schools. As Haskell continues to change and meet the educational demands of native Americans and Alaskan Natives into the 21st Century, so too should the system by which Haskell is administered change and grow. The Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems Act of 1997 complements the educational and administrative efforts of these schools, giving Haskell and SIPI the support and flexibility required to progress and develop into outstanding institutions of higher learning. My Kansas colleague, Representative Vincent Snowbarger, has introduced this bill in the House of Representatives.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1095       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Haskell Indian Nations      University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute      Administrative Systems Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) the provision of culturally sensitive curricula for      higher education programs at Haskell Indian Nations      University and the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute      is consistent with the commitment of the Federal Government      to the fulfillment of treaty obligations to Indian tribes      through the principle of self-determination and the use of      Federal resources; and       (2) giving a greater degree of autonomy to those      institutions, while maintaining them as an integral part of      the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will facilitate--       (A) the transition of Haskell Indian Nations University to      a 4-year university; and       (B) the administration and improvement of the academic      program of the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute.
