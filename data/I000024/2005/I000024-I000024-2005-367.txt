President, section 403 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act requires that a statement of the cost of the reported bill, prepared by the Congressional Budget Office, be included in the report. At the time of filing of the report, the statement was unavailable. The statement has since been received by the committee. I ask unanimous consent that the statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     S. 728, Water Resources Development Act of 2005, As reported          by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works          on April 26, 2005       Summary       S. 728 would authorize the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)      to conduct water resource studies and undertake specified      projects and programs for flood control, inland navigation,      shoreline protection, and environmental restoration. The bill      would authorize the agency to conduct studies on water      resource needs, to complete feasibility studies for specified      projects, and to convey ownership of certain Federal      properties. Finally, the bill would extend, terminate, or      modify existing authorizations for various water projects and      would authorize new programs to develop water resources and      protect the environment.       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, including      adjustments for increases in anticipated inflation, CBO      estimates that implementing S. 728 would cost about $4.1      billion over the 2006-2010 period and an additional $7.6      billion over the 10 years after 2010. (Some construction      costs and operations and maintenance would continue or occur      after this period.)       S. 728 would allow the Corps to spend any proceeds that it      collects from grazing fees, shoreline management permit fees,      municipal and industrial water supply fees, recreational      fees, and leases. In addition, the bill would allow the      Federal Government's power marketing administrations (PMAs)      to use proceeds from power sales to fund Corps expenses      related to hydropower. S. 728 also would convey parcels of      land to various nonFederal entities and would forgive the      obligation of some local government agencies to pay certain      project costs. Finally, the bill would allow the Corps to      collect and spend fees collected for training courses and      permit processing. CBO estimates that enacting those      provisions would increase direct spending by $212 million in      2006, $1.1 billion over the 2006-2010 period, and $2.3      billion over the 2006-2015 period. Pursuant to section 407 of      H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget,      Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates that enacting S. 728 would      cause an increase in direct spending greater than $5 billion      in the 10-year period beginning in 2046. Enacting the bill      would not affect revenues.       S. 728 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA. Federal participation in water      resources projects and programs authorized by this bill would      benefit State, local, and tribal governments, and any costs      to those governments to comply with the conditions of this      Federal assistance would be incurred voluntarily. The bill      also would benefit those governments by authorizing      additional funds or reducing matching requirements for some      specific projects.     Estimated Cost to the Federal Government       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 728 is shown in the      following table. The costs of this legislation fall within      budget functions 300 (natural resources and the environment)      and 270 (energy).                                         TABLE 1.

Spending Subject to Appropriation       S. 728 would authorize new projects related to      environmental restoration, shoreline protection, and      navigation. This bill also would modify many existing Corps      projects and programs by increasing the amounts authorized to      be appropriated to construct or maintain them or by      increasing the Federal share of project costs. Assuming      appropriation of the necessary funds, CEO estimates that      implementing this bill would cost $4.1 billion over the 2006-     2010 period and an additional $7.6 billion over the 10 years      after 2010. For ongoing construction costs of previously      authorized projects, the Corps received a 2005 appropriation      of about $1.8 billion, including funds from the Inland      Waterway Trust Fund.       For new water projects specified in the bill, the Corps      provided CBO with estimates     of annual budget authority needed to meet design and      construction schedules. CBO adjusted those estimates to      reflect the impact of anticipated inflation during the time      between project authorization and appropriation of      construction costs. Estimated outlays are based on historical      spending rates for Corps projects.       Significant New Authorizations. S. 728 would authorize the      Army Corps of Engineers to conduct water resource studies and      undertake specified projects and programs for flood control,      inland navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental      restoration. For example, the bill includes authorizations      for enhanced navigation improvements on the Upper Mississippi      River at an estimated Federal cost of $1.8 billion and an      ecosystem restoration project, also on the Upper      Mississippi River, at an estimated Federal cost of $1.6      billion. Another large project authorized by this bill is      the Indian River Lagoon project in the Florida Everglades      at an estimated Federal cost of $605 million. Construction      of those projects would likely take more than 15 years.       Deauthorizations. Title VI would withdraw the authority for      the Corps to build 58 projects authorized in previous      legislation. Based on information from the Corps, however,      CBO does not expect that the agency would begin any work      (under current law) for most of those projects over the next      5 years. Some of those projects do not have a local sponsor      to pay nonFederal costs, others do not pass certain tests for      economic viability, and still others do not pass certain      tests for environmental protection. Consequently, CBO      estimates that canceling the authority to build those      projects would provide no significant savings over the next      several years.       Future Corps Appropriations for Operations and Maintenance.      As discussed below under ``Direct Spending,'' sections 2019      and 2020 would make about $175 million a year available for      operations and maintenance at Corps facilities without      further appropriation. In fiscal year 2005, the Corps      received an appropriation of about $2 billion for operations      and maintenance costs, including funds from the Harbor      Maintenance Trust Fund. Enacting this bill could result in a      reduction in future appropriations if the Congress chose to      reduce total Corps spending below the level appropriated in      2005. In lieu of a reduction, however, the Congress could      choose to continue Corps funding at current levels to provide      funds for the backlog of the agency's maintenance needs. For      this estimate, CBO assumes that future Corps appropriations      would continue at current levels and that new spending      authorized by the bill would be in addition to the current      level of agency funding.                            Direct Spending       Based on information from affected agencies, CBO estimates      that enacting S. 728 would increase direct spending by about      $212 million in 2006 and $2.3 billion over the 2006-2015      period. Table 2 presents the direct-spending components of      the bill. Most of the direct spending under the bill would      stem from provisions to allow for the spending of existing      power revenues associated with Corps projects for facility      planning, operation, maintenance, and upgrades without      further appropriation. Under current law, those and other      fees that would be made available for spending are deposited      (as setting receipts) to the general fund of the Treasury.       Improvement of Water Management at Corps of Engineers      Reservoirs. Section 2019 would allow the Corps to spend any      proceeds collected from grazing fees, shoreline management      permit fees, and municipal and industrial water supply fees.      Under the bill, the Corps could spend such funds for      operations and maintenance at its facilities. Based on      information from the agency, CBO estimates that spending of      such receipts would total $21 million in 2006 and 88 million      over the 2006-2015 period.       Direct Funding of Corps Operations and Maintenance for      Hydropower. Section 2020 would allow the Federal power      marketing administrations to use proceeds from the sale of      electricity to fund Corps expenses related to hydropower      functions. Based on information from the PMAs, CBO expects      that such direct funding would cost $142 million in 2006      and $1.5 billion over the 2006-2015 period, with      additional costs after 2015. Currently, receipts collected      by the PMAs for the sale of electricity and related      services are deposited in the Treasury. Once such      expenditures are directly funded, annual appropriations      for the Corps could be reduced by a similar amount, or      those funds could be spent on other unfunded Corps      priorities.       The PMAs are required to set electricity rates at a level      that recoups Federal costs. Such costs include expenses      specific to maintaining hydropower facilities at Corps      projects in addition to joint costs or those allocated      between all functions at a project (recreation,      environmental, flood control, etc.). This bill would specify      that only costs allocated exclusively to electricity      production could be funded with sales revenues.       Recreational Areas and Project Sites. Section 2004 would      authorize spending of receipts from leases and fees at Corps      recreational areas for operations and maintenance at      recreation areas and project sites. Based on information from      the Corps, CBO estimates that enacting this section would      cost $41 million in 2006 and $507 million over the 2006-2015      period.

Spending of Corps Lease Receipts. This section would allow      the Corps to spend money it collects from leases at      recreational areas and project sites without further      appropriation on operations and maintenance. Based on      information from the Corps, CBO estimates that enacting this      section would cost $8 million in 2006 and $98 million over      the 2006-2015 period.       Spending of Recreation Fees. This section would direct the      Corps to establish a new system of recreation fees, including      charges for admission to Corps recreation sites and for the      use of recreation facilities, visitor centers, equipment,      and services. Under the bill, the new fees (which would be      based on the value of the admission or service purchased)      would replace charges authorized under more restrictive,      existing laws. CBO estimates that, once the broader fee      authority that would be provided by this section has been      fully implemented, Corps offsetting receipts would      increase by $12 million a year from the current annual      level of about $42 million. (We expect that increases      would initially be less because of delays in determining      the market value of similar local recreation opportunities      and establishing appropriate fee schedules for some      recreation sites.) Because all amounts collected under the      fee system would be available to the Corps without further      appropriation, however, CBO estimates that enacting this      provision would have a net cost of $33 million in 2006 and      nearly $200 million over the 2006-2010 period. Over the      2006-2015, the total increase in net direct spending would      be just over $400 million.       Various Land Conveyances. S. 728 would authorize the Corps      to convey at fair market value 13 acres of land and the      structures on the land, including a loading dock with mooring      facilities, in Alabama. In addition, S. 728 would authorize      the conveyance at fair market value 650 acres of Federal land      at the Richard B. Russell Lake in South Carolina to the      State. Based on information from the Corps, CBO estimates      that the Federal Government would receive about $7 million in      2008 from those sales.       The bill also would convey certain Federal land in Alabama,      Pennsylvania, Georgia, Oregon, Kansas, and Missouri. CBO      estimates that those conveyances would have no significant      impact on the Federal budget.       Arcadia Lake, Oklahoma. Section 3071 would eliminate the      obligation of the city of Edmond, Oklahoma, to pay      outstanding interest due on its water storage contract with      the Corps. CBO estimates that this provision would result in      a loss of receipts of about $8 million in 2006.       Waurika Lake Project. Section 3073 would eliminate the      obligation of the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District      in     Oklahoma to pay its outstanding debt related to the      construction of a water conveyance project. Because of an      accounting error, the Corps inadvertently undercharged the      district for costs associated with a land purchase related to      the water project in the early 1980's. Under terms of the      construction contract, the district is required to pay all      costs associated with building the project, including the      full cost of the land purchases. CBO estimates that enacting      this section would cost less than $200,000 a year over the      2006-2015 period.       Funding to Process Permits. Section 2017 would make      permanent the Corps' current authority to accept and spend      funds contributed by private firms to expedite the evaluation      of permit applications submitted to the Corps. CBO estimates      that the Corps would accept and spend less than $500,000      during each year of this extension and that the net budgetary      impact of this provision would be negligible.       Training Funds. Section 2003 would allow the Corps to      collect and spend fees collected from the private sector for      training courses. CBO estimates that the Corps would accept      and spend less than $500,000 annually and that the net      budgetary impact would be negligible.     Estimated Long-Term Direct Spending Effects       Pursuant to section 407 of H. Con. Res. 95 (the Concurrent      Resolution on the Budget, Fiscal Year 2006), CBO estimates      that enacting S. 728 would cause an increase in direct      spending greater than $5 billion in the 10-year period      beginning in 2046. That estimate assumes that the bill's      estimated direct spending cost of $241 million in 2015 would      continue to increase over the next 40 years. Specifically,      CBO assumes that the Corps' costs for operations and      maintenance at PMA projects would increase at the rate of      inflation projected for 2015 for this activity about 2.9      percent a year. That inflator reflects a weighted average of      pay and nonpay components of Corps operations and maintenance      activities. In addition, we assume that Corps collections      from grazing, permit, water-use fees, and proceeds from the      use of recreationsites would increase more slowly, near the      observed historical rates of growth for such collections.     Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact       S. 728 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in UMRA. Federal participation in water      resources projects and programs authorized by this bill would      benefit State, local, and tribal governments, and any costs      to those governments to comply with the conditions of this      Federal assistance would be incurred voluntarily. The bill      also would benefit those governments by authorizing      additional funds or reducing matching requirements for some      specific projects.
