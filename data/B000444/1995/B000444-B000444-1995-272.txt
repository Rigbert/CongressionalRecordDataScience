 I do not have a copy of the statement. But I hope I state it correctly. He cited a section. He referred to it as the Hillary Clinton report on mammography, or something to that effect, where he said that report included that women under the age of 40 for mammographies--the average cost was, and I forget the number--it was $150,000, or $15 million, whatever it was. For women over the age of 50, it would cost less. And it was suggested that we should follow a cost-benefit analysis, and decide that mammographies maybe should be only for women over 50 years of age because of the cost.  The way this legislation is written, if in the wisdom or the lack of wisdom of the U.S. Congress and with the President signing the legislation, if we were to pass a piece of legislation which on its face made absolutely no economic sense, and we decided that even if it cost $10 million per life in order not to even have one life lost, you had to get to zero tolerance on some chemical, clearly it would not pass a cost-benefit analysis.  Let us assume the cost-benefit analysis was done and it is clear that they come back and say, ``Look, this is going to cost $10 billion or $1 million or $500 million for every life you save.'' If the legislative bodies and the President wanted to do that, would they still be able to do that?
