I commend the Chair for his interest in the proceedings here--something he always demonstrates when he is there. He has had the ability to serve in both bodies and we have what might be a little bit more of a leisurely technique over here. The Senator from Vermont is delighted to have the Senator from Florida as a Member of this body.                          ____________________
