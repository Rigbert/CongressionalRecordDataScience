 President, for our majority leader, I make this request: I ask unanimous consent that pursuant to the consent agreement of September 11, at 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday, September 22, the Senate resume S. 1301, and Senator Kennedy be immediately recognized to offer his amendment relative to the minimum wage. I further ask that at 2:15 on Tuesday there be 5 minutes equally divided, to be followed by the vote on the motion to table that amendment.
