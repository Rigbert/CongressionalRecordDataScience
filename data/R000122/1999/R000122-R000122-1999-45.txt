 If we, in fact, pass this amendment, we will be able to fund up to 100 additional partnership, state, and recruitment grant proposals, thereby enabling this important innovation in teacher preparation to be accessible throughout our nation.  I am strongly supportive of this amendment. I think it is something that will allow us to make great progress. Once again, emphasizing a point made so well by Senator Kennedy, if you look at public education, and if you search for the most powerful lever that we have to improve it, to reform it, and to continue it as an excellent system, teacher training is that lever.  This amendment will give us the power to move forward, dramatically and decisively to improve the quality of teaching in the United States. I strongly support it and commend the Senator from Massachusetts for his efforts.  I yield back to the Senator from Massachusetts.
