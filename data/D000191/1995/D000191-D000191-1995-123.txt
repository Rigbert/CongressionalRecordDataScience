Chairman, it is sad the gentleman thinks it is ridiculous that there are 15,000 G.I. families today on food stamps, and tens of thousands of others living in dangerous and unsafe conditions in proximity to our military bases, while at the same time we are asking them to deploy overseas into dangerous situations, and forget about their families back home. I do not think that that is a ridiculous amendment.  For the gentleman to say it would take 9 months to figure out a program to help lift those 15,000 families and tens of thousands of others above the poverty level and the near poverty level, I believe that the Pentagon that could deploy a rescue mission within 4 hours to Bosnia can figure out a way to compensate our GI's, men and women serving today, to compensate them adequately, so their families are lifted above the poverty level, and they are no longer eligible and dependent upon food stamps and living in substandard conditions. That cannot take 9 months, Mr. Chairman. I do not believe that could take 9 months. It is a specious argument.  The priorities on the Republican side were to throw more money at ballistic missile defense, despite the $36 billion spent so far, which has yielded nothing except for one faked successful test over the Pacific Ocean, and to ignore the needs of those tens of thousands of GI's and their families. That is not a proper set of priorities.  What is it that is the military might of America, the enlisted men and women, or pie-in-the-sky? I say food on their tables and adequate housing for their families come before pie-in-the-sky.
