Chairman, again, I appreciate the comments of the chairman.  I also want to commend our fellow Michigander on the Committee on Agriculture, who asked some pretty tough questions and asked us to deliver a better peach price with Gus Schumacher, representative of the USDA.  Mr. Chairman, I yield briefly to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Smith) who helped carry the ball in the committee.
