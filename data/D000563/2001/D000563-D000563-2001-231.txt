What the Senator is seeking, as I understand it, is at least the enforcement that Senator Murray has included in this Transportation appropriation bill, which includes, if I am not mistaken--and I stand to be corrected if I am--that we would in fact go into Mexico to the trucking firms, see these trucking firms, inspect their trucks in Mexico, understand the standards they are using for hiring drivers and the like; secondly, that all of the trucks coming in from Mexico would be subject to inspection in the United States.  It is my understanding, from Senator Murray's bill, that of the 27 points of entry in the United States, there are only 2 currently inspecting trucks on a 24-hour basis--2 out of 27. So we have a system where, frankly, many thousands of trucks come in from Mexico without the most basic inspection in terms of safety.  I ask the Senator from California if she believes this would move us toward our goal of having safer trucks and truckdrivers coming in from Mexico.
