President, I appreciate the words of my friend from Utah. Obviously, we cannot determine the course the White House might take. They can make that decision on their own, and I expect will. We can only determine what the Senate does. As I said before, it is advise and consent, not advise and rubberstamp.  I only urge the White House to seek, as Presidents have throughout my lifetime, advice from the home State Senators of both parties on judgeships. Senator Hatch and I can move far more quickly on judges when that kind of consensus has been reached, just as we have demonstrated by moving through numerous conservative Republican nominees but for whom there was consensus.  Frankly, it would be a much easier job if only the Senator from Utah and I had to make these decisions. Again, I hope the White House will listen to what the two of us have been saying. We have demonstrated we will work together. They also have to help. They have to help in the consultation. They have to help in getting the information on to the FBI, and the ABA reports. They have to also make sure when they speak about these issues they speak accurately.  I thank my good friend from Utah for his comments. I will continue to work with him.  I also see the distinguished assistant Republican leader. He and the assistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid, have worked very closely together with each other to try to schedule votes on judges. Both have worked with me and with Senator Hatch. I think that is helpful. It reflects the way the Senate is supposed to work. Our distinguished leaders, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, have worked closely on this and will continue to do that.  I yield the floor.
