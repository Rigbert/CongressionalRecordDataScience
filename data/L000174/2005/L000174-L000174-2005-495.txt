. 483, a bill that designates a courthouse in Brownsville, TX, as the ``Reynaldo G. Garza and Filemon B. Vela United States Courthouse'' in honor of these two judges, including the first Mexican-American named to a Federal judge. Unfortunately, the Senate has repeatedly delayed action on this bill. Congressman Solomon P. Ortiz first introduced a similar bill honoring these judges in 1998. It is now 7 years later and months after both these Judges' deaths in 2004.  Both this Congress and last, I have introduced a companion bill with Congresswoman Norton that designates the new annex to the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, DC, the ``William B. Bryant Annex.'' This historic figure should be honored, and that honor should occur during his lifetime. Regrettably, the Senate has yet to act on this bill, S. 478, which I introduced on March 1, 2005.  In order to prevent repeating the regrettable timing of the Judge Garza and Vela Courthouse naming, I urge that the Senate move ahead on this worthy commendation of Judge Bryant's lifetime of public service.  Judge Bryant continues to perform his duties as a senior Federal judge at the age of 93. His commitment to ending racial segregation and his belief in public service and the law has carried him through a historic career. He was the first African-American Chief Judge for the United States District Court in DC. The current Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan and all of Judge Bryant's fellow judges recognize his truly remarkable lifetime achievements and have unanimously requested naming the newly constructed annex in his honor.  Naming the new annex to the E. Barret Prettyman Courthouse after Judge Bryant is long overdue. I urge the Senate to take this action without further delay and allow Judge Bryant the commendation he deserves.                          ____________________[Page S6667]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]     REYNALDO G.
