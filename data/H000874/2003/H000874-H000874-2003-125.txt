Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  If I might, I would like to start with the general and then go to the specific for next week. I know that there are some of our colleagues who are trying to plan schedules for not only next week but weeks out and I know there has been a lot of discussion going on.  Can the leader tell me what he anticipates the schedule will be generally speaking in the month of October? My presumption is that we are going to be here through the end of October, as the Senate has not passed some of the bills and sent them to us. Our anticipation is that we will be here at least that long.  Can the gentleman tell us what he anticipates to be the schedule for the weeks of October? We know that the Senate is taking off one of those weeks. I think the first full week of October they will be taking off. I think Members would find it very useful if the gentleman could give us his thoughts on what our schedule would be.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.                              {time}  1530  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I do not want to prejudge the Committee on Appropriations' work, but I think in dealing with the Senate, the House and with both sides of the aisle it looks like everybody is coming together in a consensus around a continuing resolution that might run us to October 31, and that should be a veryreal signal to our Members that we will probably be in session to at least October 31.  However, trying to figure out exactly what weeks we will and will not work depends a lot on the work that we still have pending. Any day now we anticipate receiving from the administration a supplemental appropriations bill. Obviously, the Committee on Appropriations will go immediately to work on that, but I am informed that it may take at least two, three, even four weeks with hearings and things that need to be done, I think all Members want to really look at that supplemental and make sure that we are doing the right thing, and I cannot say today that, definitively, we would be off the week that the Senate has taken off, but I am hoping that working over the weekend and through the week next week, we ought to be able to give Members some sort of idea as to what the month of October might look like.
