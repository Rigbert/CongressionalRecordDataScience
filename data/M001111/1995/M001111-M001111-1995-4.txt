 President, thank you.  First, let me commend the Senator from New York for his tremendous leadership on behalf of the children in the welfare reform bill.                     welfare: reform; don't renege  Mr. President, it is with sadness today I must tell the American people their Congress has failed them in its attempts to reform public assistance in this country. Welfare reform is important, but the bill before us today was written with so little compassion it must be stopped.  The American people know we must change welfare. They know welfare must give a hand-up, not a hand-out. But no one I have talked to, not the most conservative welfare-basher, would stand where I am standing and vote to hurt children like this bill will.  You have heard the estimates: this bill will throw an additional 1.5 million children into poverty in this country. It will eliminate the guarantee to basic services to children at a time when we should be improving the safety net. Children need the guarantee to assistance. Children need the safety net.  I supported a welfare bill out of this Senate, a bill I had fundamental disagreement with, because we were able to make some improvements before it left the floor. I fought hard for child care funding, for money for job training, for domestic violence language. When these improvements had been made, I held my nose and voted for the bill, knowing some people would think I had done something horrible, because I naively thought the majority might be listening.  I thought after all our fighting, the majority party might get a hint about what kinds of things we thought were important in a bill to actually reform welfare. I said at the time--if this bill got worse in negotiations with the House, if the majority did not improve this bill dramatically, then it would not have my support. And it will not. This bill is a slap in the face of every person in this country trying to get off public assistance, and I will vote ``no.''  The conference report is so lacking, if I pick out just one thing to focus on, there won't be time to tell you about any others. But let us look at what the conference report proposes to do about child care:  First, remember that child care faces major problems today, before this welfare bill sends many new people into the work force. Child care is not always easy to find, you cannot always depend on the quality, you cannot always afford quality when you find it, and sometimes you cannot afford to pay at all, so a relative or friend takes care of your kids. But that's all today. Here's what the conference report will do tomorrow:  Over the next 7 years, the work requirements in this conference report will create the need for an additional $14.9 billion worth of child care. But, the report only funds $1.9 billion of new money, leaving a $13 billion shortfall, according to HHS. The result is many people will have no place to leave their child when they go to work.  If you are lucky enough to get your child into child care, the conference report cuts funding for child care quality standards more than 50 percent from the Senate bill. This money pays for improvements in quality and access to child care: training providers, inspecting and monitoring facilities, helping parents to find child care, providing grants to buy cribs and other equipment to start child care businesses, and beginning school-age programs.  The result is, you as a parent will have to worry about whether your child care worker is well-trained, and whether your child is healthy and safe when you return from work.  This conference report also allows welfare recipients to count providing unpaid child care toward meeting the work requirements, essentially, to babysit other people's children without meeting any of the standards of a child care facility or home day care business. There is no money for training or certification for people setting up home child care under this provision.  What is worse, the conference report repeals a state's ability to regulate health and safety in child care, including these small in-home child care situations, which is where most of the abuse problems in my state occur.  If you are unlucky enough to be a child in a child care situation where there is a problem, this conference report cuts the abuse enforcement that might protect you. It block grants child protection and foster care, and cuts the very functions that allow States to help children who need foster care, to recruit and train parents, to place children, and to monitor quality. The $3.7 billion reduction over seven years will cut Child Protective Services, family preservation money for preventing problems, and money for older youth.  Finally, the conference report significantly cuts the child and adult care food program, by as much as $3 billion over seven years. Providers in my state tell me these cuts will effectively close the doors of many small day care businesses, and lead to cost cutting that will affect child nutrition. We will have more people competing for less child care, and nutrition declining in the centers which stay in business.  Who here on the floor of the Senate can honestly say they speak for children? We have lobbyists for every issue, but infants and children do not get to vote. If you cut child protection, what constituency will rise up in protest? Not the children themselves; I will guarantee it.  This conference report has many problems. One of them is the assault on child care. I will be voting against this report.  Mr. President, I speak against the welfare conference report, and I do so as someone who voted for the Senate welfare reform bill, but I did so because I thought the majority would understand that our yes vote meant that we strongly supported child care funding language for domestic violence and job training funds. Those are not in the final bill. It is $13 billion short in child care money. That is not just money; that is children who will be out there on the streets with no one to take care of them.  Mr. President, this Congress will not be remembered for passing welfare reform. They will be remembered for endangering the lives of thousands of American children.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this conference report.
