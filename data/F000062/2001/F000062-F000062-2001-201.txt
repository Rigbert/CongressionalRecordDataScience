  Mr. President, the State is adding additional power. The problem comes in the next 2 years. What can be done and what is the appropriate Federal role in the next 2 years? I submit that the appropriate Federal role is to provide a period for liability and stability until the State has brought on line enough additional power to have a functioning free market where supply and demand functions in an appropriate manner.  The State has also planned an $850 million conservation package that will aim to reduce energy demand across the board by 10 percent or more. So in the immediate future, conservation is the best way for California to avoid days of rolling blackouts this summer. But, in my opinion, it is going to be impossible to achieve enough conservation to avoid all blackouts.  Additionally, the Governor of California has issued a series of executive orders authorizing increased output at existing facilities and ensuring that environmental regulations are not posing any barriers to maximum energy production.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time a letter from Winston Hickox, the Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency, asserting that there are no energy plants idling in the State because of environmental reasons, with the exception of those State plants that are being retrofitted so that they can operate cleaner, more efficiently, and more often this summer.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              State of California,                              Environmental Protection Agency,                                   Sacramento, CA, March 28, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It has been alleged that air      quality regulations are a major contributor to California's      current power shortage crisis and are constraining energy      supplies. In his March 22, 2001, testimony before the House      Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee (enclosed), Dr. Alan      Lloyd, Chairman of the California Environmental Protection      Agency's Air Resources Board (ARB), refuted those statements.      The situation in California has not changed. No essential      power generation is off-line due to air quality constraints.       As you know, on February 8, 2001, Governor Gray Davis      issued a series of Executive Orders to comprehensively      address power generation. The Orders boosted generating      capacity by authorizing increased output at existing      facilities, accelerated power plant construction, streamlined      the review process for new facilities, and provided      incentives for distributed and renewable generation.       California regulatory agencies are quickly and successfully      expediting permits for new generating units. Since April      1999, nine major power projects (including one expansion)      totaling an additional 6,300 megawatts (MW) have been      approved. Six plants are under construction with four      expected to be on-line this year between July and November.      Another 14 projects (new sitings and expansions) are under      review for an additional 7,700 MW of capacity. All of these      projects include the necessary environmental offsets and      required emission controls. The State has also realized the      need for short-term supply and is expediting permits for      smaller peaking plants. These peakers will be on-line for the      2001 summer peak season.       With regard to existing capacity, the ARB is continuing its      coordination with the California Independent System Operator      (Cal-ISO), local air districts, California Energy Commission      (CEC), and plant personnel to identify generating units that      may be constrained by air permit limitations and to remove      barriers to summer time operation. Governor Davis' Executive      Orders dealt with this matter as well, authorizing additional      compliance mechanisms to keep both power generation and      environmental protection on track. The U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency, Region IX, is working closely with      California regulatory agencies and has indicated support for      this approach.       This spring, a number of generating units are off-line for      routine maintenance. Many of them are taking advantage of      this downtime--and available labor--to install air pollution      controls. Please note, these installations have been      carefully coordinated with Cal-ISO. They were only authorized      upon a finding that sufficient supplies and reliability of      the power grid system would be maintained.       In summary, air quality agencies realize the seriousness of      the State's energy situation and have been working      diligently, and effectively, to site new power plants and      increase existing capacity while still addressing air quality      concerns. Existing state and federal laws provide significant      flexibility to make these adjustments. Governor Davis'      Executive Orders provide additional means and flexibility to      keep generation on-line and quickly permit new power plants.      The air quality regulatory system works. We believe that      California can increase energy supply while, at the same      time, protecting public health and the environment.      California citizens expect nothing less.           Sincerely,                                                Winston H. Hickox,                                                 Agency Secretary.       Enclosure.  Testimony of Dr. Alan C. Lloyd, Chairman, California Air Resources  Board, Before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, March                                 22, 2001       Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. My      name is Alan Lloyd, and I serve as Chairman of the California      Air Resources Board (ARB). I welcome the opportunity to      provide an overview of California's electricity challenge      with respect to air quality issues.       Over the past several months, Governor Davis has embarked      on a comprehensive strategy to address the electricity      situation in California. One of the major components of the      State's plan centers around increasing energy supplies by      expediting the construction of power plants and other sources      of generation. Specifically, we are in the midst of an      aggressive effort to bring 5,000 megawatts on line by this      summer and 20,000 megawatts by 2004 in order to meet      anticipated energy demand this summer and beyond.       Mr. Chairman, my main message is this: We can accomplish      this goal within the existing framework of California's air      quality regulations. Furthermore, environmental laws do not      pose a barrier in terms of our ability to bring new      generation on line and ensure that existing power plants can      operate at maximum capacity. In short, we can increase energy      supply in an expedited manner while at the same time      maintaining our commitment to the environment.       Air pollution controls have been identified as a major      contributor to California's current energy challenge. That      perception is not accurate. Air quality issues are a very      small part of the State's overall power production problem.      Where air quality rules have affected or might have      potentially affected the ability to create essential power,      state and local regulators have moved swiftly and      successfully to keep needed plants on line. Simply put, no      essential electricity generation     has been curtailed due to air emission limitations.      California's programs to protect public health are not a      major factor in the electricity shortages experienced to      date.       No single factor can explain the current energy crisis. The      matter is far too complex. However, it can be said with      certainty that environmental laws are not to blame. Under      existing environmental programs and the policy direction of      Governor Davis, state and local air regulators have had, have      used, and will continue to use, the considerable flexibility      included in California's regulatory programs to ensure that      power generating sources remain in operation under      environmentally sound conditions. While the review process      and decision making timelines have been streamlined,      substantive environmental standards and mitigation      requirements have not been compromised.       Over the last several months, there has been an increasing      focus on environmental laws as contributors to the energy      crisis. This concern has taken two distinct forms:       1. The charge that environmental laws have prevented      maximum utilization of existing electrical generation      facilities; and       2. The allegation that environmental laws have prevented      bringing new electrical generation facilities online.       There have also been charges that the State of California      has not be responsive enough in addressing the power issues,      and has not been willing to take the extraordinary actions      needed to deal with how environmental requirements have      affected electricity production.       Mr. Chairman, I submit to you that these statements have      diverted attention from the true and complex causes of the      current energy situation. As a result, they have not      contributed to productive efforts to resolve it. I would like      to briefly address each of these issues.       Although existing laws and regulations provide mechanisms      for addressing our power needs, they can also require      substantial time and process. Governor Davis, through the      exercise of his emergency powers under state law, has      significantly expanded state and local agencies' ability to      apply flexibility and common sense to act quickly to ensure      that power generation will continue.       By using his emergency powers and issuing Executive Orders,      Governor Davis has added substantially to the state's ability      to deal with our current energy situation. Executive Orders      D-24-01, D-26-01, and D-28-01 ensure that where statutory and      regulatory impediments exist--related to either the continued      operation of an existing plant or the construction of a new      clean facility--they will be swiftly addressed and resolved.      The Executive Orders also provide that these actions will be      accomplished without sacrificing needed air quality      protections.       State and local agencies now have both the direction the      authority they need to expeditiously review and approve      permits. Under the Governor's Executive Orders, they are:       Allowing the continued operation of existing facilities      that might otherwise face limits on hours of operation.       Expediting the review and permit approval for new peaking      facilities that have acquired the needed control technology      and mitigation, but need rapid processing to come on line      quickly.       Enabling new peaking plants to obtain emission credits      needed for permitting through the state, rather than      arranging for them through private transactions.       Completing permit reviews and approvals for new large      facilities in as little as four months to enable new capacity      to begin construction expeditiously.       The Governor's Executive Orders maintain all substantive      environmental protections. For example, existing units must      continue to utilize all of the required emission control      equipment, and must provide funds to mitigate the impact of      their increased hours of operation. Similarly, new units must      utilize the best available control equipment and must      continue to provide emission reduction credits to mitigate      their emission increases. Permitting will take less time, but      will not be less protective.       All central station electrical generating facilities are      permitted by local air pollution control districts under      rules incorporated in the State Implementation Plan (SIP).      These permits reflect operator-provided information,      including factors such as intended hours of operation and      fuel type. This information has a direct bearing on the      facility's anticipated emissions. Based on operator-provided      data, emission limits are established through the air      permits. It is these operator-defined limits that have been      at issue. In many cases, these facilities are now in a      position of having, or wanting to generate additional      electrical power in excess of the time periods assumed in the      original permitting process.       Despite this unanticipated high level of operation, through      the joint efforts of local air districts, the Air Resources      board (ARB), and the California Energy Conservation and      Development Commission (CEC), as well as the assistance of      the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), needed      electrical generation has not been interrupted. State law and      local regulations provide several means to address permit      limitations without disruption of electrical generation or      unmitigated damage to air quality.       The ARB has assisted local air districts in addressing any      potential issues arising out of their efforts to maintain      power generation. ARB has maintained close coordination with      the U.S. EPA to ensure that state and local response to the      energy situation does not raise concerns at the federal      level. We have approached the electricity shortage with an      environmentally sound balance of need awareness and impact      concern. U.S. EPA has indicated its understanding of the      complexities California is facing and has indicated a      continued willingness to assist.       At the Governor's direction, the ARB and air districts have      been able to balance the State's energy needs with the      public's right to clean air. Existing air quality regulations      have provided the flexibility to address expeditiously the      unexpected power demands of the State without material harm      to air quality. These accommodations have been completed in      very short time frames and have ensured continued power      generation. This flexibility has been used numerous times      over the last six months to enable continued power      production. These have affected both large and small plants      are summarized in Attachment 1.       The additional grants of authority to the Governor under      the Emergency Services Act augments existing statutes and      increases the ability of state and local agencies to work      together in significantly reduced time frames. Whether it is      providing for an existing source to operate beyond its      permitted hours of operation of streamlining certification of      new peaking sources, the Governor's emergency Executive      Orders provide even greater flexibility in responding to      source specific generation issues than previously existed.       All new proposed power plants must be constructed and      operated in compliance with applicable federal, state, and      local air pollution requirements. Within California, the 35      local air districts are responsible for regulating emissions      from stationary sources, including power plants. At the state      level, ARB is the agency charged with coordinating efforts to      attain and maintain federal and state ambient air quality      standards and comply with the requirements of the federal      Clean Air Act. To this end, ARB coordinates the activities of      all the districts in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.       Some have cited California's environmental laws as the      reason new power generation has not been built in recent      years. However, a review of CEC data demonstrates otherwise.      Since April 1999, CEC has approved 13 major power projects      (including one expansion) totaling over 8,400 MW of      additional capacity. Six of these plants are under      construction and four of those six are expected to be on line      this year, with start dates spanning from July through      November. Another 15 projects (new sitings and expansions)      are currently under review for an additional 6,700 MW of      capacity. Lastly, there is still an additional 7,960 MW of      capacity that has been publicly announced and for which the      CEC anticipates receiving applications this year.       Some have also argued that costs of compliance with air      quality regulations are too substantial and must be relaxed      to achieve needed power generation. This argument is also      flawed. Today, approximately 15,000 MW of new electrical      generation has either been approved or is in the licensing      process. All of these projects have included the necessary      environmental offset packages and have incorporated all      required emission controls. Compliance with these      requirements has proven to be both technically and      economically feasible.       To bring new, additional peaking facilities on line,      Governor Davis has created both a streamlined review process      and an ARB-operated emission offset bank. These actions will      ensure that all necessary peaking facilities can also be      sited.       The CEC's siting process is designed to take 12 months.      However, a number of factors, other than environmental      regulations, have recently influenced individual project      timelines. Over the last two to three years, the actions of      local activists, businesses, and others have slowed the pace      of some projects. In fact, power generators themselves have      utilized the siting process to hold up the licensing of a      competitor.       Since 1997, competing companies have intervened in 12 of      the 21 projects proposed for licensing. Their participation      has slowed the process in at least four cases.       Constraints on electrical generation capacity from central      station powerplants have caused increased interest in the use      of distributed generation (DG). DG is electrical generation      at or near the place of use. Governor Davis supports      legislation action that will provide incentives for      distributed generation. Last September, the Governor signed      Senate Bill 1298, which directs ARB to establish a      certification program and adopt uniform emissions standards      and general air quality guidelines for DG technologies. By      law, this program must be in effect by January 1, 2003. ARB      is on a fast track and expects to complete this December--     over a year ahead of schedule.       As the foregoing demonstrates, it is not environmental      regulation that has prevented the creation of additional      power generation. Rather, many factors have contributed to      the current crisis. Among those is also the fact that market      participants can and do manipulate the electrical power      market by withholding capacity in order to maximize their      price of electricity.       Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)      agrees. Although it found insufficient evidence of market      manipulation by any individual market participant: ``. . .      there was clear evidence that the California market      structure and rules provide the opportunity for sellers to      exercise market     power when supply is tight and can result in unjust and      unreasonable rates under the FPA . . . we reaffirm our      findings that unjust and unreasonable rates were charged      and could continue to be charged unless remedies are      implemented.''       The Air Resources Board is continuing its efforts to ensure      that California has the maximum electrical power output      possible, while still protecting public health and mitigating      any adverse effects of increased electrical output. This is      being done within the confines of existing law as recently      expanded through the Governor's Executive Orders. To quote      Governor Davis, California is demonstrating that we can cut      red tape, build more power plants and continue to protect the      environment.       Our State's history reflects a pattern of success even in      the face of unparalleled challenges. California, the most      populous state in the nation, has made incredible strides in      improving air quality and protecting public health. At the      same time, the State has enjoyed immense population and      business growth. During this current energy situation,      California will maintain its record of achieving a balance      among all the issues to ensure that a reasonable and      successful solution is achieved.       In sum, the air quality regulatory system works. The      Governor's utilization of his emergency powers to expedite      the process of power siting while maintaining environmental      standards confirms that California can maintain its      environmental and economic objectives.       Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify      this morning.
