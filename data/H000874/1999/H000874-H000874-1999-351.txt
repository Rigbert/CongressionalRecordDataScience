Speaker, I rise today to share information about Guillian-Barre Syndrome Day on Saturday, May 1, 1999.  ``GBS Awareness Day'' is an effort to help educate the public and to focus attention on Guillian-Barre Syndrome. GBS is an inflammatory disorder of the peripheral nerves. It is characterized by the rapid onset of weakness and often, paralysis of the legs, arms, breathing muscles, and face. Although most people recover, this can take months, and some have long-term disabilities. It is important to note that GBS can develop in any person at any age, regardless of gender or ethnic background.  Although a great number of cases developed from the 1976 swine flu vaccine, almost 50 percent occur shortly after a viral infection such as a sore throat or diarrhea. This should bring home how susceptible we all are to this baffling disorder which is unpredictable and as of yet, it's cause is unknown.  In 1980, in response to the growing number of cases, Robert and Estelle Benson founded the Guillian-Barre Syndrome Foundation International. The foundation has developed 130 chapters to help serve the needs of patients, families, and friends while at the same time raise money to fund medical research. The foundation is proud to have on it's medical advisory board some of the world's leading experts on GBS, as well as physicians who themselves have the disorder.  One of GBS Foundation cofounders, Mr. Ralph Neas, has played a vital role in bringing awareness to the community through his work at the local Montgomery County Chapter. It is the mission of those who have been affected by this sometimes devastating disease to assure that everyone is aware of the established support system and to better educate the community on the facts and symptoms of Guillian-Barre Syndrome.  I congratulate the foundation on their efforts and wish them great success in their mission.                          ____________________
