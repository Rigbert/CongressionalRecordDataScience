President, when the bomb exploded outside the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City last month, my thoughts and prayers and I suspect that those of all Americans turned immediately to the victims of this horrendous act. The terrorism legislation that has been introduced for our consideration, however, is silent with respect to victims of terrorism.  This amendment is intended to fill that void left in this bill and include attention to those who suffer immediately and directly from violent extremism. It is my desire that this amendment, to include attention to victims of terrorism in the bill, will provide a series of changes in our growing body of law recognizing the rights and needs of victims of crime on which we can quickly reach agreement.  No one will deny that a comprehensive approach to terrorism demands attention to the victims of terrorism. That is what this amendment will provide.  The amendment helps correct a gap in the law for residents of the United States who are victims of terrorism that occurs outside the borders of the United States and who are not in the military, civil service or civilians in the service of the United States and, therefore, not eligible for benefits in accordance with the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986.  Thus, this amendment, the Victims of Terrorism Act, adds to the Victims of Crime Act provisions that authorize supplemental grants to the States to provide compensation and assistance for residents of such States who are victims of terrorism or mass violence while overseas.  One of the continuing tragedies of the downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, is that the United States Government had no authority to provide assistance or compensation to the victims of that heinous crime. Likewise, the U.S. victims of the Achille Lauro incident could not be given aid. There has simply been no authority in our law for the Department of Justice to respond to these victims through our crime victims' programs. This is wrong and will be remedied by this amendment.  In its report to Congress last summer, the Office for Victims of Crime at the U.S. Department of Justice identified a related problem. both the ABA and the State Department have commented on their concern and their desire that crime victims compensation benefits be provided to U.S. citizens victimized in other countries. This is an important step in that direction.  Certainly U.S. victims of terrorism overseas are deserving of our support and assistance.  In addition, this Victims of Terrorism Act provides authority to respond to the consequences of violent extremism here at home. We in this country have been shielded from much of the terrorism perpetrated abroad. That sense of security has been shaken by the bombing in Oklahoma City, the destruction at the World Trade Center in New York, and the assaults upon the White House.  The Victims of Terrorism Act adds to the Victims of Crime Act provisions for supplemental grants to States to provide emergency relief in the wake of an act of terrorism or mass violence that might otherwise overwhelm the resources of a State's crime victims compensation program and crime victims assistance services.  We all applaud the efforts of our Office for Victims of Crime in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing. It helped to organize a crisis response team of specially trained professionals who were dispatched within hours to the disaster. I know that the National Organization for Victims Assistance was critical in providing timely assistance to Oklahoma City victims and [[Page S7732]] thank and acknowledge their heroic efforts.  This amendment will allow them to do more. I want to thank the dedicated officials at the Department of Justice Office for Victims of Crime, John Stein of the National Organization for Victims Assistance, Dan Eddy of the National Association of Crime Victims Compensation Boards, and David Beatty of the National Victim Center for their help, counsel, and suggestions in connection with this amendment.  The amendment builds on the crime victims assistance programs of the States and Federal victims assistance provided through our U.S. attorney's offices to furnish emergency assistance in times that demand it. I propose that we allow the Attorney General and the Office for Victims of Crime, additional flexibility in its targeting of resources to victims of terrorism, mass violence, and the trauma and devastation that they cause.  The Victims of Terrorism Act's supplemental grants to provide compensation and assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence are funded through an emergency reserve established as part of the crime victims fund. I do not intend for this emergency reserve to be established at the expense of our States' ongoing compensation and assistance programs. Indeed, funds are not available for the reserve until the full annual compensation grants are funded and the crime victims fund has received in excess of 110 percent of the amount deposited in the previous year so that assistance programs will be adequately funded, as well.  The emergency reserve will also serve as a rainy day fund to supplement compensation and assistance grants to the States for years in which deposits to the crime victims fund are inadequate. There have been deep swings in the amount of funding deposited annually and, therefore, available for distribution. This emergency reserve will provide the Director with the means to even out what would otherwise be wide variations in annual grants and allow those providing these critical services some additional confidence that funding will be available even following a year of poor deposits.  The emergency reserve's ceiling of $50 million is intended to allow confidence and the vital resources needed to take action to supplement grants in down years. In order to serve its intended purposes, the emergency reserve and, for that matter, the entire crime victims fund must be accorded respect and security. This is a trust fund that is dedicated to critical needs.  I hope through the provisions of this act to provide some greater certainty to our State and local victim's assistance programs so that they can know that our commitment to victims programming will not wax and wane with events. Accordingly, the amendment would allow grants to be made for a 3-year cycle of programming, rather than the year of award plus one, which is the limit contained in current law. This change reflects the recommendation of the Office for Victims of Crime contained in its June 1994 report to Congress.  Our State and local communities and community-based nonprofits cannot be kept on a string like a yoyo if they are to plan and implement victims' assistance and compensation programs. They need to be able to program and hire and have a sense of stability if these measures are to achieve their fullest potential.  I know, for instance, that, in Vermont, Lori Hayes and Pat Hayes at the Vermont Center for Crime Victims Services; Judy Rex and the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Abuse; Karen Bradley from the Vermont Center for Prevention and Treatment of Sexual Abuse; and others, provide tremendous service under difficult conditions. Such dedicated individuals and organizations will be greatly aided by increasing their programming cycle by even 1 year. Three years has been a standard that has worked well in other settings.  Unfortunately, even with the recently announced decreases in violent crime, it is certain that we will have too many crime victims who need assistance in the years ahead. While we have made progress over the last 15 years in recognizing crime victims' rights and providing much-needed assistance, we still have more to do. It is in recognition of these needs and the additional authorities and scope being added to the Victims of Crime Act by this Victims of Terrorism Act that I include a provision to raise the base amount for small States from $200,000 to $500,000 for their assistance programs. This is funding that will be put to good use.  I am proud to have played a role in passage of the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and the victims provisions included in such measures as the Federal Courts Administration Act of 1992 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  My greatest hope would be that the Victims of Terrorism Act, while improving our responsiveness to national tragedies, need never be invoked. My concern is that we have not seen the end to terrorism or mass violence and that its provisions will be important in our future.  A number of our colleagues have great interest in crime victims legislation, including Senators Hatch, Biden, Ford, DeWine, Kyl, and McCain and I look forward to working with them on these important matters. In connection with this amendment I want to thank, in particular, Senators Hatch, Biden, and McCain for working with me on it.  We can do more to see that victims of crime, including terrorism, are treated with dignity and assisted and compensated with Government help.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of support for this amendment from the National Organization for Victims Assistance, which outlines many of the its benefits.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             National Organization                                            for Victim Assistance,                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1995.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I write to express the enthusiastic      support of the National Organization for Victim Assistance      for your proposed amendment to the anti-terrorism bill now      before the Senate--an amendment that would establish vitally      needed services for the victims of terrorism through the      structure of the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) and its Crime      Victims Fund.       Let me give you a sense of the need for such an emergency      service from our perspective:       When we tried to assist the relatives of Americans held      hostage in Beruit, one service we tried to give them was the      wherewithal to make telephone calls to friends and family--a      healthy coping device which virtually every hostage family      uses extensively, often causing them financial hardship. We      found a charitable businessman who volunteered to organize      contributions to a free phone service for a designated member      of each family. Sadly, the contributions dried up before the      hostage crisis ended.       We also tried to help the niece and nephew of Peter      Kilbourne return his body from the East Coast for burial in      his home state of California (the State Department being      authorized to transport the remains of the slain hostage only      to the nearest U.S. port of entry). Happily, we connected the      relatives to an imaginative victim advocate in Santa Clara      County, who persuaded the state victim compensation program      to underwrite the transportation and burial costs.      Unfortunately, few American victims of terrorism overseas      have such a connection to a victim advocate, and very few      compensation programs have the authority to assist its      citizens who are victimized beyond the borders of the United      States.       And as the coordinator of NOVA's Crisis Response Team that      arrived in Oklahoma City the same day that its Federal      Building was bombed, I sensed immediately that which is now      being slowly documented--that those who had experienced      significant, immediate emotional crisis numbered in the      scores of thousands, that those at risk of experiencing      persistent crisis reactions are surely in the thousands, and      that those at risk of debilitating post-trauma stresses      number at least in the hundreds. NOVA's ongoing planning work      with just one institution--the city school system--shows us      that, whatever good has been done by our      volunteer crisis counselors and their counterparts in      Oklahoma City, the need for caregiving services over the      next year or two far exceeds available resources, and that      full-time crisis counselors and post-trauma therapists      must be hired for the task if society is to perform the      same healing services for these victims as for victims of      other violent crimes.       Your proposal to meet this need is not merely timely and      compassionate but inspired:       It would rename the existing financial reserves in the      Crime Victims Fund by calling [[Page S7733]] them an      ``emergency reserve,'' which precisely describes both its      original purpose--to cover any shortfall in the Fund's      revenues in a given year--and to circumscribe the purposes      for which the new authorization is being created--a class of      emergencies for which there are no victim assistance      resources at present;       It would raise additional revenues for the Fund to help      cover the new expenses;       It would cover domestic acts of ``mass violence'' so that      one need not immediately ascertain the motives of a terror-     inducing criminal before acting to assist the affected      community; and       It would place on the Director of the Office for Victims of      Crime the task of devising appropriate regulations,      presumably in consultation with the State Department and      administrators of state victim assistance and compensation      programs, among others, so that the emergency authority can      be invoked quickly, frugally, and imaginatively.       Let me add a final thought: in our ongoing work with      ``Operation Heartland'' in Oklahoma City--the cooperative      enterprise of city, county, state, and federal agencies to      ease the pains of thousands of victims of the Murrah Federal      Office Building bombing--we have seen just how the resources      of your amendment would be put to use--quickly and      effectively. The same is true of the monumental task that      will someday face city, county, and federal criminal justice      agencies, that is, how to meet their burdens of preserving      the victims' rights when prosecuting a crime which, by      design, produced thousands of anguished and grieving victims      of violence.       For these reasons, we very much hope that your amendment      will enjoy bipartisan support and speedy enactment.           Sincerely,                                                    John H. Stein,                                                  Deputy Director.
