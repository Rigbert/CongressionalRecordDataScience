Speaker, I include in the Record the following Homily and Eulogy for Sister Catherine Pinkerton:       The readings chosen for Catherine today by her CSJ sisters      are wonderfully descriptive of who she was.       Catherine's life was all about bringing glad tidings to the      poor and letting the oppressed go free. She was so powerfully      passionate and so dedicated to her mission of justice, who      can doubt that the Spirit had indeed anointed her for this      work?--And is she not a true daughter of Joseph? (Luke 4: 14-     23)       The first reading from the Book of Wisdom (Message version)      describes her so well: inquiring mind coupled with      dedication. She was one of a kind, able to multitask and keep      an edge; nimble in argument, able to conduct three      conversations at the same time; kept a clean record, always      had her wits about her; wouldn't hurt a fly; was drawn to the      good; sharp as a tack, nothing got past her; always had an      orange in her pocket; cordial with humans, kind to animals;      (Some examples--I'm told that one     fish in the motherhouse fish tank actually always responded      to the sound of her voice. She loved the deer on our      property, and was once found after hours roaming the kitchen      trying to find some food for a wounded doe. Her great niece      Kelly Haas recalls how much Catherine loved the horses at the      stable where Catherine came to watch her learning to ride.)      could hold her own in male company. She was a model of      virtue, didn't miss a trick; she could discern the movements      of the soul--whether intellectual or moral, subtle or not-so-     subtle.'' (Wisdom 7: 22-23)       The only thing that's missing from this fascinating list is      that her hair and makeup were always perfect, her two      business suits beautifully tailored, and she always looked as      if she had just stepped out of a band box.       Seriously.       So how shall we eulogize our Catherine?       Perhaps we should begin at the beginning--her heart for the      marginalized was instilled at age seven, when her parents      were about to buy a new home right before the Great      Depression, Catherine loved the house they were considering,      particularly because of its large library. ``I told all my      friends about it,'' she said. ``But Dad sat us down and said,      `Mother and I have decided not to buy that house.' I said,      `Why, Daddy?' He said, `Because something terrible is going      to happen in this country, and there will be people who won't      have food or housing or jobs and . . . we have to help      them.'' And I said, `Why can`t they help themselves?' He      said, 'Some people don't have resources like education and      jobs.' And then he said, `And besides, missy, you don't need      a big house when other people don't have food on the table.'      And that was my first lesson in justice.''       Later, involvements with Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker      Movement and friendship with Mother Margaret Mary Neary were      influential in Catherine's decision to join the Congregation      of St. Joseph.       After Vatican II, Catherine quickly acquired multiple      involvements in Cleveland. She was a respected teacher,      skilled choir director and principal at St. Joe's Academy      where she annually taught the entire student body to sing the      Battle Hymn of the Republic in four-part harmony. She worked      closely with Cleveland groups that focused on the poor and on      advancing women's roles in church and society. In the 1970s      she worked as a consultant to Cleveland's parish councils and      other religious communities. She was president of the      Sisters' senate and became a founding member of the Cleveland      Women's Ordination Conference.       Among her local awards are two naming her as one of the      Most Influential Women in Cleveland as well as the John      Carroll University Centennial Education Medal. From 1976-1984      she served in leadership with our Congregation of St. Joseph      and in 1982 was elected to the presidency of Leadership      Conference of Women Religious (LCWR), which at the time      represented all 130,000 US sisters.       And so began Catherine's national ministry--first via      LCWR--and then in 1984 when she began working as a lobbyist      for NETWORK, the Catholic Social Justice lobby founded by      LCWR sisters.        I'd like to take a moment now and reprise a tribute from      her LCWR and NETWORK sisters when in 2006, they gave her the      highest honor any former LCWR president could receive--the      Outstanding Leadership Award. It is a good snapshot of how      Catherine lived out her anointing to work for justice and the      poor:       The late Sr. Bette Moslander, CSJ who was part of the LCWR      presidency with Catherine said: ``Catherine was in LCWR      leadership at a time when the conference and US women      religious were the focus of intense scrutiny by the church      and by the US government. The major shifts of Vatican II      renewal had brought about changes that were not yet      completely accepted by the Catholic population in this      country or by the Congregation of Religious in Rome.''       The late Sr. Miriam Therese Larkin, CSJ, also in the LCWR      presidency with Catherine, says: ``Catherine's wisdom,      insight and straightforwardness during these times enabled      her to make her point so clearly and cogently that further      protests lost their meaning and simply died. We really cannot      measure the value of her service to women religious in the      United States and in the world.''       Former Network Director Sr. Kathy Thornton RSM wrote: ``It      is perhaps on Capitol Hill that [Catherine] has had the      strongest impact, commanding attention with her intelligence      and unwavering determination as an advocate for those unduly      burdened by the injustices of society. . . . Catherine has      become a formidable presence in the halls of Congress.       Jean Stokan, policy director of Pax Christi USA: ``When      Catherine walks the halls of Congress, she parts waters.      Heads turn and useless chatter ceases when she enters a      room.''       NETWORK colleague Michael Culliton concurs. ``I remember      trips to Capitol Hill with Catherine. I was struck by the      number of times we were stopped by staffers and elected      officials who knew Catherine by name. Ever a woman of      justice, her warm return of a greeting was typically followed      with a strong injunction related to an upcoming vote or      policy debate.''       Kathy Thornton again: ``Catherine has become at home in      centers of power. She has won the respect of many heavy-     hitters in the political world and can ably tease Bill      Clinton, confer with Hillary Clinton and chide Ted Kennedy,      who when he does not see Catherine for a while, admits to      really missing her.''       Sr. Janet Mock CSJ--the former Executive Director of LCWR--     notes: ``She is equally at home, however, with the people who      live on the margins. Her co-workers note that Catherine puts      the same effort into building relationships with the world's      power brokers as she puts into building relationships with      the marginalized people whom she knows from the streets of      DC. As she uses her intellect to analyze social ills, she      uses her heart to understand the people affected by them.       U.S. Representative Marcy Kaptur`, who knew Catherine for      over 30 years, told us at her wake last night that Catherine      was the founding face of NETWORK and of Catholic Social      Teaching in Congress. ``Network in its early years would not      have been possible without her inspired leadership.''       By way of background, during Clinton admin--Catherine      worked with then First Lady Hillary Clinton and Senator      Edward Kennedy in an effort to craft comprehensive health      care legislation. She brought Catholic Social Teaching      principles to the debate and was a strong advocate for      ensuring that those without coverage would have access to      healthcare. When that effort faltered, she became a      passionate advocate for the Child Health Insurance Program      for families too poor to have health insurance but did not      qualify for Medicaid.       At the Wake Service last night, the current Executive      Director of NETWORK, Sr. Simone Campbell reflected that      Catherine's perseverance and lobbying had actually prepared      the way for the Affordable Care Act, and related how happy      she was to see it passed just before Catherine retired so she      could experience the rich fruits of her over 25 years of      dedicated lobbying.       Sr. Nancy Sylvester IHM remembers that when Catherine came      to NETWORK ``[She] also took a great interest in our young      interns/associates. She mentored them and took time to drive      them home if needed or to assist them in other ways.''       Sr. Theresa Kane RSM--LCWR president just before Catherine:      ``Catherine Pinkerton was a dedicated, enthusiastic and a      most gracious woman religious to all who encountered her. She      lived a full, joyous and most worthwhile life and meets her      loving God with many graces. Indeed she has earned and been      gifted with the hundredfold!''       At a DC farewell for Catherine, the well-known Washington      Post Columnist EJ Dionne praised her this way: ``It has been      said that while we are born with original sin we also have      access to original grace...Sr. Catherine's public witness has      always been about grace--about the capacity to solve problems      and help people. We have heard her preach, we have watched      her work, and boy are we grateful--this city could use a      whole lot more people like you, Sr. Catherine. You make us      proud to be Catholic.'' (Full remarks can be found at https:/     /www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0qHNO3GquO)       So, are we getting the idea that Catherine was sort of a      larger than life kind of person? Well, yes--and no.       We, Cleveland sisters were immensely proud of her but we      also dealt gently with her frailties.       Last, unbeknownst to any but her closest confidantes, there      were the insecurities that sometimes plagued her. So this      closing quote comes from someone Catherine has described as      her soulmate: Sr. Felicia Petruziello, who lived with her in      Washington for a number of years and is a lifelong friend:       ``We were soulmates in our earthiness--our human      weaknesses,'' says Felicia. ``Both of us were always doubting      ourselves--we were connected in being anxious and wondering      if what we were doing or saying was right or not. It wasn't      the big and famous things she did that connected us but our      insecurities. When she gave a speech, she needed to have five      people read it first to see if it was OK. Before she received      her award at LCWR she spent most of the time in the bathroom      because she was so anxious about whether her speech was good      enough. And she found it so helpful to ride up in the      elevator with Joe Biden's mother just before her benediction      at the 2008 Democratic convention. She felt more secure that      another ``old lady'' was present.''       ``This is something most people didn't know,'' concludes      Felicia. ``She often felt very insecure inside--but that      didn't stop her--she is a model for how we can do big things      when we move beyond our insecurities.''       ``She is a model for how we can do big things when we move      beyond our insecurities.''       I'd like to close with Catherine's own words from a news      story at the time of her LCWR award: ``Our foundresses dealt      with chaos,'' she said, ``and we have to deal with chaos now      because only out of chaos is going to come the creativity of      the future. Women Religious are the prophetic dimension of      the church. Religious life is a prophetic gift given to the      church and humanity. We stand on the line of what is and what      is yet to be, and that is our role.''       ``We stand on the line of what is and what is yet to be . .      . .''       And isn't this a daughter of Joseph?                    Sister Catherine Pinkerton, CSJ                      (Congregation of St.Joseph)                       Formerly Sister Mary Pius                        Born September 22, 1921                 Entered Eternal Life December 28, 2017       Catherine was born, the third of four children, on      September 22, 1921 to Charles D. and     Anne Berry Pinkerton. She grew up on Cleveland's west side in      a family that was both politically conscious and socially      active and where discussion of ``issues'' (which almost      always included the children) was a regular part of family      interaction. Her father ran a steel foundry supply business      and was a salesman most of his life. Her mother was both a      homemaker and helped her husband with the business.       Catherine talked about Sunday afternoon walks to the lake      with her father where she learned many valuable things among      which was that a woman could do anything if she understood      how the world and business worked. Catherine attended St.      Ignatius Elementary School from which she graduated in 1935.      She then went on to St. Joseph Academy, graduating in 1939.      During her high school years, she was introduced to the      Catholic Worker movement and was soon volunteering at a soup      kitchen. She became very close to Mother Margaret Mary Neary,      who was instrumental in helping her make the decision to      enter the Sisters of St. Joseph, which she did immediately      following graduation.       Her parents were reluctant to see her enter, but they did      support her in her decision. She received the habit in 1940      and was given the religious name, Sister Mary Pius. She      attended St. John College from which she received her BSE in      1950 and her MA (Curriculum, English, and Education) in 1957.      She did further study at both John Carroll University      (certification in secondary school administration) and Laval      University in Canada (music). As was the case with most      sisters at that time, much of her formal education was done      on Saturdays and during summers while she was teaching.       Sister Mary Pius's teaching assignments were: St. Rose      (1943-50); St. Joseph, Canton (1950-57); St. Joseph Academy      (1957-73). During her time at St. Joseph Academy, she was a      teacher, the principal, and the director of the Junior      Professed Sisters. This was around the time of the Second      Vatican Council and Mother Margaret Mary Neary (Catherine's      friend from high school) told her that she would be      responsible for preparing young sisters for a Church and a      community which didn't yet exist. What a challenge that was!       In all the different capacities which Catherine served at      St. Joseph Academy, she was always involved with teaching      music. She was especially skillful in getting large groups to      sing well. There was nothing like hearing the entire school      sing, ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic''!       It was during these years that Catherine was elected to the      Diocesan Sisters' Senate and eventually became its president.      She gradually became more and more involved in organizations      of women religious. From 1973-75, she was the chairperson of      NAWR (National Association of Women Religious). In 1975, she      came back to Cleveland and worked for the Diocese in pastoral      planning as the Director of Parish Councils (1975-80).      Shortly after, she was elected to the leadership team of the      Congregation of St. Joseph. (1976-84). When her term was      completed, Catherine went to work for NETWORK, a national      Catholic social justice lobby in Washington, D.C., which was      affectionately known by some as the ``nuns' lobby'' (1984-     2010). NETWORK was founded in the early 1970's by Catholic      sisters to do research on and lobbying in Congress regarding      those issues which affect the lives of the poor and      minorities in our country and in the world. Catherine was      honored to give the benediction at the 2008 National      Democratic Convention in Denver, pausing before praying, and      delivering a prayer of hope and gratitude to the crowd and      the nation.       Catherine's health caused her to decide in 2010 to return      to Cleveland and to St. Joseph Hall where she remained a      vibrant part of the local CSJ community. We are grateful for      having shared in the life and the gifts of Sister Catherine      and we celebrate her entrance into eternal life.       The following are a few additional reflections about      Catherine:       ``Catherine has a remarkable capacity to build      relationships. In the mystical body of Christ, Catherine is      sinew and nerves: connecting and loving each unique      expression of the Divine.'' (Michael Culliton)       ``Catherine, politically astute and passionately committed      to the Gospel, never backed away from the way of justice and      peace in the concrete and often messy reality of our time.''      (Bette Mosslander CSJ)       ``Catherine has ventured into the halls of Congress to      speak truth to power. She approaches Senators and      Representatives not with money to line campaign coffers, but      with faith, a deep knowledge of the issues, and a belief in      the social Gospel of Jesus. As a consequence, she has touched      the hearts--and changed the votes--of countless members of      Congress.'' (Kathy Thornton, RSM)                          ____________________
