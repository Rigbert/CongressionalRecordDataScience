Speaker, the American people need to know what's happening.  They pulled the Transportation-Housing bill. I wasn't for that bill as it came out of committee, nor were any Democrats that voted on it in committee, but they brought it to the floor and then pulled it. Nine days from tomorrow, nine legislative days from tomorrow, we are going to have that issue of how we are going to fund government and keep it running.  The Senate just a few minutes ago refused to allow the Senate--because the Republican Party voted ``no'' on bringing debate to close after days of debate and discussion, and they voted ``no'' to take the HUD bill up for discussion.  So in both Houses the Republican Party has abandoned the appropriations process. Now, I've just said that.  Hal Rogers, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a conservative Republican, says this:  ``I am extremely disappointed with the decision to pull the bill from the House calendar today. The prospects of passing this bill in September are bleak at best, given the vote count on passage that was apparent this afternoon. With this action, the House has declined to proceed on the implementation of the very budget it adopted'' without a single Democratic vote.  He went on to say--Mr. Rogers, conservative, Kentucky, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Republican:       Thus, I believe that the House has made its choice:      sequestration--and its unrealistic and ill-conceived      discretionary cuts--must be brought to an end.  The Ryan budget was unrealistic when it was considered on this floor. Mr. Rogers voted for that budget. He knew then it was unrealistic. He knew then it could not be implemented.
