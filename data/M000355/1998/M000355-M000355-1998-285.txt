 President, I come to the floor today to support S. 1882, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998. This bill comes at a time when our nation's shifting job market has greatly increased student demand for post-secondary education. However, for many families in Kentucky and across the nation, the rising cost of tuition creates a real barrier to attending college. A majority of college students today rely upon some form of financial assistance in order to meet these escalating costs. For the first time in decades, loans constitute the largest part of student financial-aid packages. As the loan burden increases, students and their families are seeking greater choice in financial resources for higher education.  Making a college education more affordable has always been a priority of mine, and for the past several years I have introduced legislation to provide tax incentives to families who save for college. In fact, my legislation, which allows tax-free education savings in state-sponsored savings plans for education purposes, was included in the Parent and Student Savings Account Plus Act, which Congress approved earlier this year by a strong margin. The House and Senate approved this essential legislation in response to growing public interest in federal policies that facilitate personal planning and investment in education, and to provide students with greater choices in both academic programming and financial aid resources. However, this measure and similar initiatives have been heavily criticized by the Clinton Administration.  For example, throughout the HEA reauthorization process, President Clinton has repeatedly tried to limit students' financial options by creating a single-lender system run by the U.S. Department of Education. Banks, credit unions, and other qualified lenders currently use their financial expertise and experience in loan management to provide college loans for students and parents through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), while the U.S. Department of Education operates the Direct Lending program through participating colleges and universities. The Clinton Administration heralded the consumer benefits that would result from the competition between FFELP and the Direct Lending program during its original authorization in the 1993 Budget. Now, President Clinton has turned away from his original advocacy for greater choice in favor of making the U.S. Department of Education the sole lender for student loans.  Since its creation, the Direct Lending program's reputation has become synonymous with slow, inefficient service. The Department simply does not have the personnel or experience necessary to efficiently process the high volume of loans demanded by students. For example, in 1996, the processing of 900,000 student aid applications submitted to the Department were delayed by severe management problems. Just last year Congress was forced to pass the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act in response to the Department's stoppage in processing applications for direct loan consolidations. If students had been limited to one lending option, the Department's backlog and organizational problemswould have denied many students access to the student loans necessary for their enrollment in school.  Based on the Department's struggle to meet its responsibility to our nation's students, concerned members of the House and Senate have worked diligently to prevent another crisis in student access to college loans. Not all colleges and universities participate in the Direct Lending program, and the interest rate index adjustments supported by the 1993 Budget threaten to eliminate private lenders from the student loan market. Without the aid of private lenders, many students will be left without necessary financial assistance. S. 1882 rejects Clinton's repeated attempts to strangle consumer choice by revising the interest rate index on student loans, and improves the service and accountability standards of guaranty agencies who participate in the FFELP program.  The guaranty agency model included in this bill directs agencies to utilize the advantages of the Internet and other technological advances in order to increase the speed and efficiency of the student loan process. S. 1882 also increases the financial responsibility guaranty agencies must bear when a student loan goes into default. All lending organizations--public and private--should be held up to high standards of performance and fiscal integrity. By increasing agency accountability, this bill makes sure that students across the country have access to qualified, responsible lending agencies. By streamlining the loan process and weeding out irresponsible lenders, S. 1182 strengthens the ability of reliable agencies to offer low-interest student loans.  S. 1182 increases institutional accountability not only for lenders, but for institutions of higher education as well. A solid primary and secondary education is the base upon which future academic success is built, and a highly qualified teaching force is an essential component of a child's educational foundation. S. 1182 raises the bar with which we measure teachers by holding institutions of higher education that prepare teachers for classroom instruction responsible for the caliber of teachers they graduate.  From early childhood through post-secondary school, a child has no greater resource than a knowledgeable, skillful teacher in the classroom, and S. 1882 holds both states and institutions of higher education responsible for placing the best teachers in our public schools. Through the creation of Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants, S. 1882 focuses on state-based reform of the teacher certification process to ensure that new teachers are qualified both in instructional skills and the subject matter which they teach, and to hold institutions of higher education accountable for properly preparing teachers for the classroom. These grants also give states the flexibility to financially reward teachers whose students have high levels of academic performance, and the authority to remove unqualified teachers from the classroom. In addition, S. 1882 allows states to develop alternative certification options for college graduates and capable individuals from other professional and occupational backgrounds who are interested in teaching.  Students face many other barriers in addition to cost when preparing for acceptance into a post-secondary school. Many first-generation and low-income students have educational needs that are not met by routine classroom instruction. S. 1882 provides support services and counseling programs for these students through the reauthorization of federal TRIO programs. For years, students across Kentucky have benefited from the Upward Bound program, which assists disadvantaged students in gaining entrance into higher education and completing a course of study. Unfortunately, many Upward Bound students are forced to choose between summer educational programs and part-time employment. S. 1882 will enable these students to pursue challenging academic programs by expanding Upward Bound to include summer work study. The Talent Search program is also expanded to introduce low-income students to careers in which students from disadvantaged backgrounds are under-represented. I am pleased that S. 1882 reauthorizes and strengthens these two programs which are highly valued by students throughout Kentucky.  The influence of institutions of higher education is felt far beyond the classroom as many colleges and universities are providing long-term leadership for communities undergoing an economic transition. In Kentucky, the higher education community has done an exemplary job of molding its curricula to meet the economic needs of the Commonwealth. The University of Kentucky and Louisville have established world-class research programs and have extended their community recruitment and outreach programs. Many of Kentucky's regional colleges and private schools are also implementing programs complimentary to the goals of excellence outlined by their home communities and the state government. Kentucky's community colleges and technical schools recently integrated their academic and training programs to create a seamless system of post-secondary education. Such efforts to achieve cooperation and quality in post-secondary education will produce great benefits for Kentucky students in the years to come.  By recognizing the inextricable link between future economic viability and higher education, Kentucky is a prime example of the direction in which higher education in the United States is headed. With this bill, we have the opportunity to open the doors of higher education to a greater number of students than ever before, at a time when post-secondary education is at a premium. As the summer draws to a close, and another school year is about to begin, I am pleased that ninety-five of my colleagues joined me in recognition of the important role education plays in shaping our nation's future by supporting S. 1882.                          ____________________
