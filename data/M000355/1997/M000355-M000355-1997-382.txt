 President, for the information of all Senators, following morning business tomorrow the Senate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 18, the Hollings resolution regarding a constitutional amendment on campaign expenditures. It is the majority leader's hope that on Thursday we will be able to reach an agreement as to when the Senate will complete action on this resolution. Rollcall votes are, therefore, possible throughout Thursday's session of the Senate, and the Senate may be asked to consider other legislative or executive matters that can be cleared.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
