  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, $422 billion: a new record deficit for the United States of America, yet another record for the Bush administration, eclipsing last year's record of $375 billion. But only inside the Washington Beltway or inside the Bush White House is this considered proof positive that his economic policies are working.  Working how? We are going to spend every penny of the Social Security surplus and replace it with IOUs. We are going to finance the entire Government of the United States outside the Department of Defense with borrowed money. We are going to add 10 percent to the national debt in one year, indebting another generation and a generation after that to work to pay off this profligate spending.  They say their policies are working. Working how? For whom? The very few wealthy people who have reaped the benefit of the huge tax cuts, while the rest of America is being given the tab.                          ____________________
