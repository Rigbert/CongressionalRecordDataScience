President, I was privileged to attend the event at the National Building Museum this morning commemorating the FBI's centennial anniversary. It was an extraordinary event honoring the dedicated men and women of the FBI. Four of the six FBI Directors who have guided this agency over the last 84 years were present, and Director Mueller made an inspiring speech to mark the occasion. He spoke about the history of the Bureau, paid tribute to those who have served and are currently serving, and spoke about the elements in the FBI's motto of ``fidelity, bravery and integrity.''  I was especially struck by Director Mueller's description of the values that guide the Bureau, values that are important to effective law enforcement. He said:       It is not enough to stop the terrorist--we must stop him      while maintaining his civil liberties.       It is not enough to catch the criminal--we must catch him      while respecting his civil rights.       It is not enough to prevent foreign countries from stealing      our secrets--we must prevent that from happening while still      upholding the rule of law.       The rule of law, civil liberties, and civil rights--these      are not our burdens. They are what make us better. And they      are what have made us better for the past 100 years.  I commend the Director for his words and for his service. I congratulate the men and women of the FBI and thank them for all they do every day to keep Americans safe, establish justice, and allow us to secure the blessings of liberty.  I ask that the remarks of Director Mueller be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             100th Anniversary Commemoration, July 17, 2008       Good morning to all. It is truly an honor to be here today      to mark this significant milestone in the Bureau's history,      and to share in the celebration of this occasion--the 100th      anniversary of the FBI.       My thanks to Attorney General Mukasey and the many other      distinguished guests for joining us today.       My special thanks, also, to Directors Webster, Sessions,      and Freeh, for being here with us on this day. Together, they      represent three decades at the Bureau in which we saw a      strong emphasis on white collar and organized crime, as well      as counterintelligence cases. We witnessed innovations in      crime-solving technologies, and a dramatic expansion of our      international program.       But let's go back a bit further in history.       One hundred years ago, Attorney General Charles Joseph      Bonaparte organized a group of investigators under the      Justice Department. In July, 1908, the Bureau of      Investigation opened its doors.       The first Bureau employees numbered just 34--nine      detectives, thirteen civil rights investigators, and twelve      accountants. They investigated, among other things, antitrust      matters, land fraud, and copyright violations.       Compare that to today's FBI--a threat-based, intelligence-     driven, technologically supported agency of over 30,000      employees--employees who are working in 56 field offices here      in the U.S., and 61 Legal Attache offices overseas.       Employees who are combatting crimes as diverse as      terrorism, corporate fraud, cyber crime, human trafficking,      and money laundering. J. Edgar Hoover would indeed be proud.       Today's FBI is often, and I believe accurately, described      as one of the world's few intelligence and law enforcement      agencies combined.       The culture of the FBI is now, and for the past 100 years      has been, a culture of hard work and dedication to protecting      the United States, no matter what the challenges.       In the wake of the September 11 attacks, it became clear      that the FBI's number one priority must be the prevention of      another terrorist attack. We refocused our mission, revised      our priorities, and realigned our work force.       We strengthened lines of communication between the Bureau      and our partners in the global intelligence and law      enforcement communities.       And we are now stronger, and better equipped to confront      the threats we face today.       Today's FBI continues to reflect and to embody its motto--     Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity. It is a motto emblazoned on      the FBI Seal. And it is worth its weight in gold.       For the past 100 years, the men and women of the FBI have      lived out their commitment to Fidelity, Bravery, and      Integrity. And it is precisely because they have done so that      the Bureau has the reputation that it has today.       Even so, these are qualities that need to be constantly      burnished by the men and women of the Bureau, to ensure that      they do not rust for lack of use.       For most of us, fidelity is faithfulness to an obligation,      trust or duty.       For the men and women of the FBI, fidelity also means      fidelity to country. It means fidelity to justice and to the      law, fidelity to the Constitution, fidelity to equality and      liberty.       Bravery is the quality of being willing to face danger,      pain, or trouble; to remain unafraid.       Bravery is not merely the act of rushing in where others      flee. It is the quiet, diligent dedication to facing down      those who would do us harm and to bring them to justice.       The well-known tennis champion and social humanitarian,      Arthur Ashe, once said, ``True heroism is remarkably sober,      very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at      whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever      cost.''       Bravery is the capstone in the stories of Special Agents      Rodney Miller, John O'Neill, and Lenny Hatton. On September      11, Miller and O'Neill went up, not down, the stairs of the      North Tower of the World Trade Center to help others to get      out.       Rodney Miller went all the way up to the 86th floor,      offering assistance to fire and police personnel on the      scene.       Through radio transmissions, Lenny Hatton reported the      crash of the second plane, and then assisted with evacuation      efforts. Neither he nor John O'Neill survived.       And we will never know how many lives were saved as a      result of their and the other first responders' extraordinary      bravery on that day.       Although their stories are unique, their bravery is      repeated by the men and women of the FBI working each and      every day around the country, and around the world.       Whether cracking down on public corruption or white collar      crime that corrodes the public trust. Or capturing criminals      who exploit children on the Internet, or commit violent      crime, hate crime, organized crime, espionage, or terrorism.       Such bravery can be seen in the story of Jay Tabb, a member      of our Hostage Rescue Team. Tabb received the FBI Star after      being shot and seriously wounded during the arrest of a      wanted fugitive.       Just months later, during a search of a terrorist safe-     house in Iraq, he was injured again, this time by a suicide      bomber. Despite his own injuries he rescued four wounded      soldiers. After each incident his first question was, how      soon can I get back to work with my team?       Bravery can be seen in the stories of our Task Force      Officers like Port Authority Police Detective Tom McHale, who      has served on our Newark Joint Terrorism Task Force since      1995.       The morning of September 11th, McHale was blocks away from      the World Trade Center when he heard the first plane fly      overhead. He raced to the scene to assist with evacuations      and rescues. He was caught in both building collapses, and      was injured.       And yet as a trained ironworker, McHale spent the next      weeks in the rubble cutting through steel recovering bodies.      He worked at Ground Zero for 12 hours a day, before reporting      for duty on the Joint Terrorism Task Force to help with      thousands of leads.       Bravery can be seen in the work of Jennifer Keenan, the      first female Special Agent to be stationed in Pakistan and in      Yemen, and who helped carry out dangerous missions in both of      those countries.       Along with Tom McHale, Keenan was part of the FBI team in      Pakistan who captured Al Qaeda suspect Abu Zubaidah.       Bravery can be seen in the story of Special Agent Bruce      Bennett and three other Agents, who, as John mentioned, were      seriously wounded just last March in a terrorist bombing,      also in Pakistan.       And it can be seen in the story of Walter Walsh, our oldest      retired Special Agent, who survived shootouts with gangsters      in the 1930s.       And it so happens that several of these individuals are      with us today. Would you all please stand so we can recognize      you?       And yet there is no shortage of heroes in the FBI. I am      certain there are also many unsung heroes with us here in the      audience today--heroes whose stories may never be told.       And we honor them as well.       For the men and women of the FBI, bravery is reflected not      only in the physical courage often necessary in the job. It      can be seen in the courage of conviction, in the courage to      act with wisdom in the face of fear, and in the courage it      takes to admit mistakes and to move forward.       This brings us to the third quality that defines the      Bureau, and that is integrity. It is the quality of being of      sound moral principle; uprightness, honesty, and sincerity.       For the men and women of the FBI, integrity is reflected in      all that we say and we do--in honesty, in keeping promises,      in fairness, in respect to others, and in compassion.       Integrity is, in some ways, the most important of the three      words that make up our motto. Integrity is the fire by which      fidelity and bravery are tested.       Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity set the expectations for      behavior; they set the standard for our work.       More than just a motto, for the men and women of the FBI,      Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity is a way of life.       And it has always been so. It has been said of FBI      employees that they stand on the shoulders of their      predecessors. Indeed, we do.       And while it is a time of change in the Bureau, our values      will never change.       It is not enough to stop the terrorist--we must stop him      while maintaining his civil liberties.       It is not enough to catch the criminal--we must catch him      while respecting his civil rights.       It is not enough to prevent foreign countries from stealing      our secrets--we must prevent that from happening while still      upholding the rule of law.       The rule of law, civil liberties, and civil rights--these      are not our burdens. They are what make us better. And they      are what have made us better for the past 100 years.       The men and women of the FBI today are part of history in      the making. We understand that we have been passed a legacy      and that it remains our responsibility to both build on and      to pass on that legacy to those who will succeed us.       John F. Kennedy once said, ``. . . when at some future date      the high court of history sits in judgment on each of us, . .      . our success or failure, in whatever office we hold, will be      measured by the answers to four questions: First, were we      truly men of courage . . . Second, were we truly men of      judgment . . . Third, were we truly men of integrity . . .      Finally, were we truly men of dedication?''       The men and women of the FBI, here and around the world,      past and present, can resoundingly answer yes to each of      these questions. That is because they live our motto each and      every day.       Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity remain the attributes of      an organization with a proud. history of distinguished      service to the nation. And each of us is indeed honored to be      part of that.       With Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity defining every FBI      employee, we stand fully ready to face the challenges of the      next century.       Thank you all again for being here with us today and God      bless.                          ____________________
