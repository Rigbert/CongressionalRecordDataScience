Speaker, I rise today to commemorate my former colleague, retired Congressman Delbert ``Del'' Latta, who passed away this past May in Bowling Green, Ohio.  Congressman Latta honorably served the people of Ohio's 5th Congressional district for thirty years, and was a pillar of the Republican Party, while making friends on both sides of the aisle. He served as close friend and advisor to Presidents Nixon and Reagan. Del was a man of strong convictions, helping him to quietly and steadily serve as a leader of his party for nearly three decades.  Before winning his seat in the House of Representatives, Del served as a member of the Ohio Senate for five years. During his early tenure in the U.S. House he served on the Rules Committee, but after 16 years his sterling reputation for honesty and integrity earned him a spot on the Judiciary Committee in 1974.  His time on the Judiciary Committee coincided with the Watergate hearings, perhaps the most challenging constitutional period of recent history. Del Latta was steadfast and resolute during this trying time, serving as a loyal defender of a President under siege. For those of us who have been through similar periods of history in this chamber, a President truly values Members of Congress who serve as loyal defenders in public, and honest brokers in private. Del Latta was both a loyal defender, and an honest broker.  Del was eminently likeable, even if you disagreed with him on policy. He possessed a truly collaborative nature, enabling him to work with other Members to achieve landmark legislation that would shape the party's platform. In 1981 Mr. Latta shepherded passage of an economic package in the House for a new President, Ronald Reagan. He led with his amiable charm, keen wit, and resilience, all characteristics that I also see in his son, our colleague, Congressman Bob Latta.  In 1988 the Congressman chose to end his congressional career on his own terms. At the time, he served as Dean of the Ohio Congressional delegation. Flash forward twenty years and Del's son Bob sought the same seat, Ohio's Fifth Congressional district.  Congressman Latta's passion and commitment to his country and his government deserve recognition and the utmost respect. Del was a man who served faithfully with a humble spirit that embodies the Midwest. It was my privilege to have served with him in the U.S. House at a time when there were but a handful of veteran Members. He was always respectful and of good humor.  Over the past several weeks I have thought about those weekly trips from Washington to Ohio that I would often share with Del Latta, and how often he spoke fondly about his wife Rose Mary, and his daughter Rose Ellen, and our colleague Bob. How proud he would be today of his five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.  We offer them our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of our dear colleague and fellow Ohioan, Del Latta.                          ____________________
