President, I thank my colleagues for accepting the amendment. I also thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the chairman of the committee, and the distinguished majority leader for their work, as well as my staff, Bruce Cohen, Kristine Lucius, Noah Bookbinder, and others.  We have made it very clear--the Senate has made it very clear--how we hold in abhorrence hate crimes. I thank my colleagues for standing up and so strongly voicing, in a bipartisan way, their opposition to hate crimes.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
