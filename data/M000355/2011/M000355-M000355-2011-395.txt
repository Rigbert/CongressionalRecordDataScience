 President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the Commonwealth's finest, the late Mr. Reid S. Jones. A native of Pulaski County, KY, Reid was a prime example of a man who was a true American hero and who valued his faith, his family, and his community.  A rich tradition of business success and pride in hard work and achievement always seemed prevalent throughout the history of Reid's family, so it came as no surprise when Reid began to exhibit early signs of entrepreneurial instincts. As a young boy, members of his hometown witnessed Reid leading a small goat down a road from the country store operated by his parents to a local family farm as he tried to make a sale. It was this ambition and drive that made Reid S. Jones a leader, a war hero, and a guiding force for all who knew him.  Reid, who passed away on April 15, 2005, joined the U.S. Army in 1944 at a crucial point during World War II. Eighteen years old, Reid felt a strong desire to serve and protect his country as well as to defend the rights and freedoms of others. He courageously fought in the Battle of the Bulge, one of the deadliest battle for American forces of the war. Reid's leadership got him promoted to the rank of staff sergeant, and he remained in Germany for a short time after the war to help begin the reconstruction process.  After returning home from the war to his new bride Elva Sears, Reid received a bachelor's degree from Union College in Barbourville, KY. He decided to further his dedication for educational excellence and became a history teacher, principal, and basketball coach for the Pulaski County and Somerset City school systems. His firm yet compassionate character made Reid well-respected by his peers and fondly remembered by his former students. Later in the 1960s he became a district sales manager for the Fram Corporation, an automotive product brand best known for their oil filters. His eye for detail and strong ambition to get things done earned him frequent recognition for exceeding sales quotas and helped him play an instrumental role in placing Fram products in Wal-Marts across the southeastern United States.  Reid's ``jack of all trades'' ability eventually led him to open his own automotive businesses, as well as become a 32nd-degree Mason, a member of the Oleika Shriners Temple, and the board of directors of the First United Methodist Church.  In addition to serving his community through business and educational work, Reid deeply cherished the relationships he had with his friends and family. He has often been remembered through the strong friendships he formed with members of the Somerset community, as he met daily with friends at his automotive businesses for coffee and southern storytelling. His dedication to public service and education, led his wife, along with his daughter, Dr. Sonya Jones, to establish The Jones Educational Foundation, to provide scholarships and assistance for people of south-central Kentucky and beyond who seek greater education and who show effort and ability.  There is no doubt that because of Reid's character, his dedication to family and friends, and his contributions to higher education and the business community, that his town, the Commonwealth, and the country have been forever changed for the better.  The Commonwealth Journal recently published an article about Mr. Reid S. Jones and a contribution that his daughter made to the Jones Educational Foundation on behalf of his dear friend, the late James Eastham. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Jan. 30, 2011]   Foundation launches Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund With Contribution                      Honoring James `Onion' Eastham       The Jones Educational Foundation Inc., a 501(c)3 not-for-     profit corporation based in Somerset, has launched the Reid      S. Jones Memorial Fund with a $1,000 contribution made by Dr.      Sonya Jones honoring the late James Arthur ``Onion'' Eastham.       According to Dr. Jones, president and CEO of The Jones      Foundation, the donation is intended to pay tribute to the      friendship between James ``Onion'' Eastham, a man who was      regarded highly in the Somerset community, and her father.       Further, the fund is meant to honor veterans from all the      wars in which the United States has fought. The initial      donation honors veterans who served in the European and      Pacific theaters of World War II.       ``I had been thinking about the Foundation setting up a      fund for veterans in Dad's name ever since I made a donation      in his memory to help restore the Soldiers and Sailors      Memorial building at Union College,'' Dr. Jones said.       Reid Jones graduated from Union in 1989. He went on to do      graduate work in education at Eastern Kentucky University.       ``When Mr. Eastham passed away in late December, I knew it      was time,'' Dr. Jones added. ``Dad thought so much of his      friend that I felt he would want me to do something special      to honor Onion's memory.''       Reid Sievers Jones (April 24, 1926 to April 15, 2005)      entered the U.S. Army at a crucial point in the history of      World War II. He was stationed in Germany, and he fought in      the Battle of the Bulge. He was a survivor in what has been      called ``one of the bloodiest battles'' of World War II.       Conducted in the dense mountainous region of Belgium, the      Battle of the Bulge was Adolf Hitler's last major offensive      against the Allies. The battle ran from Dec. 16, 1944, until      Jan. 25, 1945.       When he enlisted in the Army as a private, Reid Jones was      18 years of age. He married Elva Sears on Dec. 30, 1944,      shortly before shipping out to the European front. He was      promoted to the rank of staff sergeant and remained in      Germany for a short time after the war to help begin the      process of reconstruction.       James ``Onion'' Eastham (Sept. 22, 1923, to Dec. 28, 2010)      served in the Asiatic-Pacific theater where he was awarded      two bronze stars for duty at and during the Luzon and      Southern Philippine campaigns. He also received the      Philippine Liberation Ribbon with a bronze star for duty      involving combat with the enemy.       Reid Jones and Onion Eastham were ``two of a kind,'' said      Jimmy Eastham, son of the former Somerset City Council member      who served as staff sergeant and crew chief aboard a B-25      bomber in the United States Marine Corp.       Jones and Eastham both were salesmen after the war. Jones      worked for many years for Fram Corp. and Eastham for the      Morton Salt Co. The two men liked to get together and engage      in the high art of Southern storytelling. Both formed strong      friendships with other men in the Somerset community.       ``Dad and Onion Eastham were part of a group of men who      convened initially at Dad's car lot out on East Mt. Vernon      Street, then at Dad's automotive parts store on Ogden Street      in the building now owned by Dr. Byron Owens,'' Dr. Jones      said.       ``After Dad retired from Fram, he devoted most of his time      to the automotive business and our family's business and our      family's rental properties,'' Dr. Jones continued.       ``When Dad closed one automotive parts store housed in the      same building with Mother's antiques and collectibles, he and      his buddies met for coffee at the Sugar Shack over on the      strip,'' she said.       Meeting for coffee was part of their ``daily routine,''      said Jimmy Eastham.       From time to time, the group also included Bobby Claunch,      Howard Eastham, Ledger Howard, Penny Starnes, Don Stone, Jim      Williams and Bob Williams in addition to Reid Jones and Onion      Eastham.       Like his father, Jimmy Eastham served as a member of      Somerset City Council. He and the Eastham family have given      their enthusiastic endorsement to the Reid S. Memorial Fund      with Dr. Jones' cornerstone contribution in memory of James      ``Onion'' Eastham.       ``It is a good idea to establish the fund even if it      weren't done in the name of my father,'' Eastham said.       Both Reid Jones and James Eastham were ``very patriotic,''      according to Virginia Eastham, mother of Jimmy, Lisa (Bandy)      and Wayne Eastham.       When Reid Jones returned from the war, he worked first as a      teacher and principal in the Pulaski County and Somerset City      school systems. He is remembered, particularly by former      students at Shopville High School as a firm teacher who was      not afraid to exercise discipline when he thought it was      needed.       Later, in the 1960s, he joined Fram Corp., based in      Providence, R.I., as a district sales manager. Frequently, he      was recognized for exceeding sales quotas. He was      instrumental in placing Fram products in Wal-Marts across the      southeastern United States.       Reid Jones was a 32nd degree Mason and a member of Oleika      Shriners Temple in Lexington. He served on the board of      directors of First United Methodist Church.       In addition to being an influential member of Somerset City      Council, James ``Onion'' Eastham was a member of the Somerset      Masonic Lodge #111 and a long-standing member of the Kiwanis      Club. He was also a member of First Baptist Church where he      taught Sunday school and served as chair of a building      committee for the church's new sanctuary.       As a member of Somerset City Council from 1964 to 1982,      Eastham played an active role in helping to establish      Somerset Community College and finding a location for what is      now Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital. He considered running      for mayor, but his job as a regional salesman for Morton Salt      Co. created time constraints that caused him not to seek      office.       According to Clarence Love, city clerk during the years      Eastham served on council, ``he was very conscientious.'' In      Love's opinion, Eastham was an ``excellent councilman.''       Jimmy Eastham said he thought his father most likely would      be remembered most for ``standing for what he believed in.''       The Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund was established, first and      foremost, to help veterans with educational issues.       ``A veteran might return from Afghanistan ready to go to      law school and need some assistance,'' Dr. Jones said. ``Or,      a veteran might return and want to become a law enforcement      officer or a mechanic.''       As interest on the fund grows, money will be awarded to      veterans who demonstrate great potential for success in      professional and vocational arenas.       Primarily, the Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund intends to honor      ``the warrior spirit,'' Dr. Jones said, ``the spirit of      courage and bravery'' that has helped keep the United States      free.       The Reid S. Jones Memorial Fund is now open for tax-     deductible contributions.
