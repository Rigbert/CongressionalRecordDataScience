 Chairman, I opposed the construction of nuclear powerplants, so the gentleman is talking to the wrong guy. But the location of the nuclear powerplants, when they were developed, it was not implicit in that, it was certainly not implicit that the waste would be permanently stored on that location. For example, in Vernon, VT, it would be a disastrous place to store nuclear waste in a long-term period.  So given the reality, and this is the problem that we have, I say to the gentleman from Ohio, given the reality that we have all of this nuclear waste, the environmental challenge is to determine how we could dispose of that waste in the safest way possible.  I do not agree that forcing communities to dispose of it locally, which is the implication of the gentleman's amendment, is the safest. I would argue that that in fact could be an environmental disaster.
