President, in October, 1999, I came to the Senate floor to speak about an important amendment to the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2000 concerning farm workers. I have worked on this issue for over three years. I worked with my friend, Senator Smith of Oregon, as well as my colleague Senator Graham of Florida, to have our bipartisan amendment adopted by the managers of the bill, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin.  I come to the floor today as the Senate completes debate on the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 to again ask the administration to get serious about addressing the very real problems in the current farm worker system.  The amendment that was adopted into last year's Labor HHS appropriations bill required the Department of Labor to report to Congress with plans to improve compensation, working conditions, and other benefits for farm workers in the United States. The adopted amendment became report language in the Labor HHS Conference Report directing the Department of Labor to deliver the administration's farm worker plan to Congress as soon as possible.  It is almost ten months since that directive was adopted by the entire Congress--and almost three years since I was first promised by Secretary of Labor Herman that such a plan was being devised--and still the administration has delivered no plan. As we enter the busiest time of the year for American farms, once again I amforced to point out the ineptitude of the Administration in dealing with this critical issue.  The General Accounting Office completed a report in 1997 on the farm worker situation in our country. They said there are enough farm workers. But they came to that conclusion only by counting illegal farm workers.  Today's agricultural labor program is a disaster for both farm workers and farmers. Estimates are that well over half of the farm workers in this country are here illegally. They are smuggled into the United States by people called ``coyotes.'' Because they are here illegally, these farm workers have no power--they cannot vote. The illegal, but much needed, farm worker is often subjected to the worst possible living and working conditions imaginable. This situation is nothing short of immoral.  At the same time, the growers, who need a dependable supply of workers to pick our crops, are also in a completely untenable situation. Senator Smith and I represent Oregon farmers who literally have no where to turn to find legal farm workers. The current situation turns those farmers who want to do the right thing into people who have to make a Hobbesian choice: do they become felons by hiring illegal farm workers or do they go bankrupt.  It bears repeating: Well over half of the farm workers in the United States are illegal immigrants.  Oregon farmers have told me that in meetings, with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Department of Justice, the Administration has admitted that they know farmers must become felons by hiring illegal workers. It is deplorable that farmers are greeted by the Administration with winks and nods--not a legal farm worker system.  In 1998, in the second session of the 105th Congress, Senator Graham, Senator Smith, and I put together a bipartisan proposal to change this wholly unacceptable system. We tried to create a new system for dealing with agricultural labor that would be in the interest of both the farm worker and the farmer. Under our bill, workers who were legal would get a significant increase in their benefits and farmers would be assured a consistent, legal work force.  But after 67 Senators passed our bill, the administration refused to work with us to hammer out badly needed H2A reform legislation.  At that point, Senators Graham, Smith, and I started alternatively waiting for and asking for the Administration to produce their plan for a new agricultural worker system that would address the legitimate concerns of both farm workers and farmers.  In the spirit of comity and a desire to reach agreement with the executive branch, we have been waiting to see the Administration's plan. Mr. President, to date, after meetings, phone calls and congressional directives, we have been kept waiting for more than three years to see the administration's proposal.  By its inaction, the Administration is perpetuating a system that is a disaster for both the farm-worker and the farmer. It is a system that is totally broken--a system that has condemned the vast majority of farm workers to some of the most terrible and immoral conditions imaginable. It is a system that has made it impossible for farmers who want to do the right thing.  Our bipartisan effort was not a good enough solution for the administration. Well, the administration's inaction is not a good enough solution for me.  All of us--farm workers and growers, Senators Graham, Smith, and I--continue to wait. It is time for the administration to get off the sidelines. They should do what they promised to do well over two years ago and what we, as Congress, required them to do over 10 months ago.                           amendment no. 3706  (Purpose: To ensure that those students at risk of dropping out of  school receive appropriate attention and to ensure that all students      are given the support necessary to graduate from high school)       On Page 59, line 12, before the period insert the      following: ``: Provided further, That of the amount made      available under this heading for activities carried out      through the Fund for the Improvement of Education under part      A of title X, $10,000,000 shall be made available to enable      the Secretary of Education to award grants to develop and      implement school dropout prevention programs.''.
