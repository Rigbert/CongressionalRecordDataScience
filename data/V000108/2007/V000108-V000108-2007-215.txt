Leon West. I can truly say that Leon is one of northwest Indiana's most dedicated, distinguished, and honorable citizens. I have known Leon for many years, and he is one of the most passionate and involved citizens that I have ever known, especially when it comes to his service to the Democratic Party and the people of the First Congressional District. For the past 14 years, Leon has been a constant fixture in Porter County, serving as chairman for the Porter County Democratic Party, and more recently, as First District chairman. At the age of 72, Leon has decided to retire from these posts to spend more time with his family, but his efforts over the course of his tenure and the impact he has had on transforming the government in Porter County will forever be remembered. To honor Leon, a farewell reception will be held at the Woodland Park Community Center in Portage, Indiana, on Monday, August 6, 2007.  Leon West was born in Osceola, Arkansas, on September 17, 1934. He was one of six children. Known for his passion and unwavering devotion to the betterment of his community, it is no surprise to learn that Leon, as a young man, served in the U.S. Army from 1957 to 1959 and again from 1961 to 1962. While serving his community in various capacities throughout his lifetime, Leon came to be known for his strong work ethic, a trait he undoubtedly developed during his 42 year career at United States Steel.  Early on, Leon knew that the best way to improve his community and to help the people of Porter County was to get involved in public service. In each of his roles, Leon focused on the same goal, to make a difference in society, starting with his own community. Some highlights of Leon's career include his service on the Portage Board of Zoning Appeals, his 18 years on the Portage City Council, and his service on the Porter County Council. In addition, Leon further demonstrated his commitment to the people of northwest Indiana through his membership with the Portage Jaycees, the Exchange Club, Dunes Lodge #741, and the Shriners, to name a few. It was through his work with the Jaycees that Portage, Indiana, received its status as a city in 1968. He has also served on various councils and boards. From issues ranging from taxes and transportation to caring for the elderly, Leon West has always been an active participant in seeking to improve his community in every way possible. For his efforts, he was awarded the prestigious Sagamore of the Wabash in 1997 by the late Governor Frank O'Bannon.  While his everyday presence will be missed in northwest Indiana, Leon will now have a chance to fully commit his time to those closest to him, his family. A loving husband, father, and grandfather, Leon's commitment to his community is surpassed only by his love for his family. Leon and his loving wife, Beverly, will soon be moving to Texas, and they plan to spend as much time as possible with their three children: Kathy, Kerri, and Ken, and their adoring grandchildren: Blake, Paige, Andrew, Claire, Duncan, and Lou.  Madam Speaker, Leon West has selflessly given his time and efforts to the people of the First Congressional District and to the Democratic Party in northwest Indiana throughout his years of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication, and I ask that you join me in wishing him the best of health and happiness in the years to come.                          ____________________
