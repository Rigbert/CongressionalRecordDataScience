 President, as a representative of the great state of California, it is always a pleasure to learn about and recognize the great achievements made by members of the Law Enforcement community.  Today, I am delighted to commend Judge Barry Russell, for selflessly dedicating his personal time, energy, and money to coordinating the Federal Bar Association's Federal Law Enforcement Medal of Valor and Distinguished Service Award Luncheon.  Judge Russell has chaired this program for the past ten years, without expecting anything in return. He makes this special effort to ensure that members of the Los Angeles area Federal Law Enforcement community are honored for their selfless acts of valor and exemplary investigative achievements.  On behalf of the United States Senate, and all who have benefitted from your inspirational service, I commend you and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.                          ____________________
