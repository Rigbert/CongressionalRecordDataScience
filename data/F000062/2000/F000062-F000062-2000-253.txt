 President, I am pleased to offer today, legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Tony Lara, a remarkable young man from El Salvador who has lived in the United States since he was 10 years old.  Tony's story is particularly compelling. In less than twenty years of this young man's life, Tony has faced one tragic setback after another. However, through his optimism, intelligence, and hard work, he has bravely confronted challenges that most would view as insurmountable. In spite of enormous odds, Tony has become a high school graduate, a California State Wrestling Champion and an inspiration to his community.  An unfortunate chapter in Tony's story is that he faces deportation and separation from his younger sister because at age nineteen, Tony is an orphan. Immigration law prohibits permanent legal residency to minor children under the age of twenty-one without their parents.  Ten years ago, Tony Lara and his younger sister Olga were brought to the United States by their parents who were fleeing the civil war in El Salvador. That same year, Tony's mother was deported back to El Salvador. She tragically died in a drowning accident while trying to reenter the United States. Tony's father turned to drugs, abandoned his children and was eventually deported in 1994. He has not heard from him since. At age 11, Tony became a surrogate father to his younger sister.  Tony and his sister were taken in by an uncle who had neglected to care for them. Eventually, Tony's neighbors, Philip and Linda Bracken, invited the children to live with them. The Brackens later adopted Olga, who now has permanent residency in this country. The couple lacked the resources, however, to adopt Tony and at age 16, Tony was left without a home.  Unfortunately, the adults to which Tony turned for advice counseled against turning himself in to the Department of Children Services. They feared he could be deported and would never see his sister again. Tony could not bear losing the only family he had left; thus he remained on his own.  In 1996, Tony met his high school's wrestling coach, Terrence Fisher. Mr. Fisher knew little about Tony's circumstances, but he noticed his slight build and extreme sadness. When the coach had discovered Tony was homeless and hungry, he invited him to live with his family. Mr. Fisher also invited Tony to try out for the school's wrestling team. Although he had never wrestled before, Tony was truly a natural.  By his senior year, Tony had worked hard and captured the California state wresting championship for his age group and weight class. He had also excelled socially and academically. After Tony graduated from high school, he continued to win wrestling championships and has become a role model in his community. He is continuing his education by studying business at West Valley Occupational Center.  Tony has been featured on two television programs. In 1998, he was featured on an NBC news program called ``Beating the Odds,'' which was about young people of great achievement who have overcome enormous obstacles. Last year, Tony was featured on a Univision hour-long special program, which also spoke to Tony's special circumstances.  I can think of no one more deserving of permanent residency in this country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached bill be entered into the record with this statement.  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the bill and a letter from Terrence Fisher, high school coach, which illustrates the compelling nature of young man's circumstance, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2002       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR TONY LARA.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of      section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Tony Lara      shall be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or for      adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully admitted      for permanent residence upon filing an application for      issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such Act      or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Tony Lara enters the United      States before the filing deadline specified in subsection      (c), he shall be considered to have entered and remained      lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be eligible for      adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act as of the date of enactment of this Act.       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application      for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for      adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2      years after the date of enactment of this Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting      of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Guy Taylor,      the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to      reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal      year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made      available to natives of the country of the alien's birth      under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that      are made available to natives of the country of the alien's      birth under section 202(e) of such Act.                                  ____                                              Terrence Fisher,                               Northridge, CA, September 12, 1999.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am a United States citizen and      reside with my wife and children in Northridge, California.      For the past nine years, I have taught music and coached      wrestling, football, and track at El Camino High School in      Woodland Hills, California. I write to ask your help in      sponsoring a private bill to grant Gerardo (``Tony'') Lara      permanent residency.       Tony is a nineteen year old national of El Salvador who has      resided in this country since 1990, and against all odds, has      become a high school graduate and California State Wrestling      Champion. In 1990, Tony and his sister Olga were brought to      the United States by their parents who were fleeing civil      war. Tony and Olga were then ten and four years old,      respectively.       The same year, Tony's mother was deported back to El      Salvador. When she again fled civil war in her country and      tried to reenter the United States, she died in a drowning      accident. Tony's father turned to drugs, effectively      abondoning Tony and Olga in the United States. From 1991 on,      Tony became a surrogate father to his baby sister.       Between 1990 and 1996, Tony somehow managed to survive and      care for his sister. Tony's father was jailed repeatedly for      drugs and in 1994 was finally deported. Tony and Olga were      given free housing in their uncle's rented apartment, but the      uncle was almost never home. Eventually Tony's neighbors,      Philip and Linda Bracken, invited Olga to live with them.      Olga's relationship with the Brackens became increasingly      close, and they eventually adopted Olga. Because of the      adoption, Olga now has permanent residency in this country.      The Brackets lacked the resources to adopt Tony along with      his sister.       Tony was left on his own. When he had money, he would eat      at fast food restaurants. When he did not have money, he      would ask his friends for food. Sadly, all adults whom Tony      sought help from about     his situation told him that if he turned himself in to the      Department of Children Services, he could be deported and      would never see his sister again. Tony could not bear losing      the only family he had left, and thus remained on his own.       I met Tony in 1996 when he was a student at El Camino Real      High School. Tony was a tiny kid, just the size to qualify as      a wrestler in the 105-pound division. Though Tony had no      wrestling experience, I invited him to try out for the      school's wrestling team. Tony had never wrestled before but      was a natural. By his senior year, he captured the California      state championship for his age group and weight class. I've      never coached anyone who works as hard as has Tony.       I initially knew little of Tony's background, but noticed      his extreme sadness. When I asked Tony why he was so sad, he      confided in me that he was homeless and hungry. I then      invited Tony to live with my family. Tony shares a bedroom      with my son. Since moving in with our family, Tony has      prospered both socially and academically. I am sure that is      because for the first time since he was ten, he has had the      loving support of a family and adequate food and shelter.      Tony graduated high school and continues to win      championships. He is continuing his education by studying      business at West Valley Occupational Center.       Tony has no legal immigration status. His inability to      secure permanent residency cannot be attributed to any lack      of effort on Tony's part. Tony has a list of forty      professionals (lawyers, teachers and guidance counselors) he      sought legal advice from. Time and time again, he was told      that if the authorities knew of his immigration status or the      fact that had no parents in the United States, he would be      separated forever from his baby sister. The tragedy is that      we now know that had Tony become a ward of the court before      age 16, he could have filed a special immigrant visa petition      and obtained legal status. And had suspension of deportation      not been eliminated in the 1996 immigration law, Tony would      easily have qualified for suspension of deportation.       I am asking for your assistance in sponsoring a private      bill on Tony's behalf. I am told that the enactment of a      private bill is extremely rare and a real longshot. But      Tony's whole life has been a longshot, and I believe that he      will overcome the difficulties of securing permanent      residency just as he has overcome all the many other      obstacles in his life.       In a time where anti-immigrant sentiments still run high in      California, it is important to remember that it was not      Tony's choice that his parents fled to the United States      during a time of civil war, and it was not his choice that      his mother drown in a river or that his father turn to drugs.      It was Tony's choice to overcome these tragedies, to care for      his baby sister, and to succeed as a high school graduate and      a state wrestling champion. To recognize these achievements,      Tony was featured in an NBC news program called ``Beating the      Odds.''       The United States would undoubtedly benefit from the      contributions that Tony will make as a permanent resident in      this country, and I can think of no young man more deserving      of our country's support. It is hard to imagine Tony now      returning to El Salvador. He would suffer not only extreme      poverty (Tony has a weak command of Spanish and no ability to      write in Spanish) but extreme emotional distress from losing      the family support he has finally found at my home. Most      importantly, Tony would suffer the loss of contact with his      U.S. citizen sister, now age 12. Our family would also suffer      if separated from Tony, as he has truly become a member of      our family and the community in which we work and live.       I look forward to meeting with you further to discuss my      request for your assistance. I am joined in asking for your      support from the people listed on the attached pages. I thank      you in advance for you consideration of this matter.           Sincerely,                                                 Terrence Fischer.                                 ______                                       By
