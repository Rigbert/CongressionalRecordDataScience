Chairman, in 2008, the Office of Surface Mining finalized revisions to the stream zone buffer rule in an open and transparent manner. After taking office, the Obama administration put on hold that rule and proposed a different rule last year without the input of the States.  The administration's approach under the new rule has been anything but collaborative and inclusive, and States have been totally shut out of the process. In response, the FY16 omnibus includes language to bring the States and the administration back together. To date, OSM has not shared all documents with the States and refuses to meet with the States that have requested meetings.  The American people expect more--more openness and transparency from their government--and that is why this funding prohibition must remain in the base bill.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and reject this amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
