 Mr. President, I have submitted three amendments for consideration by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee. It is my understanding that there will not be objection, but I would like to briefly describe each of these amendments and then offer them for consideration by the Senate.  The first amendment that I will offer is one which addresses the microcredit issue. This is one that I think is of extraordinary importance in terms of supporting and promoting the entrepreneurial spirit of small business people around the globe through the use of microcredit loans.  For those unfamiliar with the term, microcredit is a very small loan given to very poor people with dramatic and positive results. By accepting this amendment, we could enhance the lives of thousands of impoverished peoplethroughout the world as well as their families and communities.  Many years ago, I journeyed to Bangladesh with a colleague of mine from the House of Representatives, Mike Synar of Oklahoma, who passed away a couple years ago. In Bangladesh, we saw the activities of the Grameen Bank, the people's bank, which gave small loans to very, very poor people. Through those loans, these peoples lives were transformed. The people understood that this was a rare opportunity. And, they were supported by people in their communities who would cosign the loans. The payback rate on the loans was in the high 90th percentile. With only a few dollars, maybe $100, a woman in Bangladesh had a chance to buy some tools that would allow her to pursue a trade and to feed her family. Another woman might be able to buy a dairy cow and with the milk from that cow she could feed her children as well as provide products for sale, which would provide some income for her family.  These microcredit loans are not charity; they are a means to provide poor, fledgling entrepreneurs in lesser developed countries with loans for startup of individual businesses. It has proven to be a successful way to help these people achieve economic independence and dignity for themselves.  It is interesting that where we found people in Bangladesh involved in microcredit, we also found timely discussion and debate about critical issues, such as the elevation of the status of women, for example. It wasn't a surprise to find that the women involved in Grameen Bank were also actively involved in prenatal activities so that their children would be more healthy. They also actively participated in family planning programs on a voluntary basis that helped them to take personal responsibility for the size of their families as well as other issues that all of us, I believe, agree are part of the solution to dealing with developing economies.  My amendment will change the status of the program in one slight respect. It gives microcredit a higher priority among U.S. enterprise development efforts. This amendment will ensure that at least half of the funds already appropriated through this bill, S. 2334, for USAID for microenterprise initiatives will be used for programs providing loans of less than $300 to poor people, particularly women, or for institutional support of organizations primarily engaged in microcredit loans.  We don't increase the overall spending amount; we merely have a reallocation of the smaller loans in this package. Existing loans have a remarkably high repayment rate of 95 percent or more.  This amendment supports the goals of the Microcredit Summit held in Washington, DC, in 1997 to offer credit for self-employment and other financial aid. It also supports the goals found in S. 2152, the Microcredit for Self-sufficiency Act of 1998, introduced in June, sponsored by myself, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, and 22 other Senators on a bipartisan basis.  I believe that the use of microcredit loans is a pragmatic and proven method for fostering the growth of small businesses.  I thank the chairman for acceptance of this amendment.                           Amendment No. 3496 (Purpose: To allocate funds available for activities pursuant to the                       Microenterprise Initiative)
