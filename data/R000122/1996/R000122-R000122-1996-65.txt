Speaker, there has been growing international concern over the plight of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, especially since November 12, 1991, when Indonesian troops killed more than 250 defenseless people and wounded hundreds more at Santa Cruz Cemetery in the East Timorese capital of Dili.  Thousands of East Timorese had gathered at the cemetery for a memorial service that turned into a demonstration. In an unprovoked attack, Indonesian forces opened fire on the crowd. A British television journalist filmed part of this tragic event, attracting the attention and indignation of the global community.  Nearly 5 years later, the situation in East Timor remains extremely tense. While the Indonesian officers and soldiers who were responsible for the Santa Cruz massacre received light punishment, when they received any punishment at all, the East Timorese accused of organizing the demonstration received long sentences, ranging from 9 years to life in prison. So far as is known, all of the Indonesian perpetrators have long ago been freed, in contrast to the East Timorese, all of whom were charged with nonviolent activities, but none of whom have been released.  As we near the fifth anniversary of the massacre, it would be fitting for the Indonesian Government to release all those charged with nonviolent activities in connection with the event.  In July 1996, Amnesty International presented a summary analysis of the human rights situation in East Timor to the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization. I now ask that this important documemt, which underscores the need for concrete action, be placed in the Congressional Record:  Indonesia: Human Rights Deteriorate in East Timor as UN Talks Go On       Another year of talks and vague promises of greater      openness by the Indonesian government has brought no relief      to the people of East Timor, Amnesty International said today      at the United Nations (UN) Special Commission on      Decolonization in New York.       Despite the recent completion of the eighth round of talks      between the governments of Indonesia and Portugal, and a      visit     to Indonesia and East Timor by the UN High Commissioner for      Human Rights, the root causes of human rights violations in      East Timor remain unaddressed.       Reports of arbitrary arrests, torture, ``disappearance'',      extrajudicial killings, the imprisonment of prisoners of      conscience, and unfair trials have continued. There is      particular concern that the authorities may be using      disturbances in the territory as a pretext to arrest people      involved in peaceful pro-independence activities.       ``Instead of committing itself to taking concrete measures      to address gross violations by its security forces, the      Indonesian government responds to criticism with cosmetic      measures aimed at appeasing international and domestic      critics,'' Amnesty International said.       In 1995, for example, the government agreed to a visit by      the High Commissioner for Human Rights to Indonesia and East      Timor. During the visit the authorities said they were      prepared to cooperate further with the mechanisms of UN human      rights bodies, but gave no indication of how or when this      would be done.       ``The international community should not be fooled into      thinking this constitutes real progress on human rights in      East Timor. Limited concessions as such have not alleviated      the deteriorating situation on the ground,'' Amnesty      International said.       Concrete action is urgently required to curb arbitrary use      of power by the security forces, end the impunity and remove      legislation which allows for the detention of prisoners of      conscience.       The international community should also fulfill its      responsibility to the people of East Timor by holding the      Indonesian government accountable for violations whenever      they occur.       ``The time for talking is over. The Indonesian government      must now demonstrate a genuine commitment to human rights in      East Timor--and the international community must hold that      government to such a commitment,'' Amnesty International      said.                          ____________________
