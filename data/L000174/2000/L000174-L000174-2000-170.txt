President, the Senator from Nevada makes a compelling argument. Consider the extraordinary and, I believe, unprecedented procedure of the majority leader in calling up an amendment of a Democratic Senator who was not consulted. Note that the amendment is the amendment filed just before the amendment that we have been trying to have considered to provide Latino and immigration fairness, the one on which we are being denied consideration or a vote. The amendment on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is something we ought to at least have the guts to stand up and vote up or down on and let the Latino population of this country know where we stand.  I say to my friend from Nevada, this exercise--to me, at least--appears to be an attempt to keep us from voting on something of significance to this country. Isn't this very similar to what we have seen on the question of judges, where anonymous holds from the Republican side have stopped us from voting up or down on judicial nominations for months and years in some cases; and anonymous holds from the Republican side are currently preventing Senate action on the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization; and anonymous holds from the Republican side have been preventing Senate action on the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, a bill to help fund bulletproof vests to protect our State and local police officers; and anonymous holds on the Republican side have prevented passage of the visa waiver legislation; and anonymous holds on the Republican side are preventing the Senate from passing the Computer Crime Enforcement Act? Is there a pattern here? The majority appears not to want to allow the Senate to either vote for or against these measures. They should at least allow us to vote.
