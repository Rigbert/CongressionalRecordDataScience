 Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming made some references to the August recess and what happened during that time. I admire the Senator from Wyoming so much for the time he has spent on this issue. I, frankly, have not spent much time on this issue. We are kind of a product of our own committees in the Senate, but I do remember--and some people have forgotten--that during the August recess it was not just health care, it was also the cap-and-trade bill, because these are the bills that were passed right down party lines.  I have to disagree with the Senator from Wyoming in one respect and that is the people during the August recess were not upset with the Republicans. They were upset with the Democrats because the one bill in my State of Oklahoma is referred to as socialized medicine. They have a hard time believing that the government is going to be able to run anything better than what we have today. I know those in this Chamber who represent States up in the far north recognize that the hospitals, the Mayo Clinics, and some of those in the northern tier, are filled with people from Canada. They have come down to America because they can't get what they wanted in Canada. So I kind of looked around and the people in Oklahoma seem to understand that if it doesn't work in Denmark, if it doesn't work in the United Kingdom, and if it doesn't work in Canada, why would it work in the United States? The answer is clearly that it wouldn't.  The other issue that was prominent at that time was the issue of global warming. Six years ago I made thestatement that the notion that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2, cause global warming is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. I know that more and more people are using the hoax statement now. The reason that was such a big issue was it passed again in the House, right down party lines--this was the Waxman-Markey bill--that would have been a tax increase on the American people of well over $300 billion a year. That translates in my State of Oklahoma to about $3,000 a family, a tax-paying family. It is something we were not going to let happen and we still are not, but that is a reality. I wish to remind my fellow Senators: You may think that August is a long time ago. You may think that since we have been in the shelter of these halls here in the Senate that people have forgotten about those two issues, and they haven't forgotten. However, I have to say that is not why I am here tonight.                          ____________________
