Speaker, as the co-chairs of the Congressional Automobile Caucus, we rise to recognize the newly formed Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers on the occasion of the inaugural meeting of its Board of Directors.  In Washington today, we hear a lot about reinvention. The Alliance is a perfect example of a major industry ``reinventing'' itself to reflect new world realities. The American auto industry has undergone a remarkable transformation in the past few years with the mergers and alliances between U.S. manufacturers and manufacturers around the globe. While its predecessor organization was composed of solely U.S. companies, the new Alliance embodies the global market place, with 10 member companies from around the globe.  The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an international coalition of car and light truck manufacturers, was formed this past January. The member companies include BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Mazda Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagon, and Volvo. The new trade association created by this powerful Alliance of automobile manufacturers promises to be an organization that is nimble enough to respond to rapidly changing issues that reach across the ever-shrinking global marketplace.  Members of the Alliance have gone on the public record as committed to developing constructive approaches. Moreover, the Alliance pledges to work with government and other stakeholders to find sensible and effective solutions to shared concerns. We have already witnessed this constructive approach to issues. On May 1, President Clinton unveiled EPA's proposed ``Tier 2'' standards to reduce vehicle emissions and sulfur content in fuel. Prior to this announcement, the Alliance had called for reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and sulfur-free fuel to provide cleaner cars and cleaner air. EPA's proposal and the Alliance are similar. The Alliance generally supports the clean air targets that EPA has proposed, including cars and trucks meeting the same average standards for nitrogen oxides.  The Alliance companies operate 255 manufacturing facilities in 33 states. They produce more than 90% of all new vehicles sold each year in the United States.  The Alliance stands ready to provide its views and comments on automotive concerns to Members of Congress as we debate issues of importance to the industry and consumers. It has a dedicated staff of professionals, led by Josephine Cooper, who have a long record of experience and knowledge of automobile issues.  A key component to developing good public policy is having an open dialogue with groups impacted by our decisions. We are confident that the Alliance and its member companies will play a vital role in developing creative and constructive solutions to the issues before the Congress.                          ____________________
