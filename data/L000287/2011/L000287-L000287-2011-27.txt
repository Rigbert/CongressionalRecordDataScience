Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and commemorate Marine Private First Class Ted Dennis Britt, who gave his life at Khe Sanh, on March 30th, 1968.  Ted grew up in my district; in Decatur, Georgia. He was born into a military family--His father was a Navy veteran of two wars, and his brother served in Afghanistan as a Brigadier General in the Georgia Army National Guard. Ted grew up playing baseball and joined the Marine Corps not long after graduating from Southwest Dekalb High School in 1967. It's hard to believe that he was already engaged to be married when he enlisted at only 18 years of age.  Mr. Speaker, in 1968, PFC Ted D. Britt, was one of many Marines serving in harm's way. Far from home, his family, and from everything he knew, Ted served gallantly and gave everything. Our country can never repay our debt to him or his family, but I wish to join with his friends and family in spirit, as they honor and remember him this week.  Mr. Speaker, as you would imagine, our military has already posthumously awarded PFC Britt the appropriate medals and ribbons for his bravery under fire. But I wish to add my voice to their chorus. I wish to help ensure that Ted's sacrifice is not lost to history--but remembered, honored and understood. I never knew Ted Britt, but his selflessness is what I will never forget.  To this young man's family, and to those who called him friend, I offer my thoughts and prayers. May God bless them and keep them in their moment of remembrance.                          ____________________
