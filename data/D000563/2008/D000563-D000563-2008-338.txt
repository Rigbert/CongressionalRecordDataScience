President, today I am introducing the Protecting Consumers from Unreasonable Credit Rates Act. The bill establishes a Federal usury cap of 36 percent on all consumer credit transactions, in an effort to eliminate the unconscionable interest rates that some consumers have been charged for payday loans, car title loans, and other forms of credit.  The bill protects all borrowers by establishing the same annual percentage rate cap already in place for military personnel and their families. That rate is similar to the usury caps already enacted in many states.  Specifically, the bill establishes a maximum interest rate of 36 percent on all consumer credit transactions, taking into account all interest, fees, defaults, and other finance charges.  The bill clarifies that this cap does not preempt any stricter State laws.  It applies civil penalties for violations, including nullification of the transaction, fines, and prison.  It empowers attorneys general to take action for up to three years after a violation.  Previous attempts to curb payday lending have often been evaded due to the challenges of defining what constitutes a predatory loan. This bill overcomes this challenge by setting a relatively high interest rate as the cap, and then applying that cap to all credit transactions of any kind.  With the economy in decline and consumer debt skyrocketing, it is vitally important that strong protections against predatory lending be enacted to protect consumers against unscrupulous lenders. The financial security of many working families depends on it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3287       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from      Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2008''.     SEC. 2. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.       Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et      seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``SEC. 140. MAXIMUM RATES OF INTEREST.       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, no creditor may make an extension of credit to a      consumer with respect to which the annual percentage credit      rate, as defined in subsection (b), exceeds 36 percent.       ``(b) Annual Percentage Credit Rate Defined.--For purposes      of this section, the annual percentage credit rate includes      all charges payable directly or indirectly incident to,      ancillary to, or as a condition of the extension of credit,      including--       ``(1) any payment compensating a creditor or prospective      creditor for an extension of credit or making available a      line of credit, or any default or breach by a borrower of a      condition upon which credit was extended, including fees      connected with credit extension     or availability, such as numerical periodic rates, late fees,      excessive creditor-imposed not sufficient funds fees charged      when a borrower tenders payment on a debt with a check drawn      on insufficient funds, over limit fees, annual fees, cash      advance fees, and membership fees;       ``(2) all fees which constitute a finance charge, as      defined by rules of the Board in accordance with this title;       ``(3) credit insurance premiums, whether optional or      required; and       ``(4) all charges and costs for ancillary products sold in      connection with or incidental to the credit transaction.       ``(c) Relation to State Law.--Nothing in this section may      be construed to preempt any provision of State law that      provides greater protection to consumers than is provided in      this section.       ``(d) Civil Liability and Enforcement.--In addition to      remedies available to the consumer under section 130(a), any      payment compensating a creditor or prospective creditor, to      the extent that such payment is a transaction made in      violation of this section, shall be null and void, and not      enforceable by any party in any court or alternative dispute      resolution forum, and the creditor or any subsequent holder      shall promptly return to the consumer any principal,      interest, charges, and fees, and any security interest      associated with such transaction.
