 President, today I am introducing legislation to prohibit the payment of Social Security benefits to convicted criminals who are incarcerated at the expense of hard-working taxpayers.  The fate of the Social Security program has become a major topic of debate in Washington and in the homes of the American people. In the news, on Capitol Hill, and in the conversations of people all across this country the question of how to address the pending financial problems of Social Security has caused considerable anxiety. Congress must face one of its stiffest challenges in the next couple of years to enact legislation that will rescue the Social Security program for the long term.  However, there are other flaws in the Social Security program that we must not overlook. Because Social Security provides a lifelong entitlement to cash and health care, it is often a target of fraud and abuse. In the last couple of years, we have taken action to suspend benefits paid to drug addicts and alcoholics and have increased funding so the Social Security Administration can perform continuing disability reviews which ensure that beneficiaries who may have recovered are no longer receiving benefits.  Just last year, Congress enacted legislation to help SSA identify prisoners who received benefits from the Supplemental Security Income Program. Unfortunately, Congress was unable to provide similar help to the Social Security Disability Insurance Program.  No one incarcerated for a crime should continue to collect Social Security Disability Insurance. Criminals should not be allowed to double dip and receive Federal money earmarked for the purchase of food and clothing while they are part of a prison system which provides these necessities already. The average SSDI payment in January of 1996 was $682. When an individual's shelter, food, and clothing needs are already being paid for at government expense--at least $13,000 a year in some States--paying out additional Federal funds is inexcusable.  Under current law, criminals are prohibited from collecting disability insurance benefits if they are incarcerated and if that incarceration arises from a conviction punishable by imprisonment of more than one year. However, this narrow standard applies to a limited number of criminals.  In order to fully confront this problem we must enact legislation that accomplishes two goals. First, the law needs to be expanded to close the existing loophole that allows criminals who are serving time for misdemeanors or who receive a sentence of less than one year to continue to collect benefits. Second, we must amend the law to facilitate the flow of information between Federal, State, county and local officials.  Right now, SSA is able to identify only a few of the individuals who have been imprisoned to stop their benefits. The Social Security Act already requires that any Federal, State, county or local agency send the SSA the names and social security numbers of anyone who is confined to a penal institution or correctional facility in writing.  What's needed is an incentive for State and local law enforcement authorities to report to the SSA any inmate illegally collecting DI benefits. In testimony to the House Ways and Means Oversight Committee on March 4, 1996, the General Accounting Office testified that SSA lacks timely and accurate information to stop benefit payments to prisoners.  My bill provides State and local law enforcement agencies with a financial incentive to report convicted criminals who are receiving benefits while serving time in jail. The bill awards $400 for each criminal reported to SSA within the first 30 days of confinement, and $200 if the required information is reported to SSA after the 30 day period ends. If the local authorities do not notify SSA within 90 days after confinement begins, no award will be made.  Last year, as part of welfare reform we took steps to stop the flagrant abuse of the Social Security system with respect to SSI payments. Now we must finish the job by extending the law to include the illegal collection of DI benefits.  By passing this legislation we will protect the financial soundness of Social Security disability insurance and preserve the program for the people it is meant to assist. The only way to protect the hard-earned money of the American taxpayer is to insure that every penny is being spent properly. This legislation is projected to save $35 million over the next 7 years. In this day of hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit this may not seem overwhelming, but it will ease the administrative burden on SSA and most importantly, help restore confidence in this vital program.                                 ______                                       By
