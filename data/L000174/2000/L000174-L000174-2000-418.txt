President, I wish to say a couple of words about one of my oldest and best friends in the Senate, the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens.  Last week, Senator Stevens was named ``Alaskan of the Century.'' Most of us feel pretty fortunate if we get named for the day, or possibly for the week, and sometimes even the month in our States. He was named ``Alaskan of the Century.''  Well, my good friend, Ted Stevens, deserves that. He has a way about him, as we all know. He keeps me humble. I might talk about the hardships of a cold winter day in Vermont. But then I see his eyebrows go up when he explains to me that 40 degrees below zero is just beginning to get nippy--it gets to 75 below in Fairbanks. At that point, I know I am beat.  Ted Stevens is a tireless legislator, a respected leader. He helped create the State of Alaska. How many of us could actually say something like that? He actually helped create a State with his tireless work and brought it into the Union. He did this having already served his country in so many ways. He was in the Air Force in World War II, served as a U.S. attorney in Fairbanks, and was also an Alaskan State representative. And this was on top of so many other things he has done. Today, of course, he serves with great distinction as one of the three most senior Members of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.  Senator Stevens has consistently been a leader for our Nation's defense issues and has chaired the Senate Rules Committee, Governmental Affairs Committee, and Ethics Committee among others.  Senator Stevens and I have served together for a long time. As members of the Appropriations Committee, both of us have worked to find economic opportunities for the rural communities that so many states, including our own, share. Ted and I have also worked together through some of this Nation's most challenging times. During the divisive days of the impeachment trial, Senator Stevens and I were chosen to fly to Jordan together as representatives of one, united Senate mourning the death of King Hussein.  Senator Stevens is also a strong proponent of Title 9 and women's equality in sports. In fact, just this year he sponsored the Women in Sports Awards luncheon where Monica Seles was honored for her excellence on tennis courts throughout the world. I am sure that Ted, an avid tennis player, tried to set up a game with her himself.  While he is unquestionably a great legislator, Senator Stevens is also a proud father of six children and has a beautiful wife, Catherine. Senator Stevens is an accomplished man with whom I am proud to serve in this United States Congress. Alaska, land of the aurora borealis and the Midnight Sun, has every reason to be proud of its senior Senator and this award shows Alaskans' gratitude and respect for his tireless work.  Ted, congratulations on your well-deserved recognition as Alaskan of the Century.  Ted and his wife, Catherine, have long been friends of myself and my wife, Marcelle. I consider him very much a member of the old school--when he gives his word, that is it; go to the bank with it.  I have seen several pieces of complex and important legislation go through this body because Ted Stevens gave his word they would go through--a word that he never broke with either Republican or Democrat. That is why Ted Stevens has gained so much respect.                          ____________________
