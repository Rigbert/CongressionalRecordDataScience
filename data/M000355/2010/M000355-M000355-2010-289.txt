 President, I rise to honor Mr. Brian Duffy of Louisville, KY, for his hard work and support on behalf of Kentucky's World War II and terminally ill veterans. Mr. Duffy founded the Bluegrass Honor Flight chapter in 2007. Through his leadership, and the support of numerous donations and volunteers, the Bluegrass Honor Flight chapter has been able to fly nearly 600 veterans from Kentucky to Washington, DC, providing these brave patriots the opportunity to see their memorial firsthand.  Today, I wish to congratulate Mr. Duffy, himself a veteran, for recently being named 2010's official``Thundernator'' responsible for starting the ``Thunder over Louisville'' firework show. He was so named because of his dedication to the Bluegrass Honor Flight organization.  I know my colleagues will join me in honoring Mr. Duffy for his tireless advocacy on behalf of veterans.                          ____________________
