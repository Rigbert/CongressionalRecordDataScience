Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Well, the chairman and I have established a good record of working together. I would love to get a commitment here to work together, to go through a full reauthorization of the Clean Water Act and clarify these many issues, what we want to protect and what we want to be excluded from the jurisdiction. The Congress has the authority to do that. I think we should undertake that. It would be very difficult.  To say that repealing this rule, which does have some clarifications of the Bush rule--that would return us to the Bush-era regulations, a hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories that are resulting in an increase in delays caused to the public at large, doesn't seem like a good result. So unless we choose to act and clarify the law, that is what we are going to be stuck with.  Under this resolution, absent another specific action by Congress, they can't use any of the work that went into developing this rule or the data. It can'tbe substantially the same. We would have to further authorize them to begin a new rulemaking.  There was unprecedented public comment, 207 days of public comment. There were 1 million comments received. There were 400 public meetings. There was a special consultation process for the States and local officials. Now, my State and the State of Pennsylvania apparently were pretty satisfied with that. There are other States that weren't, but maybe they didn't go to the meetings.  I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Napolitano).
