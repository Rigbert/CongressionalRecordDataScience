 President, I am pleased to introduce this legislation today with Senator Boxer to allow the National Park Service to extend the boundaries of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, GGNRA, by acquiring critical natural landscapes and scenic vistas. Last year, this bill was successfully passed out of the Senate, but was not passed by the House before the 107th Congress adjourned.  This bill meets two distinct needs in California by adding 4,700 acres of pristine natural land to the boundary of the Golden Golden Gate Recreation Area, GGNRA, and by extending the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, GGNRA, Advisory Commission for ten more years.  A key component of this legislation is that about half of the total cost of purchasing these lands will be donated by the local community. This legislation specifically provides that all land transactions involve a willing seller and willing buyer.  Furthermore, this bill has the strong support of the local environmental and preservation groups, the Point Reyes National Seashore Advisory Commission, and the National Park Service. I know of no opposition to this bill.  The three Marin County properties lie in the Marin headlands. Preservation of these lands will protect habitat, ridge-top trails and scenic views of San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean.  The city of San Francisco would like to donate to the Federal Government the San Francisco land along the Pacific coastline, and has authorized $100,000 for the restoration of the site.  The addition of the Rancho Corral de Tierra property will protect sweeping views of the San Mateo Coast and ensure the protection of rich farmland, several miles of public trails, and an incredible array of wildlife and vegetation. All or part of four watersheds, and several endangered species such as the peregrine falcon, San Bruno elfin butterfly, San Francisco garter snake and the red-legged grog. Moreover, due to the coastal marine influence and dramatic altitude changes, plants grow on the property that are found nowhere else in the world.  The second component of this bill extends the advisory commission of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area for ten more years.  This commission has an active committee that represents a wide range of user groups from bicyclists to bird watchers to outdoor enthusiasts. It provides a vital communications link between the Park Service and the surrounding communities that enjoy the attractions that this national site has to offer. Without this commission, the Park Service would be hard pressed to provide the same level of service and attention to the broad interests and diverse communities that it serves.  I continue to be a strong advocate for public involvement in Park Service decisions. I believe that this commission has been essential in ensuring that the Park Service upholds its commitment to allow community participation in its decision making process, particularly when it comes to contentious issues.  California's national parks are truly invaluable and the park that this bill supports offers an opportunity for visitors and residents to enjoy unique national habitats and open spaces. This legislation continues the legacy that enables the Park Service and the community to work together, not only to protect the environment, but also the interests of the nearby communities.  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I hope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, as it did last Congress. Congressman Tom Lantos plans to introduce companion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his leadership on this issue.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 302       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
