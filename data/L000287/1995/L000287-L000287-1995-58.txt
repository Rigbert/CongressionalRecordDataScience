Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this rule. I want to thank the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], the chairman, the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Wolf], the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi] and the gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Bereuter] for all their good work. We must send a very strong message to China.   Mr. Speaker, we must send a strong message to China. We must let China know that if they want to join the community of nations, they must treat their people with respect and dignity. We must tell them that selling arms to Iran, a terrorist nation, is unacceptable.  Harry Wu's arrest is only the most recent reminder of China's longstanding human rights abuses. We cannot forget the day the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square. Terrible human rights abuses continue to this day.  Political prisoners in China and Tibet are brutally tortured. Religious leaders are imprisoned. Democratic reformers are jailed. There is no freedom of speech, no freedom of press, no freedom at all.  We have a moral obligation and a mandate to tell China to change its ways. As a Congress and as a nation, we cherish freedom, and we must speak out.  We cannot stand by while China stifles dissent and disagreement. We cannot stand by while the Chinese Government tortures its prisoners. We cannot stand by while China exports goods made in slave labor camps. We cannot stand by while China detains an American citizen, Harry Wu, and threatens him with the death penalty.  I truly believe that if you do not stand for something, you will fall for anything. We cannot have trade at any cost. We must not let the democracy movements in China and Tibet fall. We must stand with the people who are fighting for freedom. I urge my colleagues to support this Rule.                              {time}  1115
