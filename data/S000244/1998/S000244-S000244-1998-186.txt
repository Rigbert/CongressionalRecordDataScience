Speaker, the Fastener Quality Act was signed into law in 1990. It required all threaded metallic fasteners of one-quarter inch diameter or greater that reference a consensus standard to be documented by a National Institute of Standards and Technology's certified laboratory. Although the legislation has been on the books for over 8 years, concerns over the bill's impact on the economy have delayed its implementation of final regulations. NIST regulations are slated to go into effect on July 26 of this year.  H.R. 3824 amends the Fastener Quality Act by exempting fasteners produced or altered to the standards and specifications of aviation manufacturers from the new regulations. Exempting the proprietary fasteners of aviation manufacturers from the Fastener Quality Act makes sense, considering aviation manufacturers are already required by law to demonstrate to the FAA that they have a quality control system which ensures that their products, including fasteners, meet design specifications. Subjecting the proprietary fasteners of aviation manufacturers to a second set of Federal regulations is redundant and unnecessary. In fact, the FAA has stated that doing so may even undermine the current level of aviation safety.  In addition to the Fastener Quality Act's impact on aviation manufacturing, several questions have been raised about the Act's effect on other industries. For instance, the automotive industry projects costs of compliance through the motor vehicle industry could be greater than $300 million a year without necessarily enhancing vehicle safety.  Furthermore, since 1990, the scope of the Fastener Quality Act seems to have grown. Originally intended to ensure public safety, today, if the NIST regulations are to be implemented, even garden hose fasteners such as those produced by Sheboygan Screw Products, Incorporated, in my district could be forced to comply with the additional burdens of the Act. I am not sure what dangers faulty garden hose fasteners may cause, but I am sure that preventing the public from being susceptible to hose failures will be expensive.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3824 addresses the concerns by, first, delaying the regulations issued by NIST under the Fastener Quality Act on this subject until after June 1, 1999. Second, requiring the Secretary of Commerce to transmit to Congress a report on changes in fastener manufacturing processes that have occurred since the enactment of the Fastener Quality Act and recommend any changes to the act that may be warranted because of those changes.  Delaying NIST regulations until next year gives us the opportunity to take a closer look at the Fastener Quality Act, especially considering it was crafted over 8 years ago. As Chairman of the Committee on Science, I have pledged to hold additional hearings on this issue in the coming months. We may find that changes in the fastener manufacturing products have diminished the need for further regulations in this area, or even that this act should be repealed.  H.R. 3824 was reported by the Committee on Science on May 13, 1998. It has wide bipartisan support and it has been endorsed by several business organizations, including the United States Chamber of Commerce. Original cosponsors of this legislation include the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella) and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Cook).  In addition, I wish to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis); the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia); the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant); the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Doyle); the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hastert); the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Gordon) the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter); the other gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller); and the third gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) for endorsing this bill and helping promote its speedy passage. I would also like to thank the Committee on Commerce chairman, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell), as well as the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure chairman, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Shuster) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), for discharging the bill to enable its passage before the July 26 regulatory deadline.  Mr. Speaker, at this point I would insert our committee's exchange of correspondence into the Record, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support this common sense regulation.                                        Committee on Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 1998.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, House Committee on Science,     Washington, DC.       Dear Jim: On May 13, 1998 the Committee on Science ordered      reported H.R. 3824, a bill amending the Fastener Quality Act      of 1990 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 5401 et al.) to exempt from its      coverage certain fasteners approved by the Federal Aviation      Administration for use in aircraft. As you know, the      Committee on Commerce was named as an additional committee of      jurisdiction and has had a longstanding interest in the issue      of fastener quality and the Fastener Quality Act. This      interest goes back to the 100th Congress, at which time the      Committee undertook an investigation of counterfeit and      substandard fasteners. This investigation resulted in the      issuance of a unanimously approved Subcommittee report      entitled ``the Threat from Substandard Fasteners: Is America      Losing Its Grip?'' which ultimately led to the approval by      our respective committees of the Fastener Quality Act of      1990.       H.R. 3824, as ordered reported, would amend the Fastener      Quality Act in two ways. First, the bill exempts fasteners      approved for use in aircraft by the Federal Aviation      Administration from the requirements of the Act. Secondly, it      delays implementation of the final regulations until the      Secretary of Commerce and the Congress have had an      opportunity to consider developments in manufacturing and      quality assurance techniques since the law was enacted.       Because of the important and timely nature of these      amendments to the Fastener Quality Act, I recognize your      desire to bring this legislation before the House in an      expeditious manner. I also understand that you     have agreed to address several technical issues raised by      this Committee in a manager's amendment to be offered on the      Floor. Therefore, with that understanding, I will waive      consideration of the bill by the Commerce Committee. By      agreeing to waive its consideration of the bill, the Commerce      Committee does not waive its jurisdiction over these      provisions. In addition, the Commerce Committee reserves its      authority to seek conferees on these and any other provisions      of the bill that are within the Commerce Committee's      jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference that may be      convened on this legislation. I would seek your commitment to      support any request by the Commerce Committee for conferees      on amendments to the Fastener Quality Act or related      legislation.       I would appreciate your including this letter as a part of      the Committee's report on H.R. 3824 and as part of the record      during consideration of this bill by the House.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Bliley,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         Committee on Science,                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1998.     Hon. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr.,     Chairman, House Committee on Commerce,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Bliley: Thank you for your letter of June 3      regarding H.R. 3824, the recently passed Science Committee      amendments to the Fastener Quality Act (FQA) of 1990 (15      U.S.C. Sec. 5401 et seq.).       I appreciate your willingness to work with us to examine      the need to amend the FQA.       As you note in your letter, the Committees on Commerce and      Science have long shared jurisdiction over FQA. By agreeing      to the expeditious consideration of H.R. 3824 on the House      floor, the Committee on Commerce does not waive any of its      jurisdictional rights. Should the Committee on Commerce seek      conferees on provisions of the bill within its jurisdiction,      I will support such a request.       The Committee on Science will include this exchange of      letters within the report of the Science Committee and will      work with you to ensure that the technical amendments to the      bill requested by your Committee are included in the bill      when H.R. 3824 is brought before the full House for its      consideration.       I look forward to continuing to work with you on this and      other matters.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         Committee on Science,                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1998.     Hon. Bud Shuster,     Chairman, House Committee on Transportation and          Infrastructure, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Shuster: Thank you for helping expedite      consideration of H.R. 3824, the recently passed Science      Committee amendments to the Fastener Quality Act (FQA) of      1990 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 5401 et seq.), by agreeing not to      request a sequential referral on the bill. I agree that      through this action the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure does not waive any of its jurisdictional      rights associated with the bill.       Additionally, the Committee on Science will include this      exchange of letters within the report of the Science      Committee.       I look forward to continuing to work with you on this and      other matters.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman.                                  ____                                       Committee on Transportation                                           and Infrastructure,                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1998.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on Science,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I understand that the Committee on      Science recently ordered reported H.R. 3824, a bill amending      the Fastener Quality Act to exempt from its coverage certain      fasteners approved by the Federal Aviation Administration for      use in aircraft.       In recognition of your Committee's desire to move this      legislation expeditiously through the House of      Representatives, the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure agrees to waive its referral of the bill.      However, this action should not be construed as waiving or      otherwise diminishing the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure's jurisdiction over the bill or issues      associated with H.R. 3824. In addition, should a conference      on H.R. 3824 or a similar measure become necessary, I would      ask you to support the Committee on Transportation and      Infrastructure being represented on the conference committee.      Finally, I ask that you make this letter a part of the      Committee on Science's report on the bill.       Once again, it has been a pleasure working with you and      your staff, and I look forward to seeing H.R. 3824 scheduled      for Floor consideration very soon.       With warm personal regards I am           Sincerely,                                                      Bud Shuster,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
