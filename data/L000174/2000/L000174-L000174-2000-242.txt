President, this week, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona. I applaud that decision. Miranda struck a balance between the needs of law enforcement and the rights of a suspect that has worked well for 34 years. There is no reason to upset that balance now.  Shortly after Miranda was decided in 1966, I became State's Attorney for Chittenden County, Vermont. I remember clearly the immediate impact that this momentous decision had upon law enforcement, prosecutors, criminal defendants and the criminal justice system as a whole. The Supreme Court's pronouncement that all suspects in custody needed to be advised of certain constitutional rights, including the privilege against self-incrimination, before being questioned was as new then as it is familiar today.  The Miranda decision put into place a fair and bright-line rule that both protects the rights of the accused and has proven workable for law enforcement. Statements stemming from custodial interrogation of a suspect are inadmissible at trial unless the police first provide the suspect with a set of four specific warnings: (1) you have the right to remain silent; (2) anything you say may be used as evidence against you; (3) you have the right to an attorney; and (4) if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.  These warnings are necessary to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings and so ensure that any statement obtained from the suspect is truly the product of his free choice. As author and former Federal prosecutor Scott Thurow wrote in an opinion article in Wednesday's New York Times: ``The requirement to recite Miranda is an important reminder to the police that the war on lawlessness is always subject to the guidance of the law.''  Over the last 34 years, the Miranda rule has developed into a bedrock principle of American criminal law. The required issuance of Miranda warnings has been incorporated in local, State and Federal police practice across this nation. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say, as the Court said this week, that Miranda warnings ``have become part of our national culture.''  Two years after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 3501, which laid down a rule that purported to overrule Miranda and to restore the case-by-case, totality-of-the-circumstances test of a confession's ``voluntariness'' that the Miranda decision found constitutionally inadequate. The validity of section 3501 did not come before the Court until now because no Administration of either party sought to use it, out of concern for its dubious constitutionality. The issue was finally presented only because an organization of conservative activists maneuvered a case before the most conservative Federal appeals court in the country. To her credit, Attorney General Reno declined to argue that Miranda had been invalidated by section 3501. She also declined to ask the Supreme Court to overrule Miranda, on the ground that it has proved to be workable in practice and in many respects beneficial to law enforcement.  The Court's decision this week in Dickerson v. United States--announced by the Chief Justice and joined by six other Justices--erased any doubt that the protections announced in Miranda are constitutionally required and cannot be overruled by an act of Congress. Section 3501's attempt to authorize the admission at trial of statements that would be excluded under Miranda is therefore unconstitutional, as I have long believed.  This week's resounding reaffirmation of the Miranda rule should put to rest the issue of Miranda's continuing vitality. Most law enforcement officers made their peace with Miranda long ago: It is time for the rest to do the same. That is why I am disturbed by Justice Scalia's parting shot in Dickerson. In a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thomas, Justice Scalia vowed to continue to apply section 3501 until such time as it is repealed.  Mr. President, that time has come. I am introducing a bill today, together with my good friend, Senator Feingold, to repeal section 3501. I can think of no good reason to allow this patently unconstitutional statute to remain on the books. On the contrary, leaving section 3501 on the books is sure to invite more unwarranted attacks on Miranda by the same conservative activists who brought us the Dickerson case. Enough is enough. Whatever you think of Miranda's reasoning and its resulting rule, seven Supreme Court Justices have reaffirmed its constitutional pedigree. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to uphold their oaths to defend the Constitution by repudiating an unconstitutional statute.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2830       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Miranda Reaffirmation Act of      2000''.     SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE 18.       Section 3501 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--       (1) by striking subsections (a) and (b); and       (2) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as      subsections (a), (b), and (c) respectively.
