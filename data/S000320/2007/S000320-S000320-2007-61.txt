 Ed Richardson, who has dedicated over 40 years of his life to improving Alabama's public education system. On July 15, 2007, Ed will step down as Auburn University's 17th President, and he will leave behind a legacy of achievement unparalled in Alabama.  In the 1960s, Dr. Richardson worked in dual roles as a high school science teacher and assistant principal, with the objective of becoming a scientist for NASA. However, following a tragic accident that claimed the life of the Cloverdale School's principal, Dr. Richardson abandoned that aspiration to assume the role of principal. Taking over this position would propel Dr. Richardson into a long career in education, rising to the ranks of local superintendent, superintendent and university president.  In 1982, Dr. Richardson was named superintendent of Auburn's school system, a career move that at the time was considered unwise. But he had a vision of excellence that proved the naysayers wrong. Thirteen years after becoming superintendent, Auburn's school system was regarded as one of the best in Alabama.  Dr. Richardson's success at turning around Auburn's school system made him the ideal candidate for state superintendent. Faced with a formidable opponent who had the backing of the Governor and the Alabama Education Association, Dr. Richardson fought a hard campaign and was appointed Alabama's state superintendent 1995.  While serving in this position, Dr. Richardson oversaw many legislative and policy changes to Alabama's educational system. Although he may be best known for implementing Alabama's Educational Accountability Act, which holds schools responsible for the performance of their students, he is also responsible for creating performance report cards for schools and universities.  During Dr. Richardson's tenure as Alabama's superintendent, the high school drop out rate fell to historic lows, thanks in large part to his efforts to strengthen the State's high school graduation requirements, making them some of the most rigorous in the Nation. During this time, student academic performance reached an all-time high.  Recognizing the importance of our educators, Dr. Richardson restored teacher testing to hold higher education instructors responsible for their students' performance. He also launched the Alabama Reading Initiative and piloted the Alabama Math, Science and Technology Initiative to give teachers the training and tools they need to better teach these important subjects.  In 2004, Governor Bob Riley approached Dr. Richardson to take over as interim president at Auburn University. Following his acceptance of the position, Dr. Richardson wasted no time in taking charge and making much needed changes in key administrative positions. The culmination of his hard work came in December 2004, when Auburn regained its accreditation status.  Finally, after serving two and a half years as interim president at Auburn University, the board of trustees unanimously named Dr. Richardson Auburn University's 17th President. As president of Auburn, Dr. Richardson pursued an aggressive agenda. He focused on the development of Auburn's research park, improving its airport, effecting changes in the structure of the university's agriculture programs and forging a close relationship with Auburn University-Montgomery.  As Dr. Richardson, along with his wife Nell, embarks on another phase in his life he will remain an inspiration to many and will be remembered for his dedication and many contributions to Alabama's public education system. I wish him much luck in his future endeavors and I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life and career of my good friend Ed Richardson.                          ____________________
