 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Let me be very honest and say that I think a $1-an-hour increase over a 2-year period is not enough. In my view, we should raise the minimum wage today to at least $6.50 an hour. The idea, however, of doing it over a 3-year period is an absolute insult to millions and millions of low-income workers who are struggling to keep their heads above water. Let us defeat the Republican proposal. Let us pass the Traficant amendment.
