Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just to respond briefly.  Mr. Chairman, in the previous amendment we made very clear to all our colleagues--all of the sponsors of the amendment, and there were several--that we were not reducing family planning by one penny. Our amendment says we have got to get out of the promotion of abortion overseas. Regrettably, many of the so-called family planning organizations in some countries are the primary engine trying to topple right-to-life laws. That is cultural imperialism. It certainly puts the unborn and their mothers at risk. And as Planned Parenthood has said, and I can give Members the quote, ``When abortion laws are liberalized, the number of abortions skyrocket.'' That is their word, skyrocket. So if we want more abortions, liberalize the laws.
