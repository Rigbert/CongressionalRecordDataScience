 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an honorable Kentuckian and decorated World War II veteran, Mr. Wilburn K. Ross of Strunk, KY. Ross, who turned 91 in May, celebrated his birthday by making a trip to Kentucky from his current home in Dupont, WA. Ross has not only served his country but continues to serve his childhood home by coming back each year to spend time with his family and fellow veterans of McCreary County.  Ross, who is also known as ``Wib,'' was raised in Strunk, KY, and joined the U.S. Army here to begin his extraordinary service to our country. Every year for his birthday, Ross makes the visit back to Kentucky. ``Everybody here treats me well,'' Ross said. ``I like coming back here becauseI was raised here.'' Ross's son Greg is the eldest of his six children and travels with his father.  On October 30, 1944, Ross served as a private in Company G, 30th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. This day Ross fought courageously, and 6 months later he received the highest decoration in the U.S. military, the Medal of Honor. After 55 out of the 88 men were lost in his company, Ross manned a machine gun alone holding off six German attacks.  Mr. Ross's bravery and courage while in service to his Nation is an inspiration to his fellow Kentuckians. His story is one that is told again and again to remind McCreary County residents of his dedication and liberty to our country. A local newspaper published an article on May 23, 2013, to celebrate 91 years of life for Mr. Ross and to retell his story while in uniform. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record, as follows:             [From the McCreary County Voice, May 23, 2013]                           Courage Under Fire    Story of Native Congressional Medal of Honor Recipient Is Worth                                Repeating                           (By Eugenia Jones)       As he does each year on his birthday, Wilburn K. ``Wib''      Ross makes the journey back from his current home in Dupont,      Washington to the Bear Creek community in Strunk, Kentucky,      to visit his birthplace and childhood home and to celebrate      and reminisce with family and friends.       This year, with Ross turning 91 on May 12, was no      exception. Arriving in McCreary County on the day prior to      his birthday, the spry 91-year-old clearly was not weary from      his cross-country travels. After spending the remainder of      his McCreary County arrival day visiting with his brothers      and other family members, ``Wib'' found time to visit the      American Legion Post 115 for a night filled with jokes and      conversation with fellow veterans.       On the following day, ``Wib'' once again visited the      American Legion, where he was honored at a special luncheon      with an American flag birthday cake.       The story of Congressional Medal of Honor recipient and      McCreary County native Wilburn K. Ross, who was a member of      the 2nd Battalion, 30th Infantry Division, and his bravery      under fire during World War II has been told many times, yet      it remains a story that is worth repeating, not only to      remind us of the individual courage and bravery needed to      protect the freedom we cherish but also to share, with our      young people, the historical legacy surrounding a McCreary      Countian's inclusion into the elite group of Congressional      Medal of Honor recipients.       It is from McCreary County that Ross, as a young man,      entered the U.S. Army during World War II. His service led      him to be cited for ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity      at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty near St.      Jacques, France'' and to be awarded the Congressional Medal      of Honor.       According to the ``U.S. Army Center of Military History,''      Ross's extraordinary feat of courage began at 11:30 a.m. on      October 30, 1944, after his company had lost 55 of 88 men in      an attack on elite German mountain troops.       Risking his own safety in order to absorb the beginning      impact of the enemy counterattack, Private Ross placed his      machine gun 10 yards in front of his leading support      riflemen. With machine gun and small-arms fire whizzing      around him, Ross fired with deadly accuracy and managed to      fend off the enemy force.       Surrounded by automatic fire and exploding rifle grenades,      Private Ross, by himself, continued to man his machine gun      and bravely held off six more German attacks. By the eighth      attack, most of Ross's supporting riflemen were out of      ammunition. As the American riflemen took positions      supporting Ross from behind, they crawled, during battle, to      Private Ross in order to slip a few rounds of ammunition from      his belt. Throughout it all, Ross continued to fight on with      basically no help, successfully pushing the enemy back      despite the fact that enemy grenadiers crawled to within four      yards of his position in attempts to kill him with hand      grenades.       Finally, having used his last rounds of ammunition, Private      Ross was directed to withdraw to the command post with the      eight surviving riflemen. Instead, Ross, anticipating more      ammunition, stood his ground. The Germans, realizing that      Ross and his machine gun were all that stood between them and      a major breakthrough, embarked on their last attack, bringing      their fire and wrath together on Private Ross in an effort to      destroy him. Just as the enemy was about to rush over Ross's      position, he received fresh ammunition, allowing him to open      fire on the enemy, killing 40 and wounding 10 of the      attacking force.       Single-handedly breaking the attack, Ross killed or wounded      at least 58 Germans in more than five hours of continuous      combat, saving the last members of his company from      devastation.       ``I didn't really get tired,'' Ross commented when asked      about the battle. ``But they got awfully close to killing      me.''       Remaining on his post that night and the following day for      a total of 36 hours, Ross proved that his upbringing in      McCreary County, Kentucky, had served him well in preparing      him to exhibit extraordinary courage and fortitude in      protecting his comrades and his country under fire.       Six months later, on April 14, 1945, Ross proved that the      same McCreary County upbringing had prepared him to receive      the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest military      decoration given by the United States government to a member      of the armed forces.       Years later, that same McCreary County man, who as a young      adult worked in the local coal mines at Stearns, received      congratulations from and shook the hand of President John F.      Kennedy, just a few months prior to Kennedy's assassination.       In continuing his career with the Army, Ross reached the      rank of Master Sergeant and received the Purple Heart, Bronze      Star, Oak Leaf Clusters, Combat Infantry Badge, Good Conduct      Medal, and the French Croix De Guerre. He was wounded four      times and also served in Korea.       Today, at 91 years old, Ross will quickly tell everyone how      much he enjoys his birthday visits home to McCreary County.       ``Everybody here treats me well,'' Ross smiled. ``They've      named the highway [Private Wilburn K. Ross Highway] after me.      I like coming back her because I was raised here.''       Ross's son Greg, the eldest of six children, travels with      his father and truly admires his father. ``He's been a super      man all his life,'' Greg commented as he smiled at his      father. ``He's always been helpful to everybody. It's fun to      travel with him.''       ``Wib'' says his life is ``pretty good'' now. With his son      close by, Ross still lives by himself in Dupont and mows his      own grass. He enjoys going out for his weekly visit to a      local gathering spot to listen to music and sings along when      the lyrics, ``Put your sweet lips a little closer to the      phone,'' ring out from the stage.       The Congressional Medal of Honor recipient is      straightforward and direct when asked for his advice to the      younger generation.       ``I think the best thing is to always do what you think is      right,'' Ross declared. ``If you do that, you'll have nothing      to worry about.''                          ____________________
