Albans, VT, this year celebrates its centennial, and thousands of citizens turned out on July 5 to mark the occasion in a festive and flawless celebration blessed by Vermont's glorious July weather.  There was a grand parade organized by the St. Albans Rotary Club. There was music. There were recollections and mementos of the city's rich history. And there was a community photograph.  In an article about the centennial published in the Burlington Free Press, reporter Richard Cowperthwait captured the festivities and the sense of history that all Vermonters share. Included in the article is this apt observation from St. Albans Mayor Peter DesLauriers: ``We've gone through the life and death of our railroad; we've gone through fires; we've gone through all of these things and today--right now--I think we're literally on the top of the heap here.''  Mr. President, I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  The article follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 6, 1997]                    St. Albans Celebrates 100 years                       (By Richard Cowparthwalt)       St. Albans.--The Main Street banner said it all Saturday;      ``Celebrate St. Albans.''       That is just what thousands did on a resplendent day that      marked the city's centennial. Activities ranged from an hour-     long parade, ethnic festival and community photograph to      fireworks at nearby St. Albans Bay.       ``I don't know how they could ever top this,'' St. Albans      resident Madonna Vernal said. ``It's a beautiful place.''       During the past century, the city has seen its ups and      downs. It has evolved from a booming railroad hub to a      depressed area with double-digit unemployment to a once-     again-lively county seat with a rising economy.       ``It's a very proud day for the City of Albans,'' Police      Chief David Demag said. ``This event was very impressive. It      was very much hometown USA.''       City officials, residents and visitors from as far away as      Belgium pointed to the success of the day and the beauty of      downtown Taylor Park. It is situated in the midst of the St.      Albans Historic District, between turn-of-the century brick      buildings on Main Street and the imposing churches, Franklin      Superior Courthouse and St. Albans Historical Society museum      building on Church Street.       ``I'm impressed by the buildings'' as well as by the      friendliness of the people, said Myriam Van Dooren, a Belgian      who is visiting friends in Fairfield.       Mayor Peter DesLauriers said the city's centennial      homecoming celebration came off without a hitch on a day that      had abundant sunshine and temperatures in the 70s. The      pleasant conditions contrasted sharply with Friday's      unsettled weather that did not stop a crowd estimated at more      than 500 from turning out on Taylor Park for seven hours of      musical entertainment.       DesLauriers said the city of about 7,600 has persevered      through trying times since its first mayor and aldermen were      elected March 2, 1997--109 years after the town of St. Albans      was organized.       ``We've gone through the life and death of our railroad;      we've gone through fires; we've gone through all of these      things and today--right now--I think we're literally on the      top of the heap here, ``DesLauriers said.       ``The morning parade, which was organized by the St. Albans      Rotary Club, was the signature event of the centennial. There      were about 30 floats with St. Albans' history on display.      They ranged from legendary local musician Sterling Weed      driving a horse-drawn wagon to a depiction of the Oct 19,      1864, Civil War raid that put St. Albans on the map.       Following the parade, a crowd gathered near the      intersection of Main and Bank streets for a community      photograph by local photographer Leonard Parent.       ``I wish we could do this more often, not just once every      100 years,'' City Council member James Pelkey said.                          ____________________
