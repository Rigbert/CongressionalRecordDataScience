There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 955       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as ``Abraham Lincoln National      Heritage Area Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area is a      cohesive assemblage of natural, historic, cultural, and      recreational resources that--       (A) together represent distinctive aspects of the heritage      of the United States worthy of recognition, conservation,      interpretation, and continuing use; and       (B) are best managed through partnerships between private      and public entities;       (2) the Heritage Area reflects traditions, customs,      beliefs, folklife, or a combination of those attributes that      are a valuable part of the heritage of the United States;       (3) the Heritage Area provides outstanding opportunities to      conserve natural features, historic feature, cultural      features, or a combination of those features;       (4) the Heritage Area provides outstanding recreational and      interpretive opportunities.       (5) the Heritage Area has an identifiable theme, and      resources important to the theme, that retain integrity      capable of supporting interpretation;       (6) residents, nonprofit organizations, other private      entities, and units of local government throughout the      Heritage Area demonstrate support for--       (A) designation of the Heritage Area as a national heritage      area; and       (B) management of the Heritage Area in a manner appropriate      for the designation;       (7) there is a compelling need to educate and cultivate      among the citizens of the United States, particularly youth,      an understanding appreciation for, and a renewed commitment      to integrity, courage, self-initiative, and principled      leadership in public and private life;       (8) few individuals in the history of the United States      have as broadly exemplified such qualities, and so profoundly      influenced the history and character of the United States, as      Abraham Lincoln;       (9) the story and example of the life of Abraham Lincoln,      including his inspiring rise from humble origins to the      highest office in the land and his decisive leadership      through the most harrowing and dangerous time in the history      of the United States, continues to bring hope and inspiration      to millions in the United States and around the world;       (10) the great issues during the lifetime of Abraham      Lincoln, including national unity, equality and race      relations, the capacity for democratic government, and the      ideals to address those and related issues, continue to this      day to define the challenges facing the United States;       (11) the ideals espoused by Lincoln, and the sentiments      expressed by Lincoln with respect to keeping the United      States together, are as relevant today as the ideals and      sentiment were in Lincoln's troubled time;       (12) Illinois is known throughout the world as the land of      Abraham Lincoln;       (13) unquestionably, the physical, social, and cultural      landscape of Illinois helped mold the character of Lincoln;       (14) ``Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have      passed from a young to an old man,'' Lincoln remarked on      leaving Illinois. ``To this place and the kindness of these      people I owe everything'';       (15) Lincoln, in turn, left his own traces across the      Illinois landscape;       (16) the traces remain today in the form of stories,      folklore, artifacts, buildings, streetscapes, and landscapes;       (17) though scattered geographically and in varying states      of development and interpretation, together the traces of      Lincoln bring an immediacy and tangible quality to the      powerful Lincoln legacy;       (18) individually and collectively, the traces of Lincoln      in Illinois constitute an important national cultural and      historic resource;       (19) in particular, the stories and cultural resources of      the Lincoln legacy of the region--       (A) reflect the values and attitudes, obstacles and      ingenuity, failures and accomplishments, human frailties, and      strength of character of the men and women who made up the      diverse people of Lincoln's generation, including upland      Southerners and Northeastern Yankees, Anglo-settlers and      American Indians, ``free'' blacks, abolitionists, and critics      of abolitionists;       (B) reflect the material culture and relative levels of      technical sophistication in the United States in the lifetime      of Lincoln;       (C) recreate the physical environment during the lifetime      of Lincoln, revealing the impact of the environment on      agriculture, transportation, trade, business, and social and      cultural patterns in urban and rural settings; and       (D) interpret the effect of the democratic ethos of the era      on the development of the legal and political institutions      and distinctive political culture of the United States;       (20) 3 previous studies entitled ``Abraham Lincoln Research      and Interpretive Center Suitability/Feasibility Study'' by      the National Park Service (1991), ``Looking for Lincoln      Illinois Heritage Tourism Project'' commissioned by the State      of Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs in      cooperation with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency      (1998), and the ``Feasibility Study for the Proposed Abraham      Lincoln National Heritage Area'', revised in 2003, help      document a sufficient assemblage of nationally distinctive      historic resources to demonstrate the feasibility of, and      need to establish, the Heritage Area;       (21) the National Park Service--       (A) operates and maintains the Lincoln Home National      Historic Site in Springfield, Illinois; and       (B) is responsible for--       (i) advocating the protection and interpretation of the      cultural and historic resources of the United States; and       (ii) encouraging the development of interpretive context      for those resources through appropriate planning and      preservation;       (22) the Heritage Area can strengthen, complement, and      support the Lincoln Home National Historic Site through the      interpretation and conservation of the associated living      landscapes outside of the boundaries of the historic site;       (23) there is a Federal interest in supporting the      development of a regional framework and context to partner      with and assist the National Park Service, the State of      Illinois, local organizations, units of local government, and      private citizens to conserve, protect, and bring recognition      to the resources of the Heritage Area for the educational and      recreational benefit of the present generation and future      generations;       (24) communities throughout the region--       (A) know the value of their Lincoln legacy; but       (B) need to expand upon an existing cooperative framework      and technical assistance to achieve important goals by      working together;       (25) the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity      and Bureau of Tourism of the State of Illinois--       (A) officially designated ``Looking for Lincoln'' as a      State Heritage Tourism Area; and       (B) has identified the story of Lincoln as a key      destination driver for the State;       (26) the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition, the      management entity for the Heritage Area--       (A) is a nonprofit corporation created for the purposes of      preserving, interpreting, developing, promoting, and making      available to the public the story and resources relating to--       (i) the story of the adult life of Abraham Lincoln in      Illinois; and       (ii) the contributions of Abraham Lincoln to society; and       (B) would be an appropriate entity to oversee the      development of the Heritage Area; and       (27) the Looking for Lincoln Heritage Coalition has      completed a business plan that--       (A) describes in detail the role, operation, financing, and      functions of the Looking For Lincoln Heritage Coalition as      the management entity for the Heritage Area; and       (B) provides adequate assurances that the Looking For      Lincoln Heritage Coalition is likely to have the financial      resources necessary to implement the management plan for the      Heritage Area, including resources to meet matching      requirement for grants.
