Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this amendment. Its premise is slanderous to 2,700 of our fine law enforcement officers. It is a bigoted statement I say to my friends who have been the subject of bigotry. An NRA letter says that soemhow ATF agents, unlike all the other agents, cannot be trusted. There is no evidence of that. Two hundred sixty-six of those agents since 1920 have lost their lives. Do my friends on this side of the aisle want those agents to believe that somehow they are less trustworthy than other law enforcement agents in this country? I think not. The chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary is correct. If that is our premise, then let us abolish ATF.  My friends in this House, we are talking about crime bills. We are talking about safe streets, and safe schools, and safe communities, and safe neighborhoods. They are threatened today by some of the most violent, vicious [[Page H1385]] people in America who traffic in guns that will kill people very fast, and a lot of them, not to hunt, not to shot at targets, and they traffic in explosives. We just had a plea by somebody in New York who wanted to blow up the United Nations, undermine the security of the international community. Who investigated and found that conviction? An ATF agent.  Now I think this bill can be argued one way or the other on its merits as to whether you want to extend the exclusionary rule good-faith to warrantless searches or not. I think that is a legitimate debate, but I say to my friend on this side of the aisle: Let us not slander some very good people who daily we ask to go up against some of the most dangerous, deranged criminals in this land who threaten the stability of this Nation.  There is no evidence to support the contentions of the NRA that, unlike all others, and I presume that they would like to see this exclusionary rule applied to the Los Angeles Police Department, or the New York Police Department, or the Dallas or Miami Police Department; they would like that.                              {time}  1240  Their premise presumably is that they are perhaps not as well-trained or as carefully or as closely supervised as the agents of ATF, and they are wrong--dead wrong. I say to my friend, the chairman of the committee, for whom I have great respect and with whom I am probably going to vote at the conclusion of the consideration of this bill, do not besmirch these officers, do not single them out. There is no evidence on which to say that they are less competent or less concerned with constitutional protections.  They protect our country. We have asked them to do so. We have asked them to do one of the most difficult jobs of law enforcement in this country--dealing with those who traffic in illegal guns and explosives that can kill a lot of people very quickly.  Do not pretend that the debate on this floor is simply in a vacuum to make political points against our friends on that side of the aisle, that we will embarrass them for voting against the NRA this time, and that those 2,700 agents and all their predecessors and that organization will somehow be oblivious to the debate on this floor that intimates that they are less worthy of being extended this authority than some other law enforcement agents charged by the Government of the United States to protect the welfare of this Nation.
