Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I am suggesting with the Boehlert amendment we have solved the problems of the emergency. But we have also put a cap on the administration or the agency itself of misusing its power as it has done in the past.  The gentleman from New York may not be aware of this, but this has occurred. All we are saying is we have a responsibility as Congressmen, and the Member of that district has the responsibility if a refuge is in fact proposed that is beyond 500 acres, then in reality they ought to come back here and talk to the chairman of the subcommittee and the Members, and especially the Member of that district. So I support the Boehlert amendment, and I definitely oppose the Nadler amendment.                              {time}  1545
