Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise with great sorrow and a heavy heart. The eyes of the world are upon us and the yoke of justice lays heavy upon our shoulders. But today, Mr. Chairman, justice will not be served.  On this day, June 22, 2000, another man will die in Texas. He will not pass by the mercy and the grace of God; he will be executed at the hand of the State.  I am not here to defend the action of those who sit on death row, but I rise to condemn the taking of life. To kill a man, any man, is not moral, it is not just, and it is not right.  The death penalty is not becoming of a civilized society. It is not worthy of a great Nation. Human life is the gift of the Almighty. Who are we to take that gift away?  This afternoon, a man will die in Texas. A piece of our humanity will die with him.
