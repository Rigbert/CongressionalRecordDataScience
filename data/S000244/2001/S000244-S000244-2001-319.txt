Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 1209) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to determine whether an alien is a child, for purposes of classification as an immediate relative, based on the age of the alien on the date the classification petition with respect to the alien is filed, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 1209       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Status Protection Act      of 2001''.     SEC. 2. USE OF AGE ON PETITION FILING DATE, PARENT'S                    NATURALIZATION DATE, OR MARRIAGE TERMINATION                    DATE, IN DETERMINING STATUS AS A CHILD OF A                    CITIZEN.       (a) In General.--Section 201 of the Immigration and      Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151) is amended by adding at the      end the following:       ``(f) Rules for Determining Whether Certain Aliens Are      Immediate Relatives.--       ``(1) Age on petition filing date.--Except as provided in      paragraphs (2) and (3), for purposes of subsection      (b)(2)(A)(i), a determination of whether an alien satisfies      the age requirement in the matter preceding subparagraph (A)      of section 101(b)(1) shall be made using the age of the alien      on the date on which the petition is filed with the Attorney      General under section 204 to classify the alien as an      immediate relative under subsection (b)(2)(A)(i).       ``(2) Age on parent's naturalization date.--In the case of      a petition under section 204 initially filed for an alien      child's classification as a family-sponsored immigrant under      section 203(a)(2)(A), based on the child's parent being      lawfully admitted for permanent residence, if the petition is      later converted, due to the naturalization of the parent, to      a petition to classify the alien as an immediate relative      under subsection (b)(2)(A)(i), the determination described in      paragraph (1) shall be made using the age of the alien on the      date of the parent's naturalization.       ``(3) Age on marriage termination date.--In the case of a      petition under section 204 initially filed for an alien's      classification as a family-sponsored immigrant under section      203(a)(3), based on the alien's being a married son or      daughter of a citizen, if the petition is later converted,      due to the legal termination of the alien's marriage, to a      petition to classify the alien as an immediate relative under      subsection (b)(2)(A)(i), the determination described in      paragraph (1) shall be made using the age of the alien on the      date of the termination of the marriage.''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)      shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act      and shall apply to all petitions and applications pending      before the Department of Justice or the Department of State      on or after such date.
