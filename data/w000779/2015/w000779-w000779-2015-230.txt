President, I will be very brief. I think tonight is a milestone for the Medicare Program--a lifeline for millions of older people. That is because tonight the Senate is voting to retire the outdated, inefficiency-rewarding, commonsense-defying Medicare reimbursement system.  As Senator Hatch noted, it has been bipartisan; it has long been bipartisan. I think this is an important night for the Senate and it is going to be long remembered.  I yield the floor.
