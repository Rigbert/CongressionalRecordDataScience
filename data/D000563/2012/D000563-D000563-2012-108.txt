' Much like the movie starring Jimmy Stewart, it is the story of a small town boy who dreamed of big adventures in a big city, but who discovered his life's calling not far from home.  For nearly 60 years, Dr. Russell Dohner has dedicated his life to providing affordable healthcare to residents of Rushville--a rural community in western Illinois.  Dr. Dohner grew up on a farm, not far from Rushville, one of seven children. He experienced seizures as a small boy, and it was his family doctor who stayed by his side and inspired him to enter the medical field. After high school, Dr. Dohner served in the Army during World War II, attended Western Illinois University, and then worked his way through Northwestern University Medical School.  Although he hoped to move to a big city and work as a cardiologist, he knew Rushville, a city of just 3,200 people, needed a doctor. In 1955 he opened an office there hoping to stay just a few years. That was 57 years ago. Today, little has changed in his Rushville office--the nurses, the furniture, and the price of a visit. He charges patients just $5 a visit.  He does not take health insurance, but at only $5 most of his patients can afford the visit. Even if someone cannot pay, he still helps them.  Dr. Dohner barely makes enough money to pay his nurses, and he relies on income from his family's farm to make ends meet. However, one thing that helps keep the office overhead low is the lack of technology. There is no computer, no fax machine, and no answering machines. Five decades of records are kept on handwritten, 4-by-6 index cards.  Dr. Dohner keeps his office open 7 days a week. On Sundays he stops in before going to church. He starts his day making rounds at Culbertson Memorial Hospital in Rushville, he then takes patients at his office, and he ends the day with another round at the hospital. He may see as many as 120 patients a day. He works with patients on a first-come, first-serve basis. But, if it is an emergency Dr. Dohner lets them use the back door. And if patients are too sick to make the trip in, he will make a house call.  Although he has no children of his own, he has delivered more than 3,500 babies. This happens to be more people than the population of Rushville.  Dr. Dohner puts patients before himself. He has never been on a vacation and cannot remember ever taking a day off. The only time he has closed down his office was when he suffered a heart attack and he himself needed medical care. Dr. Dohner has said, ``I have to take care of my patients first.''  At age 87 and after nearly 60 years on the job, Dr. Dohner continues to provide the rural area with selfless service, hard work, and affordable healthcare. He does not seem to be slowing down much, and for that, the community is grateful.  Dr. Russell Dohner is as a wonderful example of how one person's life can have a big impact on a small town.                          ____________________
