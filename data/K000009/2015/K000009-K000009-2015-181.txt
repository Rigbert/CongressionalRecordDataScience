Speaker, I rise today to recognize a very important milestone in the life of a church community in my District. Exactly 100 years ago today, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church was incorporated. On June 27, 2015, His Eminence Archbishop Demetrios, Primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of America, will lead the congregation and our community in Holy liturgy to celebrate the occasion.  Toledo, Ohio rose up as a city of immigrants. The city's Greek Americans arrived in Toledo in ever increasing numbers as the 20th Century dawned. These early settlers recognized the need to establish a church community. Bonded through faith and tradition, the community had been holding services in different locations in North Toledo. Upon incorporation, the move to build a church of their own began in earnest. In October of 1915 a house was purchased on the same lot on which the current church still stands. The remodeled house served as the church until a new church building was constructed. A splendid building in a Byzantine style, the church is truly magnificent. On Christmas Day 1920, the Divine Liturgy was celebrated for the first time in Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church.  The Cathedral itself serves to anchor the heart of Toledo in its near north end. Along the Cathedral's perimeter, visitors from near and far are welcomed to Toledo in sculpted letters carved into the landscape and a light shines forth from its entry foyer both day and night. Holy Trinity's congregants have built an institution worthy of its founders and vital to our community's character.  Through the coming decades the church community grew. Even in the hardship years of Depression and Wars, the members of thechurch soldiered on. They sacrificed and prayed and the church thrived. As the years continued and the church grew, the Greek American Progressive Association organized a chapter named Parmenides Lodge No. 136, auxiliaries were formed, and federations including Pan-Arcadian, Tenedian, Cretan, Samian, Corinthian, and Sterea-Elias came together to preserve the culture. The ladies of the church organized under the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Ladies Philoptochos Society. The Daughters of Penelope reactivated Dodona Chapter No. 24. World War II brought the formation of chapters of the Greek War Relief Association to help those suffering in Greece.  The post-war years saw progressive leadership and a renewed spiritual activity. Choir and Sunday School were re-energized, The Hellenic Youth Organization was formed followed by the Greek Orthodox Youth of America. This time also brought a realization of the need for new church structures. Ground was broken in October 1951 for a new Education Building which was dedicated on September 13, 1953. In 1958, adjacent land was purchased. Improvements continued in the church culminating in a major renovation in 1966. The newly refurbished church was consecrated on May 22, 1966. With this consecration, a dream conceived so many years before became a reality.  Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church continued to grow and has been woven into the fabric of our community. It remains in Toledo's older North End near downtown and draws our entire community to its renowned festival each September. In 1987, the parish was elevated to a Cathedral. As the 20th century came to a close and a new century dawned, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral and its members remained integral to Toledo. Today, Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral serves 450 families. The cathedral is part of the Metropolis of Detroit, of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. It serves as a beacon of light to the faithful and fulfills the promise in Ephesians 2:20-22, ``Built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.'' I join with the members of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral as well as our larger community in celebrating a century of faith.                          ____________________
