Chairman, I would like to respond to the arguments made by the chairman.  First of all, the idea that a slush fund would be traded is simply not true. If you look at the total national fines that have been imposed by EPA and the courts, you are talking about $12 million in a year like 1989. You are talking about $28 million in a year like 1993.  Second, that the moneys would be used to pay for citizens' suits is absolutely not true. I point out in the text of the amendment it states, ``Amounts in the fund shall be available, as provided in appropriations acts,'' that is your ultimate break on this system, ``to the administrator to carry out projects to restore and recover waters of the United States from damages resulting from violations of this act which are subject to enforcement actions under this section and similar damages resulting from the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United States.''  Again, the control of this system is the appropriations process. They are subject to it, and they are only available to clean up polluted waterways in the United States.  The final point the gentleman made, that this would encourage bureaucrats to run amok, again, the break on the [[Page H4853]] system is the subject of the annual appropriations process, just as the highway trust funds, the aviation trust funds and other funds are. So I do not think we have that encouragement. We are not changing the penalties.  I would recommend the amendment to the Members' attention.
