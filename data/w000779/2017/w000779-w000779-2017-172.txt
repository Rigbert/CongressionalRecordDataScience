President, just very quickly, the Senator pointed out this analysis we have gotten where the premiums go into the stratosphere. Senator Murray and I worked a long time on it.  Wages for working people are going up about as fast as a snail trying to climb uphill. I am curious what you think that means for working-class families in Virginia, because I know in my home State--and Senator Merkley and I have talked about this--we have working families right now who every single month are walking on an economic tightrope, balancing their food bill against the fuel bill, the fuel bill against the rent bill.  Because my colleague was correct with respect to the fact that this would start, by the way, in January--this is not some kind of far-removed thing--people are going to feel the hit of these skyrocketing premiums right away. What does my colleague think that is going to mean for working-class families in his home State?
