Speaker, on January 31, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall vote 12.  Had I been present for rollcall 12, on agreeing to H. Res. 522, providing for consideration of H.R. 1173, a measure to repeal the CLASS program, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
