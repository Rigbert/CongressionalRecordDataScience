 Mr. Chairman, this is a highway and infrastructure bill. That means it is a jobs bill. Now, I would remind my colleagues and those watching that the President said back in January, as part of his weekly address, that he would do whatever it takes, whatever it takes, to create jobs. There is not a more shovel-ready project than the Keystone XL pipeline, period.  Secretary Clinton said in October of 2010, I am inclined to support this project. In August of 2011, she indicated that there was no reason why they couldn't give an approval or a denial by the end of last year.                              {time}  1420  This is 20,000 direct jobs, more than 100,000 indirect jobs, a $7 billion privately funded pipeline that will subscribe to the pipeline safety bill that this committee as well as the Energy and Commerce Committee worked on, that the President signed this last year, raising the standards, raising the fines for those that violate those standards. It is a better pipeline safety route than ever before. I have to say for those detractors, the route has been changed through Nebraska. It will no longer go through that aquifer.  We will bring as much as 800,000 barrels of oil from the oil sands in Canada. As these gas prices continue to go up, Americans understand supply and demand; 800,000 barrels a day that we can get from our friends, the Canadians. If we don't do so, where is it going to go? China. China is already preparing to spend billions of dollars to instead build that pipeline to Vancouver, send it to China to be refined and, guess what, we will get none of that refined oil back.  Some detractors of this project say why don't we just build a refinery in North Dakota. Well, let's say we did. Are you not going to still then build a pipeline to connect it with the supply routes across the country?  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.
