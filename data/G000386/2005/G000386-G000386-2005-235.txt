 We need to eradicate the phony tax schemes that abuse our tax laws at the expense of honest taxpayers. I have worked hard to enact legislation to combat tax shelters by shutting them down and raising the penalties on those who promote and participate in those phony deals. This bill contains many more provisions that do just that. I will add to the bill the increased penalties on tax shelter promoters and on aiders and abettors, and I will support these provisions in conference. These provisions will help deter the activities of those who sell illegal tax schemes and those who help participants in these schemes.  I share the Senator's desire to combat tax shelters, and I share his goals of deterring banks' participation in tax shelters and in exploring ways to let agencies work together to prevent tax shelter activity. However, I think that your amendment has some technical matters that I would like my staff to work through with your staff for future consideration. Combating tax shelters is a constant battle that we will continue to fight.
