 President, I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Chambliss and myself. This is a simple amendment. It simply authorizes a study into how we can better cover farmers affected by recalls they did not cause.  When a food safety recall occurs--such as spinach, tomatoes, cantaloupe--consumers stop purchasing the product regardless of what farm the food came from. When this happens, producers suffer major financial losses because of a recall they did not cause.  This amendment directs the USDA to conduct a study into the feasibility of a crop insurance product that would cover a producer's losses after these kinds of events.  The amendment has zero cost, it has bipartisan support, and it is endorsed by United Fresh.
