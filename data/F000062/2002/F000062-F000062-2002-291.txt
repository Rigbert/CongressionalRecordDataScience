 President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today with Senators Cantwell and Wyden to make sure that all energy transactions are transparent and subject to regulatory oversight. With passage of this legislation, we can reinstate regulatory oversight to the marketplace and help ensure there is not a repeat of the energy crisis that had such a devastating impact on California and the West.  The Enron bankruptcy has uncovered many gaping holes in our regulatory structure, everything from accounting and investment practices to on-line energy transactions. Congress must take a look at all of this. The bill we are introducing today is a first step. The exemptions and exclusions to the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act essentially gave EnronOnline, and the entire energy sector, the ability to operate a bilateral electronic trading forum absent any regulatory oversight or price transparency.  Let me give you an example of what that lack of transparency meant to California: On December 12, 2000, the price of natural gas on the spot market was $59 in southern California while it was $10 in nearby San Juan, NM. We know it costs less than $1 to transport gas from New Mexico to California because this was the cost when these transportation routes were transparent and regulated. So there was $48 unaccounted for that undoubtedly found its way into someone's pocket.  This problem lasted from November, 2000 to April, 2001, and all this time no one knew where all this money was going. The Senate Energy Committee looked at this issue last year but was not able to piece together all of what happened. In the wake of Enron's bankruptcy, however, we are beginning to learn a lot more. By controlling a significant number of energy transactions affecting California, some traders estimate that Enron controlled up to 50-70 percent of the natural gas transactions into southern California, and by trading in secret, Enron had the unique ability to manipulate prices and gouge customers. And the consumes, particularly those in California, ultimately bore the brunt of the costs. In fact, through the course of the crisis in California, the total cost of electricity soared from $7 billion in 1999 to $27 billion in 2000 and $26.7 billion in 2001.  A market does not function properly without transparency. Additionally, regulators need the authority and the tools to step in and do their jobs when markets have gone awry. This bill, then, is intended to close the regulatory loopholes that allowed EnronOnline to operate unregulated trading markets in secret. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act provided a regulatory exemption for bilateral transactions between sophisticated parties in nonagriculturual and nonfinancial commodities. This exclusion includes energy products and electronic trading forums. Because many of the EnronOnline transactions did not involve physical delivery, there was also no oversight by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. In determining which agency, FERC or the CFTC should have the proper authority, we are faced with two challenges: 1. FERC does not have the necessary expertise in derivative transactions; and 2. CFTC does not have the necessary expertise to protect consumers from out-of-control energy prices.  This bill tries to utilize the unique talents of each agency.  In summary, our legislation: 1. Repeals exemptions and exclusions provided for by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000; 2. ensures that energy dealers in derivatives markets (such as EnronOnline) cannot escape federal regulation; 3. makes sure that all multilateral markets and dealer markets in energy commodities are subject to registration, transparency, disclosure and reporting obligations; 4. gives FERC regulatory oversight authority over bilateral transactions not subject to CFTC oversight. Although CFTC would have antimanipulation authority over these transactions; 5. expands FERC jurisdiction to include derivatives transactions, which are defined to include transactions based on the cost of electricity or natural gas and include futures, options, forwards and swaps unless such transactions are under the jurisdiction of the CFTC or the state; and 6. Ensures that entities running on-line trading forums must maintain sufficient capital to carry out its operations and maintain open books and records for investigation and enforcement purposes.  This last point is also very important. Enron saw its future as a ``virtual'' company. As such it sold off many of its physical assets over the past few years. Investors lost confidence in Enron's ability to back up its trades since Enron did not have enough assets to back up its trades. This was a contributing factor in Enron's final spiral into bankruptcy.  Energy trading has gotten extremely arcane and complex over the last three decades. Very few people fully understand how swaps and other derivatives actually work. Without adequate transparency, regulatory oversight, and a regulatory agency willing to do its job, the likelihood is that consumers will pay the price. This is what happened in the California Energy Crisis and has happened with Enron. It would be unconscionable not to do everything we can to prevent the same thing from happening again.                                 ______                                       By
