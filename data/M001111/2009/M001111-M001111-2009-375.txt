 President, I wish to recognize Vickie VanZandt and Steve Hickok for their exemplary record of public service to the Bonneville Power Administration, the people of Washington State, and the Pacific Northwest.  Vickie VanZandt retired on March 28, 2009 after 35 years with the Bonneville Power Administration. She most recently served as Bonneville's transmission business line senior vice president. As the senior executive, Vickie assured the transmission grid operated safely and reliably in order to provide power to over 12 million customers. Her work involved coordinating and setting policy for transmissions system planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance--clearly, no small feat.  Vickie graduated magna cum laude from the University of Washington's School of Engineering, is a registered engineer, and is a member of Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society. She has been a board member of the Western Regional Transmission Association, past president of the Northwest Regional Transmission Association, and has chaired the arbitration committees of both of these organizations. At the request of the Department of Energy, she also chaired the Operations Team investigating the East Coast Blackout of August 13, 2003.  Steve Hickok, Bonneville Power Administration's deputy administrator, retired on April 4, 2009, after 27 years of faithful service. Previous to his time with Bonneville, Steve served on the staff of my former colleague, Senator Mark Hatfield, as well as with the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Appropriations. His experience here in the Senate served him well, and at Bonneville, Steve has served as the assistant administrator for conservation and renewable resources development, the chief operating officer, and the group vice president for sales and customer service. He was appointed as the deputy administrator, the organization's second highest-ranking position, in 2001.  Steve graduated with honors from Pomona College in Claremont, CA, and is also a graduate of the Stanford Executive Program. He has received many awards during his time at Bonneville, including the Secretary of Energy's Meritorious Service Award and the prestigious Presidential Rank Award, which he earned in both 1992 and 2000.Steve has served on the boards of directors of the Electric Power Research Institute, the Western Energy Institute, the American Leadership Forum of Oregon, the Portland Business Alliance, and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation.  Again, I express my thanks to both Vickie VanZandt and Steve Hickok for their years of invaluable service to the Bonneville Power Administration, and to the entire Pacific Northwest region. The people of Washington State and the region have certainly benefited from their dedicated public service and experience. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors.                          ____________________
