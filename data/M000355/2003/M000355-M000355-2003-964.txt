 6, the NATO expansion treaty on today's Executive Calendar. I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having passed through its various parliamentary stages up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification; further, that the nine committee-recommended declarations and three understandings be considered agreed to; there then be 4 hours for debate equally divided between the chairman and the ranking member; provided further that the only amendments in order be the following: a Warner-Levin-Roberts on a consensus, a Levin-Warner on suspension, and a Dodd on administrative structure.  Further, there be 60 minutes equally divided on each of the amendments, with relevant second degrees in order and limited to 60 minutes as well. I further ask that following the disposition of the above amendments and the use or yielding back of time, the resolution of ratification be temporarily set aside; provided further that the Senate then proceed to a vote on the adoption of the resolution of ratification on Thursday, May 8, at a time determined by the leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader.
