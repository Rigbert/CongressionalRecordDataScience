Speaker, There is no room for bias-motivated or hate crimes against fellow Americans. As America fights to defend the values of tolerance and freedom abroad, we must also work vigorously to ensure these values are protected at home.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 256, condemning bigotry and violence against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, South Asian Americans and Sikh Americans.  I want to thank Congressman Issa, along with Congressman LaHood, Congressman Conyers, Congressman Dingell, Congressman Rahall and Congressman Honda for their help on this legislation, along with approximately 50 other colleagues--from both sides of the aisle and all parts of the country--who co-sponsored this measure.  The resolution is straightforward. It acknowledges the contributions to our Nation that have been made by Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, South Asian Americans, and Sikh Americans.  This measure notes that members of these groups have served honorably in our military and in law enforcement, working every day to protect the American people.  The measure also affirms that we as a Congress are concerned by the incidents of bias-motivated crimes against Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans, Arab Americans and South Asian Americans.  And we condemn any acts of bigotry or violence directed against Americans of these groups.  We call upon law enforcement officials throughout America to investigate thoroughly and prosecute vigorously any crimes committed against Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, Sikh Americans or South Asian Americans.  There is a place in America for people of all races, creeds and colors.  There is no place in America for bigotry, prejudice and violence.
