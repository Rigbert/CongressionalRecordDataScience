Is the Senator from Texas aware of the fact he is mistaken again in saying only 3 Federal employees out of 1.8 million were terminated, when the official figures show in fiscal year 2001, 8,920 Federal employees were terminated, and in fiscal year 2000, 8,400 Federal employees were fired for reasons related to poor performance? Is the Senator aware of those numbers?
