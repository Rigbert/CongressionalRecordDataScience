 President, the reason we are in this snarl is because my good friend, the majority leader, has this issue all tangled up with the debt ceiling extension and a health care bill that there is this rush to pass before Christmas, a 2,100-page bill and no one has seen the final version yet. All of these things are all tangled up together.  Our advice would be to quit trying to pass this health care bill before Christmas that has an artificial deadline to pass something that most of us have not seen. Let's do the necessary business of the government and do what Senator Snowe has recommended continuously, which is that we pass the bill on a bipartisan basis with a broad coalition of support.  I believe my time may have expired.
