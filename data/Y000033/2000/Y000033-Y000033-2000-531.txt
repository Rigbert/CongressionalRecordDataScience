Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would address several matters of concern to Alaska Natives through an amendment to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA).  As my colleagues know, ANCSA was enacted in 1971, stimulated by the need to address Native land claims as well as the desire to clear the way for the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and thereby provide our country with access to the petroleum resources of Alaska's North Slope. As the years pass, issues arise which require amending the Act. The Resources Committee as a matter of course routinely considers such amendments and brings them before the House.  Consequently, I am introducing this bill containing several such amendments to ANCSA in order to facilitate having its provisions circulated during the upcoming Congressional recess among Congress, the Administration and the State of Alaska for review and consideration.  This bill has six provisions. One provision would clarify the liability for contaminated lands. The clarification of contaminated land would declare that no person acquiring interest in land under this Act shall be liable for the costs of removal or remedial action, any damages, or any third party liability arising out or as a result of any contamination on that land at the time the land was acquired under this Act.  Section 3 of the bill amends the Act further to allow equal access to Alaska Native Veterans who served in the military or other armed services during the Viet Nam war. Alaska Natives have faithfully answered the call of duty when asked to serve in the armed services. In fact, American Indians and Alaska Natives generally have the highest record of answering the call to duty.  Under the Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for lands which they traditionally used as fish camps, berry picking camps or hunting camps. However, many of our Alaska Natives answered the call to duty and served in the services during the Viet Nam war and were unable to apply for their Native allotment. This provision allows them to apply for their Native allotments and would expand the dates to include the full years of the Viet Nam war. The original dates recommended by the Administration only allowed the dates January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1971. Our Alaska Native veterans should not be penalized for serving during the entire dates of the Viet Nam conflict. This provision corrects that inequity by expanding the dates to reflect all the years of the Viet Nam war--August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975.  The settlement trust provision of ANCSA presently indicates that the assets placed in a settlement trust are not subject to any creditor action other than those by the creditors of the settlement trust itself. Federal law is unclear whether the beneficiary's interests in the trust can be subject to attachment, etc., by their creditors. The legislative history from the 1988 amendments specifically indicates that a ``spendthrift clause'' could be included in the trust agreement for a settlement trust, but does not specify what the scope of such a provision could be. Normally, under general trust law, a spendthrift clause operates to limit the circumstances in which creditors can reach a beneficiary's trust interest. Alaska law (A.S. 34.40.110) expressly recognizes the validity of a spendthrift clause for trusts established on or after April 2, 1997, but does not expressly authorize a spendthrift clause for trusts established prior to this date.  All this uncertainty places the Trustees in a difficult legal position under present law in deciding whether to honor creditor levies against beneficiary interests in a settlement issue. Trustees are required as fiduciaries to protect the beneficiaries' rights, but are also required to honor creditor actions if those are valid under applicable law. At least one court case is now pending before the United States District Court for Alaska to determine whether the trustees of a settlement trust must honor a levy by the State of Alaska with regard to various beneficiaries' unpaid child support obligations.  By contrast, since 1971 section 7(h) of ANCSA has clearly restricted most creditor actions as to Native corporation stock. Creditors are prohibited from levies and other similar actions against Settlement Common Stock, except to the extent that a court has authorized creditor action with regard to unpaid child support. Thus, child support levies are valid against Settlement Common Stock as long as a court has previously authorized such actions.  The proposed provision removes the uncertainty as to levies against the beneficial interests in a settlement trust by clarifying that such levies and other creditor actions may occur in the same circumstances that such levies and actions could occur with regard to the stock in a Native corporation. Not only does this confirm the trust procedure to a procedure already known to the personnel within Native corporations (who often provide the day to day administration of the trusts), but it also follows logically because the source of the settlement trust assets was the Native corporation.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to the provisions which are currently included in the legislation I am introducing today which amends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, it is my understanding that several other provisions are in the process of being drafted and/or negotiated with relevant parties. If those provisions are ready to be considered at the time of committee mark-up of this bill, then I anticipate that they would be offered for inclusion in the bill at that time.  Again, I am introducing this bill today to facilitate its provisions circulated and reviewed during the April recess by the Department of the Interior, the State of Alaska and Alaska Natives.                          ____________________
