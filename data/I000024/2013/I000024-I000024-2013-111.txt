Regarding the very amendment that is an obstacle, keeping me from the vote, I ask unanimous consent right now to become a cosponsor of that amendment, the Vitter amendment I am talking about.  I know what he is trying to do. I know he is going to make an effort to get this done maybe in other legislation if it does not happen here. I will be joining him in his cause. I see this as a separate matter here, as I say. We want to move this along. Everyone agrees to. I will stand by and see if anyone changes their mind.  Thank you, I say to the chairman and ranking member. Thank you for the very kind comments on my amendment.
