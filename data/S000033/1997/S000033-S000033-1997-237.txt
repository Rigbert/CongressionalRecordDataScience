 Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Electronic Fund Transfer Fees Act of 1997. This legislation addresses the growing practice of automated teller machine [ATM] operators assessing a surcharge on consumers who use their machines. Specifically, my bill prohibits an ATM operator from imposing an additional surcharge on customers for accessing their bank accounts through the operator's ATM.  On April 1, 1996, the national communication networks for ATM's--Cirrus and Plus--terminated their policy which prohibited ATM owners from surcharging consumers for using their machines. As a result of this policy change, customers may now be charged twice for accessing funds from the customer's own bank account if the customer uses an ATM which is not owned by the bank; the first fee is charged by the customer's bank for using a nonbank ATM and the second fee is charged by the ATM operator.  At the time of this policy change, experts estimated that within the first 18 months, 80 percent of ATM owners would impose a surcharge. In actuality only 6 months after the policy change 71 percent of ATM owners were assessing surcharges in North Carolina, 69 percent in Arizona, 60 percent in Virginia, and 48 percent in Maryland. While the nationwide figure has only reached 23 percent a recent study of banking practices in Texas indicates that the percentage will continue to grow; Texas' largest 10 banks have been allowed to surcharge since 1987 and all 10 banks now assess a surcharge for noncustomer ATM withdrawals.  In practice, banks enjoy tremendous savings by conducting consumer transactions through ATM's because ATM transactions are less costly to a bank then teller transactions. An ATM withdrawal on a nonowned machine may cost a large bank between $.50 and $.60. By contrast, a teller transaction with a customer costs the large bank between $.90 and $1.15. A study by the Consumer Finance Project indicates that in 1995, banks avoided 2.6 billion teller transactions because consumers used ATM's. Because the banks are actually saving money by using ATM's, consumer groups view it as extremely unfair to charge a consumer multiple fees for withdrawing his/her own funds through ATM's. Consumer groups such as U.S. Public Interest Research Group [US PIRG] and the Consumer Federation of America support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, it is now typical in many parts of the country for a consumer to be charged between $1.50 and $2.50 just to access money on the consumer's own accounts. Whatever costs may be incurred by a bank when a customer uses a nonbank ATM, banks do manage to recover; on average, customers pay $1.18 to their bank for the convenience of using ATM's which are not owned by the bank.  I am especially concerned because, unlike the banks that hold our accounts, the machine owner has no incentive to keep his/her fees reasonable because no relationship exists between the ATM owner and the customer. As such, the more remote the ATM machine, the less incentive for reasonable fees, and the more captive the bank customer.  Mr. Speaker, at a time when banks are making record profits and one-third of those profits--tens of billions of dollars a year--come from fees, it is outrageous that these same banks and other ATM owners are charging consumers even more to access the consumers' money. We must eliminate these additional surcharges and help protect the consumer from another needless expense.                          ____________________
