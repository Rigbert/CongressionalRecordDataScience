  Since joining CBO's Scorekeeping Unit in 1982, Mr. Blau has worked side by side with the Budget Committee, helping us keep track of the status of legislation and committee allocations. As an all around expert on budget process and the Congress, Mr. Blau has been invaluable in helping the Budget Committee execute our responsibilities to the Senate.  Mr. Blau is well-regarded by both Democrats and Republicans for his tireless and diligent work--as well as his patient and easygoing manner. His attention to detail includes reviewing each and every Congressional Record to ensure that the database he maintains to help us with managing the Senate budget process is up-to-date at all times. It is an incredibly important task and one that we are grateful to Mr. Blau for his help in overseeing the past three decades.  In short, Mr. Blau exemplifies CBO's high standard of professionalism, objectivity, and nonpartisanship. In fact, he twice has received the CBO Director's Award, the agency's highest recognition for outstanding performance.  As chairman, I greatly appreciate the sacrifice that Mr. Blau has made in assisting the Budget Committee and the Congress. I wish him well in his future endeavors, including, as I understand it, a plan to spend more time following in person his beloved Nationals--the other Washington baseball team.  I would like to now turn to my colleague, Senator Sessions, for his remarks.
