 President, I want to point out the big deal the Senator from Connecticut made about the IRS regulations and the guidelines not mentioning the word ``children.''  The point is very clear, from the General Accounting Office, but in their study of the IRS guidelines, under a category ``other necessary expenses,'' if it does not mention children, if it does not take the needs of children into consideration, what in the heck do the words ``child care'' mean? What does ``dependent care'' mean, if the needs of children are not taken into consideration? It may not be mentioned in the IRS guidelines per se, but under ``other necessary expenses,'' it is very clear that the needs of every child will be taken care of.  I yield the floor.
