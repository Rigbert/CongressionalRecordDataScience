 President, each of us--not just those of us here in the Senate, but virtually every American--can remember someone; a teacher, a coach, a principal, who made a singular contribution to our lives during our school days. Someone who helped to show us the way as we passed through adolescence and into adulthood. Someone who was a role model, a mentor, a confidante, a friend.  For more than forty years, Father Robert Kenney has been such an individual in the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young men who have attended Salesianum School in Wilmington, Delaware. As a teacher of mathematics, he prepared them for college and careers; as Athletic Director and baseball coach for 34 years, he molded the skills and the characters of young athletes, teaching lessons on the ball-field which would remain with his players throughout their adult lives. As Salesianum's principal, and later president, he maintained and broadened the school's fine reputation for building young men of character, young men whose sense of integrity, honor, compassion, and civic-mindedness were as great as their knowledge of mathematics, history, or literature. Today, Salesianum graduates can be found among the leaders in business and industry, education and the law, public service and community affairs can be found not only throughout Delaware, but across the Nation as well. A great many of them trace their leadership skills, in addition to their academic knowledge, to Father Kenney and the atmosphere he maintained at Salesianum School.  Father Kenney has been more than teacher and coach, more than principal and president, even more than mentor to scores of young men. He is a major part of the beautiful and rich history of Salesianum and the contributions that the school has made to our city, our State, and the lives of so many of us. He is, quite simply, one of the heroes of our time in the State of Delaware.  The high school I attended, Archmere Academy, is one of Salesianum's great rivals on the athletic field. There were a number of spring afternoons when I looked across the baseball diamond and hoped fervently that this would be the game when we would finally beat Father Kenney's well-coached and talented team. It never happened. Father Kenney would always figure out a way to squeeze out a win against the Archers. Often, it wasn't close.  But as much of a rivalry as existed between the two schools, Father Kenney was someone I respected immensely, for his character as a man and as an educator was legendary. During my years in public service, as I have witnessed on an even greater scale Father Kenney's contribution to our community, my admiration has only deepened.  This June, Father Kenney will be stepping down as Salesianum's president, though he will remain involved in the life of the school and the community. He calls Salesianum ``my life's work,'' and intends to continue to work with the school, its alumni association, and the people of our community. He probably knows this, but even if his ties to school and community weren't so strong, we wouldn't let him cease to be involved.  As Salesianum's baseball coach, Father Kenney and his teams compiled a record of 411 wins against only 168 losses, for a winning percentage of .710. It is an impressive record, but I can tell you that his winning percentage in developing young men of great character is even more impressive.  On behalf of our fellow Delawareans, I wish Father Kenney the best for his newest venture. Yet I promise you, Father Kenney, Delawareans are going to keep you busy.                          ____________________
