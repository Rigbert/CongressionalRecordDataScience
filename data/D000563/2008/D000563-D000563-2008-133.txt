 There is another thing that troubles me. There is great potential for conflicts of interest because decisions have to be made by the Secretary of the Treasury under his proposal about where the Federal taxpayers will step in with their money and buy illiquid assets; in other words, buy the mistakes, the mortgage securities, for example. Those decisions will have a direct impact on the survival of institutions and on the jobs of the people who are affected by those.  We want to make sure there is no conflict of interest, that the decisions are made by those who have no skin in the game, no investment in the decision, and it has to be at least subject to some review. There is no one in this country, thank goodness, above the law, and yet in the proposal given to us by the Treasury Department, there is no judicial or administrative review of decisions being made about where the $700 billion is going to be invested. We are being asked--in a hurry--to get this done in a hurry, to give more authority to this administration, specifically to this Secretary of the Treasury, a man whom I respect, but to give more authority to him than anyone has ever had in the history of the United States, and to say that his actions are not subject to review by any court, any administrative body, when there is such a great potential for conflict of interest. That concerns me.
