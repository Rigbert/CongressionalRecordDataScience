Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Eagles of Schoolcraft High School on their men's basketball state championship title. These outstanding young men have worked hard for this accomplishment and have made their community very proud. Their 73-59 victory is an achievement that will be remembered forever.  Winning a state championship is a remarkable achievement that few teams ever experience. This championship is a legacy that the 2010-2011 Eagles will remember forever. The Eagles and Coach Randy Small, along with assistant coaches Bob Saxman, Derrick Small, Lee Ingram, Jon Tone, and Aaron Beery, know that success comes through teamwork and dedication. The Eagles' commitment to the game and their drive to go the extra mile, led them to victory.  It is an honor to pay tribute to the entire Eagles squad: Jon Cakmakci, Kody Chandler, Benny Clark, Zac Decker, Tyler Dow, Bryan Jones, Blake Krum, Jonathan Lawrence, Jacob Lenning, Jacob Marshall, Luke Ryskamp, Joe Savage, Cam Schwartz, Jeffrey Scott, and Trent Skippers. We salute all of you.  On behalf of all the residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Schoolcraft Eagles, Coach Small, and the entire Schoolcraft community--you are an inspiration to us all. Go Eagles!                          ____________________
