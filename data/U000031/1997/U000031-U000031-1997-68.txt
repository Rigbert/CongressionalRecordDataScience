Speaker, it is my pleasure and privilege today to join with Represenatative Henry Waxman and 106 of our colleagues in introducing H.R. 1260, the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to expand and coordinate research on Parkinson's disease to speed the discovery of a cure for this devastating disorder.  The bill authorizes $100 million in fiscal year 1998 and such sums as may be necessary in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 to expand basic and clinical research, establish up to 10 Morris K. Udall Parkinson's research centers across the country, provide for a coordinated program of research and training with respect to Parkinson's disease at the National Institutes of Health, and establish a grant awards program to support researchers who demonstrate the potential for making breakthrough discoveries in Parkinson's.  Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive disorder affecting 1 million Americans. In its final stages, the disease robs individuals of the ability to speak or move. Although Parkinson's disease costs society an estimated $26 billion a year in medical and lost productivity costs--costs which will escalate as the baby boom generation ages--Parkinson's research is severely underfunded. The research funding level has essentially been flat for the past 5 years, averaging about $26 million a year, or only $26 per patient in direct research funding.  I encourage my colleagues who have not already done so to cosponsor the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research Act and join us in the search for a cure for this devastating disease.                          ____________________
