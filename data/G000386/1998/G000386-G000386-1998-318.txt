 President, I would like to talk about ``pay and chase'' today. ``Pay and chase'' is a Pentagon term used to describe another misguided policy. With pay and chase, the Pentagon pays the bills first and then tries to track down the receipts later on. Sometimes they find them; sometimes they don't And sometimes, they don't even bother to look. This is not a good policy. It is un-businesslike, and it's dangerous.  Under current law, payment is not due until a valid receipt is in hand. A certified receipt tells you that the goods and services have in fact been delivered.  So, to me, pay and chase is a mystery. Why, Mr. President, would anyone--in or out of government--want to pay a bill without a receipt? That defies understanding. It makes no sense. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the Pentagon bureaucrats are urging Secretary of Defense Cohen to do.  Today, pay and chase is unofficial policy. It's practiced but not authorized by the law. But the Pentagon bureaucrats want Secretary of Defense Cohen to change that and make it O.K.--with the law.  Secretary Cohen made his request in a letter to the Senate dated February 2, 1998.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have his letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     The Secretary of Defense,                                 Washington, DC, February 2, 1998.     Hon. Al Gore,     President of the Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: I am forwarding for your consideration      draft legislation that, if enacted, would be entitled the      ``Department of Defense Reform Act of 1998.'' This bill is      intended to form the core of the Defense Reform Initiative      (DRI). I request prompt action by the Congress on this      proposal.       The DRI is an exciting, sweeping reform of the ``business''      of the Department of Defense. It will affect the Department      from its corporate headquarters at the Pentagon to each      service member and his or her family throughout the world.      While aspects of our reforms can and already are being      accomplished within existing statutory authorities, the      proposed bill is crucial to implementing many of the most      important and far-reaching reform elements that will make the      Department more business oriented. The DRI will give us the      authority to use those practices that our American industry      counterparts successfully have used to become leaner and more      flexible in a world of increasing change and flexibility.       Re-engineering the Department. We will re-engineer by      adopting the best private sector business practices in      defense support activities. For example, we propose to      incorporate state-of-the-art business procedures in our      travel system. Section 301 would streamline our household      goods transportation so that simplified ``Do-it-Yourself''      (DITY) moves would be available to every service member.      Section 401 would authorize streamlined procurement payment      practices so that our civilian contractors would get prompt      and accurate payments for their goods and services. Section      403 would enable all Federal agencies more freely to use      private sector practices in the sale of surplus personal      property, alone or in conjunction with current Government      reinvention and streamlining initiatives, and to foster more      expedient and efficient disposals of property.       Consolidation. Next, we will consolidate organizations to      reduce unnecessary redundancy and to move program management      out of Pentagon corporate headquarters and back into the      field. The Office of the Secretary of Defense and defense      agency personnel will be cut, as will personnel in Department      of Defense field and related activities. Section 202 supports      this initiative by extending current force drawdown      authorities through September 30, 2003. Section 107 would      clarify that I can make organizational changes as the      National Defense University in order that I can move parts of      organizations into that structure when appropriate.       In addition to cutting the size of staffs, the DRI will      establish a number of new organizational arrangements. Among      these is a Threat Reduction & Treaty Compliance Agency      created to address the challenges of weapons of mass      destruction. Section 102 supports this initiative by      eliminating the requirement for an Assistant to the Secretary      of Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense      Programs. Sections 104 through 107 support another      important consolidation initiative--establishing a      Chancellor for Education and Professional Development to      raise the quality of civilian training and professional      development to world-class standards. Part of our      consolidation effort will enhance the role of the National      Guard and other Reserve elements in domestic emergency      responses. Sections 501 through 503 support this effort by      making our Reserve component and National Guard members      more available and an even closer member of our family.       Competition. We will compete many more functions now being      performed in-house, which will improve quality, cut costs,      and make the Department more responsive. While this      initiative will apply throughout the Department, some      candidates for competition include civilian and retiree      payments, personnel services, surplus property disposal,      national stockpile sales, leased property management, and      drug testing laboratories. Section 402 would permit use of      contractor employees of a contractor whose system is being      tested, to provide the analytic and logistic support in those      cases where contractor impartiality is assured.       Elimination. Finally, we will eliminate excess      infrastructure. Since the end of the Cold War, the Department      of Defense has reduced its military forces significantly, but      infrastructure cuts lag behind. The defense budget has been      reduced by 40 percent, and military personnel will have      declined by 36 percent by 2003. At the same time, after four      rounds of base closures, the Department's domestic base      structure is only 21 percent slimmer. Consequently, we need      to make more infrastructure reductions. Money is wasted on      keeping open excess installations. These resources can better      be directed to support the warfighter. Title VII of our bill      would authorize two additional rounds of base closures. Each      round will provide annual savings of $1.4 billion.       The DRI would increase direct spending annually by less      than $10 million during fiscal years 1999-2002; therefore, it      is subject to the pay-as-you-go (paygo) requirement of the      Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. This proposal      should be considered with other proposals in the President's      Fiscal Year 1999 Budget that together meet the paygo      requirement.       Enactment of this proposal, together with our other      management and structural changes, dramatically will enhance      our ability to improve organizational efficiency while making      more effective use of the Department's financial and      personnel resources. I urge the Congress to enact this      legislation promptly so that we can pursue these crucial      management reforms.           Sincerely,                                                       Bill Cohen.
