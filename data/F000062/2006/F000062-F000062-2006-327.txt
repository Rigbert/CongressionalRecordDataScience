 President, I have had an opportunity to listen to the discussion between Senator Craig and Senator Chambliss on this provision of AgJOBS which we put in as part of the blue card. I congratulate Senator Craig on one of the most colorful charts that we have seen.  The labor provision of this bill is a compromise that was negotiated. I think it makes sense to leave it that way. It is left that way for 3 years. This has been the subject of long negotiations. After many attempts to try to find the right balance, Senators Kennedy and Craig struck an agreement that was supported by both growers and farm workers across this Nation. That is the language in this bill.  Under AgJOBS, H-2A workers are paid the greater of the prevailing rate or the adverse effect wage rate. As Senator Craig has said, the standard is frozen at 2003, and growers will be required to pay the prevailing wage, or what the adverse wage rate was over 3 years ago. The compromise states that this will be the wage rate just for the next 3 years. And during that time, the GAO and a commission of agricultural and labor experts will perform two studies examining H-2A wage rates and making recommendations to Congress. If at the end of the 3 years Congress fails to enact a new adverse effect wage rate, the adverse effect wage rate would be adjusted by the cost of living.  While changing AgJOBS isn't, alone, a disqualification, I think we have to be very careful before we upset what has been a very carefully crafted compromise that is supported by a broad coalition of Members from all sides of the debate.  If I might, I would like to ask Senator Craig a question. Since he was the one who negotiated this, is it not true that this is a broadly agreed upon solution for both farm workers as well as growers?
