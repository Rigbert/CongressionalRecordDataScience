 President, today Senator Barbara Boxer and I are introducing the Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997. This legislation is nearly identical to H.R. 858 sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Wally Herger and passed by the House last week on a vote of 429 to 1.  The House vote is remarkable for two reasons:  First, any legislation involving a controversial issue--particularly on one as contentious as forest management --that receives 429 votes is remarkable in and of itself.  Second, the process by which this legislation evolved is really, I think, groundbreaking, and it deserves to be recognized.  I first met the Quincy Library Group back in 1992 when I was running for the Senate, and was then very impressed with what they were trying to do.  The overwhelming House vote is a real victory for local communities like Quincy which seek to avoid the polarizing--and often paralyzing--battles that have characterized forest management issues for the last decade.  The Quincy Library Group is a local coalition of timber industry representatives, environmentalists, citizens, and elected officials in Plumas, Lassen, and Sierra Counties, CA, who came together to resolve their long-standing conflicts over timber management on the national forest lands in their area.  They had seen first hand the seemingly ever present conflict between timber harvesting and jobs, environmental laws and protection of their communities and forests, and the devastation of massive forest fires. They also saw that a practical solution to the conflict between timber interests and environmental interests were both going to be wiped out one day by uncontrollable wildfires. And so they tried to get together and talk things out.  They decided to meet in a quiet, non-confrontational environment--the main room of the Quincy Public Library. Hence, they became known as the Quincy Library Group.  They began their dialog in the recognition that they shared the common goal of fostering forest health, ecological integrity, an adequate timber supply for area mills, and economic stability for their community.  So, after a year-and-a-half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group developed an alternative managementplan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest.  This legislation is the result. The bill we introduce today implements the Quincy Library Group's plan.  I know that some environmental organizations had concerns about aspects of this legislation, and some may still oppose it.  But let me make something very clear: As I stated when I met with the Quincy Library Group, in order to have my support, the legislation had to explicitly state that all activities would be carried out consistent with all applicable Federal environmental laws, both substantive and procedural. The administration made this requirement clear as well.  The House bill and this legislation do so.  Another condition for my support, and that of the administration, was that the legislation must authorize sufficient funds to carry out the plan, so that funds will not be diverted from other important programs like wildlife protection, grazing and recreation.  The House bill and this legislation authorize appropriations to do so.  With these key provisions in place, I believe this legislation deserves strong support and swift passage.  Specifically, this legislation:  Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the Quincy Library Group's forest management proposal on designated lands in the Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests for 5 years as a demonstration of community-based consensus forest management;  Protects the California spotted owl and riparian areas by excluding all spotted owl habitat in the pilot project area from logging and other resource management activities during the 5-year pilot project, and requiring the Forest Service to follow the scientific analysis team guidelines for riparian system protection;  Calls for the construction of fuel breaks on 40,000 to 60,000 acres a year;  Provides for group selection on 0.57 percent of the project area annually as well as individual tree selection uneven-aged forest management;  Limits the total acreage subject to forest management activities to 70,000 acres annually;  Requires a program of riparian management, including wide protection zones and riparian restoration projects;  Requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement prior to the commencement of the pilot project;  Authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the Quincy Library Group pilot project;  Directs the Forest Service to amend the land and resource management plans for the Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to consider adoption of the Quincy Library Group plan in the forest management plans;  Requires an annual report to Congress on the status of the pilot project, including the source and use of funds, the acres treated and description of the results, economic benefits to the local communities, and activities planned for the following year; and finally,  Requires a scientific assessment of the Quincy Library Group project to be commenced at the midpoint of the project and submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002.  At the suggestion of the environmental community, and with the concurrence of the Quincy Library Group, I have added language to the House version of the bill to provide additional environmental safeguards. These additions will ensure that there will be no road building or timber harvesting on the lands the Quincy Library Group plan designated as off base, plan designates certain lands as deferred, and require the annual reports and the final report on the Quincy Library Group project to include a report on any adverse environmental impacts of the pilot project. Finally, it is our intention that areas of late successional emphasis identified in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem project report also be protected from resource management activities during the pilot project, and I will seek committee report language on this issue.  What all this means is that as a result of the Quincy Library Group pilot project:  The threat of catastrophic forest fires will be reduced, through the clearing of underbrush and thinning of the smaller trees;  Enough jobs in the forests will be provided to keep the local mills in operation and the communities in existence; and  Forest health will be improved, riparian areas will be restored, and biological diversity maintained.  Mr. President, I believe the Quincy Library Group deserves a great deal of credit and respect for approaching a tough issue with the goal of finding common ground.  There is a lot of common ground. They all live in the area. They all work there. They raise their children there. They all care about both the environment and the industry that provides jobs to the region. They wanted to work out a solution instead of continuing the take-no-prisoners-approach of endless litigation and standoff.  I believe the solution-based approach demonstrated by the Quincy Library Group should be supported by the Congress, and that is why I committed months ago to introduce legislation based on this group's efforts.  On an issue like forest management and timber harvesting, many local variables are involved and must be considered to find workable solutions:  For example, the wildfire threat in Tennessee is not the same as it is in California.  And the economic impact of the timber industry may be different in Hayfork, CA than it is in Juneau, AK.  The bottom line is that, as long as certain basic standards of environmental law are met, this pilot project will demonstrate whether a local initiative can be successful in developing a forest management plan that works to protect the old growth trees, endangered species, and jobs for the community.  And based on that belief I am pleased to support their efforts by sponsoring this legislation in the U.S. Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1028       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
