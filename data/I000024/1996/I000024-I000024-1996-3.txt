President, like most Americans, I have watched the events of the past several days in the Middle East with great concern. Through a series of miscalculations, the fragile peace process, which so many of us support and were hoping would be successful, seems to have been threatened by renewed violence.  As a strong supporter of Israel, I hope a reopening of the constructive dialog has been achieved in the White House in the past 24 or 36 hours. And I hope as well that both Israel and Palestinian leaders will renew their commitment to peace.  As they attempt to resolve their immediate differences, I urge Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat to act in good faith and with restraint, although I have to say, after having had a lengthy meeting with Mr. Arafat just a few weeks ago on the Gaza, I did not observe much restraint.  So often, dramatic events in one district of the world draw attention from some of the other things that are going on. I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the concern that I have over other things that are taking place in that region of the world. I wish to call to my colleague's attention, current actions being taken by Syria, actions which may prove to be an even greater threat to the security of Israel and the stability of the Middle East.  A very dangerous game is being played by Syrian President Hafez Assad on the Golan Heights. For the past month, Syria has been conducting a series of troop movements along Israel's northern border, which will enable Syria to quickly launch an attack on Israel. Syria has redeployed up to 12,000 troops from in and around Beirut to within striking distance of the Golan Heights. This is the first significant manipulation of military forces since the Madrid Conference convened 5 years ago to initiate the peace process.  Only by standing on the edge of the Golan, which I have done many times, and I am sure the Senator presiding has also, can you get the full impact of the strategic significance of the Golan.  The Syrian troop movements is just the latest in a series of destabilizing actions by Assad. Despite repeated invitations for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Assad has refused to renew peace talks with Israel. Syria still harbors some 10 anti-Israel terrorist organizations in Damascus. Syria also supports the anti-Turkish, anti-Jordanian terrorists, and let's not forget Syria's destabilization of Lebanon with over 40,000 Syrian troops supporting Hezbollah terrorists.  Mr. President, the Syrian troop movements are additionally menacing in light of a serious surprise attack on Israel during the observance of Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement in 1973.  In 1973, Syrian commando units were used to attack Israeli positions on Mt. Hermon during Yom Kippur, the day of fasting prayer and introspection, which was observed in Israel just last Monday. Syrian troop movements could force a dangerous escalation by virtueof the implied threat to Israel of their forward positions.  In the most recent redeployment, which took place just last week, special forces were moved to forward positions on the Syrian side of Mt. Hermon. These movements are most disturbing and significantly change the military picture. It was a similar force which captured an Israeli outpost on Mt. Hermon in 1973. They were only dislodged after heavy loss of life.  Mr. President, an editorial published in a recent Near East report outlines the threat to Israel of these recent Syrian actions.  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Troubling Syrian Troop Movements       For several weeks, Syrian troops have been moving from the      Beirut area to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, close to Israeli      positions on the Golan Heights. The New York Times (Sept. 18)      said Israel and the U.S. are particularly concerned about the      movement of crack Syrian commandos near Israeli listening      posts on Mount Hermon, given that the 1973 Yom Kippur War      began with a Syrian commando attack on Mount Hermon.       In its September 18 lead story, Ha'aretz reports that an      intelligence assessment (presented in recent days to Prime      Minister Netanyahu against the background of the troop      movements) says that, while there are no signs indicating an      immediate outbreak of hostilities, ``the probability of war      with Syria is no longer low.'' (In recent years, IDF      intelligence assessments have said there is ``a low      probability'' of such a war.)       The biggest military advantage Syria could gain from the      latest troop movement would be a reduction in the time needed      to move from a defensive to an attacking posture. ``The main      concern is not that the Syrians will try to attack the      Galilee, but will try a quick capture of some key point, like      Mt. Hermon. This evaluation is based largely on the nature of      the Syrian forces sighted in the area: special commando units      trained to engage in swift raids,'' wrote Ha'aretz      intelligence expert Yossi Melman (Sep. 18).       While the Syrian movements are troubling, their      significance should not be exaggerated. Israel and Syria have      reportedly exchanged ``pacifying messages'' aimed at heading      off a confrontation. Foreign Minister David Levy and U.S.      Ambassador to Lebanon Richard Jones are said to be involved      in calming things.       ``I don't see anything particularly alarming in the      redeployment,'' Jones said, adding that a military      confrontation between Syria and Israel'' seems pretty far-     fetched'' (Reuter, Sep. 17).       Prime Minister Netanyahu told the Knesset Foreign Affairs      and Defense Committee: ``Syria's intention is evidently to      put psychological pressure on Israel and its new government.      And, when pressure is applied to you, the main thing is don't      get pressured.''       Syria's bullying tactics come at a particularly inopportune      time--just as Washington and Jerusalem have been working      tirelessly to arrive at a new formula for resuming Israeli-     Syrian talks. Damascus would do well to jettison the      questionable threats and troop movements in favor of re-     engaging in serious negotiations with Israel.                          ____________________
