 Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: City of Norco  Address of Requesting Entity: 2870 Clark Avenue, Norco, CA 92860  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $750,000 for the City of Norco's Waste-to-Energy Facility. Last year, a preliminary feasibility study prepared for the City of Norco showed that thermal conversion of horse manure and bedding material into electricity appears to be a viable proposition, both technologically and financially. The city is now taking steps towards a contract for the design and construction of a manure-to-energy facility. The requested funding will allow the city to design and engineer the project. When complete, the project will allow the city to reduce its carbon footprint by providing an environmentally friendly ``green'' source of renewable energy to citizens of Norco and surrounding communities. The City of Norco will provide the non-federal cost-share of the project.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Water and Related Resources  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Inland Empire Utilities Agency  Address of Requesting Entity: 6075 Kimball Avenue, Chino, CA 91708  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $100,000 for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency's Inland Empire Regional Water Recycling Project. The InlandEmpire Regional Water Recycling Project will produce 100,000 acre-feet of recycled water per year when the project is complete. The water will be used for outdoor irrigation, industrial processes and recharging groundwater basins, thereby serving the needs of 800,000 current residents in the Inland Empire. The requested funding will be allocated to engineering design and construction of the project. The non-federal funding will be provided by the Inland Empire Utilities Agency.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Construction, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District  Address of Requesting Entity: 915 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 980, Los Angeles, CA 90017  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $2,000,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers' Murrieta Creek project. Murrieta Creek poses a severe flood threat to the cities of Murrieta and Temecula, where overflow flooding from this undersized creek with a tributary watershed of over 220 square miles has periodically wreaked havoc, most recently in 1993 when the public and private sectors incurred flood-related damages of nearly $20 million, and nearby Camp Pendleton Marine Base suffered $88 million in damages. The project, developed jointly by the Corps of Engineers and the local sponsor, not only provides flood protection for these two communities, but also includes other elements such as environmental restoration and recreation that will serve as the lynchpin for regional economic development. The requested funding will be used to award and construct the project's entire Phase II reach, which includes protection for Old Town Temecula, as well as to complete the Design Documentation Report (DDR) and the preparation of plans and specifications for Phase III's Multi-Purpose Detention Basin.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Water and Related Resources  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Orange County Water District  Address of Requesting Entity: 18700 Ward Street, Fountain Valley, CA 92708  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $100,000 for the Orange County Water District's Orange County Regional Water Reclamation Project. The Orange County Water District diverts secondary treated waste water from the Orange County Sanitation District that would otherwise be disposed of in the ocean. The waste water is highly treated using microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultra violet light with hydrogen peroxide. Currently, half of the collected water is injected into groundwater basin along the coast to create a barrier preventing seawater from intruding our precious drinking water supplies and is pumped to the District recharge basins for percolation into the groundwater basin. The project would expand the capacity of the current plant by an additional 18 million gallons per day. Additional microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light treatment equipment would be purchased and installed. A significant portion of the infrastructure has already been constructed to accommodate an expansion. This includes the yard piping, pump stations, and the electrical backbone. When the Ground Water Replenishment System was designed and constructed, all piping, facilities, electrical systems, and the site were designed for an ultimate capacity of 130 million gallons per day.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Water and Related Resources  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Western Municipal Water District  Address of Requesting Entity: 450 Alessandro Boulevard, Riverside, CA 92508  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $1,000,000 for the Western Municipal Water District's Riverside-Corona Feeder project. The Riverside-Corona Feeder project captures and stores new water to increase firm water supplies, reduce water costs and improve water quality as well as reduces regional dependence upon increasingly unreliable imported supplies from the State Water Project, the Colorado River and the northern Bay-Delta. The project will also be equipped to clean plumes of perchlorate and VOCs in the Bunker Hill basin, and will provide a link among groundwater basins in the region. In addition to the Bunker Hill Basin, the Feeder will allow water supplies to be conjunctively used in the Chino, Riverside and Arlington groundwater basins, further enhancing the ability of the region to withstand droughts and providing a mechanism to allow treatment and recovery of poor quality groundwater found in these basins.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Investigations, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District  Address of Requesting Entity: 915 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 980, Los Angeles, CA 90017  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $221,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers' Riverside County Special Area Management Plan. The Corps is developing the nation's largest Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) for both the San Jacinto and Upper Santa Margarita Watersheds, which by assisting federal, state and local agencies with their decision making and permitting authority, will position those agencies to protect, restore and enhance aquatic resources while also accommodating various types of development activities and public infrastructure projects. The Corps has already made significant progress on a ``Landscape Level Aquatic Resource Delineation'' and ``Functional Assessment'' to help in determining the value of area waters and wetlands. Once completed, the plan will not only streamline the permitting process to foster regional economic development, but it will also create and protect woodlands, wetlands, freshwater marshes, vernal pools, streams, lakes and rivers. The Corps had developed alternatives incorporating Riverside County's previously approved Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan and the General Plan and the information learned from the Landscape Level Delineation and Functional Assessments. They have also started the process of preparing environmental documents for NEPA and CEQA compliance. The requested funding will be used to complete the EIR/EIS, complete the development of the Abbreviated Permits and complete the Resource Conservation Plan to adequately mitigate for impacts to jurisdictional waters authorized through the issuance of SAMP permits.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Investigations, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District  Address of Requesting Entity: 915 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 980, Los Angeles, CA 90017  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $100,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers' San Clemente Shoreline project. Erosion of the protective beach in San Clemente has caused much of the study area to have little if any beach, particularly during the winter season. Storm induced waves have become a serious threat over the past several years to City facilities, the Lossan railroad, commercial properties, infrastructure, and coastal residencies. The public components of these facilities threatened by erosion and coastal storms have a value of over $10 million. Also, there have been emergency revetments placed in several areas along the study area to prevent damage to the railroad from storms. It is estimated that the railroad will be required to spend $14-$20 million in the future to protect the rail line. Restoration of a protective beach will reduce these costs for protection. The requested funding will allow the Corps of Engineers to complete work on the feasibility study and move towards the project's design.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Construction, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District  Address of Requesting Entity: 915 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 980, Los Angeles, CA 90017  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $582,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers' San Juan Creek, South Orange County, project. The Corps of Engineers began the San Juan Creek Watershed Feasibility Study in 1998 and the initial study phase was completed in 2003. The project has now moved into what the Corps calls a ``spin-off'' study. The spin-off study is a more focused and narrowly defined study of flood control and ecosystem restoration alternatives in the very bottom of the watershed in the cities of Dana Point and San Juan Capistrano. With sufficient federal appropriations in FY2010 and FY2011, the study will be completed. The project has taken on additional importance with the failure of 1,500 linear feet of concrete channel lining on January 9, 2005. About 3,200 residents in the Cities of Dana Point and San Juan Capistrano were evacuated in the early morning hours. The County of Orange declared an emergency and together with the Corps of Engineers placed large rock on the exposed earthen slope as a temporary repair.  Requesting Member: Congressman Ken Calvert  Account: Construction, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District  Address of Requesting Entity: 915 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 980, Los Angeles, CA 90017  Description of Request: The Fiscal Year 2010 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act provides $52,193,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers' Santa Ana River Mainstem project. The Santa Ana River Mainstem Project is being constructed to address what the Corps of Engineers identified in the 1980s as ``the worst flood threat west of the Mississippi River''--which then impacted three million people and 110,000 acres located in the three Southern California counties of Orange, Riverside, and San Bernardino, with estimated loss of 3,000 lives and $15 billion in economic losses (1987-8 price levels). To date, the Federal Government and the flood control districts of the impacted counties have spent over $1 billion on the Project. Continued funding is necessary to complete the Project and ensure the level of protection as planned. Specifically, funding is needed to complete the Reach 9 component, which is the last section of the Santa Ana River, between Prado Dam and the Pacific Ocean, to be improved as part of the project. Until the Reach 9 channel and levee improvements are completed, this reach of the river will not be able to convey the maximum 30,000 cubic feet per second outflow from the new Prado Dam outlet works. The completion of Reach 9 is necessary to provide the level of protection envisioned by the authorized project. The overflow from Reach 9 would destroy local businesses, commercial properties and homes and the adjacent sections of the State 91 freeway, a major transportation artery in the region. Interior dikes in the Prado Dam flood control basin and the construction of a new Prado Dam spillway are additional components of the project that must be funded.

The requested funding would allow the Corps of Engineers to perform much needed studies and amend the water control plan to permit Seven Oaks Dam to be used for water conservation. The winter rains of 2005 demonstrated beyond question that water conservation at Seven Oaks Dam can provide a major supplemental source of water to for this increasingly water-short region. Specifically, the studies will update the environmental documents relating to water conservation at Seven Oaks. The studies will also address the problem of anaerobic conditions that developed during the summer of 2004 so as to ensure that such conditions do not contaminate water stored for human consumption in the future.                          ____________________
