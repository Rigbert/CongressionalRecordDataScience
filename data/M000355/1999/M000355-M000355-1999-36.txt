 Does the Senator from Idaho--of course we are not in the best position to answer this, I don't guess, since it is not our party, but it is still interesting to speculate. Let's assume the National Right to Life Committee gave a $100,000 soft money contribution to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. I ask my friend from Idaho, does he anticipate at that point the Democrats in the Senate would become pro-life?
