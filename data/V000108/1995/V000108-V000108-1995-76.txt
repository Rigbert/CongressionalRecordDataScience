Speaker, over the course of my years as a private citizen and public official, I have witnessed a great, unfolding story. This story is one of pride and principle, enterprise and excellence. It is the story of American workers given the chance to contribute to society, with the labor movement's guiding hand.  Today, I would like to call attention to 16 young men who completed the sheet metal workers' apprenticeship program. On June 12, 1995, Sheet Metal Workers International Association Local Union No. 20 in Gary, IN, initiated these men as journeymen sheet metal workers. The new members are: John Babe, John Bodish, Erik Burkhart, Shane Byers, Andy Cleland, Kevin Frazier, Sam Glover, Phil Grede, Christopher Jenness, Eugene L. Klimazewski, J. Patrick Knox, Duke Popa, Jerry Porter, Richard Sells, Christopher Shaffer, and Matthew Vanbuskirk.  According to Mr. G. Russell Basset, who has almost 20 years of celebrated service as an elected official with Local No. 20, the apprentice program offers a broad overview of the sheet metal craft. Over a 5-year span, each apprentice must attend school once a week in Gary, IN. Moreover, the apprentice spends another 4 days a week working on sites and learning the various skills needed to make a successful and prosperous journeyman. These marketable skills include applied math, metal fabricating, welding, and architectural design as well as many others.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other colleagues to join me in congratulating these fine individuals as they began their distinguished careers as journeymen sheet metal workers. Their futures promise to be successful as they use their intangible and tangible experiences from the apprentice program in their careers as well as their personal lives. May their careers be long and fruitful.                          ____________________
