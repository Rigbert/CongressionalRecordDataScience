Mr. Speaker, the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights, which I chair, was briefed by Kim Sang-Chul, chairman of the Korea American Friendship Society. I am inserting his comprehensive statement in the Record for the information of my colleagues:  Remarks by Kim Sang-Chul, Chairman, Korea America Friendship Society       Honorable Chairman, and members: I wish to thank you for      inviting me here to speak on the human rights situation in      Korea.                        i. introductory remarks       Korea has a checkered history. It has experienced numerous      foreign invasions throughout its 5000-year history. However,      it has managed to keep its independence and its people have      made the country what it is today--a democratic, independent      and economically thriving country--through patience,      perseverance, and hard work.       From ancient times, we have been called the white-clad      people for our love of purity and justice, symbolized by      Koreans' traditional white clothing. Korea is a small nation      in terms of its territory. But it is not small in terms of      its aspirations. We have achieved miraculous economic growth      and established a democratic government through fair      elections in a short period of time. We are optimistic about      our future. We will probably be able to join the ranks of      advanced countries in the first part of the next century,      thereby allowing us to play a more important role in the      international community for the promotion of world peace,      freedom, justice and prosperity.       Our successful journey on the path toward economic      prosperity and political freedom could not, by any means, be      described as smooth. We endured hardship for 36 years under      Japanese colonial rule. The nation was in chaos and the      national economy was completely devastated as a result of the      Korean War.       Thanks to the sacrifices of our allies, we were able to      fend off communist aggression and achieve peace, however      fragile it may be.       Thanks to the support of our allies and friends, we were      able to overcome the devastation of the tragic war, rebuild      the nation and its economy, achieve freedom and establish a      democratic government.       The road leading to freedom and democracy in Korea has been      bumpy. We were under the rule of military governments for      almost 30 years from 1961 through 1992. There is no denying      that many human rights violations occurred during this      period.               II. HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA       On September 26, 1985, I met Mr. Kim Keun-Tae at the      prosecutor's office. Mr. Kim was in custody for investigation      of his alleged anti-government activities. He revealed that      he was tortured with electric shocks and water-torture and      showed me the wounds on the back of his foot. I was deeply      distressed for three days after seeing his wounds. I decided      to follow my conscience and submit an unprecedented      application for a court order to preserve evidence of Mr.      Kim's wounds.       The revelation of Mr. Kim's torture was a very strong      challenge to the powerful Chun Doo-Whan government. As a      result of my action, the judge had to provide Mr. Kim an      opportunity to make a detailed statement about his suffering      caused by the torture during the investigation.       Mr. Kim's 40-minute-long statement shocked the courtroom      audience and the press, which somehow managed to report parts      of Mr. Kim's testimony.       As a consequence, the telephones in my law office and my      residence were tapped and government auditors began an      investigation of my tax returns.       However, I prevailed in a lawsuit against the policemen who      tortured Mr. Kim and in a suit demanding compensation for the      damage he suffered.       On July 5, 1986, as one of the lawyers of a nine-member      legal team, I filed a lawsuit against the police officers      responsible for the sexual torture of Kwon In-Sook, a female      college student.       I remember delivering to Ms. Kwon a secret letter from      Cardinal Kim Su-Whan, in which he encouraged her in her time      of distress and agony.       The exposure of the sexual torture incident created a      backlash against police brutality and the immorality of the      government. On Jan. 14, 1987, another case of torture by the      police resulted in the death of a Seoul National University      student. The death of Pak Chong-Chol shocked citizens and the      popular anti-government movement started to expand.       On April 13, 1987, President Chun refused to accept a      direct presidential election to choose his successor. In May,      as a member of the executive committee of the Citizens      Movement for a Democratic Constitution, I participated in a      peaceful march that drew the enthusiastic support of people      across the nation.       The ruling party's presidential candidates, Roh Tae-Woo,      had to issue his so-called July 29 declaration, accommodating      the people's demand for a direct presidential election and      other democratization measures.       In ten years, even the rivers and mountains will change,      according to an old Korean saying. We are witnessing      tremendous changes in my country these days. Two former      presidents of Korea are in custody pending their trials on      various criminal charges. On the other hand, Kim Keun-Tae is      a vice president of the major opposition party and one of his      old friends who attended his trial is now the spokesman for      the ruling party.       How we evaluate the present political situation in the      Republic of Korea, including the human rights situation and      the national security situation, is by no means a simple      issue. It is rather complicated. I will, however, pick out a      few important issues and try to present an objective view of      the current situation in Korea. I believe that there is a      consensus that the human rights situation in the Republic of      Korea has improved significantly.       There could be some isolated human rights violations which      are not uncommon even in the most developed countries. At      present I am really concerned about violent demonstrations,      the irresponsibility of the press and citizen's lack of a      sense of duty.       The National Security Law of the Republic of Korea has been      the focus of the attention of the U.S. Government. I proposed      the repeal of the National Security Law and suggested that      the government include its relevant articles in the criminal      code when I submitted my opinion on the revision of criminal      law in Jan. 1985. I also proposed the replacement of the      National Security Law with the Protection of Democratic Order      Law when I was a national policy adviser to Kim Young-sam,      the then presidential candidate of the opposition party.       However, I completely changed my mind after cautiously      watching the advent of the so-called ``Mass Revolution''      movement since 1989. Korea is the only country in the world      which is divided into two opposing ideological camps: the      democratic and free Republic of Korea and the communist North      Korea. North Korea has tried to overthrow the government of      the Republic of Korea ever since its establishment. We should      not forget that North Korea's military forces are heavily      concentrated along the Demilitarized Zone, about 30 miles      from Seoul. It will take only six minutes for North Korea's      fighter planes to reach Seoul. These fighter planes were      relocated closer to the DMZ last October.       A North Korean agent, Kim Tong-shick, was arrested after a      gun fight when he was discovered by South Korean police last      October. He was heavily armed. He confirmed that besides his      most recent infiltration he was sent to the Republic of Korea      five years ago, when he crossed the border to North Korea      with a high-ranking North Korean female agent who operated in      the south for 12 years since 1980, and newly recruited labor      movement leaders in the South.       He made contacts with Ham Wun-Kyung, who led a violent      demonstration and sit-in at the USIA in Seoul, and other      student activists. Kim revealed his identity and discussed     cooperation with the activists for the ``revolution'' in the      South. Just a few of them reported his identity to the      authorities.       It is quite natural and necessary for a nation to equip      itself with the legal devices to safeguard its national      security in the face of a threat to its survival through      espionage activities and the resultant chaos. Germany      deals with such violations through its penal code but      Korea handles anti-state activities with the National      Security Law.       There have been some criticisms of the law's interpretation      and applications. However, the repeal of the law will create      a legal vacuum for the regulation of illegal activities short      of sedition or attempted overthrow of the government. And the      previous National Security Law violators should be pardoned.       Second, according to the labor laws of the Republic of      Korea, the formation of a union is prohibited for public      servants and school teachers and only one union is allowed in      one work place. The freedom to organize a labor union,      stipulated in the international Labor Organization      provisions, could be in direct conflict with Korean labor      laws.       A traditional labor union concept is based on the      assumption that antagonism and conflict between labor and      management are inevitable. In the case of public servants,      the management is the people of the nation, and in the case      of school teachers, the management is the people or nonprofit      public organizations.       From Korea's traditional ethical point of view, their      relationship should not be that of antagonism but that of      service to the public cause. In particular, school teachers      are not treated as labor in our society. They are respected      for their service and their mission to teach our youths. The      Korean labor laws containing the prohibition against unions      for school teachers and public servants are overwhelmingly      supported in Korea.       It is debatable whether allowing multiple unions is a basic      factor for free unionism. In addition, multiple unions will      further complicate things and cause more frequent labor      disputes and antagonism, and therefore, it is construed to be      not more than a demand by labor activists and failed to get      wide support in Korea.       Essentially, freedom should be guaranteed by all means. The      concept of fundamental social rights and their application      varies according to a nation's culture, characteristics and      its composition. What really matters is not the difference in      the system itself but a nation's willingness to accept the      fundamental principle of human rights. I dare say that the      Republic of Korea is one of these countries.       Third, let us turn our attention to the anti-establishment      activists in Korea. It is a fact that there were some      followers of the socialist's line of armed revolution and      North Korea's communist juche ideology hidden among those who      proudly fought for freedom and democracy under the      dictatorial military governments.       Distinguishing between these two groups of people was not      an easy matter then. But, as Korea advances toward political      maturity, it became easier to identify their true colors. The      anti-establishment activists deny the legitimacy of the      Korean government, ignore law and order, and use violence to      achieve their objectives. They should not be treated as      conscientious activists who work within the system.       Fourth, I wish to briefly mention the separated family      issue as a human rights issue. As Dr. Albert Schweitzer once      said, the freedom to visit or live in one's hometown is one      of the fundamental human rights. This very human right is      grossly violated in Korea because of North Korea's inhumane      and uncompromising stance toward the separated family issue.      Ten million separated families do not know their relatives'      whereabouts and there is no channel of communication between      them whatsoever.       The Korean government has repeatedly proposed to North      Korea measures to facilitate reunions of and communication      between the separated families but to no avail. It is tragic      not to have your own family with whom to share happiness and      sorrow. My family is one of the separated families. My father      was longing to hear something about his father and uncles.      But he died last August without his wishes being fulfilled.                    III. HUMAN RIGHTS IN NORTH KOREA       Now I would like to take a look at the status of the human      rights situation in North Korea.       The death of Kim II-Sung did not change anything in North      Korea. North Korea continues to be a closed society, isolated      from the international community.       North Korea maintains the same dictatorial communist regime      under the same ``juche'' ideology and the obsessive cult of      personality. Politically, the North Korean people are living      in an extensive gulag. Economically, they are plagued by low      productivity, a shortage of food, a shortage of energy and      foreign currency, and its economy has registered negative      economic growth for quite some time. While having to tighten      its closed-door policy to maintain the present political      structure, its economic problems can not be solved without      opening its doors, structural adjustment, and economic      reform. In addition, the complete blockade of information and      criticism is destroying any human rights initiatives in North      Korea.       North Korea's military buildup has continued, which is      incomprehensible to anyone of sound judgement. It has      consistently carried out espionage activities to disrupt the      Republic of Korea. In the latter part of this year, they      dispatched two teams of armed agents to the South.       Their ``Reunification Through Revolution'' policy is a      combined strategy of underground sabotage and a full-scale      attack. Their war strategy is first to make an all-out      bliztkrieg in the front and rear simultaneously and end the      war before U.S. reinforcements arrive on the battlefield.       It is believed that North Korea's extensive stockpiling of      weapons testifies to their willingness to go to war. There      seems to be a consensus within North Korea that the      liberation of South Korea should be the ultimate policy goal      of the government and the only way to end its poverty and its      hopeless economic reality.       Whenever I hear something about the status of human rights      in North Korea, it sends a shiver down my spine.       I think it can be safely said that there are no human      rights in North Korea. There is certainly no freedom of      speech, no freedom of the press, no freedom of assembly, no      freedom of religion. The people of North Korea can not select      their own jobs, nor can they decide for themselves where to      live.       ``The Ten Fundamental Principles Concerning the Solid      Establishment of Juche Ideology'' proclaimed in 1974 is, in      fact, above the constitutional law as well as the criminal      codes in North Korea. Article 3, section 9 stipulates that      the ``Great Leader's'' and the ``Dear Leader's'' instructions      and the Labor Party's policies should be implemented without      fail. No compromise is allowed.       Even minor violations will result in death or incarceration      of the violators and his family in the gulag.       North Korea's obvious intention of manufacturing nuclear      arms and its possession of chemical weapons are a great      threat to the national security of the Republic of Korea.       North Koreans live in fear and dire poverty, struggling to      survive. They have lost the respect for the dignity of the      human being, and are indoctrinated to hate outsiders,      especially the so-called American imperialists and their      puppets.       Let me give you some examples. Without permission, North      Koreans are not allowed to change their residence or to      travel. As a result, North Koreans who have visited      Pyongyang, the capital city, constitute only 5% of the      population. 45% of the North Korean territory, including      military bases and seashores, is off limits to civilians.      They can not write letters and can not freely talk on the      phone even with their friends and relatives in North Korea.      They have no free access to television, radio, or newspapers      other than political propaganda.       There are more tragic stories. It has become known that      there are 50,000 residents in a concentration camp called      ``Camp 15'' located in Yuduck Kun, South Hamkyung province.      People are thrown into the camp without a judicial trial. In      the camp, there is believed to be a ``completely restricted      zone'' from which no one can get out once they have been sent      into it. This has been known to the outside world through the      statements of Mr. Ahn Hyeok and Mr. Kang Chul-Whan who      escaped from the camp in March 1992 and defected to South      Korea through China. People in the camp are treated as ``less      than animals,'' suffer forced labor, live in dire poverty,      and are exposed to various diseases. It has been reported      that 200,000 people, or 1% of the total 20 million people of      North Korea are confined in the inhumane detention camps      throughout North Korea.       It has been reported that the North Korean government      deported the handicapped and their families from the cities      of Pyongyang, Nampo, Gaesong, Chungjin where foreigners      frequent, to remote areas. It has also been reported that      there has been a nationwide campaign to ``dry out the seeds''      of dwarfs, that is, prevent the births of babies with such      birth defects.       There was the case of a North Korean who smuggled in a      large quantity of heroin and was found to be a staff member      of the Social Security Department of the government of North      Korea. This happened near Vladivostok, Russia in June 1994.      This shows the very nature of the collective leadership in      North Korea.       At the time North Korea was receiving 150,000 tons of rice      free-of-charge from South Korea, it captured the      ``Woosungyho'', a South Korean fishing vessel, which was a      drifting because of engine failure. The North Koreans killed      2 members of the crew and still refuse to return the other      fishermen on board the ship. North Korea also refuses to      return Reverend Ahn Seung Woon, who was kidnapped to the      North. As of now the total number of people kidnapped by the      North has reached 400.       There are 42,000 churches with 10 million Protestant      Christians and 3 million Catholics in the South but in the      North, only 2 Protestant churches and 1 Catholic church exist      and these are for exhibition purposes.       What more would we need to explain? There are no human      rights for North Koreans. They are treated as slaves, or no      better than disposable resources.       The North Korean leaders are nothing but a collective group      which uses violence as its main weapon. They rule through      suppression, violence and punishment with little regard for      human dignity.       As you all know there have been innumerable cases of human      rights violations in North Korea and I have presented just a      few. Any diplomatic relationship with North     Korea and any promise for economic aid would mean extending      support to a violent and inhumane regime which has no respect      for human rights. If we are to avoid the inadvertent support      for a dictatorial regime, we should be alert. Improvement of      the human rights situation in North Korea has to be a      prerequisite to the normalization of diplomatic relations.      Such improvements must include freedom of religion and      communication among the separated families.                         iv. concluding remarks       Ladies and gentlemen!       The North Korean leaders are manipulating the negotiation      process to create a breach between South Korea and the United      States. Cleverly taking advantage of Korean people's love for      peace by threatening a ``sea of fire'', they are attempting      to get what they want without any intention of improving      relations between the two Koreas.       ``The Korean peninsula is threatened by war'' is not simply      rhetoric but a reality. Especially if there is an unstable      political situation in the Republic of Korea any sign of      weakness in the Korea-U.S. security ties might encourage      North Korea to launch a war.       Korea is a country with optimism and vision. Korea will      overcome any adversities and suffering. Korea will not forget      its debt to its friends and allies.       Our nation is greatly indebted to the United States in our      march toward political freedom, economic development and      peace on the Korean peninsula. The people of the United      States fought the Korean War, shoulder to shoulder with us to      deter communist aggression; they provided aid when we were      poor and hungry; they opened their market for Korean      products.       The Korea-America Friendship Society was established in      1991 when anti-US sentiment was at its highest to remind      Korean citizens of who are our enemies and who are our      friends, and to help contribute to strengthening relations      between the two countries.       The United States has made enormous contributions to the      protection of freedom, the expansion of human rights, a free      market, and open societies throughout the world. I believe      these beautiful American traditions will be passed on to      future generations.       Because I am well aware of the importance of this      opportunity given to me, I have tried my best to make a      presentation as objectively as I can.       I sincerely request you to be cautious observers of the      real situation on the Korean peninsula, and offer your wise      judgments on what the United States should do for peace,      freedom justice and prosperity for the world as well as the      Korean peninsula.       Thank you very much.                          ____________________
