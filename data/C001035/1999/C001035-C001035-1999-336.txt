Of the several disclosures we require to be included in a mailing containing a sweepstakes or skill contest promotion, these two disclosures--that no purchase is necessary and that purchasing does not improve your chances of winning--are particularly important for the reader to see in a prominent way. The statements themselves should be clear and conspicuous, as required by the bill, and they should be prominent in three places in each mailing, so it would be very difficult for a recipient not to notice them.  A number of sweepstakes and skill contest promoters currently include in their mailings the statement that no purchase is necessary. But this is often included only as a part of a lengthy set of rules or buried in other statements and notices that allow it to be easily overlooked. That is why our managers' amendment includes the requirement that these two statements be prominent, and clearly and conspicuously displayed. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his assistance on this issue.                           Amendment No. 1497              (Purpose: To provide a managers' amendment)
