Mr. Speaker, I rise to submit a letter from 28 Members of Congress, and an enclosure from the National Physicians Center for Family Resources, requesting that the National Cancer Institute correct scientific inaccuracies in their Fact Sheet on the link between abortion and breast cancer. I commend the National Cancer Institute for the steps they have already taken to revisit their fact sheet and I look forward to a scientifically accurate fact sheet in the near future.                                Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2002.     Hon. Tommy Thompson,     Secretary of Health and Human Services, Department of Health          and Human Services, Hubert Humphrey Building, Washington,          DC       Dear Secretary Thompson: We write to request a review of      the National Cancer Institute (NCI) fact sheet FS #35.3,      labeled ``Abortion and Breast Cancer.'' As we work together      to make sure the American public has the most accurate and up      to date information on health risks, especially related to      the serious disease of breast cancer, we wanted to      specifically ask for a review of the official NCI information      on the link between abortion and breast cancer. Even though      this fact sheet was updated March 6th of this year, we      believe it is scientifically inaccurate and misleading to the      public.       Even though, to date, 28 out of 37 scientific studies      worldwide, and 13 out of 15 in the United States show a      positive association between abortion and breast cancer risk,      the NCI fact sheet on this topic emphatically states ``The      current body of scientific evidence suggests that women who      have had either induced or spontaneous abortions have the      same risk as other women for developing breast cancer.'' This      glossing over of the weight of published scientific evidence      does not provide the public with the information they      deserve.       Furthermore, it seems inappropriate for the NCI to rely so      heavily on one study to support its claims regarding abortion      and breast cancer. The NCI fact sheet relies on Melbye et      al., 1997, although that study contains many significant      flaws. In particular the Melbye study: misclassified 60,000      women as not having abortions when, in fact, the women did      undergo an abortion; included medical records that did not      consistently record a history of abortion; and, included over      350,000 women who were generally too young to be diagnosed      with breast cancer because their ages were twenty five years      of age and younger. We believe NCI has given this flawed      study too much weight and that the entire body of evidence      needs to revisited as soon as possible.       We respectfully request that the fact sheet be reevaluated      for accuracy and bias and that it be removed from the      Department website until that review is completed. We thank      you for your attention to this important health issue and to      our concerns about the NCI fact sheet on the link between      abortion and breast cancer.           Sincerely,         Christopher Smith; Joseph R. Pitts; John Shadegg; W. Todd            Akin; Joe Wilson; Robert B. Aderholt; Walter B. Jones;            Sue Myrick; Milissa A. Hart; Sam Johnson; Roscoe G.            Bartlett; Todd Tiahrt; Pete Hoekstra; Bob Schaffer;            Mike Pence; Gil Gutknecht; Van Hilleary; Henry E.

Hostettler;            JoAnn Davis; Ernest Istook; Cliff Stearns.                                  ____  National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet Analysis, The Abortion--Breast   Cancer Connection (ABC Link), National Physicians Center for Family                       Resources (NPC), April, 2002       Overall tone of denial of abc link: ``. . . it appears that      there is no overall association between spontaneous or      induced abortion and breast cancer risk, . . .'', even      though, to date, 28 out of 37 studies worldwide and 13 out of      15 in the U.S. report a positive association.       Confusion of induced and spontaneous abortion: These two      terms appear together repeatedly, as if they are equivalent.      Never is the proper equation of spontaneous abortion and      miscarriage made; in fact, the word miscarriage never      appears. Yet paradoxically, the ``inability to separate      induced from spontaneous abortions'' is offered as a      criticism of earlier studies on the abc link.       Misrepresentation of the published medical literature on      the abc link:       (a) A key study on American women which relied on      prospective medical records (Howe et al., 1989), and which      found a significant abc link (overall RR = 1.9), is not cited      at all, even though much more weight is given to data ``from      studies that collected data on abortion history before the      breast cancers occurred'', and even though it is presented as      a weakness that ``Most of the early studies relied on self-     reports of induced abortion''.       (b) The study specifically funded by the NCI to examine the      abc link (Daling et al., 1994), which study reported a      significant overall link (RR = 1.5) and much higher risks for      teenagers (RR = 2.5) and actually reported ``RR = [squ]'' for      teenagers with any family history of breast cancer, is not      cited at all.       (c) The only comprehensive review and meta-analysis on the      abc link (Brind et al., 1996), which reported a positive      association in 18 out of 23 studies worldwide (9 out of 10 in      the US), is not cited at all.       Reliance on flawed studies which do not show an abc link,      merely because they are based on prospective data, namely:       (a) the study by Melbye et al., 1997, even though it      misclassified 60,000 abortion-positive women as abortion      negative, used breast cancer records which antedated abortion      records, and included over 350,000 women under age 25, among      other flaws;       (b) the study by Goldacre et al., 2001, even though it      misclassified over 90 percent of the abortion-positive women      in the study as abortion-negative;       (c) the null studies by Newcomb and Mandelson (2000) and      Lazovich (2000), even though both are so small (23 and 26      patients with induced abortion, respectively) and of such low      statistical power that neither could even detect a RR as low      as 1.5 with statistical significance.       Inclusion of inaccurate statements, i.e.:       (a) ``In three of the (four) studies, information was based      on medical records than on the woman's self-report;''. In      fact, this is true of only two (i.e., Goldacre and Newcomb &      Mandelson) of the four studies referred to.       (b) ``The strength of this study (Melbye 1997) include . .      . the ability to account for breast cancer risk factors that      may differ between those women who have had abortions and      those who have not,''. In fact, the lack of such data on      potential confounders was a weakness of the Melbye study,      which only adjusted for age and age at first term pregnancy.      Most studies also adjust for age at menarche, age at      menopause, etc.       (c) ``Most of the early studies necessarily relied on self-     reports of induced abortion, which have been shown to differ      between breast cancer patients and other women.'' In fact,      the opposite is true. Even the only study cited on the fact      sheet which examined this question reported: ``The authors'      data do not suggest that controls are more reluctant to      report a history of induced abortion than are women with      breast cancer.''       Disguising the established breast cancer risk factor that      is directly affected by abortion in a substantial proportion      of abortion patients, i.e.: ``Well established breast cancer      risk factors include . . . a late age at the time of the      first birth of a full-term baby''. Abortion, which, in      childless girls and women, necessarily delays the first full-     term pregnancy, is not mentioned at all in this context.                               ____________________
