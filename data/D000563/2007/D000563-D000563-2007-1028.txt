President, I urge my colleagues to support the Homeland Security Education Act. This bill encourages initiatives to increase the number of Americans trained in science, technology, engineering, math, and foreign languages.  More than a century ago, Henry Ford revolutionized transportation and industry with the creation of the Model T. This car and the process designed to create it were so innovative that it was copied by every other company. The Model T became the base model for all cars that followed. This is a classic American story. Some of the most important scientific breakthroughs in modern history have occurred in the labs, workshops, and classrooms of America. We take pride in our Nation's ability to meet any challenge and solve any problem with innovation and discovery. But we are falling behind. Today's innovations in the auto industry come not from Detroit but from Japan. Engineers in Asia are designing tomorrow's hybrid car while Henry Ford's company and other American companies are just trying to keep up.  America's colleges and universities can play an important role in reversing the decline in American innovation. The United States graduates some of the world's best engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, but a far higher proportion of the students in China, India, South Korea, and Japan are focusing on these fields. The National Academies of Science reports that in 2004, only 32 percent of the undergraduate degrees awarded in the United States were in science or engineering compared to 59 percent in China and 66 percent in Japan. If we do not address this crisis soon, China, India, and Japan will become the new centers for scientific and technological innovation, while American workers scramble to keep up. We must act now to ensure that America remains the world's economic, scientific, and technological leader.  American workers are also increasingly finding themselves at a disadvantage in a multilingual global community. In our increasingly global economy and with a heightened concern for security in the post-911 world, we need Americans who can speak a foreign language. Only 9 percent of American students enroll in a foreign language course in college. We especially need to focus on less commonly taught languages, including Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, and Korean, and other languages that are of particular value in the world today.  The best place to address both of these concerns is in the classroom. We must adapt our educational system by providing the teachers and resources needed to encourage students to study science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and foreign languages. The Homeland Security Education Act is an important step in the right direction.  This bill would encourage students to pursue math, science, technology, engineering, and critical foreign languages by providing them with $5,000 scholarships. Scientists, engineers, technology professionals, and those fluent in foreign languages would be encouraged to return to the classroom and use their career experiences to inspire students in high-need or low-income schools. New grant programs would encourage educational institutions, public entities, and businesses to enter into partnerships that improve math and science curricula, establish programs that promote students' foreign language proficiency along with their science and technological knowledge, and create and establish foreign language pathways from elementary school through college. Finally, the bill would fund a student loan repayment program for qualified individuals trained in science, technology, engineering, math, and foreign languages who join the Federal workforce.  Our country is quickly approaching a crisis of competitiveness. To avoid falling behind our international competitors in science and innovation, we must confront this problem immediately in our schools. We need to strengthen our students' proficiency in science, technology, engineering, math, and foreign languages and provide them with the incentives necessary to pursue careers in those fields. Today's students are tomorrow's innovators, scientists, and technology leaders, and we can't afford not to invest in them. I encourage my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring the Homeland Security Education Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1294       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Education      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Investing in science, technology, engineering,      mathematics, and foreign language education is essential to      maintaining the competitive advantage and national security      of the United States. Significant improvements in the      quantity and quality of science, technology, engineering,      mathematics, and foreign language instruction offered in      United States elementary schools and secondary schools are      necessary.       (2) For the past 3 decades, about one-third of the      baccalaureate degrees awarded in the United States have been      granted in science and engineering, compared to 59 percent in      China and 66 percent in Japan.       (3) The United States is behind its European counterparts      in foreign language skills, in that one-half of European      citizens speak a second language while only 9 percent of      Americans speak another language.       (4) Elementary schools and secondary schools in the United      States need more qualified teachers, equipment, and resources      to improve education in mathematics, science, and foreign      languages.       (5) The optimum time to begin learning a second language is      in elementary school, when children have the ability to learn      and excel in several foreign language acquisition skills,      including pronunciation.       (6) Foreign language study can increase children's capacity      for critical and creative thinking skills, and children who      study a second language show greater cognitive development in      areas such as mental flexibility, creativity, tolerance, and      higher order thinking skills.       (7) All people of the United States should strive to have a      global perspective. To understand the world around us, we      must acquaint ourselves with the languages, cultures, and      history of other nations.       (8) Federal agencies have reported shortfalls in language      capability that is integral to, or directly supports, every      discipline and is an essential factor in national security      readiness, disaster response, law enforcement, information      superiority, and coalition peacekeeping or warfighting      missions.       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to ensure the      national security and the competitiveness of the United      States through increasing the quantity, diversity, and      quality of the teaching and learning of subjects in the      fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and      foreign language.
