Certainly, my State of Oklahoma is not the only State that has bridges and road problems.  Another good thing we are waiting on--and I feel very confident we are going to be able to pass this out of the Senate--is the pilots' bill of rights, which we are in the process of, hopefully, getting done. When that time comes, I would like to be recognized to talk about some of the great extensions of justice to people who have been denied that justice heretofore just because they happen to be pilots.  I will yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
