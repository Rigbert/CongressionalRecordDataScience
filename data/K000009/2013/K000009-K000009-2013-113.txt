 Obviously, I rise in support of the amendment. Also, I just wanted to say on the record to the Corps, it would be wonderful if somebody over at the Corps had a map and they took all of the watersheds of the Great Lakes and they put them all together and then the staff for the Great Lakes would be located somewhere in those watersheds, because right now, that isn't the case. And it causes us all kinds of bloody problems up in our part of the world where we do adjoin Canada up there. You know, there's another country north of us. It has been so hard toget them to recognize the coastline that you described. And so this is my moment to vent a little bit on the floor and say: Hello, Corps. We're out there.  I happen to represent the largest watershed in the Great Lakes, and we really need the Corps' focus on the most important freshwater system that exists on the face of the Earth. Twenty percent of the freshwater on the globe, surface freshwater, is up in our region. And it always seems like it's never together. It's never together. So the gentleman's amendment helps to focus a little bit on this, but the challenge goes beyond just this amendment.  I know the Corps will hear us, and I know as they talk about restructuring, meeting budget realities, they will view us as a system that is important to think of as a whole, not just in little pieces and dangling particles and things that happen out there, but rather as an extraordinarily important water system for our continent and for our world.  So I wanted the opportunity to say that on the record, and I thank Congressman Higgins for his leadership, and I thank the chairman for his understanding. We in the Great Lakes region face our own set of issues, and we need the Corps' full cooperation. I ask my colleagues to support the Higgins amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment No. 32 Offered by Mr. Walberg
