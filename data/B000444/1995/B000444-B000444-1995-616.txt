 Let us talk about how people back home do it.  Now, let us just look at what the Senator said. He said States have debt. Well, they have debt. We are just saying we should not have any debt. But he is saying--let us get this straight--we are going to collect in taxes in New Jersey as we collect in taxes federally from the FICA tax for Social Security and the income tax and excise tax and all the other taxes, the State of New Jersey, the State of Delaware, the State of Illinois, the State of Utah, we are going to collect this money. Now, under the system that they are setting up, the total amount of money we collect cannot be less than the money we pay out. Right? OK, so far so good. New Jersey does the same thing. But what we are doing in our unified budget is we are spending the Social Security pensioners' money.
