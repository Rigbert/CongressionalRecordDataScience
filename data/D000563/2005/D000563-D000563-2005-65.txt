It is interesting to me, the passions that many of our colleagues bring to the fight of protecting a person's money--which is an important part of our job--but when it comes to protecting our freedoms, I don't see the same level of passionate commitment. I hope we will see that change during the course of this debate. But I think Americans value their freedoms very much.  I always recall, as a practicing attorney, how many people would be dismissive of criminal procedures to protect defendants until it was their teenage son or daughter who was arrested and then they came to their attorney and said, What can we do? What does the law provide to protect us?  I think we should all be sensitive to that fact.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
