 President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely right. This is outrageous. We have the Department of Education pointing fingers at Congress when they can make a ruling and stop this practice today. According to all accounts, the delay of this is costing billions of dollars. If we wait for Congress to act on reauthorization of the act 6 months or longer from now, taxpayers are going to lose $2.8 billion in interest payments. We are in the Senate where we know that access to Head Start is critical, we know access to college is critical, and we know that $2.8 billion sent to the bank today means students are not getting higher education.
