President, online consumer purchases are poised to explode to more than $300 billion early in the next Century. But the goldrush in cyberbuying is likely to carry along with it a boom in cyberfraud. Congress can help head-off this cybercrime by extending our current telemarketing laws to encompass fraud on the Net.  In response to the staggering $40 billion consumers lose in telephone fraud each year, Congress earlier this summer passed the 1998 Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I strongly supported that effort. The new law builds upon the four federal laws enacted since the early 1990s that deal directly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffens penalties for telemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially for crimes against the elderly, requires criminal forfeiture to ensure the booty of telemarketing crime is not used to commit further fraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones compensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing fraud penalties so that prosecutors can find the masterminds behind the boiler rooms, and will help law enforcement zero in on quick-strike fraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly against suspected fraud.  The 1998 law is a good step forward but it's not enough to deal with today's digital economy. As more Americans go online, cyberscams are bound to proliferate. The Congressional crackdown on telemarketing fraud will only encourage cyberscammers to migrate to the Net unless the law gets there first. That is the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today.  The Telemarketing Fraud and Seniors Protection Act simply extends current law against telemarketing fraud to include the same crimes committed over the Internet. The approach expands the existing law applicable to mail, telephone, wire, and television fraud to fraud over the Internet, and its enforcement would follow the same division of labor there is today between the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. The bill would apply the same tough penalties that Congress enacted earlier this year to cyberscams. The growth of Internet telephony makes it more attractive for cyberscammers to set up shop offshore, beyond the reach of U.S. law. My bill would address this problem by allowing law enforcement to freeze the assets and deny entry to the United States of those convicted of cyberfraud.  The bill takes special aim against those attempt to defraud one of our most vulnerable groups--our senior citizens. Seniors are the target for more than 50 percent of telemarketing fraud. Although telemarketers convicted of fraud face stiff penalties--a minimum of 5-10 years in jail and restitution payments to their victims, we also need to better educate and inform senior citizens on how to avoid becoming victims of telemarketing fraud in the first place, and how to assist law enforcement in catching the perpetrators.  The legislation would also authorize the Administration on Aging, through its network of area agencies of aging, to conduct an outreach program to senior citizens on telemarketing fraud. Seniors would be advised against providing their credit card number, bank account or other personal information unless they had initiated the call unsolicited. They would also be informed of their consumer protection rights and any toll-free numbers and other resources to report suspected illegal telemarketing.  Mr. President, the Federal Trade Commission is off to a good start against cyberscammers. Some of the operations the FTC has targeted are not companies at all, but merely websites that promise consumers everything from huge new consulting contracts to the elimination of bad credit reports. They may use scare tactics to frighten consumers into sending important personal financial information and hundreds of dollars for services the consumer will never see, or attempt to lure consumers with the promise of help them cash in on the Internet explosion. The FTC also has a strong operation going against junk e-mailers. My legislation will complement and strengthen the FTC's effort to target telemarketing fraud over the Internet and especially when such fraud is aimed at seniors.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this important legislation, and ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2587       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,             TITLE I--TELEMARKETING FRAUD OVER THE INTERNET     SECTION 101. EXTENSION OF CRIMINAL FRAUD STATUTE TO INTERNET.       Section 1343 of title 18, United States Code, is amended      by----       (1) striking ``or television communication'' and inserting      ``television communication or the Internet''; and       (2) adding at the end thereof the following: ``For purposes      of this section, the term `Internet' means collectively the      myriad of computer and telecommunications facilities,      including equipment and operating software, which comprise      the interconnected world-wide network of networks that employ      the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or any      predecessor or successor protocols to such protocol, to      communicate information of all kinds by wire or radio.''.     SEC. 102. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SANCTIONS.       The Federal Trade Commission shall initiate a rulemaking      proceeding to set forth the application of section 5 of the      Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45) and other      statutory provisions within its jurisdiction to deceptive      acts or practices in or affecting the commerce of the United      States in connection with the promotion, advertisement,      offering for sale, or sale of goods or services through use      of the Internet, including the initiation, transmission, and      receipt of unsolicited commercial electronic mail. For      purposes of this section, the term `Internet' means      collectively the myriad of computer and telecommunications      facilities, including equipment and operating software, which      comprise the interconnected worldwide network of networks      that employ the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet      Protocol, or any predecessor or successor protocols to such      protocol, to communicate information of all kinds by wire or      radio.
