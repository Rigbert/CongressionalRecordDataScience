 I say, at this point in time, we have three or four amendments before the Senate on health care reform. We started the debate on Monday. We are now wrapping up Wednesday. We are about to go into the 4th day of the debate on one of the most important bills in the history of the U.S. Senate, and we have yet to reach an agreement with the Republican side of the aisle to have the amendments voted on.  If we are only doing four amendments or three amendments in 4 days, this is not going to be the kind of debate the American people expected. They expected us to bring issues before the floor here, debate them, with a reasonable period of time, and then vote and move to another issue. Certainly, there are a lot of things to talk about.  So I hope the Republican side of the aisle will have a change of heart and will start to join us in this dialog, will offer their amendments in a timely fashion--we will give them their opportunity to debate them--and then bring them to a vote. But the fact is, we have not had a single vote this week on health care reform amendments because of objections from the other side. That is not in the interest of moving forward this important legislation and giving Members an opportunity to present their amendments and have them voted on in a timely fashion.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
