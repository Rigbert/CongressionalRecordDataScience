President, I rise to introduce, with my good friend Senator Hatch, the Federal Prosecutors' Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2001. This bill would correct an inequity that exists under current law, whereby Federal prosecutors receive substantially less favorable retirement benefits than other nearly all other people involved in the Federal criminal justice system. The bill would increase the retirement benefits given to Assistant United States Attorneys by including them as ``law enforcement officers'' ``LEOs'', under the Federal Employees' Retirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System. The bill would also allow the Attorney General to designate other attorneys employed by the Department of Justice who act primarily as criminal prosecutors as LEO's for purposes of receiving these retirement benefits.  The primary reason for granting enhanced retirement benefits to LEOs is the often dangerous work of law enforcement. Currently, Assistant United States Attorneys, ``AUSAs'', and other Federal prosecutors are not eligible for these enhanced benefits, which are enjoyed by the vast majority of other employees in the criminal justice system. This exclusion is unjustified. The relevant provisions of the United States Code dealing with retirement benefits define an LEO as an employee whose duties are, ``primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention'' of individuals suspected or convicted of violating Federal law. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331(20) and 8401(17). AUSAs and other Federal prosecutors participate in planning investigations, interviewing witnesses both inside and outside of the office setting, debriefing defendants, obtaining warrants, negotiating plea agreements and representing the government at trials and sentencings, all of which fall within the definition of the duties performed by law enforcement officers. Indeed, once a defendant is brought into the criminal justice system, the person with whom they have the most fact-to-face contact, and often in an extremely confrontational environment, is the Federal prosecutor.  Although prosecutors do not personally execute arrests, searches and other physically dangerous activities, LEO status is accorded to many criminal justice employees who do not perform such tasks, such as pretrial services officers and probation officers and accountants, cooks and secretaries of the Bureau of Prisons. Moreover, because they are often the most conspicuous representatives of the government in the criminal justice system, Federal prosecutors are natural targets for threats of reprisals by vengeful criminals. Indeed, there are numerous incidents in which assaults and serious death threats have been made against Federal prosecutors, sometimes resulting in significant disruption of their personal and family lives.  Only recently a veteran Federal prosecutor in the Western District of Washington was murdered in his home, and, although the crime remains unsolved, based upon the facts of the case the authorities have referred to the crime as a hit. In addition, I have received many other accounts from Federal prosecutors regarding specific threats to which they and their families have been subjected because of the performance of their duties. Federal prosecutors have written to me that they have been forced to relocate themselves and their families due to death threats; that they have been assaulted; that they and their families have been followed by members of criminal organizations; that have been forced to install security systems at their homes and to change their routes to and from the office to protect their safety and the safety of their families.  As our war against terrorism continues, Federal prosecutors will be on the front lines once again as the symbols of our criminal justice system, andunfortunately therefore the targets of those who seek its downfall. Among other tasks, the Attorney General has designated AUSA's to play a major role working with police and Federal agents in forming each judicial district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force. One Federal prosecutors wrote to me stating that shortly after his name was in the local news as heading his district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force and he had spoken to his family about taking suitable precautions, that his young son came into his bedroom one night holding a hockey stick for protection asking about their safety. Thus, Federal prosecutors and their families will deal more than ever with a level of stress and danger that justifies their being treated as LEOs.  Enhanced retirement benefits are also justified by the Federal Government's need for experienced prosecutors to bring ever more sophisticated cases under increasingly complex Federal criminal laws. In recent years, we have seen the growth of complex Federal prosecutors to combat the threats posed by organized crime, drug cartels, terrorist groups and other sophisticated criminals. The prosecution of such difficult cases is best handled by experienced prosecutors. It is therefore in the public interest to provide reasonable financial incentives for talented, experienced prosecutors to remain in government service.  This bill would make Assistant United States Attorneys and other Federal prosecutors designated by the Attorney General eligible for immediate, unreduced retirement benefits at age 50 with 20 years of service. For example, prosecutors who are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System would receive 50 percent of the average of their three highest years' salary. At the same time, it would exempt prosecutors from the mandatory retirement provisions that require other law enforcement officers to retire at age 57. Because the loss of physical strength and agility does not adversely affect a person's ability to function as a prosecutor, there is no reason to mandate early retirement.  Two important features of this bill will contain its costs. First, the bill provides that incumbent Federal prosecutors are themselves responsible for making up the difference in individual contributions owed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for their prior service. An incumbent has the choice of making up this difference either by making a payment up front or by accepting a reduction in retirement benefits. Second, government contributions for the prior service of incumbents are made ratably over a ten-year period under this bill. Thus, payments for prior government contributions are spread out to lessen the financial impact. These two provisions will insure that the cost of the bill is kept well within reasons.  This bill enjoys broad, grass root support. In the last month alone, I have received literally hundreds of letters supporting this bill, sent from over 40 States, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The bill also enjoys support in the law enforcement community. The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, the Federal Criminal Investigators Association, and the Southern States Police Benevolent Association have all written me to voice support for the inclusion of AUSAs in the definition of an LEO.  In addition, I know that other Senators, including Senator Mikulski, are considering additional measures to expand these same retirement benefits to other Federal employees who perform law enforcement functions, including IRS employees whose primary duty is to collect delinquent taxes. I support and commend their leadership in bringing these matters to the forefront.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Hatch, and I urge its swift enactment into law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record along with a sectional analysis.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1828       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Short title. Contains the short title, the      ``Federal Prosecutors Retirement Benefit Equity Act of      2001.''       Sec. 2. Inclusion of Federal prosecutors in the definition      of a law enforcement officer. Amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331      and 8401 to extend the enhanced law enforcement officer      (``LEO'') retirement benefits to Federal prosecutors, defined      to include assistant United States attorneys (``AUSAs'') and      such other attorneys in the Department of Justice as are      designated by the Attorney General of the United States. This      section also exempts Federal prosecutors from mandatory      retirement provisions for LEO's under the civil service laws.       Sec. 3. Provisions relating to incumbents. Governs the      treatment of incumbent federal prosecutors who would be      eligible for LEO retirement benefits under this Act. This      section requires the Office of Personnel Management to      provide notice to incumbents of their rights under this      subtitle; allows incumbents to opt out of the LEO retirement      program; governs the crediting of prior service by      incumbents; and provides for make-up contributions for prior      service of incumbents to the Civil Service Retirement and      Disability Fund. The section gives incumbents the option of      either contributing their own share of any make-up      contributions or receiving a proportionally lesser retirement      benefit. The section allows the government to contribute its      share of any make-up contribution ratably over a ten year      period.       Sec. 4. Department of Justice administrative actions.      Allows the Attorney General to designate additional      Department of Justice attorneys with substantially similar      responsibilities, in addition to assistant United States      attorneys, as Federal prosecutors for purposes of this Act      and thus be eligible for the LEO retirement benefits.                          ____________________
