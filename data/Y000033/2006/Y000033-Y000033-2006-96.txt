I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 889, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006.  This bill authorizes $8.7 billion in funding for the Coast Guard, including $1.6 billion for the recapitalization of Coast Guard vessels, aircraft and support systems.  Funding at this level would result in the acceleration of the Deepwater program and would provide a new, more capable fleet to support the Coast Guard's many traditional and homeland security missions.  The conference report also includes provisions related to Coast Guard's response in the regions that were affected last year by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and the impacts of the storms on the maritime industry.  The conference report also requires safety inspection for passenger ferries, makes it easier to prosecute illegal drug smugglers, encourages the construction and use of U.S. flag liquefied natural gas vessels, enhances maritime security by increasing penalties for violations of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, and adjusts oil spill liability limits for the first time since the Oil Pollution Act was passed in 1990.  H.R. 889 also includes legislation passed by the House as H.R. 1412, the Delaware River Protection Act.  This bill was introduced by the Coast Guard Subcommittee chairman, our colleague from New Jersey, Mr. Frank LoBiondo. I commend him for his hard work on this measure.  H.R. 889 is a truly bipartisan bill and deserves the support of each Member of this House.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
