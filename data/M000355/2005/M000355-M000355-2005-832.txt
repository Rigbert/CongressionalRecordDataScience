 President, we have several cleared amendments to the State, Foreign Operations bill which I send to the desk and ask for immediate consideration en bloc.  There is one on behalf of Senator Martinez regarding the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy; by Senator Leahy, a technical amendment; for myself regarding activities of OPIC in Libya; three Leahy amendments, two technicals and an amendment regarding assistance to Pakistan; a Leahy amendment regarding assistance for the North Caucus.  All of these amendments have been cleared on both sides. I ask for their immediate consideration.
