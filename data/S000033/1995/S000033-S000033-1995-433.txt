 Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for her leadership over the years. It is a pleasure to work with the gentleman from Oregon, Pete DeFazio, as well as other Members of the Congress. I am delighted to join with my colleagues today in supporting legislation which would repeal the NAFTA agreement that Congress passed last year.  When Congress passed NAFTA last year we were told that this trade agreement would be a step forward for both the economy of the United States and the economy of Mexico. We were told that it would be a win-win situation.  Unfortunately, 1 year later it appears to be a lose-lose agreement. Today up to 50,000 American workers have lost their jobs as a result of NAFTA and have filed for NAFTA trade-assistance benefits. The Mexican economy today is staggering and wages in Mexico are plummeting. Most alarmingly, is in the last few weeks the United States Treasury Department has opened up a $9 billion line of credit in order to shore up the sinking Mexican peso and they have encouraged United States commercial banks to lend additional billions of dollars to shore up the peso, all of which could very well lead to a disaster for the American taxpayer who ultimately could be asked to pick up the damage.  It seems to me that what NAFTA is about is a continuation of a trade policy in this country which has been very unfortunate for the average American worker.  Today in this country, and we do not talk about this terribly often, we have a $150 billion trade deficit. With NAFTA that deficit is becoming worse. I feel that GATT will only accelerate that problem.  Economists tell us that for every $1 billion in trade we create some 20,000 jobs. That means that with $150 billion trade deficit we are looking at the loss of 3 million jobs.  Second of all, when we look at the economy in America today, there are people who say the economy is doing fine, we are creating new jobs. The point to make is what kind of new jobs are we creating, what kind of old jobs are we losing?  The new jobs that we are creating are, by and large, low-wage, part-time, temporary jobs that often have no benefits at all. The manufacturing jobs we are losing, in agreements like NAFTA, are decent-paying jobs that have good benefits.                              {time}  1500  That process of losing decent-paying manufacturing jobs and replacing them with low-wage, part-time, service-industry jobs is one of the reasons that the average American worker is seeing a major decline in his or her standard of living. It seems to me that the beneficiaries of the NAFTA agreement, and as you will recall, I say to the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur], the [[Page H214]] people who pushed hardest for this agreement will be the major multinational corporations in America who will take our jobs to Mexico where they can pay people a dollar an hour, or today with the devaluation of the peso even less.  Who are we kidding? Why will large corporations pay American workers $10 an hour, provide decent benefits, have to protect the environment, when they can go to Mexico and get the unfortunate and desperate Mexican workers to work for substandard wages, when they can go to China and hire people in an authoritarian society at 20 cents an hour?  I think it is absolutely appropriate that we in Congress demand the repeal of NAFTA, that we make certain that the American taxpayers are not stuck with a billion dollar bill in trying to shore up the peso or protecting American banks who are lending the Mexican Government money, and I also think it is very appropriate that we begin to take a fundamental and hard look at our entire trade policy, which has worked to benefit large corporations but has worked detrimentally to the needs of the average American worker. So I think that we are doing something that is important.  I hope that we will gather more and more support from Members of Congress to stand up, to repeal NAFTA, and to reverse our trade policies.
