 President, I rise in support of Senator Bond's amendment to establish a full-time IRS Board of Governors. I firmly believe that oversight of an agency with the equivalent of 100,000 full-time employees, a requested fiscal year 1999 budget of almost $8.2 billion, and a history of wasting $4 billion in an attempt to modernize the tax collection system, is, without question, a full time job.  Furthermore, rigorous oversight will be critical to ensuring that the reforms that Congress has in store for the agency will be carried out effectively and expeditiously. I think the prudent strategy is to keep the agency on very short leash given the shocking stories that have come to light from the recent Finance Committee hearings. I have my own ideas as to how to liberate the taxpayer from the IRS--namely the implementation of my flat-tax proposal. But short of comprehensive tax simplification, I strongly support Senator Bond's efforts.  Mr. President, the IRS is a very troubled agency that demands the highest level of scrutiny. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I feel we owe it to the American taxpayer.
