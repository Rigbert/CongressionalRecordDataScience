I thought he was about to bring something up. I hope he would not put in a quorum call. I would like to speak about some of the matters that may be coming up later. I have been talking with him and Senator Reid and Senator Levin. If it becomes ripe to make that agreement, naturally I would yield the floor immediately as I did for the chairman. But I find in the joys of allergies, my voice is fast disappearing and I would like to speak now while I know I can so speak.
