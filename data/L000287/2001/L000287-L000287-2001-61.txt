Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues, I rise today to pay tribute to the brave and courageous men and women and a few young children that attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery 36 years ago today, March 7, 1965.  Just think, Mr. Speaker, 36 years ago, in many parts of the American South, 11 States of the Old Confederacy, from Virginia to Texas it was almost impossible for people of color toregister to vote. As a matter of fact, in a State like the State of Mississippi, in 1965 the State had a black voting-age population of more than 450,000 and only about 16,000 blacks were registered to vote. There was one county in Alabama, between Selma and Montgomery, Lowndes County, where the county was more than 80 percent African American; yet there was not a single registered African American voter in the county. In the little county of Selma, only 2.1 percent of blacks of voting age were registered to vote.  People of color not only had to pay a poll tax, they had to pass a so-called literacy test. Interpreting sections of the Constitution of the United States, the constitution of the State of Alabama, the constitution of the State of Georgia and the State of Mississippi, there were black men and women teaching in colleges and universities, black lawyers and black doctors being told they could not read or write well enough. On one occasion, a black man had a Ph.D. degree in philosophical theology and he flunked a so-called literacy test. On another occasion, a man was asked to give the number of bubbles in a bar of soap.  The drive, the movement for the right to vote came to a head in Selma, Alabama. For many months people had gone down to the courthouse to be turned back. They were arrested. Some were jailed. On March 7, 1965, about 600 black men and women, and a few young children, attempted to march from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, to the State capital, to dramatize to the Nation and to the world that people of color wanted to register to vote. They were beaten with night sticks, bull whips, trampled by horses, and tear gassed.  That day became known as Bloody Sunday. There was a sense of righteous indignation all across America when people saw what happened to these 600 men and women and young children in Selma. Eight days later, after what became known as Bloody Sunday, President Johnson came to this hall and spoke to a joint session of the Congress, and he started that speech off on March 15, 1965, by saying: ``I speak tonight for the dignity of man and for the destiny of democracy.'' President Johnson went on to say: ``At times, history and fate come together to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. So it was more than a century ago at Lexington and at Concord. So it was at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.''  And in that speech on March 15, 1965, President Johnson condemned the violence in Selma, introduced the Voting Rights Act; and before he closed that speech he said over and over again: ``And we shall overcome.'' The Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, and it was signed into law on August 6, 1965, 36 years ago.  Because of the courage of these men and women and these young children, Mr. Speaker, we have witnessed a nonviolent revolution in America, a revolution of values, a revolution of ideas. Because of this march, because of this attempted march, we are on our way toward the building of what I like to call the ``beloved community,'' toward the building of a truly interracial democracy. By marching, by standing up, these young men and women, these young children, on March 7, 1965, and the Members of Congress back in 1965, helped to expand our democracy, helped to open up the democratic process and let hundreds of thousands and millions of our citizens come in.  We live in a better country. We live in a better place because a few men and women and a few young children got in, what I call, the way to make America different, to make America better. Today, Mr. Speaker, I stand here to salute these brave men and women, men and women, with courage, who dared to sail against the wind on March 7, 1965.                          ____________________
