Speaker, I rise today to honor Goddard Space Flight Center on its 40th anniversary. Established in 1959, Goddard has played a vital role in furthering the goals of our space program. Whether in the field of Earth science, space or space communication, Goddard is a leader in furthering our knowledge and understanding of the last frontier.  Named after Dr. Robert H. Goddard, a pioneer in rocket research, the center employs some of the world's most renowned scientists and engineers. Located on 1,270 acres in Greenbelt, Maryland, Goddard is a major employer in Prince George's County with almost 12,000 civilian and contractor employees.  Through the years, Goddard has been a leader in many of NASA's most successful programs. Beginning in 1959 as the project manager for Explorer VI, Goddard's scientists beamed down the first images of the Earth for the world to see. Since that historic mission, Goddard has gone on to lead projects like studying aspects of the Earth's environment through the Earth Science Enterprise. By linking together the data of various satellites, the program has been able to monitor land-surface, biosphere, atmosphere and oceans. Joint projects like the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, coordinated with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are providing important information on the expanse of the Antarctic ozone hole. And Goddard is working with Japanese scientists from the Japanese National Space Developmental Agency to measure tropical and subtropical rainfall through the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission. Goddard is also home to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center, the command center for the Hubble Space Telescope. Not only did Goddard project managers and engineers play a major role in designing the telescope, but they continue to provide expertise in serving Hubble and providing round-the-clock monitoring of the telescope's images and data.  I am proud to have played a role in working with the Maryland congressional delegation and members of the Goddard community in saving the center from closure in 1996. The work that Goddard personnel perform benefits every American and nations around the globe. I look forward to continuing to work with the Goddard community to promote and protect its vital interests and the region's space and technology industries.  Goddard's forty-first year of operation is certain to produce new and exciting advances in space and earth science. Several launches of Goddard programs are planned this year. The GOES-L meteorological satellite will allow meteorologists to improve local forecasts while the FUSE satellite, in collaboration with Johns Hopkins University, will explore the Universe through high-resolution spectroscopy.  I congratulate Goddard Space Flight Center on its leadership not only in space technology and science, but as a leader in the community as well. Whether through educational programs to area schools and universities or through outreach to Goddard's contracting community through the Goddard Alliance, Goddard is an incredible asset to Maryland, our Nation, and world-wide.  Congratulations on forty years of excellence and best wishes for the future.                          ____________________
