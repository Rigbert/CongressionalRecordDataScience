President, I am glad to see that the Senate is finally turning its attention to the nomination of Christina Snyder. She was first nominated in May 1996, over 17 months ago. Her hearing was finally held in July of this year and after another 2-month delay, she was reported by the Judiciary Committee without objection. She has been pending on the Senate Calendar without action and without any explanation for the 2-month delay that has since ensued.  It seems that the delay in considering her nomination had nothing to do with her outstanding qualifications or temperament or ability to serve as a Federal judge. Rather, it seems that some opposed this fine woman and held up her nomination to a very busy court because she had encouraged lawyers to be involved in pro bono activities.  Ms. Snyder has been held up anonymously for months and months. When the Judiciary Committee finally met to consider her nomination, I was curious to learn who and what had delayed her confirmation for over a year. But no one spoke against her and no one voted against her.  Ms. Snyder has been an outstanding lawyer, a member of the American Law Institute, and someone who contributes to the community and has lived the ethical consideration under Canon 2 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. I congratulate her on her outstanding career.  When she was being interrogated about her membership on the boards of Public Counsel and the Western Center on Law and Public Interest, Senator Feingold properly observed:       [I]t is kind of an irony when we get to the day where if      you don't participate in pro bono activities, you are somehow      in a situation where your record is a little safer vis a vis      being appointed to a Federal judgeship. And then when you get      involved in pro bono activity, that might actually cause you      to get a few more questions. . . . [T]hat can't be an      encouragement for lawyers to get involved in pro bono      activities on behalf of people who don't have the ability to      go to court very easily.  After all these months, I was please to hear Senator Sessions pronounce Ms. Snyder ``an outstanding individual with a fine record'' and ``a capable lawyer of integrity and ability,'' when her nomination was considered by the Judiciary Committee.  I congratulate Ms. Snyder and her family and look forward to her service on the Federal court.  Although I am delighted that the Senate will today be confirming Christina Snyder as a Federal district court judge, the Republican leadership has once again passed over and refused to take up the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, having languished on the Senate Calendar since June 12.  The central district of California desperately needs this vacancy filled, which has been open for more than 18 months, and Margaret Morrow is eminently qualified to fill it. Thus, while the Senate is finally proceeded to fill one of the judicial emergency vacancies that has plagued the U.S. District Court for the central district of California, it continues to shirk its duty with respect to the other judicial emergency vacancy, that for which Margaret Morrow was nominated on May 9, 1996.  Just 2 week's ago, the opponents of this nomination announced in a press conference that they welcomed a debate and rollcall vote on Margaret Morrow. But again the Republican majority leader has refused to bring up this well-qualified nominee for such debate and vote. It appears that Republicans have time for press conferences to attack one of the President's judicial nominations, but the majority leader will not allow the U.S. Senate to turn to that nomination for a vote. We can discuss the nomination in sequential press conferences and weekend talk show appearances but not in the one place that action must be taken on it, on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  The Senate has suffered through hours of quorum calls in the past few weeks which time would have been better spent debating and voting on this judicial nomination. The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are puzzling--not only to those of us in the Senate who know her record but to those who know her best in California, including many Republicans.  They cannot fathom why a few senators have decided to target someone as well-qualified and as moderate as she is. Just this week I included in the Congressional Record a recent article from the Los Angeles Times by Henry Weinstein on the nomination of Margaret Morrow, entitled ``Bipartisan Support Not Enough for Judicial Nominee.'' This article documents the deep and widespread bipartisan support that Margaret Morrow enjoys from Republicans that know her. In fact, these Republicans are shocked that some Senators have attacked Ms. Morrow.  For example, Sheldon H. Sloan, a former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and an associate of Gov. Pete Wilson, declared that: ``My party has the wrong woman in their sights.'' Stephen S. Trott, a former high-ranking official in the Reagan administration and now a Court of Appeals Judge wrote to the majority leader to try to free up the Morrow nomination, according to this article Judge Trott informed Senator Lott:       ``I know that you are concerned, and properly so, about the      judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench.      So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means:      follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes.      Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I      have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a      judicial position.''  Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican administration, observed in the article that: ``Margaret has gotten tangled in a web of larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere pawn in this struggle.'' I could not agree more.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by Terry Carter from the Los Angeles Daily Journal entitled ``Is Jihad on Judicial Activism About Principle or Politics?'' In that article Senator Sessions is quoted as saying that the Senate ``can have a vote on [Morrow] nomination tomorrow.'' Well, today is tomorrow. It is high time to free the nomination of Margaret Morrow for debate and a vote.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Los Angeles Daily Journal, Nov. 6, 1997]       Is Jihad on Judicial Activism About Principle or Politics?                           (By Terry Carter)       Washington.--Three years after being nominated for the      federal bench--having been branded a California ``activist,''      grilled by Senate Judiciary Committee members about her      personal voting habits and consigned to nomination limbo by      an unidentified senator's ``hold''--it would have been      understandable if Los Angeles lawyer Margaret Morrow began      composing a withdrawal letter in her head.       If she did, she could have looked for inspiration to what      previous failed nominees had written.       ``Despite the unpleasantness of the process, I am grateful      for the honor of having had your support,'' one would-be      federal judge wrote to his sponsor. ``. . .For a while there,      I really thought that your Herculean efforts had overcome the      false and misleading charges that were made against me.''       The author of that letter found salve in a manner few dream      of. After his 1986 bid for a judgeship fell to a party line      vote, then-Alabama U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions, who faced      questionable charges of racial insensitivity during Judiciary      Committee hearings, went on to become a two-term governor and      was     elected to the Senate in 1994 along with a number of other      uncompromising firebrands. Today, Sessions sits on the very      Judiciary Committee that rejected him, and he holds his thumb      up or down on judicial nominations.       In an interview, Sessions said, ``We can have a vote on      [Morrow] tomorrow as far as I'm concerned. And I'd want to      talk about some of her writings and statements and the Senate      could vote.'' Sessions went on to say, ``Margaret Morrow has      written disrespectfully of the potential for good public      policy coming out of the referendums in California. We have a      real popular uproar over judges who've overturned      referendums.''       She likely would be, Sessions said, ``a judicial      activist.''       In the judicial activism wars, Morrow will be either a      victim or a survivor. In the spring, Morrow, a partner with      Arnold & Porter and the first woman president of the State      Bar, made it through the committee on a 13-5 vote.       Tough questions from, among others, Sen. Charles Grassley,      R-Iowa, about how she voted on past state referenda were seen      by many observers as transparent attempts to see how, as a      judge, she might rule on matters concerning immigration, the      death penalty, medical use of marijuana and other hot-button      issues. But she seemed to weather the storm. Even the      conservative Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch,      R-Utah, finally pronounced Morrow fit, saying his reservation      about her potential for judicial activism had been assuaged.      Now that her name has gone to the floor, her candidacy is      promised a full-fledged debate by both sides.       Either way, Morrow has come to define the renewed flare-up      of the age-old debate over the role of judges, predicted 200      years ago by Madison and Hamilton in the Federalist Papers.      But there is a difference this time. Swirling in the      background is a clash of old and new politics on Capitol      Hill, particularly among Republicans campaigning for re-     election and intent on keeping control of the Congress, even      as they battle among themselves over leadership.       Republicans didn't have to look far to find a bogeyman in      the judiciary--which not only is a good target, but it can't      fight back.       Chasing so-called judicial activists is more than sucker-     punching a patsy, as liberals put it. It gives Republicans      something to do together while battling over party      leadership. The excesses, the speed, have come mostly from      the Young Turks and some old hands trying to get ahead.      Whenever one pulls a foot off the accelerator to slow it      down, another jams it to the floor--and no one wants out of      the car.       ``On this issue it's more strategy and tactics that bring      disagreement among conservatives, not goals and objectives,''      said Elliot Mincberg, counsel for the liberal interest group      People for the American Way. The Young Turks and the      establishment all agree to keep as many Clinton nominees off      the bench as they can in a four-year stall, as much as they      can get away with it.       The old guard hasn't gone out of its way to thwart the      excesses. One of the most extreme of those was the      announcement by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, earlier this year      that he would seek impeachment of activist judges. DeLay      recently reiterated the threat, and added that he wants it to      ``intimidate'' judges.       Republican colleagues are quick to say that's beyond the      pale, that impeachment for individual rulings won't happen,      but, they admit, they like how it pushes the curve farther to      the right.       A good example of that right-shifting spectrum is Hatch's      unilateral move earlier this year to end the American Bar      Association's formal role of advising the Senate on judicial      nominations, though individual senators still receive      reports, and the more important pre-screening for the White      House continues. Hatch told colleagues privately that he did      so to keep the hard liners from doing worse. He said he's in      the middle, but the middle keeps moving to the right.       The hunt for judicial activists is also proving a good      fund-raising tool for some Republicans. Another freshman      senator on the Judiciary Committee, John Ashcroft, R-Mo.,      already is signaling a run for the presidency. It was      Ashcroft who placed the ``hold'' on the Morrow nomination, it      was revealed last month. And Ashcroft used his chairmanship      of the subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and      Property Rights to hold hearings on judicial activism this      year. ``Its a good launching pad,'' said one Hill staffer. A      sophisticated Internet user, Ashcroft at one point dedicated      much of his Web site to judicial activism.       He is one of only 10 senators, for several months one of      only six, to sign the so-called Hatch Pledge, which was      crafted in February by the Judicial Selection Monitoring      Project, a spinoff of the conservative Free Congress      Education and Research Foundation. Each senator was asked to      sign the pledge. It seized a sentence from a speech by Hatch      at a Federalist Society meeting in his home state. ``Those      nominees who are or will be judicial activists should not be      nominated by the president or conformed by the Senate, and I      personally will do my best to see that they are not.''       Hatch himself declined the request, citing personal policy      against signing pledges, but he praised the efforts of the      coalition of 260 conservative groups brought together by the      Judicial Selection Monitoring Project. Also not joining      Ashcroft in signing it were Grassley and Sessions. ``I      believe in fighting judicial activism but I don't need to      sign a pledge,'' Sessions said. While judicial activism has      been debated hotly the past two years in a presidential      campaign, congressional hearings, on op-ed pages and in think      tanks and bar panel discussions; the term's definition      remains slippery. ``It has been debased by conservatives so      badly it has degenerated into an epithet for decisions you      don't like--it's aimed only at results,'' said Bruce Fein, a      former high-ranking official in the Ronald Reagan Justice      Department.       Just the same, the debate quickened and became more focused      in June when the Supreme Court struck down federal laws      concerning religious freedom, Internet decency and handgun      regulation. Outcries from both the left and the right      questioned the process--calling it judicial activism--that      led to these results.       No one did so more strongly than Hatch, who is considered      by many to be an ideological soul-mate of Chief Justice      William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence      Thomas. But those three were in the majority that were      against Hatch's own Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which      Congress enacted to maneuver around an earlier Supreme Court      ruling.       ``The Supreme Court has thrown down a gauntlet,'' Hatch      said in a statement released the day after the decision was      announced. ``I intend to pick it up.'' After stumping against      judicial activism for the better part of a year, Hatch      suddenly expanded the term. Now he complained about      ``conservative judicial activism.''       Perhaps, as a result, there will be a finer point to the      debate, which is likely to continue. It has quickened in      academia. But asking legal scholars to define judicial      activism is like asking judges to interpret the Constitution.      Often the only common thread is their certainty. An activist      against judicial activism, Thomas Jipping of the Judicial      Selection Monitoring Project offers a quote from Humpty      Dumpty in a colloquy with Alice after she ventured beyond the      looking glass: ``When I use a word it means just what I      choose it to mean--neither more nor less.''       Without using the term, Justice John Paul Stevens, in a 35-     page dissent in Printz v. US, which struck down parts of the      Bready Handgun Violence Prevention Act, chided his      conservative colleagues--Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas in      particular--for engaging in the kind of judicial activism      they've eschewed so vocally in the past. Stevens pointed out      that they had resorted to ``emanations'' and ``penumbras''      from the Constitution, tools liberals often are accused of      wielding to torture the document.       While there is no locus classicus defining judicial      activism, Laurence Tribe at Harvard Law School may trump them      all: ``To say there is a neutral vantage point outside the      system for someone to declare in an Olympian and purportedly      objective way that this is activism and that is restraint is      itself a rather arrogant delusion.''       But then, Tribe comes from the ``eye of the beholder''      school of thought, which tends to be composed of liberals.      Those in the middle offer ``on the one hand, and not the      other'' definitions. And conservative scholars usually define      the term in considerable detail and nuance, with explanations      of the mistakes others make in trying to do so.       Most are quick to mention specific cases, both old and      recent. Some still argue Marbury v. Madison. 5 U.S. 137      (1803).       The conservative constitutional law professor Michael      McConnell, now teaching at the University of Utah College of      Law, made this response to Tribe. During the past 10 to 20      years, he said, the term judicial activism ``has been a      rhetorical theme of conservatives criticizing the court, and      it's only natural that their ideological opposites would try      to deconstruct and weaken that by saying it could be anything      in the eye of the beholder.''       McConnell offered a definition: ``When a court imposes its      own moral or political judgments in place of those of the      democratically elected branches, without adequate warrant in      the constitutional text, history, structure and precedent.''      But then he acknowledged the eye-of-the-beholder argument.      ``The devil is in the subordinate clause because we all see      that differently,'' McConnell added.       A corollary to the argument that judicial activism is in      the beholder's eye might be that made by some that it is      necessary. Conservatives have complained for years that      liberals went to the courts to get policy they couldn't      muster through legislatures. Now many conservatives would      like to turn the tables.       Clint Bolick, director of the libertarian Cato Institute's      Center for Constitutional Studies, believes the courts      ``should play a feisty role.'' The courts, particularly the      Supreme Court, were intended to be ``a vigorous guardian of      individual liberties against the encroachment of other      branches of government,'' he explained. So at Cato, ``we're      in the business of securing judicial activism of the right      kind, as in the correct kind.'' The Supreme Court's decisions      striking down several federal laws this past term are ``the      way the court is supposed to be activist,'' he said.       In a more playful take on reining in judicial activism a      belt with a jagged edge, the pro-life, Christian-oriented      Family Research Council in June announced winners of its      Court Jesters Award, for judges it believes stepped out of      bounds. Noticeably missing     from the list, as the conservative gratify Fein pointed out,      were two who made headlines during the year. One is federal      Judge John Spizzo in New York, who acquitted two men arrested      for blocking access to an abortion clinic because their      actions stemmed from ``conscience-driven religious belief''      rather than willful criminal intent. The other is a state      court judge in Alabama who posted in Ten Commandments in his      courtroom and invited clergy to lead juries in prayer prior      to hearing cases. The FRC's director, Gary Bauer, was willing      to offer a written definition of judicial activism for this      story but was unavailable over several weeks for an interview      to discuss the topic.       ``So many conservatives are so unprincipled in attacking      judicial activism because the real grievance is against the      results they don't like,'' said Fein, a columnist for the      conservative Washington Times newspaper and a regular      commentator on CNN, ``And the standards Republicans are now      voicing to screen Clinton nominees is what they said in the      Bork hearings should never be applied,'' he said referring to      the failed Republican nomination of Robert Bork in 1986.       The Jihad against judicial activism is seen some, in part,      as the continuation of a dynamic the simmered through the      Bork hearings: a long continuing battle against the Warren      and Burger court. For one such attack through the rear-view      minor former attorney general Edwin Meese appeared Ashcroft's      hearings on judicial activism. A fellow the Heritage      Foundation, Meese followed up, releasing to the Judiciary      Committee a report titled ``Putting the Federal Judiciary      Back on Track.'' The former Reagan administration official      wants a number of landmark decisions by the Warren and Burger      courts reversed, and agrees with Bork much-criticized belief      that Congress should be empowered to overrule Supreme Court      decision by simple majority vote.       For some, that rear-view mirror is cloudy. ``The irony of      complaints now about judicial activism,'' said Professor      Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern California      Law School, ``is that the majority of justices on the Supreme      Court and the majority of federal judges are Republican      appointees. And the Supreme Court hasn't recognized a new      constitutional right in 25 years.''       That may be why many believe the judicial activism wars are      more of a political tool. Federal judges and the Supreme      Court are ``pushing fewer hot bottoms than they were 25 or 30      or 40 years ago,'' said A.E. Dick Howard, a constitutional      scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law. The      debate over judicial activism ``is not as hot today. No      attack on the modern court is comparable to [President      Richard] Nixon's attacks on the Warren court.''       There is no broad-based criticism of the courts today that      compares to the time of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S.      483 (1954), and issues of one-person-one-vote and school      prayer. Howard explained. Criticism today is more episodic,      he said.       On Capitol Hill, senators trying to break the lock on      judicial nominations believe Chief Justice Rehnquist should      go further than criticizing it in his annual report on the      judiciary, ``Who reads that?'' asks one Senate staffer, ``He      needs to get out and say it in speeches.'' And others say      that if President Clinton went to war over one or two judges,      win or lose in Senate confirmations, the floodgates would      open for all the others. ``Every time a president has fought,      if it looks like he's fighting for principle, he wins      politically,'' said Professor Herman Schwartz, of American      University's Washington College of Law. ``People would pay      attention, American like an independent judiciary.''
