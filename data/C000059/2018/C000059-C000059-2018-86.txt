Chairman, I thank the gentleman for the time.  Mr. Chairman, I also rise in opposition to the amendment. As the gentleman mentioned, the bill already includes a $1.5 million increase for the Inspector General which is the amount that was requested. This transfer is not needed, and if enacted, it could affect the operations of the Department of the Interior.  For those reasons and others, I oppose this amendment.
