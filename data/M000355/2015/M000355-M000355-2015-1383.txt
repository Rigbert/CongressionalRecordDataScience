 President, I ask unanimous consent that S. Con. Res. 16, submitted earlier today, be placed on the calendar; and that at 5 p.m. on Monday, May 11, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 16; that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form and the Senate then vote on adoption of the concurrent resolution with no intervening action or debate.
