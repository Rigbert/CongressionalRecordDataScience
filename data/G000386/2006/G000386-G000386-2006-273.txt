 President, first, I will respond to some of the things that Senator Baucus brought up in his opening statement. He complimented me in our working through this, and I always have a good working relationship with Senator Baucus. And 90 percent of the time, or maybe more, he and I are on the same side of the fence. I remind people in the Senate that on three occasions, in November and January and February, we were on the same side of the fence on this issue.
