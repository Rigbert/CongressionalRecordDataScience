Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I had planned to offer an amendment regarding the National Science Foundation, an amendment that would help assure some much-needed expertise in scientific project management for the National Science Foundation. Rather than offer an amendment that might not have an appropriate dollar amount, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished gentleman from New York concerning the construction of scientific facilities and instruments provided in the National Science Foundation appropriation.  First let me congratulate the gentleman from New York and the Committee on Appropriations as well as his staff for the well-thought-out NSF appropriation. As he knows, NSF's primary mission includes funding peer-reviewed, investigator-initiated research by individuals or small groups. This is an operation that the NSF has managed well. However, NSF has seen its role in funding larger projects such as the construction of radio and optical telescopes expand significantly in recent years. Problems encountered in the management of some of these projects and concerns raised by the NSF inspector general suggest that the NSF may not have an adequate plan, adequate experience or adequate resources with which to effectively oversee these large-ticket projects. Indeed, language in the President's budget blueprint directs NSF to develop a plan ``to enhance its capability to estimate costs and provide oversight of project development and construction.''  Does the Committee on Appropriations share these concerns?
