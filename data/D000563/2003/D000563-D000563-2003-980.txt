HATCH. It was not necessary. It was not necessary because I was fighting to have that happen and it did in fact happen, unlike what is happening today.  Let me make a suggestion to my colleagues on the other side. I am willing to have one cloture vote, but then let's vote up or down on Estrada. And if you win, I will live with that. If you can destroy this man's career so that he cannot be a Federal circuit court of appeals judge, I will live with that. You have a right to vote against him. But you do not have a right to filibuster this man, nor should you. It is shameful. And it is shameful to put him through this without one substantive reason to do it other than a phony request for privileged documents that everybody knows is phony.
