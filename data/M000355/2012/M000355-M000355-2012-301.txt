 Captain Jaenichen has spent the last 2 years of his career serving the U.S. Congress as the Navy's Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs. In this role, Captain Jaenichen maintained oversight of the Navy team that provides Members and committees of Congress with information concerning the programs of the Department of the Navy.  Captain Jaenichen's Kentucky roots run deep. He spent his formative years in Brandenburg, graduating from Meade County High School in 1978. During his senior year he was selected as one of 50 football players from across the Commonwealth to play in the 1978 East-West All-star game. Chip's wife Paula was born in Morganfield, grew up in Louisville and later attended Meade County High School with him. After her graduation from Western Kentucky University, Paula and Chip were married in Brandenburg. The couple then moved to Louisville, where they lived until he began the Nuclear Training pipeline. Their daughter Rachael attended Murray State University and is now an English teacher at Reidland High School in Paducah. Chip and Paula's son Nathan currently serves as a Marine Corps pilot.  Chip was able to pay homage to his Kentucky heritage in his career as the Executive Officer of the USS Kentucky, an Ohio Class ballistic missile submarine. During this tour he started a Namesake State school partnership with Raceland Elementary School near Ashland. Through this program, which continues to thrive, he coordinated several visits for the crew of the Kentucky to work on humanitarian projects in the Commonwealth. Chip's efforts led to his nomination and selection to the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels in 1996, an organization with which he remains active.  Captain Jaenichen's naval career began in 1978 with an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy from Representative William Natcher. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as a submarine officer and spent the majority of his career on sea duty. He honorably served on four different submarines before assuming the role of Executive Officer aboard the USS Kentucky. After three strategic deterrent patrols with the Kentucky, Captain Jaenichen assumed command of the USS Albany. Captain Jaenichen served the final 2 years of his career with the Navy's Legislative Affairs office here in Washington.  I thank Captain Jaenichen for his 30 years of loyal service to this Nation. He has made a lasting and significant contribution to the United States Navy and our Nation. I wish him and his family all the best as they begin this new chapter in their lives.                          ____________________
