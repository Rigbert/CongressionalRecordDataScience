. 1628 and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  I move to commit the bill, H.R. 1628, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session, with changes that, No. 1, are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and No. 2, ensure that no senior will lose access to long-term care service including nursing home care and home and community-based care under the Medicaid Program. Medicaid is the largest payer of nursing home care, with 900,000 individuals across the country and 4,756 individuals in Rhode Island who reside in nursing homes having their care paid for by Medicaid. This bill would decimate Medicaid, harming seniors and their families. This motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Shaheen.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Reed moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same      back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which      the Senate is not in session, with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and       (2) ensure that no senior will lose access to long term      care services (including nursing home care and home and      community-based care) under the Medicaid program.
