I am one of the more senior Members on our side, and I certainly would be one who would have known had there been any such plan. I can assure both leaders that had there been such, I would not be here talking to the two Senators, I would probably be on the front porch of my farm in Vermont right now planning to spend the weekend seeing constituents and working from my computer connection in Vermont rather than here.  So I can assure both my friends, who are my friends, the two leaders, that had there been any such plan on this side, first, I would have known about it, but, second, I would be in Vermont by now.
