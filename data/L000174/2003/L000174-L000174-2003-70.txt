The distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, asked the then-chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee ``whether the legislation under consideration here today will fix the problem of the section 11 cap for conservation programs.''  The Senator from Iowa responded it would, and he said:       As a result, for directly funded programs, such as the      Conservation Security Program and the Environmental Quality      Incentives Program, funding for technical assistance will      come from the borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit      Corporation. . . .       For programs such as the CRP, WRP, and the Grasslands      Reserve Program . . . funding will come from the annual      program outlays . . . from the borrowing authority of the      CCC.  This was all carefully worked out. This GAO report shows it was the intent of Congress to do it the way we are funding. Unfortunately, there are those at the Department of Agriculture who will admit that privately but will not admit it publicly.  We are just trying to put the money back where it was. We are not trying to rob any of the others. I am saying they should get the money it was said they would get.  As we showed, in Texas alone, we have a $500 million deficit they assumed had been promised to them. But now, because the reallocation is not going there, hunters, those who fish, farmers, ranchers--they all agree they ought to get the money they asked for. They are good stewards of their land, but a lot of the applications to make sure they are good stewards of the land came about because we promised them the money, and now we are pulling it back. That is my concern. The GAO study makes it very clear it was intended this way.  I thank the Senator for yielding to me to point that out.
