President, I wish to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for her contribution.  Obviously, the vote this afternoon didn't go our way. My hope is that as Senators from both political parties have a chance over the next few days to lay out the consequences of the two principles we have been talking about--staying away from coercion and staying away from discrimination--by the time the Senate has completed debate and votes, we can come up with a proposal that will not set back the cause of innovation in this country.  We both have talked about the fact that the March numbers on jobs were not where we would like them to be. Particularly distressing is the number of people who seem to be either dropping out of the workforce or working part time because they can't find anything full time. Now we are looking at policies that will make efforts to put those people back to work even harder.  So I am very appreciative of the fact that the Senator was able to come to the floor; because what I tried to do over the last 20 minutes or half an hour is outline what has worked in technology policy for the last 15 years. It has been nondiscrimination and noncoercion. This bill repudiates both of those. My hope is the Senator and I and other Senators on both sides of the aisle can find a way to change this legislation so as to at least not go backward with respect to those values that have been so key to the growth of jobs in the technology sector. To have the Senator here is so helpful, and I am very appreciative.
