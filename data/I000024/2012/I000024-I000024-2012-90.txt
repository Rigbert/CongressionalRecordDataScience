President, first of all, my friend from South Carolina articulated very well what happened today with the Supreme Court. I think it is going to be a wake-up call for a lot of people in America. I think it will, as he suggested, have a profound effect on the elections in November when people realize the Court has ruled that people who don't have coverage are going to be penalized by $695 per individual, and families who do have coverage will have to pay an additional about $2,100, and the employers of America are going to be dealing with the government exchange. People are going to be concerned about it. I think they are going to want to send people to Congress in both the House and the Senate and in the White House who are going to change this system.  So I stand on the Senate floor and say that is what I am predicting and we will see what happens.                        Highway Reauthorization  I want to make one comment because we are going to vote shortly on a significant bill. It is the highway reauthorization bill. It makes me very proud because we have been trying for a year and a half to do this. When we passed the last highway reauthorization bill, it was in 2005. At that time I was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. It was, as I recall and going from memory, a $286.4 billion bill. It was for 5 years. Of course, that expired in 2009.  The problem we have had since 2009 is that we have been operating on what they call extensions. Most people are not aware that when we operate on extensions, we are operating with the same amount of money we are spending out of the highway trust fund, but we are only getting two-thirds of what we would get if it were a reauthorization.  First of all, they can only do it in a short period of time. There is no planning, and they have all said we lose about 30 to 33 percent of the amount of spending power or money that should be spent on highways, bridges, and maintenance.  It is kind of funny because I have been ranked as the most conservative Member of this body at different times, and I am always in the top three. Yet I have always said I may be the most conservative, but I am a big spender in two areas: One is national defense and the other is transportation, and that is what this is all about.  I have had occasion to talk to a lot of the new members of the conference committee over in the House and explained to them the conservative position and the conservative vote on this is to vote for the highway reauthorization bill that is going to be coming up to us. Hopefully, it will be here tonight. It is going back and forth between the House and Senate. I believe most of the conferees have already signed off on this bill, so it is coming up. It has been a long time in the making. I am very excited about it.  Let me also say that while I take the position that the conservative vote is to vote for the highway reauthorization bill, I am not alone in this feeling.  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record a statement by the chairman of the American Conservative Union. It is an op-ed by Al Cardenas, who is the chairman of the American Conservative Union. He presents a strong case as to why this is the conservative position that should be taken.  I ask unanimous consent that the statement and op-ed piece by the chairman of the American Conservative Union be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Examiner, June 21, 2012]        Conservatives Should Break Transportation Bill Gridlock                            (By Al Cardenas)       The spending and debt crises of the past few years in      Washington have forced an important debate about the proper      role of government, and the need for prioritizing government      spending.       The failed $800 billion stimulus, TARP, countless bailouts      and Congress' failure to make a serious attempt at      controlling our $16 trillion debt have given many      conservatives rightful anger over how Washington spends our      money.       Unfortunately, well-placed mistrust in Congress' ability to      spend our tax dollars is now jeopardizing legitimate spending      projects, chief among them this year's transportation funding      bill. If Congress fails to act by June 30, important      transportation projects critical to our national defense and      our economy will lose their funding. The effects on our      already suffering economy will be far-reaching and profound.       While there are important disagreements between members of      the House and Senate on this bill, enough consensus exists on      the broad framework that there's no excuse for not passing it      in time.       First, the current framework does not contain any earmarks.      This is a monumental achievement in its own right considering      ``Bridge to nowhere'' and ``John Murtha's airport'' served to      make transportation earmarks the poster children of wasteful      pork spending. Second, the myriad of highway spending      categories that used to serve as hiding places for pet      projects has been reduced from 87 down to 21.       Third, thanks to the leadership of Senator Jim Inhofe and      conservatives in the House, the cumbersome and unnecessary      environmental review process for road construction projects      will see significant reform. How much reform is up for      debate, but we're going to get something better than what we      have now, that much is assured.       Fourth, not passing a bill will hurt our already suffering      economy.       While big-government Democrats mistakenly place their      economic faith in the religion of government spending,      conservatives know the economic pump is best primed by a      robust private sector. Government cannot do much to stoke job      creation on its own, as evidenced by President Obama's      repeated failures during the past three years. But government      can play a profound role in stalling job creation and hurting      economic growth. Failure to pass a transportation bill would      have a negative effect on commerce and the businesses that      count on safe and reliable roads.       Perhaps most importantly, those of us who believe in      constitutional conservatism understand that unlike all the      things the Federal Government wastes our money on,     transportation spending is at the core of what constitutes      legitimate spending.       Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution specifically      lists interstate road-building as one of the delineated      powers and responsibilities vested in the federal government.      In Federalist Paper #42, James Madison makes an early case      for the federal government's role in maintaining a healthy      infrastructure, by stating ``Nothing which tends to      facilitate the intercourse between the states, can be deemed      unworthy of the public care.''       Let's be clear--the legislation before Congress is still      the product of a Democratically-controlled Senate, and far      from conservative perfection. But there can be no denying      that it represents a marked improvement over previous      transportation funding bills. Enough progress has been made,      victories won, and concessions secured from Democrats, that      conservatives should feel comfortable dropping their      objections and working to ensure passage of a bill before      June 30.       The road to reforming government spending will be long and      winding, but conservatives have us headed in the right      direction.
