President, today I wish to recognize my good friend and fellow Oklahoman, Mr. Gregory Slavonic, for his Senate confirmation as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Manpower and Reserve Affairs at the Department of Defense.  Greg was raised in Oklahoma City, OK. He graduated with a bachelor of science from Oklahoma State University and then enlisted in the Navy. After completing boot camp and signalman ``A'' school he received orders to the aircraft carrier USS Constellation (CVA 64) and completed two western Pacific deployments in support of combat operations in Vietnam. In 1976, he earned a master's degree from the University of Central Oklahoma.  His military awards include the Legion of Merit Medal; Bronze Star Medal, two awards; Meritorious Service Medal, three awards; Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two awards; Combat Action Ribbon; Presidential Unit Citation; and numerous other campaign and service medals.  Throughout his 34-year career in the Navy and as chief of staff to Senator James Lankford, Greg has served his country and his home State of Oklahoma with great honor and distinction. He will bring those experiences of success to this position and continue the excellence that has been the trademark of the U.S. military.  I want to congratulate Greg Slavonic on this well-deserved confirmation and wish him well in his new role at the DOD.                          ____________________
