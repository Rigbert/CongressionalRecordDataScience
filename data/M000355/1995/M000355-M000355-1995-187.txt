 President, I have seven amendments that are routine, and as far as I know there are no objections to them. Let me list them: an amendment by Senator Specter on section 660, which has to do with police training; amendments for myself regarding competitive financing; an amendment by Senator Stevens of Alaska dealing with the issue of mapping; an amendment by Senator Kassebaum already at the desk regarding Liberia; an amendment by Senator Bingaman concerning energy; two amendments by Senator Mack, one relating to the World Bank and one relating to the index of economic freedom; and an amendment by my colleague from Vermont on Honduras.  Mr. President, I send those amendments to the desk en bloc and I ask for their immediate consideration.
