 President, I rise today to honor a noted and dedicated educator, Dr. Don Dugi. Dr. Dugi has been named the 2003 Kentucky Professor of the Year, awarded by the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Criteria for the award includes support from colleagues and extraordinary dedication to teaching demonstrated by involvement with undergraduate students.  Dr. Dugi is a professor of political science at Transylvania University in Lexington, KY. He joined the faculty of Transylvania in 1975 after earning his master's degree in political science from St. Mary's College in Texas. After his master's degree, he earned his Ph.D. in political science from Purdue University in 1981 where he wrote his dissertation on the ``Political Ideology of Kentucky Coal Producers.''  During his tenure at Transylvania, Dr. Dugi has gained respect from both his colleagues and, more importantly, the students to whom he has dedicated his time and energy. In fact, the Student Government Association recognized his talent and love for teaching and honored him with its Teacher of the Year award. Dr. Dugi became the faculty advisor to both the Student Government Association and pre-law students in 1975, roles he continues today. Each May, he teaches a class to prepare students for the law school admissions test. He receives no compensation and continues to teach his regular classes. This is but one example of Dr. Dugi's selfless commitment to the students at Transylvania.  Colleagues also benefit from Dr. Dugi's commitment to excellence. The administration at Transylvania recognized Dr. Dugi's talents and awarded him a Bingham Fellowship for Excellence in Teaching in 1989. In 1998, he became the first recipient of the prestigious Bingham-Young Professorship. With this honor, Dr. Dugi developed a program that allowed his colleagues to investigate the concept of race as both an intellectual and an instructive concern. For this purpose, he organized a variety of events including a film series, lecturers, performers, and artists. The entire Transylvania campus benefited from Dr. Dugi's hard work.  An accomplished political scientist and educator, Dr. Dugi is a true leader in the field of political science and education, more generally, and should be commended for his unwavering dedication to Transylvania University, its faculty, staff, and its students. I ask each of my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to Dr. Don Dugi, not only for the 2003 Kentucky Professor of the Year Award, but for all that he gives to his students, his community, and his Nation.                          ____________________
