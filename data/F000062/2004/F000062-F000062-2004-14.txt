 I am just getting wound up. Let me just finish this windup.  Here, in the dead of night--this is not poorly thought out. This is very carefully thought out. Whoever did this knew exactly what they were doing, and they got it through one House.  Please, don't shuffle this under our desks with a resolution. This bill should be defeated. It should go back. The House of Representatives, which passed it, should at least have to come back to Washington and correct their error. This is the way I feel. I think the American people would be just appalled if they knew this was in the bill.
