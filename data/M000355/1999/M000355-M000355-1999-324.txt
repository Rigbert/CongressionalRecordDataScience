 President, it is interesting, in Hollywood lobbying efforts, they always scream censorship. This amendment has nothing to do with censorship. It has to do with the use of Federal property and federal assistance, which is a privilege, not a right.  The Federal Government, through various departments and agencies, already has very subjective standards. We are simply adding to those kinds of standards one more factor--wanton and gratuitous violence. No movie company in America has a right to use any and all Federal property and to get federal assistance anyway. We are just adding one more criterion.  This is a very reasonable amendment. I hope it will be approved by my colleagues.
