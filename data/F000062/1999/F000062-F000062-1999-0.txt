 President, I rise today to submit a resolution that commends and remembers events that transpired in Remy, France as its citizens honored the fallen World War II Army Air Corps pilot, Lieutenant Houston Braly. This inspiring story happened over fifty years ago, but its example of compassion and brotherhood remains in our hearts and minds.  On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in northern France encountered a German munitions train. After three unsuccessful attack runs at the camouflaged train, Lt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion.  Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel from the train, haystacks in fields some distance away burned, and nearly all buildings in the small French town were demolished. A 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but its historic stained-glass windows were shattered.  It was this explosion that tragically claimed the life of Lt. Braly at only twenty-two years of age.  Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents of Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled Braly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the nylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. Hundreds of villagers left flowers around his body, stunning German authorities.  The next morning, German authorities discovered that villagers continued to pay tribute to the young pilot despite threats of punishment. The placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued until American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople.  Almost 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, discovered this story in his research. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the explosion had never been replaced. He contacted members of the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. After hearing how the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend, veterans joined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization that would raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows as a gesture of thanks to Remy for its deeds.  On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.''  I know that my fellow senators will want to join me in commending the people of Remy for their kindness and recognize the comrades of Lt. Braly for their good will.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution be printed at this point in the Record.  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            S. CON. RES. --       Whereas on August 2, 1944, a squadron of P-51s from the      United States 364th Fighter Group strafed a German munitions      train in Remy, France;       Whereas the resulting explosion killed Lieutenant Houston      Braly, one of the attacking pilots, and destroyed much of the      village of Remy, including 7 stained glass windows in the      13th century church;       Whereas despite threats of reprisals from the occupying      German authorities, the citizens of Remy recovered Lieutenant      Braly's body from the wreckage, buried his body with dignity      and honor in the church's cemetery, and decorated the grave      site daily with fresh flowers;       Whereas on Armistice Day, 1995, the village of Remy renamed      the crossroads near the site of Lieutenant Braly's death in      his honor;       Whereas the surviving members of the 364th Fighter Group      desire to express their gratitude to the brave citizens of      Remy; and       Whereas to express their gratitude, the surviving members      of the 364th Fighter Group have organized a nonprofit      corporation to raise funds through its project ``Windows for      Remy'' to restore the church's stained glass windows: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) commends the bravery and honor of the citizens of Remy,      France, for their actions with respect to the American      fighter pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly, during and after      August 1944; and       (2) recognizes the efforts of the surviving members of the      United States 364th Fighter Group to raise funds to restore      the stained glass windows of Remy's 13th century church.                          ____________________
