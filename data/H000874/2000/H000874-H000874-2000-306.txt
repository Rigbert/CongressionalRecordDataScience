Hoeffel) for his comments and for his making a comment about the time between what was done in 1965 and that bridge being crossed, and I would comment that when we crossed the bridge in 2000, 35 years later, I think all of us were struck by the fact that there were Alabama troopers on the other side of that bridge but their response, when the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge was reached by John Lewis and others, was to salute, to salute in honor of all that John had accomplished and all that John represented, and showed a revolutionary change in those short 35 years.  The governor of Alabama, rather than talking about interposition and other doctrines of States' rights, met John and the President at the bridge and Governor Siegelman welcomed John Lewis home because, of course, John Lewis comes from Alabama; moved to Georgia and represents that State very well.  I think the gentleman from Philadelphia (Mr. Hoeffel), from Montgomery County as opposed to Montgomery, Alabama, made very clear the point that the march of 1965 continues to this date.  Now I would like to recognize my friend who now represents Birmingham and surrounding areas in Alabama, a former member of the State legislature, a State senator who himself was involved in the struggle, who himself was a fighter for freedom. I am pleased to recognize and yield to my friend, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Hilliard).
