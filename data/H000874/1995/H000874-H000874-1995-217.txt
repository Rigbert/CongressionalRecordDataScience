That is the point I make. I would suggest this is a very serious issue, and we are discussing it seriously, and I think that is important for the American public.  I have read a number of legal opinions, or CRS reports, including Professor Cole from Georgetown University Law Center, the law center from which I graduated. I have not seen a case that justifies or condones or holds constitutional the proscription of private dollars, nonpublic dollars, on lobbying or contact of government or trying to impact on policy activities of nonpublic groups.  Furthermore, let me suggest not only is that why it is a serious issue, because whether it is left, right or middle, we believe this is violative of the constitutional right to free speech and the right to petition one's government, but, in addition to that, I say to my friends, who I know feel very strongly about this, that the issue here is the reason so many of these groups have public funds is because we have decided as a Congress and as a people that it is better to give to the American Red Cross or the Catholic Charities or some other group funds to solve certain problems.  They are not necessarily doing us a favor. We are not doing them a favor by giving them these resources. In fact, we have judged that Catholic Charities does good work, and we want to give them resources because we believe they will more effectively distribute those funds than will the government.  So I say to my friend, as he can see, it is not just that, yes, they have Federal funds, because we have decided that we believe they can apply those funds effectively. As a matter of fact, I think that is consistent with some of the philosophy that Members on the other side of the aisle have discussed recently.
