 President, I thank Senator Shaheen for her support and her detailed explanation of what the legislation does and for everything she has done to help move this legislation along.  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 5578 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.
