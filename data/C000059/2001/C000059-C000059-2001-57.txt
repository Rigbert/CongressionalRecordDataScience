Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to pay tribute to a fallen detective from Riverside, CA. Detective Doug Jacobs died Saturday, January 13, in the line of duty for his Riverside community. We send our condolences and prayers to his family, neighbors, and the community.  Doug Jacobs was 30 years of age and employed with the Riverside Police Department since 1995. He leaves behind his young wife, Tamara, daughter Rachel, and stepson Nicholas Sohn. He also leaves behind neighbors and a community that will miss his constant self-sacrifice, generosity, and deep faith in God. And, now those left behind must pull together to support and strengthen each other during the coming months and years.  Being a police officer was all that Doug ever dreamed about when growing up--his family remembers him as a child riding in the car and pretending to talk to officers in passing police cars through the spare seat belt buckle. His career ambition only grew stronger as he grew older, joining the Riverside Sheriff's Department as an Explorer at 14. And recruiters saw in Doug an applicant who not only talked the talk of being an officer, but walked the walk. His love for police work led him to service in the police and sheriff's departments of Los Angeles, before returning home to work for Riverside in 1995.  The National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial, says it the best, that it is not how these officers died that made them heroes, it is how they lived.'' And as Riverside Police Chief Russ Leach noted at the funeral, Detective Jacobs ``Lived His Dreams.'' Many of us cannot truly understand the latent danger associated with the day to day routine of our law enforcement officers. They put themselves in danger everyday when they stop a vehicle, respond to an incident or a noise complaint--like Detective Jacobs. The danger and violence they face day in and day out is very real and it is times like these, sadly, that make us stop and honor our law enforcement officers. We hope that they be given such honor, respect and thanks always--not only when life's fragile nature is revealed. Detective Doug Jacobs lived his life protecting others and we can best serve his memory by honoring, respecting, and thanking our law enforcement officers.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and our colleagues join us today to remember this fine detective. On behalf of the residents of the city of Riverside, we extend our prayers and most heartfelt sympathy to his family and loved ones.                          ____________________
