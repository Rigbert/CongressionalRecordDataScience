Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the following testimony for the Record.       Good morning. It's a pleasure for me to speak before you      today, the Middle East and Central Asia subcommittee. I want      to commend the subcommittee for organizing this important      hearing and for your work concerning the ongoing problems in      Central Asia.       The peoples of Central Asia are largely Muslim, with a      history of living under Russian rule for centuries. Despite      our hopes and modest expectations that these nations would      matriculate from dictatorships to democracies, from my      vantage point as Co-Chairman of the U.S. Commission on      Security and Cooperation in Europe, the disappointing reality      over the last fifteen years is that most are moving in the      wrong direction. Moreover, in all countries of the region      ``super-presidents'' dominate the political arena while their      families, friends and favored few exploit the country's      natural resources. Corruption among the elite is pervasive,      as is cynicism among the populace. Legislatures and      judiciaries have languished while the authorities maintain      tight control of the most important media outlets.       Yet despite these similarities, the five countries of      Central Asia run the gamut from the standpoint of      democratization and human rights observance; I would like to      offer quick character sketches of each and then suggest some      policy options.       Kyrgyzstan represents one positive advance, as the only      country in Central Asia where the head of state won his job      in a fair contest. In last March's Tulip Revolution,      opposition leaders mobilized popular resistance to yet      another rigged election and     ousted Askar Akaev. He was replaced by President Kurmanbek      Bakiev, who won in a genuine landslide. Media outlets which      were under pressure can now report freely on events. All this      proves that Central Asians are ready for democracy. But      Kyrgyzstan faces many problems. Parliament was elected in a      rigged vote, and criminal elements are increasingly      influential. A series of assassinations of parliamentarians      has unsettled the Kyrgyz and their friends abroad. Moreover,      leaders in nearby states have been disturbed by the precedent      of ``people power'' in their neighborhood.       On the other hand, under the megalomaniac ``president for      life'' Saparmurat Niyazov, gas-rich Turkmenistan is the last      one-party state in the former Soviet bloc. No dissent or      religious freedoms are allowed and all media glorify the      ``great'' leader. Citizens must study Niyazov's Rukhnama--a      pseudo bible-mishmash of history, folklore and anthropology      which seeks to supplant traditional Turkmen sources of      spirituality. No other institutions or individuals have been      allowed to emerge. Not only are all human rights violated,      none of the bases of modem statehood have been fostered,      leaving Turkmenistan's people ill-prepared for the day when      Niyazov inevitably leaves the scene.       Tajikistan is the only state in Central Asia where Muslim      political parties are legal, an outcome of the bloody civil      war fought between 1992 and 1997. The agreement ending those      hostilities brought opposition parties into government, a      major step forward for Central Asia. But lately President      Imomali Rakhmonov has been concentrating power. In 2004, he      orchestrated a referendum that will allow him to remain in      office until 2020, if he wins next year's presidential      election--he is preparing by clamping down on potential      rivals. Two weeks ago an opposition figure was sentenced to      23 years in prison on charges many see as politically      motivated. At the same time, Rakhmonov has been muzzling the      media, with various independent newspapers closed down or      under constant pressure.       In oil-rich Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbaev has been      President since the late 1980s and is running for re-election      in December. Opposition parties are registered but have no      representatives in parliament. Independent and opposition      newspapers are harassed or fined for libel. The new and      regressive national security amendments limit religious      freedoms by increasing registration requirements, banning      unregistered religious groups, greatly curtailing missionary      activity, and permitting the suspension of registration of a      religious organization. Nevertheless, Kazakhstan wants to be      Chairman of the OSCE in 2009, a consensus decision that will      have to be made in 2006. While I would like to see a Central      Asian country in that position, chairmanship of the OSCE must      be earned. A grade of ``excellent'' from OSCE election      monitors on the presidential contest in December is the      minimum requirement. Many more improvements in human rights      performance will be needed before U.S. backing for      Kazakhstan's candidacy could be given in good conscience.       Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov has banned all      opposition. Censorship remains in effect, torture is      pervasive and thousands of people are in jail on political or      religious grounds--Islamic observance is permitted only      within state structures. Lagging economic reform has crimped      business development and aggravated widespread poverty, all      of which was recently documented by a very thorough Human      Rights First report. Demonstrating the lows the regime will      take to squash dissent, Uzbek authorities last week subjected      one of the country's most prominent human rights defenders,      Elena Urlaeva, to forcible psychiatric treatment,      injecting her against her will with powerful psychotropic      drugs.       Her troubles began when she was put under house arrest in      May to prevent her protesting the violence in Andijon. Last      May, armed men assaulted a prison in Andijon where local      businessmen were being held for alleged Islamic radicalism.      Troops responded the next day by shooting indiscriminately at      large crowds. According to eyewitnesses, hundreds, perhaps      thousands were killed. The U.S. Government, along with the      OSCE, UN and European Union, has called for an independent      investigation into Andijon. President Karimov has refused and      state-run Uzbek media outlets have accused the U.S. of      assisting with Islamic terrorists. The allegation would be      funny if it weren't so chilling.       Andijon has been a watershed in Uzbekistan's post-     independence history and in U.S.-Uzbek relations. As of      today, our bilateral ties are in a deep freeze and Tashkent      has demanded that our military base at K-2, which was      supplying coalition forces in neighboring Afghanistan, be      shut down.       As you can see, the countries of Central Asia have much in      common but have different prospects of future development. I      believe the United States can help move them in a positive      direction, while balancing the priorities of security      cooperation, energy supplies and democratization.       It is worth recalling President Bush's 2003 Whitehall      Palace speech during his trip to the United Kingdom in which      he acknowledged past mistakes in U.S. foreign policy: ``in      the past, [we] have been willing to make a bargain; to      tolerate oppression for the sake of stability . . . yet this      bargain did not bring stability or make us safe. It merely      bought time, while problems festered and ideologies of      violence took hold.''       Considering this, U.S. policy must support those Central      Asian governments which have made progress towards      democratization, especially Kyrgyzstan. We must also use our      influence to urge those in the middle to improve their      performance and those on the extremes to begin moderating      their behavior. If we are to defeat terrorism and instill      democracy and human rights in this region, we must do more.       That is why I've introduced H.R. 3189, the Central Asia      Democracy and Human Rights Act of 2005. If there is to be      lasting success in fighting terrorism, the U.S. must break      away from policies that back dictators who suppress and      terrorize their own people, as repression will mostly likely      breed future terrorism. The United States Government should      therefore use every means at its disposal to move the      countries of Central Asia to greater respect for democracy      and human rights. U.S. engagement should support American      values, promote long-term stability and security in the      region, and ensure that all assistance programs support and      reinforce these goals. In short, the bill facilitates      engagement with those countries that want to engage.       In President Bush's second inaugural speech, he declared      ``it is the policy of the United States to seek and support      the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every      nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny      in our world.'' My bill fulfills this policy directive by      providing constructive foreign assistance to support      democratization and human rights, while conditioning all non-     humanitarian U.S. assistance to the individual governments of      Central Asia, both economic and military, on whether each is      making ``substantial, sustained and demonstrable progress''      towards democratization and full respect of human rights in      keeping with their OSCE commitments.       The legislation would require that the President make an      annual determination whether such progress is being made by      examining five categories: democratization; free speech;      freedom of religion; torture; and rule of law/trafficking in      persons. If a country is not certified, economic and military      assistance would be withheld in a graduated format. My bill      provides greater flexibility to the President, as it allows      the U.S. to express dissatisfaction in a significant way      while not immediately ending all aid programs to the central      governments in this strategic region of the world. The      President is also provided with a national security waiver.       Notably, withheld money is not lost. The President is      authorized to reallocate withheld funds to provide financial      assistance (including the awarding of grants) to foreign and      domestic individuals, NGOs, and entities that support      democracy, the promotion of democracy and/or full respect of      human rights.       The United States should use every means at its disposal to      encourage democratization in Central Asia. Democracy in that      part of the world will ultimately promote long-term stability      and security in the region. That's the objective of my      legislation. I hope the Members of the Middle East and      Central Asia subcommittee will join me and cosponsor H.R.      3189.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E2208-E2209]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               TESTIMONY ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN CENTRAL ASIA                                 ______                                                        HON.
