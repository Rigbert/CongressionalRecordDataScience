Chairman, I appreciate the chairman yielding me this time, and I would join in his opposition.  I respect my good friend, however, I have to vehemently disagree. The administration has proposed a budget, and it is up to us to make a determination as to how to allocate those resources. The subcommittee has done so in a balanced and fair fashion, and I would ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment.
