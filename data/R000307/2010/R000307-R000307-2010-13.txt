We can and should provide tax relief to all taxpayers--tax relief that helps families keep more of their hard-earned dollars and tax relief that provides certainty to small businesses so they can make investments and create jobs without the fear that their taxes will go up. We need to extend this tax relief that keeps money in the hands of families and small businesses rather than putting it in the pocket of Uncle Sam.  I yield back the remainder of the time that the distinguished Presiding Officer granted me.
