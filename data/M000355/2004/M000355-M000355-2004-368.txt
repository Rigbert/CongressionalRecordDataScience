 President, let me say to my friend and colleague, the assistant Democratic leader, I do think we had a good discussion last night, and reached an agreement on moving forward with this important piece of legislation. The minor snafu my friend referred to we were able to work out in short order this morning, and that is the way the Senate ought to work.  I congratulate him for his important contribution to moving this matter forward as well.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
