Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Corona Police Chief Richard Gonzales is one of these individuals. On September 12, 2008, Richard Gonzales will retire as the Corona Chief of Police.  A native Californian, born in Los Angeles, Richard makes his home in Corona with his wife Terry. Richard was sworn in as Corona's Police Chief on February 17, 1998. Previously, he spent 26 years the Los Angeles Police Department, beginning in 1972 as a patrol officer and retiring in 1998 as Captain III overseeing a staff of 170 at Hollenbeck Division. Prior to this he was the commanding officer of the 77th Street area.  Chief Gonzales holds a Master of Arts Degree in Public Administration and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice, both from Cal State Long Beach. He is a graduate of the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia and in 2001 he attended the FBINA LEEDS Training. He has attained an ``Executive'' POST Certificate. He previously taught a POST supervisory course at the Ben Clark Training Center in Riverside for the Sheriff's Department and a POST supervisory LDSP course at Golden West College.  During his tenure as Chief of Police for the city of Corona, Gonzales oversaw the growth of the department from 114 officers to 189 officers. In addition, he advocated for the acquisition of a mobile command post, computers for patrol cars and an indoor shooting range that is 25 lanes wide. Chief Gonzales has been an excellent public servant who has consistently provided for the safety and well-being of the community of Corona.  Chief Gonzales is also actively involved in community youth activities as a board member of UNITY. His hobbies include golf and jogging and he is a member of his department's Baker-to-Vegas running team. Chief Gonzales has actively instituted partnerships with the local school district, ministerial groups and other service organizations to keep our community safe and raise the quality of life we share here in Corona. In 1999, Chief Gonzales was honored by the Inland Empire Hispanic Image Awards as ``Public Safety Person of the Year'' and in 2001 received the Ira Calvert Distinguished Citizen of the Year award. In July, 2003, he received the ``Law Administrator of the Year'' award from the California School Resource Officers' Association.  Richard's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Richard a fellow community member, American, and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
