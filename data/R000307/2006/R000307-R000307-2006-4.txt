President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated November 16, 2006.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                             Select Committee on Intelligence,                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2006.       Dear Mr. President: As chairman and vice chairman of the      Select Committee on Intelligence, we submit to the Senate the      report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence      regarding its activities during the 108th Congress from      January 7, 2003, to December 8, 2004. The committee is      charged by the Senate with the responsibility of carrying out      oversight of the intelligence activities of the United      States. While much of the work of the committee is of      necessity conducted in secrecy, the committee believes that      the intelligence community and this committee should be as      accountable as possible to the public. This unclassified,      public report to the Senate is intended to contribute to that      objective.           Sincerely,     Pat Roberts,       Chairman,     John D. Rockefeller IV,       Vice Chairman.                          ____________________[Page S11048]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               SUBMITTAL OF INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE REPORT
