 President, I ask to have printed in the Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the ninth annual State of the Union essay contest conducted by my office.  The essays follow, in alphabetical order according to the finalists' names.     Isabelle Desroches, Burr and Burton Academy, Senior, Finalist  Civility in local politics is a topic of increasing importance. As we attempt to compromise on enormous national issues such as immigration, health care, and foreign policy, intense polarization has created unbearable tension between parties, and leads almost daily to an absence of civil discourse. Even more terrifying a sight in recent years is the aggression and polarity that has seeped into local elections through overly-aggressive yard signs, tempestuous town meetings, and neighborhood altercations that craft rifts in our communities. Hopefully, we can shift these themes before courtesy in both national and local politics dies, and my generation is left sans civility in our system.  We seem to be coming upon an age of wildly strong convictions. Although history classes dive into both pros and cons of political circumstances (such as the eras of Andrew Jackson or Lincoln), citizens and politicians are more resistant than ever to accept the yin/yang relationship that can be found in any political situation. Anyone who follows news is chronically frustrated by this double standard. What we must come to accept as a nation is that none of the pressing issues that face us today can be solved without a common language of civility.  Rollo May, an existential psychologist, wrote about conviction in The Courage to Create. ``The relationship between commitment and doubt is by no means an antagonistic one. Commitment is healthiest when it is not without doubt, but in spite of doubt,'' he wrote. May understands what we must come to embrace and apply to our politics: our convictions are strongest when we can cast doubt upon our own stance. A position without doubt causes ignorance and paralyzation of thought. It is courageous to doubt yourself and keep an open mind. We learn this in school, yet students are often hard-pressed to find admirable examples of these philosophies in our lives and on the national stage. As politics become increasingly heated, we can agree that it is more important than ever to preserve integrity and traditional decorum in local elections as well; movements like this must initiate in the strong roots of our society--our tight-knit communities. Our government must set a precedent of positive influence and etiquette so that progress and compromise can finally begin. We must work to create a climate of dialogue instead of hostile debate, both in communities and gradually on a national scale. Civility in politics is the foundation of the progress we need to make in the coming years. Actively working towards an attitude in politics that allows us to work in a bipartisan fashion, and incorporate doubt in our convictions and empathy in our approach is the only way we can ensure the survival of our American political system as it was intended.      Livia Greenberg, Stratton Mountain School, Junior, Finalist  The chest closes as the throat tightens like a python strangling its prey, the skin burning as it breaks out in angry hives and rashes, forcing one to claw at their body as a lack of oxygen begins to shut down vital organs. This is an allergic reaction--one that can be experienced by the 15 million Americans with food allergies, one of whom sent to the hospital due to a reaction every three minutes. The device used to stop reactions, called an EpiPen, can be made for thirty dollars; however, the lifesaving instrument retails for 600 dollars. The exorbitant price of the EpiPen is a result of domination over the healthcare market, with nothing stopping the company from raising prices exponentially. Unfortunately, the EpiPen is not the only example of why monopoly capitalism is an immoral system that abuses the consumers who are in need of medical help. Multiple monolithic companies are forcing those with medical needs to pay prodigious amounts for necessities, a practice that must be broken apart with government intervention.  Shattering medical monopolies needs to be one of the country's priorities, and the most feasible solution to do so is to create a new act that would outlaw inflexible patents and bolster smaller companies financially. The federal government currently uses three anti-trust acts as a guideline for what is a legal or illegal trust, but because none of the acts address copyright, colossal companies have avoided punishment by patenting products or drugs in a manner that makes an alternative product illegal to sell. Even remotely similar products have been banned by the FDA and are not allowed to be sold. By creating a law that prohibits exceedingly unalterable patents, cheaper products would be allowed into the healthcare market. With a government loan, small-scale companies can develop the alternative competition, which would drive the companies that currently have a monopoly into lowering their prices in order to sell their product. In addition to reducing the cost of medical necessities, the consumers would have more freedom to choose which product they trust in case of an emergency and better access to medication essential for life.  While both an ethical and economic issue, trusts are a problem that can be solved with strong government action that keeps the wellbeing of the American citizens at the forefront of concern. No one in the United States should die because of an inability to afford medication due to corporate greed. Creating a new anti-trust act will allow for more companies to develop and sell vital medications at a more accessible price, and will stop companies from nailing in innocent people's coffins.         Seth Harte, Burlington High School, Freshman, Finalist  I'm the kid that dreams of writing movies but is reluctant because I've heard too many stories of writers that fail. I love soccer and want to play in the MLS but know how few make it. I want to be an attorney someday but all I hear is how expensive it is to go to law school. All of this noise makes me feel like there is no way to succeed. But can't I try? I am starting to believe that we close the door before we can open it because defeat feels inevitable. Our society does not see the beauty in failing so we instead we just quit. I believe this is because of our history, our grading systems, and social media.  We learn from an elementary school age that we should never fail and this philosophy is exhibited repeatedly throughout our schooling and into adulthood. We are taught that to mess up is the worst thing we can do because we have survived so long with amindset that believes we will succeed. Although believing in ourselves is good it makes it hard for us to fail with dignity and the knowing that messing up is okay. According to MedBroadcast, one of the main reasons for suicide is because of failure. We just can not handle failing, in fact, we cannot deal with it so much that we end everything because of a setback.  Our grading system has made it so only a specific type of learner will succeed. It has also taught us that the word failure means that we have been defeated or we did something wrong. The reality is that if we tried we didn't fail. I believe that children should not be punished for that. Psychology Today said that one of the leading reasons for stress for students was the need to get A's. I believe that Vermont should lean toward proficiency-based learning because it gets away from the letter grade and lets kids learn at their own pace.  Social media has taken the 21st-century teens by a storm. According to a 2015 study, the Washington Post said that teens consume nine hours a day of social media. As a teenager myself, I constantly see examples of people showing off their success which is nice; however, it makes a lot of people feel bad about themselves. We should work towards a goal of producing more positive content.  Our views of failure are false and missed interpreted, however, if you can treat failure as not what we've been taught all our lives but treat it as a way to improve as a human race and individuals we will grow tremendously know that one failure will not determine your life, getting straight A's are not needed to succeed and that there is more behind what looks like that perfect photo. If I can go through life believing this I know I will become that pro soccer player, that attorney or that writer.       Alexis Jablonski, St. Johnsbury Academy, Senior, Finalist  Aldous Huxley, the author of ``Brave New World,'' seems to have predicted the Trumpian era of disillusion and fear of immigrants. However, the basic idea of welcoming immigrants is central to our way of life; our diversity makes us stronger. Unfortunately, these values are being threatened. Current immigration policy is shifting toward exclusion of immigrant populations and has awakened an anti-immigrant sentiment that does not align with the historical importance of immigration in the U.S. These concepts are essential to America's identity of inclusivity, and they need to be protected as we have gone under such a dramatic shift in power and ideals. Trump continually spews blatant falsehoods which undermine that character of immigrant communities, in order to secure his campaign promise of a wall. It has become evident that our president will continue to use hateful rhetorical devices toward immigrant populations simply for his own benefit. When in fact, his beliefs and promises do not align with that of the American people. As demonstrated in Huxley's novel, when we isolate those we deem as the other, we are constricting our growth as a nation.  A prime example of an attempt to dehumanize and marginalize people through the news is Trump's commentary on the Migrants passage through Mexico. Trump has continually used fear tactics to dehumanize outsiders and justify our hostility toward them. The media typically presents the migrants through an overhead image of a crowd, thus neglecting their humanity. ``The Caravan'' is an excuse to not view people as human. According to our president, they are rapists, drug dealers, killers, deceitful, job stealing terrorists coming in by the thousands. This information is simply false, and aimed to incite fear among Americans. Unfortunately today, our President's hateful rhetoric toward outsiders has reframed our former charitable nature toward immigrant populations. The image of the migrant people must be adjusted. We must look at their faces to see their individual humanity, rather than a single entity.  We must remember the pillars by which our Nation was founded on, those of which make it great. The fundamental notion of inviting immigrants into our communities and providing them with equal opportunities to thrive is integral to our lifestyle. We have promised ourselves as Nation to provide stability to outsiders. We are an entire nation based on blended cultures and thoughts; these values are what offer us strength.  During Donald Trump's presidential campaign Americans were fascinated by his explosive personality. Unfortunately, over the past two years, we have learned that was not merely a campaign tactic. His continual attacks on American democracy have activated catalysts for change. We will no longer stand by, entranced and misinformed. We must encourage activism and open discussion to promote understanding, we must evaluate our media consumption and make educated decisions, and we must actively seek the truth, in a world that is overwhelming us with inflamed rhetoric. Only then, will we escape this self-inflicted Brave New World.      Simon Rosenbaum, Vermont Commons School, Freshman, Finalist  When I was thirteen, I had twenty-one cents thrown at me. For a moment, I didn't process what was happening. I looked up to see one of my classmates looking back at me, waiting to see how I would react. I left the change on the table, and left the lunchroom in the direction of my next class. Instead, I shut myself in a bathroom stall and cried. My name is Simon Rosenbaum and I've been Jewish my entire life. I wear a yarmulke to school and often can't attend school events that are on Friday nights because they interfere with the sabbath. However, I haven't always practiced self-acceptance.  I began wearing a yarmulke halfway through seventh grade. I remember weeks of emotional preparation for the snide remarks and lost friends that were sure to come. Before the morning bell had even rung, my kippah had already been grabbed and torn off. This was the result of the few Jewish kids in the school pretending that they weren't Jewish for fear of retribution from their classmates. I'm sad to say that they were right. Vermont is an extremely non-diverse state. According to Pew Research Center, over 93% of Vermonters are white, and approximately 94% of Vermonters are Christian or have majority Christian heritage. Approximately two percent of Vermonters are Jewish, out of the eight to eleven percent of Vermonters that practice non-Christian faiths. These non-diverse societies lead to non-tolerant kids.  When I was in eighth grade, a paraeducator made Mein Kampf required reading for students who she did not believe were working hard enough. I later learned that she only engaged in this behavior around Jewish students. To this day, she works in a Vermont middle school after a school investigation ``didn't find any incriminating evidence''. Anti-Semitic incidents are far more commonplace in schools today then most educators like to admit. According to a study for The Washington Post, in 2018 a study reported that 69% of young Jews in America said that they had ``personally experienced discrimination because of their faith''. This is up from 39% in 2013 from the same study.  We can solve the issue of anti-Semitism in our schools by a variety of actions. We should begin by instituting diversity experts as consultants on three month pilot periods in every Vermont school to observe systematic and ignorance based anti-semitism. Those consultants would then make recommendations in the changing of diversity education to the school board. If the board were to refuse the recommendations by the consultant, the consultant could then appeal to the State Board of Education. Another course of action we should be taking is to create a zero-tolerance policy on anti-Semitism both inside and outside of schools. If kids are shown the right examples while seeing the wrong ones punished, then the precedent will be set for an effective change in our diversity education. No educated child or adult would ever take joy from a thirteen year old crying in the bathroom.           Andy Siki, Winooski High School, Senior, Finalist                             Climate Change  ``It's not enough to think it's important. We must make it urgent,'' says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman from New York.  Vermont is taking action on global warming by reducing energy use and investing in clean energy. It is accomplishing these goals by using low carbon transportation, protecting farms,making the community green and resilient, and recycling and composting. By 2050 Vermont should be using 90% of clean energy sources. I'm part of The Youth Lobby For Climate Change. We organize an annual rally at the State House to show legislators that young people care about their future. We talk about what we're doing right now, our future as a state, and what will help our communities.  In 2016 electricity made up 28% of emission in our environment. Solar power and other renewable energy sources can reduce that number. Vermont already started putting solar panels in homes, businesses, and schools to make a cleaner environment. Recently Elon Musk made a Tesla battery to store the energy from solar panels inside a house. The length of Vermont winters might make that storage difficult, but that's a problem we need to fix. By using solar energy, Vermont could reach the goal of using 90% renewable energy sources by 2050. Transportation makes up 28% of the CO2 emissions. And Vermont can reduce this greenhouse gas emission. We could have more bikes on the road, even an electric assisted bike and a bike path. Karl Kemnitzer works with solar bikes, and he said: ``Bikes and solar are a good combination, and it's also been a lot of fun! An average solar panel puts out around 16 watts per square foot . . . the bike is so efficient. I find that over a long term, I am using about 200 watts on average as I ride along.'' Kemnitzer now needs to fit enough solar panels on a bike. He's taking an engineering class and working on that problem.  Schools should start getting students involved in their community. Schools can help affect our environment by recycling, reducing, and composting food waste. At the Youth Climate Leaders Academy students from Vermont and New Hampshire came together to make goals for their schools. We worked on composting and made a goal to start composting by January 2019. We would start in our classrooms then move to the cafeteria.  Everyone wants to take action to change things but not everyone does. At the Climate Leaders Academy I learned that you have to start by making small changes and that will lead to big changes. If Vermonters fix the small problem in their communities, we can not only affect the whole state but also influence other states around us.   Ragulan Sivakumar, South Burlington High School, Junior, Finalist                             The Waste Land  In the year 2015, the United States produced 262.4 million tons of waste, 130.63 million tons of which were landfilled. That is equivalent to 2.23 lbs./day/American person of waste landfilled. Landfilling at such a great rate requires us to create new landfills, taking away from scenic beauty while also requiring us to use more natural resources to create new products, costing us with long-term sustainability as well. To address the United States' waste problem, taxes must be put on the producers of materials that become waste, a governmental recycling program must be created, and stricter recycling laws must be imposed.  Firstly, a landfill tax should be imposed on producers to reduce the net amount of waste. Landfills they take up areas that could otherwise be used and lose us many recyclable components, making them a detriment economically. Environmentally, landfills enhance climate change by forcing decomposition to occur anaerobically, producing methane, which, according to the EPA, is over 25 times as efficient as carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Since landfills hurt economically and environmentally, a landfill tax should be imposed by ton of waste. This tax would cause producers to reduce their landfill waste while also creating an incentive for corporations to create more sustainable and effective waste management programs. As the United Kingdom has shown, a landfill tax can be incredibly effective, reducing the number of landfills by 2/3 in 8 years. With the passing years, the tax could progressively increase, further incentivizing the movement from waste, reducing our waste problem all the while.  Secondly, a governmental recycling program should also be created to complement the landfill tax. While the waste-reducing reasons are obvious, the other incentive is that recycling is a massive industry. As China has shown, recycling is a $200 billion industry. Thus, the United States could create its own governmental recycling program via some of the revenue from the landfill tax project, providing countless jobs while also alleviating our waste problems by making waste management feasible. Moreover, the recycling program would obtain the base materials for industry through recycling which could then be resold off, making the entire ordeal economically viable while also reducing our waste.  Lastly, stricter recycling laws must be imposed. According to the EPA, only 67% of paper is recycled, 26% of glass, 34% of metals, and 9% of plastics, making it is obvious that stricter recycling laws are needed. Imposing a fine for violators would ensure that recycling guidelines are followed. Since no one would want to incur a fine for something so menial, stricter recycling laws would enable the U.S. to tackle the waste problem.  In summation, the U.S. has a waste problem and must address the issue. We cannot continue with 130.63 million tons of landfilled waste each year. By implementing the policies noted above, our country would no longer be ``the waste land'': it would be a model for the rest of the world in waste management.           Fiona Therese, Compass School, Sophomore, Finalist  There is a picture of me on the wall, near our kitchen table. It was taken when I was five years old and entering kindergarten. I was wearing a yellow dress and wearing a big sun hat. The girl standing next to me, Ashley, was leaning on me and smiling. She was to become my best friend.  School is supposed to be safe and fun. It's supposed to be where you learn about new things and experiment with new ideas. It's supposed to prepare you for challenges in the future. But today, too many of us are scared of school because we don't know what might happen while we are there. I was ten when I heard about the shooting in Sandy Hook. It was the first time I realized that school might also be unsafe and that someone might want to harm us. The state of our country is one of confusion for us, as students. We are expected to go to school trusting that nothing can happen. But the truth is, every day across the country there are reports of gun violence. Even in my small school, we have drills so that we'll know what to do if someone comes to school to attack us.  In 2018, 113 people have been killed or injured in a school shooting. On average, a shooting takes place at least once every eight days that school is in session. After a shooting takes place, I have heard what people express their sympathy through `thoughts and prayers.' The time for prayers is over. We need change. Children should not fear going to school. I should not have to look around my classroom and plan a possible escape. I should be able to go to school with the same optimism that I had when I was five.  The state of our union is one of fear because our country has not passed adequate gun control. How many people need to speak out about their lost children, family or friends before a change happens?  Guns rights advocates argue that our right to bear arms is protected in the Constitution. I disagree. I believe that the Constitution is a living document, one that transcribes our aspirations and hope. In a letter to James Madison in 1789, Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``No society can make a perpetual constitution. The earth belongs always to the living generation and not to the dead.'' It is time to demand change. The state of our union might be one of fear, but I have also seen hope. The hope that I see comes not from our legislature in Washington, D.C., but in the protests across the country. My generation is on the move. We are working hard to make our country and our schools safe again. Although these are difficult times, I have seen that even young people can be powerful when they work together. The state of our union is in the hands of those who protest, those who march, those who write letters, and those who demand change. So what is the state of our union? It's one where fear must be met with strength and I'm proud to be a member of a generation who is rising up to meet the challenges that lie ahead.               Henry Wu, Essex High School, Junior, Finalist  It is the year 2060. You and your grandchildren are watching the charred Earth slowly recede from view within your space capsule. ``What happened?'' they ask. You breathe a deep sigh fraught with regret and anger as you reluctantly tell the story of the Earth's demise.``It all began in the 1970s . . . .''  When Exxon researchers learned that the burning of fossil fuels influences climate, they hid their findings from the public. Other fossil fuel companies were complicit in denying the existence of the greenhouse effect for decades. Today, the oil and coal industries are still the main drivers of carbon emissions, and $20 billion in annual U.S. government subsidies perpetuates our dependence on them.  ``Our hunger for oil and coal was insatiable. We ate and ate, but it poisoned us. We loved our cars and our plastics, but they killed us . . . .''  The use of fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and plastic production releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat. Rising global temperatures and more severe and frequent natural disasters have already devastated human lives. In as few as twelve years, rising sea levels and droughts will lead to severe food shortages, heightened political instability, and widespread poverty. A recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found that limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 deg.C, the target of the Paris Agreement, will still cause $54 trillion in damage.  ``Back in Vermont, I was a teenager when I first noticed the unbearable summer heat that made breathing difficult and forgot what a white Christmas felt like. These were merely inconveniences, but that all change in a few years. The searing wildfires and crippling hurricanes that made headlines in California and the Carolinas soon became commonplace. Entire cities vanished from the map because they were submerged underwater. Could we have avoided this?''  The efforts of individuals--taking shorter showers, using public transit, going vegetarian--can only do so much, but it's large companies that wield influence over our government and society. A carbon tax that fines businesses for pollution is an effective method of keeping them in check. It's a regenerative economic measure that could fund renewable energy research and implementation.  However, ordinary citizens still must help avoid catastrophe. In the end, our politicians and business leaders have a say in our nation's energy infrastructure, but it is our duty to convince them to adopt necessary changes. We must write to our members of Congress and tell them to resist corporate power. We must elect officials who will champion a carbon tax, and we must fulfill our end of the deal in giving up fossil fuels for renewable energy sources. So, what story will we tell our grandchildren? A lament of despair and regret, or a tale of teamwork and hope? The decisions we make today will provide the answer. Breaking our fossil fuel addiction and investing in renewables are drastic yet necessary efforts. The best time for action was forty years ago, but the next best time is now.                          ____________________
