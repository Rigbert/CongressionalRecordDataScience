You could just as well have been talking about Sam Walton, Hunt, and many others.  I do not know what it is about northwest Arkansas, that these great entrepreneurs who changed the world seem to all come from that area, as the Senator from Arkansas knows. I am very familiar with that area, since my daughter Molly is a professor at the University of Arkansas.  I have been over there many times. I was just listening to you describe the life of Don Tyson and how consistent that is with many of the other entrepreneurs. I salute all those guys up there and you for bringing that to the floor.
