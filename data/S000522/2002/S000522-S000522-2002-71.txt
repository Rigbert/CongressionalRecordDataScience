Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 513) recognizing the historical significance and timeliness of the United States-Ireland Business Summit, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 513       Whereas from September 4, 2002, to September 6, 2002, the      United States-Ireland Business Summit was held at the Ronald      Reagan Building International Trade Center in Washington      D.C.;       Whereas global economic change and the war against      international terrorism have challenged industries and      governments throughout the world to look at new ways to      resolve conflicts, eliminate barriers, and expand markets;       Whereas the Summit brought together senior level corporate,      government, and academic leaders from across the United      States, Ireland, and Northern Ireland for discussions on      economic competitiveness and important issues that are      confronting the sectors of information and communications      technology, biotechnology, and financial services in the      United States and European markets;       Whereas the discussions focused on new public and private      sector priorities, market development and entry, regulatory      issues, and opportunities for joint ventures and economic      growth, generating alliances between businesses with      operations in the United States, Ireland, and Northern      Ireland;       Whereas increased economic growth and job creation in      Northern Ireland can further help promote the peace and      shared governance under the terms of the Good Friday      Agreement of 1998;       Whereas President George W. Bush has offered a compelling      new vision for peace in Northern Ireland that emphasizes      private sector leadership and innovation to restore economic      vitality and cooperation;       Whereas the United States-Ireland Business Summit was a      bold step toward making the vision of President Bush a      reality and creating new opportunities in the United States,      Ireland, and Northern Ireland; and       Whereas approximately 44,000,000 citizens of the United      States identify themselves as having Irish ancestry and the      United States has a strong and enduring interest in      maintaining close ties with the people of Ireland and in      supporting efforts to ensure peace, justice, and prosperity      in Northern Ireland: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Congress recognizes the historical      significance and timeliness of the United States-Ireland      Business Summit held in Washington, D.C. from September 4,      2002, to September 6, 2002.
