President, Vermonters are rightfully proud of their new chief justice of the Vermont supreme court, Jeffrey L. Amestoy.  Chief Justice Amestoy--a Republican who left behind a distinguished tenure as Vermont's attorney general when he accepted the nomination to Vermont's highest judicial post by Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat--was administered the oath of office by Governor Dean on January 31 in Montpelier.  I was one of many who were present as Chief Justice Amestoy delivered the traditional inaugural address in the chamber of the Vermont House of Representatives. It was more than a speech to be heard. It was also a speech to be felt. He offered an illuminating, uplifting, heartfelt, and deeply personal tapestry that deservedly will long be remembered.  Governor Dean has said, ``The most important things in a judge are integrity, compassion, and hard work.'' All who know Jeffrey Amestoy and all who heard him speak on that wintry Vermont afternoon know how abundantly those qualities are present in our new chief justice.  I join all Vermonters in offering congratulations to Chief Justice Amestoy, to Jeff's wife, Susan Lonergan Amestoy, to their three daughters, Katie, Christina, and Nancy, and to Jeff's mother, Diana Wood Amestoy. All were on hand for the stirring ceremony in Montpelier.
