 President, I rise today to salute an outstanding group of young women who have been honored with the Girl Scout Gold Award. The Gold Award is the highest achievement a Girl Scout can earn and symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14 to 17, or in grades 9 to 12.  The young ladies from Kentucky who will receive this honor are: Jeanette Vonseal Allison, Julia Carter, Michelle Clark, Carla Cornett, Rachel N. Duncan, Staci Hurt, Lisa Jones, Laura Roberts, Julie Slone, Mollie CarolSmith, Anna Elizabeth Smoot, and Laura Camille Wilson from the Wilderness Road Girl Scout Council.  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, as well as design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is created by the senior Girl Scout and is carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.  Mr. President, I ask you and my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to these outstanding young ladies. They deserve recognition for their contributions to their community and their country and I wish them continued success in the years ahead.                          ____________________
