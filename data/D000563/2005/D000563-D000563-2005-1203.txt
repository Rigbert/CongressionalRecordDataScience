This is something that is growing in intensity and seriousness. It has been overlooked in previous wars. Our veterans have come home with scars that are not visible but which are serious and affect their lives. I am happy to hear the amendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania, as well as the Senator from Washington, is going to address this important challenge. I thank them for their leadership on both sides of the aisle.
