 Last year, the chairman wisely and judiciously included funding in his bill for a third Maritime Patrol Aircraft. This year, the subcommittee bill includes a total of $15.25 million for the Maritime Patrol Aircraft requirement. This amount, together with available balances from previous appropriated funds for maritime patrol purposes, will enable the Coast Guard to place the third CN-235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft under contract and to fund long-lead items for the next series of CN-235 aircraft to be purchased, thereby reducing the cost of these next aircraft.
