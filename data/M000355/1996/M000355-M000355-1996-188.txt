 President, the Market Access Program [MAP] is critical to the success of the 1996 farm bill and to continued agricultural growth. MAP is one of the few programs specifically allowed under the Uruguay Round agreement and not subject to any reduction. Many countries are increasingly pursuing policies to help their agricultural industries to maintain and expand their share of the world market. Now is not the time for the United States to continue to unilaterally eliminate or reduce MAP.  MAP is a key to helping boost U.S. agricultural exports, strengthening farm income, promoting economic growth and creating jobs. I urge your support to ensure programs such as MAP be fully funded. Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the motion to table the Bryan amendment.
