Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of the Operation Recognition Class of 2017. Operation Recognition is a program organized by the Riverside County Office of Education, with assistance from the Riverside County Department of Veteran's Services, that presents diplomas to residents of Riverside County who missed completing high school due to military service in World War II, the Korean War, or the Vietnam War, or due to internment in WWII Japanese-American relocation camps.  Riverside County's Operation Recognition is modeled after programs implemented in other states. Numerous county offices of education and school districts throughout California operate similar programs. The programs are yet another way to express our appreciation and gratitude for the significant contributions and sacrifices made by our veterans.  The Operation Recognition Class of 2017 includes: Timothy Lewis Basquez, San Jacinto, U.S, Marine Corps, Vietnam War; Manuel Blunt, Riverside, U.S. Army, Vietnam War; Edward J. Clark, Norco, U.S. Marine Corps, Korean War, Joseph J. Harrison, Perris, U.S. Army, Vietnam War, Bradford Hotchkiss, Riverside, U.S. Navy, Vietnam War, James Andrew Morrison, Canyon Lake, U.S. Navy, Korean War; and Mack Donald Salesky San Jacinto, U.S. Army, Vietnam War.  On behalf of all Riverside County residents and a grateful nation, I want to thank these veterans for their service to our country and congratulate them on being part of the Operation Recognition Class of 2017.                          ____________________
