President, I am pleased today to introduce the Refugee Protection Act of 2010. This week marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Refugee Act, which was signed into law on March 17, 1980. In the years since, our statute and case law have evolved in ways that place unnecessary and harmful barriers before genuine refugees and asylum seekers. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Levin of Michigan, will restore the U.S. as a beacon of hope for those who suffer from persecution around the world.
