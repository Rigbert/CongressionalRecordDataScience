 As I said on the floor a little earlier today, this was a good week. We passedan education bill in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. Just a few minutes ago, we passed an infrastructure-highway transportation bill with overwhelming bipartisan support.  I hope America feels good about what we have been able to do this week, and I hope America and I and others can feel good about what we will do next week.  Unless the gentleman has any further comments, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
