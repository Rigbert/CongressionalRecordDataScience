 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, the Health Savings Accountability Act we would hope to get to sometime next week, but this is a bill that is just being marked up, I think today; and we do have a very ambitious schedule for next week, and we just wanted to warn the Members that the Health Savings Accountability Act could very well be brought up, if we can find time next week to do so. But the other list of major pieces of legislation will take priority over that, and we hope to get to it; but I really cannot say what day we might get to it.
