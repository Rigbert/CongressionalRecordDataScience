BOXER. My friend is so right. He has a small State. I come from a large State, more than 30 million people. So, I say to my friend, imagine, if you took Vermont and put it into California, and you had many Vermonts to make up all of California, that is what this Senator is feeling. Because for each Vermonter that gets hurt, many more Californians get hurt. So I totally agree with my friend.
