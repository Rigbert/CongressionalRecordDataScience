 President, I would like to take a few moments today to pay tribute to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, or EBRI, on the occasion of its 30th anniversary. EBRI is a well-known, nonpartisan research institution providing invaluable analysis, briefings, and publications on health and retirement issues, which are critically important to both America's workers and the employers that sponsor these benefits. The high-quality and objective work done by EBRI has won it respect within the halls of Congress, among members on both sides of the aisle in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. On EBRI's anniversary, I wish to register my appreciation for its work and my admiration for its commitment to issues relating to employee benefits. I commend EBRI for the valuable contribution the institution has made to policymaking in the all-important areas of retirement, health, and economic security, and wish EBRI continued success in the future.                          ____________________
