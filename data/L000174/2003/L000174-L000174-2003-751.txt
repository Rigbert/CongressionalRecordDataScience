President, I will speak for a few minutes regarding the debate on Mr. Estrada. The reason I say this, when I came on the floor I heard a great deal of discussion about the Hispanic National Bar Association. I heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle the current president of the Hispanic National Bar Association has led the support of this organization for Mr. Estrada's nomination, which is so. However, it jogged my memory that this morning I received a letter from 15 former presidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association. These 15 take an entirely different position than the current president: 15 well-respected former national leaders of this important bar association. They date back to the founding of it in 1972.  They have written to the Senate to oppose this nomination. They wrote to Senator Hatch and they wrote to Senator Frist, as well as to Senator Daschle and myself. I am sure the speakers earlier this morning, when they spoke of the importance of the position of the president of the Hispanic National Bar Association, were probably not aware that but one is in favor of Mr. Estrada and 15 were opposed. It is very weighty opposition for 15 prior presidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association, based on the criteria to evaluate judicial nominees that this association has formally used since 1991, which has been the practical standard for the past 30 years, to make this assessment.  In addition to the candidate's professional experience and temperament, the criteria for endorsement includes the extent to which a candidate has been involved, supportive of, and responsive to the issues, needs, and concerns of Hispanic Americans and, secondly, the candidate's demonstrated commitment to the concept of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law.  In the view of the overwhelming majority of the living past presidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association, Mr. Estrada's record does not provide evidence that meets those criteria. But they say his candidacy ``falls short in these respects.''  They conclude:       We believe that for many reasons including: his virtually      non-existent written record, his verbally expressed and      unrebutted extreme views, his lack of judicial or academic      teaching experience (against which his fairness, reasoning      skills and judicial philosophy could be properly tested), his      poor judicial temperament, his total lack of any connection      whatsoever to, or lack of demonstrated interest in the      Hispanic community, his refusals to answer even the most      basic questions about civil rights and constitutional law,      his less than candid responses to other straightforward      questions of Senate Judiciary Committee members, and because      of the Administration's refusal to provide the Judiciary      Committee the additional information and cooperation it needs      to address these concerns, the United States Senate cannot      and must not conclude that Mr. Estrada can be a fair and      impartial appellate court judge.  This is a significant letter because during the tenure of these past presidents, the Hispanic National Bar Association has had a fair nonpartisan record of following its criteria, and endorsing or not endorsing or rejecting nominees, regardless of whether the nominee is Republican or Democrat. They follow the same criteria for Republicans and Democrats. The HNBA has been at the forefront of the effort to increase diversity on the Federal bench and improve the public confidence among Hispanics and others in the fairness of the Federal courts. They have supported Republican nominees as well as Democratic nominees. But these 15 individuals, who devoted a great deal of time in their legal careers to advancing the careers of Hispanics in the legal community, have felt compelled publicly to oppose the Estrada nomination, although they publicly supported both Democrats and Republicans before. This one they opposed.  I ask unanimous consent the letter that was sent to me, to Senator Hatch, to Senator Frist, and to Senator Daschle be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          HNBA's Past Presidents' Statement, February 21, 2003       We the undersigned past presidents of the Hispanic National      Bar Association write in strong opposition to the nomination      of Miguel A. Estrada for a judgeship on the Court of Appeals      for the District of Columbia Circuit.       Since the HNBA's Establishment in 1972, promoting civil      rights and advocating for judicial appointments of qualified      Hispanic Americans throughout our nation have been our      fundamental concerns. Over the years, we have had a proven      and respected record of endorsing or not endorsing or      rejecting nominees on a non-partisan basis of both Republican      and Democratic presidents.       In addition to evaluating a candidate's professional      experience and judicial temperament, the HNBA's policies and      procedures governing judicial endorsements have required that      the following additional criteria be considered:       1. The extent to which a candidate has been involved in,      supportive of, and responsive to the issues, needs and      concerns of Hispanic Americans, and       2. The candidate's demonstrated commitment to the concept      of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law.       Based upon our review and understanding of the totality of      Mr. Estrada's record and life's experiences, we believe that      there are more than enough reasons to conclude that Mr.      Estrada's candidacy falls short in these respects. We believe      that for many reasons including: his virtually non-existent      written record, his verbally expressed and un-rebutted      extreme views, his lack of judicial or academic teaching      experience, (against which his fairness, reasoning skills and      judicial philosophy could be properly tested), his poor      judicial temperament, his total lack of any connection      whatsoever to, or lack of demonstrated interest in the      Hispanic community, has refusals to answer even the most      basic questions about civil rights and constitutional law,      his less than candid responses to other straightforward      questions of Senate Judiciary Committee members, and because      of the Administration's refusal to provide the Judiciary      Committee the additional information and cooperation it needs      to address these concerns, the United States Senate cannot      and must not conclude that Mr. Estrada can be a fair and      impartial appellate court judge.           Respectfully submitted,       Signed by 15 past HNBA presidents.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
