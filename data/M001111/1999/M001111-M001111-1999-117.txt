 I was out in one of my school buildings last Monday, a school in Tacoma, where they have taken their class-size money for first, second, and third grades and put it all into the first grade, and the first grade teachers have 15 students.  Each one of those kids in those 57 classrooms will read at the end of this year. You can see it in 10 days of classroom instruction. These kids were moving ahead rapidly, and they were going to be reading. Contrast that with a class of 30 kids where maybe part will be able to read at the end of the year and, obviously, some will not. They move on to second grade, and the second grade teacher starts all the way back at the beginning with the kids who are at the bottom.  These 57 classrooms and those 15 kids in each of those classrooms will know how to read, and that second grade teacher next year can move them on from there. It is going to make a tremendous difference.  Those teachers pleaded with me not to lose funds so they can continue to do the job they have been trained to do.
