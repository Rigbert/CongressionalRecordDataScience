President, I want to take a moment today to thank a friend and a remarkable public servant. John Spring ended his second term as mayor of Quincy, IL, earlier this week.  Mayor Spring led Quincy through some of its most difficult times in recent memory. Under his leadership, Quincy weathered record floods and the Great Recession. Not only did Quincy survive these crises, the city actually came out stronger than before.  Any elected official would be proud of that record. It is even more impressive in Mayor Spring's case because he was a political rookie. He had never won public office before the people of Quincy elected him mayor in 2005. His only previous public service experience was a stint as the appointed chairman of Quincy's Police and Fire Commission.  For many of us, it takes a few tries before we actually win a race. But John is a natural. He won his first election.  Quincy, IL, is a river town. It sits right on the banks of the Mississippi River. At one point this past winter the river was so low that barge traffic was in danger of being halted.  During Mayor Spring's final weeks in office, however, heavy rains swelled the river to flood stage. When flooding threatened the city's water and wastewater treatment facilities, Mayor Spring and his team immediately put into place emergency procedures they had honed during previous floods. With leadership, hard work and a lot of sandbags, Quincy weathered the storm.  In 2008, during an earlier flood, then-Senator Barack Obama and I visited Quincy to lend support. We were inspired to see how the entire city came together to protect their homes and their neighbors' homes and businesses.  In 2010, Mayor Spring was able to welcome President Obama back to Quincy and show him how Quincy had weathered not only rainstorms, but the economic storm caused by the Great Recession.  Mr. President, the unemployment rate today in Quincy and Adams County is 6.6 percent. That rate is among the lowest in the State of Illinois, and that is no accident. Under Mayor John Spring's leadership, Quincy has continued to be the economic engine of the Tri-State area.  John Spring led the effort to lay a solid foundation for economic growth. He balanced the city's budget every year and didn't raise taxes--not even once. In fact, Quincy reduced its property tax rate in 7 out of Mayor Spring's 8 years in office.  He made tough, smart decisions that enabled Quincy to maintain adequatefunding for basic services such as police, fire, and streets. He downsized city government, reducing the workforce by more than 12 percent, implemented an early retirement program that is estimated will save the City more than $5 million, and built up the City's reserve funds.  He worked aggressively to retain and attract businesses and good jobs, and he made transportation a top priority. Amtrak expanded service between Quincy and Chicago after Mayor Spring and others advocated for more downstate Illinois passenger rail. Cape Air, a partner of American Airlines/American Eagle, expanded its Quincy-St. Louis service, recently crossing the 10,000-passenger mark. Mayor Spring also worked with Cape Air CEO Dan Wolf and regional economic development leaders to open a maintenance facility at the airport, creating a number of good-paying local jobs.  John Spring had big shoes to fill in 2005. His predecessor, Mayor Chuck Scholz, served as Quincy's mayor for 12 years and left a record of success. John Spring built on that record. Chuck Scholz helped bring Quincy into the 21st century, and John Spring positioned Quincy even more firmly to compete and win in this century's global economy.  I mentioned that Mayor Spring was a political rookie. He spent most of his career--nearly 30 years--as a teacher, counselor and coach at Quincy Notre Dame High School. In his final post at the school, as director of the Quincy Notre Dame Foundation, he was instrumental in the survival of this Catholic high school which is so important to Quincy.  Mayor Spring has been active in many other community organizations and efforts, from the Salvation Army to the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial and exchanges with Quincy's Sister City, Herford, Germany.  In January 2010, John Spring called a press conference at which he announced with his typical honesty and humility that he had prostate cancer. He recalled that when he ran for mayor he had pledged that serving the city of Quincy was his highest priority and he said that nothing, not even cancer, would keep him from serving the city he loved. He began a 9-week course of radiation treatments--about 15 minutes every weekday morning--and reported to City Hall for work after every session  I am happy to report that John's health is good and that he more than lived up to his pledge of putting the people of Quincy first.  Quincy's nickname is Gem City. In John Spring, they have had a gem of a mayor. I will miss working with Mayor Spring, but I know that he has earned a break from public service. I wish John and his wife Karen and their children and grandchildren all the best. And I would simply say to them: Thank you for lending the city of Quincy your husband, father, and grandfather. He has made Quincy's future much brighter. His energy, dedication, and effective leadership will be missed at City Hall and by all of us who worked with him.                          ____________________
