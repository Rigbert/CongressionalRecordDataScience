 President, the Deepwater Port Act gives Governors the right of veto over an LNG port 3 miles or more offshore, but this bill prevents them from having any authority if there is a proposal for an LNG terminal right on State land, right in the heart of a metropolitan area, right where it presents a danger to citizens, right where it could present an environmental disaster. This is an idiosyncracy which is wrong. All we have done is replicate the Deepwater Port Act's authority.  The other point I wish to make is there is in this bill the right of appeal. There is the right of the Commerce Department to step in and reverse anything a State does in this regard. There will be LNG terminals sited, let there be no doubt about it. The key is to site them smartly, to site them where they make the best sense.  I thank the Chair.
