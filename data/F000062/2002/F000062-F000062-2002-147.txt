 One of the things that has struck me is the belief that there is no harm from ethanol when in fact studies on this issue have not been done to a great extent.  I would ask the Senator if she has comments about yesterday's hearing on the House side. Yesterday, Professor Gordon Rauser of the University of California commented on the potential harm of ethanol on ground water. This was before a House committee.  He said that research now strongly suggests that the presence of ethanol in gasoline not only delays its degradation of benzene but also lengthens the benzene plumes which run out by between 25 and 100 percent.  I think it is very important that the Record shows there is scientific evidence that benzene plumes can go up as much as 100 percent and travel 100 percent more in distance because of ethanol.  That suggests ethanol may not be as safe as its proponents would have you believe.
