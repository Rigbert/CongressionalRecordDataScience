 Mr. President, recently in the newly passed highway bill, TEA-21, the Secretary of the Army was directed to transfer the right, title and interest of the St. Georges Bridge in Delaware, to the State of Delaware. The transfer is necessary to facilitate a retransfer of the bridge to a private entity for the purposes of demonstrating the effectiveness of large-scale composites technology. If the transfer is completed within 180 days the Secretary is directed to provide $10,000,000 to the State for rehabilitating the bridge.  I rise to ask the Senator from Nevada, in his capacity as Ranking member of the Subcommittee, to seek his commitment in working with me and the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that this transfer and the $10 million payment occurs as authorized.
