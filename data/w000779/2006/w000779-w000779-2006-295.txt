President, I ask the Senator from Washington to modify her unanimous consent request so that at the conclusion of Senator Salazar's offering his amendment, not only would I be recognized but that we would again be dealing with my specific amendment so I would not lose the opportunity to come back to my amendment which is before the Senate after Senator Salazar has completed. So it would require a unanimous consent modification.
