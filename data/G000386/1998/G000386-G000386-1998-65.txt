 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, September 23. I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Wednesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved, no resolutions come over under the rule, the call of the calendar be waived, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate then resume consideration of S. 1301, the bankruptcy bill.
