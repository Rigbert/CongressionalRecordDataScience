 Sometime we will talk about the difference.  Mr. President, I did not vote for the $3 trillion war in Iraq. I did not vote for the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. I did not vote for the Medicare Part D Program which drove up the deficit altogether as a matter of fact. I suspect my friend may have voted the other way on all of those issues which were not paid for.  In terms of ExxonMobil, let's be clear. I don't know what ExxonMobil told my colleague, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record what ExxonMobil told the Securities and Exchange Commission, the SEC. What is reported by the SEC for 2009 is they received a $156 million refund. That is the SEC.  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            United States Securities and Exchange Commission      Form 10-K--Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of                   the Securities Exchange Act of 1934                                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--18.
