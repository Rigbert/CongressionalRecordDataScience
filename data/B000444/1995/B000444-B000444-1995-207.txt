 The science of refrigeration is not precise enough that you can get it within 2 degrees. So although they give you an ideal number of 26, they say that is when crystal began to form, they also say, if I am not mistaken, there are not refrigeration units made that can guarantee you can keep it at exactly 27 as opposed to 26 or 25 or 25 as opposed to 23.  So I would ask my friend the following question. Assume the issue here were to say 26 degrees plus or minus 3 degrees. Would she be willing to go along with that? Or is she stuck on precisely 27 degrees? Because the Senator from Delaware would be willing to go along with 26 degrees plus or minus 3 degrees, mainly because there is not the science in refrigeration that you can put a product in the back of a truck, send it off to be sold in California or anywhere else and be assured that for the duration of that trip it will not fluctuate several degrees above or below.  I might add, the reason why the producers are split in my State, the producers who sell only on the east coast think this is a good idea. The producers that sell in California say: I cannot get my product across guaranteeing it is exactly a certain temperature--I cannot assert, and the technology cannot guarantee me when I put it in the truck, that I can keep it within the rule no matter what I tell you.
