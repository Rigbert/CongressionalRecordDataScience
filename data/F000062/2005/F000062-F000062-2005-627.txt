 President, I rise today to offer a resolution with Senators Snowe, McCain, Chafee, Murray, Jeffords, Durbin, Lieberman, Leahy, Lautenberg, Boxer, Cantwell, Akaka and Reed that urges the Administration to participate in international negotiations and actively reduce our greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.  The Kyoto Protocol goes into effect today. More than 140 nations, including all 25 members of the European Union, Russia and China, have ratified the agreement to reduce man-made emissions of greenhouse gases.  The United States, which accounts for about one-fourth of the greenhouse gases believed responsible for global warming, has refused to ratify the treaty.  Thirty-five of the world's thirty-eight industrialized countries--except for the United States, Australia, and Monaco--have ratified this important treaty.  This means that industrialized nations are bound to cut their combined greenhouse gases by 5 percent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.  The United States is missing an important opportunity to protect our planet's environment by not ratifying the Protocol.  I believe this is a huge mistake.  There is emerging consensus that global warming is real.  According to the National Academy of Sciences, ``Since the 1900s global average temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration have increased dramatically, particularly compared to their levels in the 900 preceding years.''  Scientists now agree on three main Facts about global warming.  Fact 1: The Earth is warming.  Fact 2: The primary cause of this warming is man-made activities, especially fossil fuel consumption.  Fact 3: If we don't act now to reduce emissions, the problem will only get worse.  We have already begun to see the impacts of climate change: four hurricanes of significant force pounded the state of Florida in a six week period last fall. The storms formed over an area of the ocean where surface temperatures have increased an average of 17 degrees over the past decade.  Eskimos are being forced inland in Alaska as their native homes on the coastline are melting into the sea.  Glaciers are beginning to disappear in Glacier National Park in Montana. In 100 years, the Park has gone from having 150 glaciers to fewer than 30. And the 30 that remain are two-thirds smaller than they once were.  In California, water supplies are threatened by smaller snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada. Record snowfalls this winter have provided hope for this summer but the region still could face drought or floods unless temperatures stay cold enough to maintain the snowpack and average snowfall continues for the rest of the precipitation season.  If we take strong action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there will be 27 percent snowpack remaining in the Sierras at the end of the century.  However, if we do nothing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, there will only be 11 percent snowpack left in the Sierras at the end of the century.  The San Diego based Scripps Institution of Oceanography, a preeminent center for marine science research, will release a study later this week showing that global warming will likely have serious ramifications in the very near future, including: a water crisis in the western United States in the next 20 years due to smaller snowpacks.  The disappearance of the glaciers in the Andes in Peru in as little as 10 years, leaving the population without an adequate water supply during the summer.  The melting of two-thirds of the glaciers in western China by 2050, seriously diminishing the water supply for the region's 300 million inhabitants.  Further, the UN Comprehensive Assessment of Freshwater Resources of the World estimates that by 2025, around 5 billion people, out of a totalworld population of 8 billion, will not have access to adequate water supplies.  And concern about the effects of climate change is mounting around the world.  Scientists fear that an ``ecological catastrophe'' is developing in Tibet with the melting of the region's glaciers as a result of global warming.  Glaciers in West Antarctica are thinning twice as fast as they did in the 1990s  The mean air temperature has risen 4-5 degrees in Alaska in the past three decades causing glaciers to melt and the coastline to recede.  Peru's Quelccaya ice cap, the largest in the tropics, could be gone by 2100 if it continues to melt at its current rate--contracting more than 600 feet a year in some places.  In addition, according to National Geographic, ``the famed snows of Kilimanjaro have melted more than 80 percent since 1912. Glaciers in the Garhwal Himalaya in India are retreating so fast that researchers believe that most central and eastern Himalayan glaciers could virtually disappear by 2035. Arctic sea ice has thinned significantly over the past half century, and its extent has declined by about 10 percent in the past 30 years. Greenland's ice sheet is shrinking.''  The Pew Center for Climate Change reports strong evidence of global warming in the United States. The findings included: the red fox has shifted its habitat northward, where it is encroaching on the Arctic fox's range.  Southern, warm-water fish have begun to infiltrate waters off Monterey, California, which were previously dominated by colder-water species.  The Alaskan tundra, which has for thousands of years been a depository for carbon dioxide, has begun to release more of the gas into the air than it removes because warmer winters are causing stored plant matter to decompose.  There have been documented trends in which the natural timing of animal or insect life cycles changed and the plants on which they depended did not. Many Southern species of butterflies have disappeared entirely over the past century as their range contracted.  According to the International Climate Change Taskforce, of which Senator Snowe is a Co-Chair, if the earth's average temperature increases by more than 2 degres Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the world could face substantial agricultural losses, countless people at risk of water shortages, and widespread adverse health impacts such as malaria.  Even more critically, if the temperature rises more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, we could be at risk for catastrophic/weather events. For instance, we would risk losing the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, which could raise sea levels, shut down the Gulf Stream, and destroy the world's forests.  Climate change is real. Its impacts are already being felt. If emissions keep growing at projected levels, greenhouse gases in our atmosphere will reach levels unknown since the time of the dinosaurs during the lifetimes of children born today.  That is why my colleagues and I have introduced this resolution that: Urges the Administration to engage in international discussions on post-Kyoto greenhouse gas reductions.  Calls upon the Administration to take action NOW to reduce emissions domestically.  Encourages the United States to keep global average temperatures from increasing more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit over pre-industrial levels.  As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, it is the responsibility of the United States to lead by example. By not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, we have sent a harsh message to the world that the largest emitter and contributor to global warming refuses to participate in a worldwide program aimed at reducing greenhouse gases.  But fortunately, even though the federal government has refused to acknowledge global warming, many States have recognized that in spite of the federal government's inaction, action must be taken.  Nearly 40 States have developed their own climate plans.  A emission trading system is emerging in the Northeast that will require large power plants from Maine to Delaware to reduce their carbon emissions.  Eighteen States and Washington, DC have enacted renewable portfolio standards. They include Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and Wisconsin.  California has enacted legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle tailpipes--it is expected that the Northeastern States and Canada will also follow California's lead.  Yet without concerted Federal action, the United States will not be able to achieve real, significant greenhouse gas reductions.  As the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, we must act now to reduce the impacts of climate change and save the environment for future generations.  The Kyoto Protocol ends in 2012. Though the Protocol ends, the United States needs to lead and move to negotiate a post-Kyoto framework. There are many things we can do. For example, we can: use our forests and our farmland as a depository for carbon to prevent it from being released into the atmosphere; develop new technologies such as clean coal, renewable energy, and hydrogen vehicles; make better use of existing technologies such as hybrid vehicles and energy efficient buildings, appliances, and power generation; and use market-based programs, such as cap and trade, to reduce emissions with the least harm to economy.  Being a responsible steward of the climate is more than just taking steps to pollute less. It also requires participating in international negotiations on the policies the world will need to achieve significant, long-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 5       Whereas in May 1992, the Senate gave advice and consent to      the ratification of the United Nations Framework Convention      on Climate Change with the intent of reducing global manmade      emissions of greenhouse gases, which committed the United      States (along with other developed countries) to a nonbinding      target of containing emissions levels at 1990 rates by 2000;       Whereas the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate      Change was signed by President George Herbert Walker Bush and      took effect in March 1994;       Whereas in December 1997, at the United Nations Framework      Convention on Climate Change conference of the parties, the      Kyoto Protocol, which set targets for reductions in the      greenhouse gas emissions of industrialized countries, was      established based on principles described in the 1992      framework agreement;       Whereas on February 16, 2005, the Kyoto Protocol will take      effect, at which time more than 30 industrialized countries      will be legally bound to meet quantitative targets for      reducing or limiting the greenhouse gas emissions of those      countries, an international carbon trading market will be      established through an emissions trading program (which was      originally proposed by the United States and enables any      industrialized country to buy or sell emissions credits), and      the clean development mechanism, which provides opportunities      to invest in projects in developing countries that limit      emissions while promoting sustainable development, will begin      full operation;       Whereas 141 nations (including Canada, China, the European      Union, India, Japan, and Russia) have ratified the Kyoto      Protocol;       Whereas the United States is the only member of the Group      of 8 that has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol;       Whereas, according to the National Academy of Sciences,      ``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as      a result of human activities, causing surface air      temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise . . .      Human-induced warming and associated sea level rises are      expected to continue through the 21st century.'';       Whereas the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency stated that ``Scientists know for certain that human      activities are changing the composition of Earth's      atmosphere. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases, like      carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere since pre-industrial times      have been well documented. There is no doubt this atmospheric      buildup of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is      largely the result of human activities.'';       Whereas major scientific organizations (including the      American Association for the Advancement of Science, the      American Meteorological Society, and the American Geophysical      Union) have issued statements acknowledging the compelling      scientific evidence of human modification of climate;       Whereas in 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate      Change estimated that global average temperatures have risen      by approximately 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past century;       Whereas the report entitled ``Our Changing Planet: The U.S.      Climate Change Science Program for Fiscal Years 2004 and      2005'' states that ``Atmospheric concentrations of carbon      dioxide and methane have been increasing for about two      centuries as a result of human activities and are now higher      than they have been for over 400,000 years.'';       Whereas according to the Arctic climate impact assessment      published in November 2004, the Arctic is warming almost      twice as fast as the rest of the planet, and winter      temperatures in Alaska have increased approximately 5 to 7      degrees Fahrenheit over the past 50 years;       Whereas scientists at the Hadley Centre for Climate      Prediction and Research in the United Kingdom have estimated      that manmade climate change has already doubled the risk of      heat waves, such as the heat wave that caused more than      15,000 deaths in Europe in 2003;       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled      ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'', held in Exeter,      England, from February 1, 2005, through February 3, 2005,      predicted that an increase in temperature of 1.8 degrees      Fahrenheit (which could occur within 25 years) would cause a      decline in food production, water shortages, and a net loss      of gross domestic product in some developing countries;       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled      ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'' predicted that an      increase in temperature of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (which      could occur before 2050) could cause a substantial loss of      Arctic Sea ice, widespread bleaching of coral reefs, an      increased frequency of forest fires, and rivers to become too      warm to support trout and salmon, and, in developing      countries, would cause an increased risk of hunger, water      shortages that would affect an additional 1,500,000,000      people, and significant losses of gross domestic product in      some countries;       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled      ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'' predicted that an      increase in temperature of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (which      could occur before 2070) would cause irreversible damage to      the Amazon rainforest, destruction of many coral reefs, a      rapid increase in hunger, large losses in crop production in      certain regions, which could affect as many as 5,500,000,000      people, and water shortages that would affect an additional      3,000,000,000 people;       Whereas scientists at the international conference entitled      ``Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change'' predicted that an      increase in temperature of greater than 5.4 degrees      Fahrenheit (which could occur after 2070) would cause certain      regions to become unsuitable for food production, and have a      substantial effect on the global gross domestic product;       Whereas in the United States, multiple mechanisms      (including market cap and trade programs) exist to carry out      mitigation of climate change, sequestration activities in      agricultural sectors, and development of new technologies      such as clean coal and hydrogen vehicles; and       Whereas, because the United States has critical economic      and other interests in international climate policy, it is in      the best interest of the United States to play an active role      in any international discussion on climate policy: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled,       Section 1. That it is the sense of Congress that the United      States should demonstrate international leadership and      responsibility regarding reducing the health, environmental,      and economic risks posed by climate change by--       (1) carrying out reasonable and responsible actions to      ensure significant and meaningful reductions in emissions of      all greenhouse gases;       (2) generating climate-friendly technologies by enacting      and implementing policies and programs to address all      greenhouse gas emissions to promote sustained economic      growth;       (3) participating in international negotiations under the      United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to      achieve significant, long-term, cost-effective reductions in      global greenhouse gas emissions; and       (4) supporting the establishment of a long-term objective      to prevent the global average temperature from increasing by      greater than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial      levels.       Sec. 2. The Secretary of State is authorized to and shall      engage in efforts with other federal agencies to lead      international negotiations to mitigate impacts of global      warming.                          ____________________[Pages S1515-S1559]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS      By
