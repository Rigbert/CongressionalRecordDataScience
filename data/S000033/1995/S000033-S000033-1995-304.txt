 No. 1, with a huge deficit, huge national debt, and terrible social needs in America, there are significant increase tax breaks for the rich, at the same time as the gap between the rich and the poor has never been wider.                              {time}  2245  No. 2, despite the end of the cold war, increased military spending at a time, in my view, when we should be cutting back on the military. And then in order to move toward a balanced budget, savage cutbacks which go against low-income elderly people, including people in the northern part of America who will be cold this winter if our heat program is cut.  Programs for homeless people; programs for children; cutbacks in the WIC Program. There is one program that Mr. Becerra touched upon earlier that I think we have not perhaps discussed enough and that is a $200 million cutback for the veterans of America.  I do not apologize to anybody for being an antiwar Congressman. Yes, I voted against the Persian Gulf war. I think very often we can resolve international conflict without wars.  But it seems to me that if the Government of the United States of America sends people off to war and asks them to put their lives on the line, and they do that, and then they come back to America and 40 or 50 years goes by, as in the case of World War II veterans and these veterans are sleeping down in VA hospitals throughout this country, it seems to me to be very, very wrong to say to those men and women who put their lives on the line, were wounded in body and wounded in spirit, that you say to them now, Hey, guess what? We have got a cutback on the VA hospitals. Thank you very much for putting your life on the line. Thank you for getting wounded, but now we have got a budget problem and we have to give tax breaks to the wealthiest people. We have to build the star wars. We have got to cutback for you.  I think that this particular cut of $200 million is absolutely upcalled for. I fear very much that as the Contract With America progresses, and I had the opportunity of meeting with Jesse Brown, the very fine and excellent Secretary for Veterans Affairs, and he shares this fear, that in the months and months to come there will be increased cutbacks on the needs of our veterans.  So, I think the bottom line is that we have got to get our priorities right and that is we respect those people who put their lives on the line and we will not go forward with those cuts.
