speaker, now this is the Republican Party you remember. The Republican Party and Speaker Gingrich oppose raising the minimum wage so hard-working Americans can earn a decent living. The same Republican Party which reveres family values, refuses a minimum-wage increase to the working mother trying to help her kids.  The same Republican Party which promises a tax cut for those earning $200,000 a year, denies 45 cents an hour to workers trying to feed their families. And the same Republicans who promise welfare reform and would rather build orphanages than create a minimum wage so people can lift themselves off of the dole.  The Grand Old Party. A lot of new faces and high-flying rhetoric, and even a new contract, but the same Republican insensitivity to the needs of average people.                          ____________________
