Mr. Speaker, today we introduce the Common Sense Protection for Endangered Species Act of 2000. My efforts to improve and update the Endangered Species Act date back over my entire 26 years of service in the House of Representatives. The Endangered Species Act or the ESA, was originally adopted in 1973, with the goal of protecting those species of fish, wildlife and plants that were in danger of extinction. However, over the last 26 years the ESA has gotten off course. It is now in danger of foundering in a sea of bureaucratic abuse and misuse.  The Committee on Resources has held over 25 hearings on the impacts of the Endangered Species Act since I became the Chairman. We have heard hundreds of witnesses testify regarding the misuse of this law for purposes that have nothing to do with protecting wildlife. We know that there are 1,197 U.S. species listed as endangered or threatened, yet no species has recovered due to actions taken under the Endangered Species Act. The ESA is a failure, when it is judged solely on the basis of the number of species recovered and it is a failure when you realize that it punishes those private property owners who do the most to protect wildlife on their property. We need to turn this failure into a success story and we can do that through the application of some basic common sense principles.  First, we need to return more authority and responsibility for wildlife protection back to the states. The states have primary responsibility for wildlife and plants within their borders. The states have done the best job of managing their own wildlife. State programs to restore depleted species of game through good scientific management have been a resounding success. Species such as wild turkey, deer, elk, mountain lions, bear, and countless others managed by the states are becoming so plentiful that their numbers are now considered too plentiful in some areas.  Almost every state has its own endangered and threatened species program. Most of the states are doing a better job than the federal government at protecting endangered species and they are doing it in a common sense fashion, unlike some of our federal agencies. However, we seem to be imposing the greatest number of federal resources in those states that have had the best endangered species programs. The State of California, under the leadership of former governor Pete Wilson, developed an endangered species program that is as stringent as the federal program and is the best funded state ESA program in the country, yet we have spent more federal ESA funds in California than in any other state. We need to insure that our scarce federal resources are used in those areas that need federal help--not in those states that are doing a good job. Let's stop duplicating the state's good work and let them do what they do best--manage their own wildlife.  Second, it is absolutely imperative that when a new species is added to the list of endangered and threatened species, that the science used to justify that listing is accurate and adequate. We need to improve the quality of the scientific data used to list species. We can only do that by requiring the agency to use good science, not just whatever science happens to be available at the time a petition is received to list a species. When a species is listed that is not really endangered or threatened with extinction, there are severe economic consequences for local communities and for affected private property owners. This should be avoided through the use of well-founded science.  Thirdly, we need to be fair to landowners who are affected by the listing of endangered species. Most endangered species are found on private lands. Private landowners need to be given incentives and rewards for protecting endangered and threatened species. Unfortunately, the ESA has been used against landowners to deprive them of the right to use their own property and to demand both land and money from affected landowners. The federal agencies that administer the ESA have been given extraordinary powers which they are using to force landowners to set aside ``in perpetuity'', huge amounts of privately owned lands that can only be used for one purpose--the protection of the public's wildlife and plant species. This type of treatment only discourages other landowners from providing habitat for wildlife.  We need to guarantee the public's right to know what the federal government is going to require for the protection of endangered species. The public and affected landowners should be included at every step in the process and should have a right to be heard and to have their questions answered about what kinds of new regulations the government may be proposing.  Fourth, we need to insure that when federal agencies' activities affect endangered species that the species are protected, but also those agencies need to fulfill their primary missions. We have seen examples of our military unable to prepare for the national defense because of the presence of endangered species on military lands. Flood control projects are delayed over many years resulting in ever increasing damage from floods. Much needed roads, bridges, and other transportation projects are stopped or delayed. Entire forests are closed to harvesting while timber workers are left unemployed. The list goes on and on.  We must insure that the government keeps its promises to private property owners. The Fish and Wildlife Service has issued over 250 permits to various landowners for the use of their property. We need to insure that the federal government does not ignore those permits and demand even greater amounts of land and money in the future during the term of those agreements.  Fifth, we must recover the populations of species and then be sure they are taken off the lists of endangered species. Under the current ESA, the federal agencies list species and then never remove them from the lists even when their populations increase dramatically. This is unacceptable. The federal government must work with the local community and affected landowners to develop workable recovery plans for species. The federal government must then keep its word to delist species when the communities make concessions to recover species.  Our bill, the Common Sense Protections for Endangered Species Act of 2000 would bring back basic common sense solutions to help achieve all these goals. It would:  1. Improve the listing process by involving and relying upon the expertise of States.  2. Improve petitions and listing investigations and insure greater public participation in the listing process.  3. It would require the use of peer reviewed science to support the listing of species.  4. It would reduce conflicts and economic dislocation caused by federal agency shut downs and provide deadlines for agency decision making. It would insure that agencies fulfill their missions and provide a faster and surer method of resolving conflicts between agencies. It would insure that public safety will be protected.  5. It would allow affected citizens a full opportunity to participate in consultations; discuss the impacts of a biological opinion and any proposed alternatives, receive information on the biological opinion; and receive a copy of the draft biological opinion prior to its issuance.  6. It would prevent abusive and excessive demands on private landowners for their land and money as a condition of getting an ESA permit from the federal government and require reasonable deadlines for making permitdecisions. It would insure that conservation agreements are binding on all parties to the agreement.  7. It would make recovery planning an inclusive process and would allow the Secretary to delegate to the states the development and implementation of recovery plans. Designation of critical habitat would become part of the recovery process. It would insure that recovery results in the delisting of species.  While I would personally prefer to make even more improvements in the ESA, I feel that these changes will be a good first start toward bringing back a common sense and reasonable approach to our federal government's efforts to recover species. I fully support protecting the rights of private property owners and believe that you can't protect wildlife unless you protect property owners. I also recognize that in order to achieve any goal, you have to take a first step. This is our first step toward Common Sense Protections for Endangered Species.                          ____________________
