Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, this entire process is unbelievable. It is unreal. It is a sham. It is a shame. It is a disgrace. The tone in Washington has not changed and this reconciliation process proves it.  We are passing this bill today so we can rush the Republican tax bill to conference. We are rushing to pass a $1.35 trillion tax bill. That is a lot of money. That is a great deal of money. We cannot afford to be wrong. Somebody needs to tell the American people what would happen if we are wrong. The Republican tax bill is based on a 10-year budget projection that may be wrong. It is going to jeopardize our ability to provide for our senior citizens, jeopardize our ability to invest in priorities like education and prescription drug benefits for all of our citizens, and jeopardize our ability to pay down the national debt, save Social Security, and protect Medicare.  We should be taking care of the basic needs of all of our people and not just some of our people but all of our people and not rushing to pass a tax bill that we cannot afford. This Republican bill is not right for America. It is not fair and it is not just. And this entire process is rotten to the core. Where is the bipartisanship that we hear from the White House, that we hear from the other side? It is not here with this bill. It was not here last week and it is not here today. We have wasted an important opportunity to work together on a bill that is good for all Americans.  I urge all of my colleagues to vote against it and vote for the Democraticsubstitute. If we want clean water, if we want clean air, if we want safety in the workplace, then support the Democratic substitute.  Mr. McCRERY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.
