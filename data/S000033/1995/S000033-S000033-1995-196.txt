 What we have here is the Robin Hood proposal in reverse. We take from the middle-class and working people, and we give to the very, very wealthy.  I think the main point that we wanted to make this evening is that we also are concerned about a $4.7 trillion national debt and the very high deficit that we have, but we think that it is extraordinarily unfair to move toward a balanced budget on the backs of the middle class, the working people, and the low-income people, when at the same time we are giving huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, expanding military spending at a time when we do not need to do so.  Mr. Speaker, our hope is that the American people begin to focus on this issue and demand a little bit of justice in this Congress, so we can deal with the budget and with our deficit in a fair and reasonable way.
