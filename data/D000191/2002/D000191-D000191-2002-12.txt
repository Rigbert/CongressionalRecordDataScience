  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Florida talked about the phony reform that was passed by this House and the fact that the Senate will not take it up. Thank God for the Senate.  That was a phony reform. It was written by the securities industry. It was written to touch them with a feather duster. Now there are corporate evildoers abroad in the land, and they have stolen and diverted billions, bankrupted firms, thousands of hardworking Americans have lost their jobs, millions of seniors' savings and pensions evaporated, and even the President has noticed.  He went to Wall Street to admonish his corporate contributors not to do it again, but not to worry, Harvey Pitt, the former security firm lobbyist, has been named to head the enforcement agency, but he did not go to the President's speech because he was on vacation at the beach hobnobbing with the same corporate evildoers he is supposed to be investigating, his former clients. We do not have to worry about a thing, I guess.                          ____________________
