 The book is called ``Hello Bee, Hello Me.'' As you can see, it is an attractive book. It was studied in 2006, and it was found to be loaded with phthalates. But this is what babies do; they put everything in their mouths.  Phthalates all too often are found in high quantities in children's toys and other products. Studies have found that they are linked to both birth and other serious rare reproductive defects. When these young children chew or suck on a toy with phthalates, these chemicals can leech from the toy into the child and enter the child's bloodstream.  They interfere with the national functioning of the hormone system, and they can cause reproductive abnormalities and result in an early onset of puberty. Parents across the country actually have no idea of these risks.  These chemicals have been banned in the European Union, five other countries, and my home State of California, and eight other States are now proposing similar bans. I believe this is the appropriate time for the Federal Government to shield children from these chemicals.  Now, of course, my communications director, like many parents, had no idea that this book contained high levels of phthalates. But it is not just books; phthalates can be found in a variety of soft children's toys such as rubber ducks and teethers like this one.  I ask unanimous consent that I may show you that teether.
