 We are coming down with a variety of different ways to deal with these criminal gangs, to investigate them, to break them up, to arrest them, to make certain they face serious sentences for intimidation of witnesses, for recruiting young people into their gangs.  I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, how can a Member stand in the Senate and say they are dedicated to stopping criminal gang activity in America and vote for this bill which allows gun dealers who have clear histories of selling repeatedly to gang members firearms that are being used to kill innocent people? How can a Member say they are against criminal gangs but are in favor of the gun dealers who are providing them with their firearms?
