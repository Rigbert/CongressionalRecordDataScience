 President, on Monday, we will resume debate on the gulf coast energy security bill. Senators are reminded that we will have a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the bill at 5:30 Monday afternoon. This will be the first vote of the week, and Senators should make their plans accordingly. We expect to finish this bill next week. We have other important items to consider, as we all know, before we leave for the August recess, hopefully at the end of next week. Therefore, it is expected that we will have a full week all of next week with lots of business before the Senate prior to the August recess.                          ____________________[Page S8416]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
