Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this resolution. I believe that it is legally incorrect. I believe it is strategically a mistake, and I believe morally it ought to be rejected.  I, of course, was one of those who believed strongly that the United States and its allies ought to act decisively in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia. I urged, as my colleagues will recall, the unilateral lifting of the arms embargo so that peoples under siege could defend themselves. I believe that was the morally correct and legally correct position.  This resolution I believe is legally wrong because, contrary to the arguments of my friend from California (Mr. Campbell), who maintains that we are in the midst of hostilities, I would suggest that any person deployed anyplace in the world is subject to hostilities. We have tragically lost men and women in uniform as the result of terrorist acts or some other act in places of the world that clearly hostilities did not exist, Japan being an example, West Germany being another.  I believe that, strategically, the adoption of this resolution would be a significant and unfortunate mistake. The deployment of U.S. troops and allied troops in Bosnia was pursuant to an agreement, the Dayton Accords, in which all parties to the conflict agreed to accept United States and allied troops for the purposes of peacekeeping, not for the purposes of projecting themselves into hostilities. So that even if one adopts the argument that 5(c) of the War Powers Act is sustainable, one should reject the presumption that it applies in this instance.  I urge my colleagues to reject this unfortunate resolution.
