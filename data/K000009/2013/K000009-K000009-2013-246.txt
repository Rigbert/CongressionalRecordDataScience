Speaker, I wish to congratulate Mr. Julius Ciaccia, Executive Director of Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District on his election as the new President of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, NACWA.  Mr. Ciaccia is an accomplished leader and committed environmental steward who plays a prominent role in the water industry, exemplifying what it means to be a public servant. He is ideally suited to serve as President of one of the Nation's leading proponents of responsible policies that advance clean water. Mr. Ciaccia has served the people of the Cleveland area for decades, and in his new role, will continue to ensure that Ohio's, and the Nation's clean water agencies continue to improve to protect public health and the environment.  Mr. Ciaccia began his career in public utilities in 1977 when he was appointed as Assistant Director of the Public Utilities Department for the City of Cleveland. In 1979 he took on the temporary role of Commissioner of Cleveland Water until 1981 when he assumed the role of Deputy Commissioner of Cleveland Water and eventually appointed Commissioner in 1988.  During the 25 years in the Division of Water, Mr. Ciaccia oversaw the management of over $1 billion worth of capital improvement projects and maintained the Division of Water's very favorable financial position. He was appointed Director of the city's Department of Public Utilities in 2004 and began his current role at the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District in November 2007.  In his current role at the District, he oversees all aspects of managing one of the nation's largest wastewater management utilities. Under his leadership, the District has received two awards from the Commission on Economic Inclusion including a 2009 award for Supplier Diversity which highlights the success of one of Mr. Ciaccia's initiatives to craft and implement a supplier inclusion program; and a 2012 award for Senior Management Inclusion, recognizing diversity of Senior Staff.  As the District's Executive Director, Mr. Ciaccia was also responsible for the recently entered consent order for a long term control plan to significantly reduce combined sewer overflows, as well as the successful development and implementation of a new Regional Stormwater Management Program. Additionally, one of Mr. Ciaccia's many accomplishments as Executive Director has been the transformation of the District's culture to one of transparency and ethical financial practices.  As member of NACWA's Board of Directors, Mr. Ciaccia has served as the Secretary, Treasurer, and Vice President. Mr. Ciaccia has selflessly shared his time, passion, energy and ideas to carry out the objectives of the Clean Water Act.  It is my sincere pleasure to congratulate Julius Ciaccia on becoming President of NACWA. I am certain his actions will ensure continued water quality progress for the Cleveland area, the State of Ohio and the Nation.                          ____________________
