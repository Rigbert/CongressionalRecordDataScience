  Senator Bond and I will be, as I said, placing in the Record, and then subsequently doing a rule XIV placing it on the calendar, a proposal that the administration thinks makes sense to deal with the modifications that everyone seems to agree in principle need to be made to the FISA procedure.  With that, I don't know that I can yield leader time to somebody who isn't a leader, so let me just say that having given that notice, we will be placing that on the calendar for later this evening.
