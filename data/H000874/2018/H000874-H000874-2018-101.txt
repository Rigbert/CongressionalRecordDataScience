Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his observation.  He talks about work. We are requiring those to work to work in order to get government benefits. What is controversial about that?  Democrats support work. We want to see people working. We oppose, however, your SNAP proposal because it is antiwork. You are taking a work requirement that is working and replacing it with one that won't work.  This is not about putting people to work. It is about pretending that you care about work as cover for taking assistance away from struggling families.  As a result of this bill, there will be fewer working--I know the majority leader wants to hear this particular piece of information.  As a result of this bill as it is currently written, there will be fewer working SNAP beneficiaries, not more, and millions more people going hungry. That is the working poor who are getting nutritional assistance for themselves and their families. There will be less of them under your bill.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Well, I thank my friend for yielding, and this is just a clear example of the difference in philosophical opinion.                              {time}  1200  We had this same debate when it came to the tax bill--that it was going to be Armageddon; if people got bonuses, it would be crumbs; and that we would be in a really worse position than we are.  Well, as we found out, Mr. Speaker, that is totally untrue. The economy is stronger. Again, in the last 49 years there has only been 7 months in the history of America where unemployment was below 4 percent. Two of those seven months are April and May of this year. We just hit 1 million new jobs, based upon that tax cut. More so since the election. Household wealth has increased by $7 trillion just since the election.  Now, this is the philosophical difference. Currently, two-thirds of able-bodied adults report no earned income at all. Why?  Because the SNAP program is letting them down. Not a single child or family who currently qualifies will be cut off. Our proposal only applies to those age 18 to 59. It exempts pregnant women, individuals who are mentally or physically disabled, and the primary caregivers of a child under the age of 6. What we do is give them the job training to get back into the workforce.  Because of that, according to the Foundation for Government Accountability, 83 percent of Americans support work requirements for SNAP. That includes 71 percent of Democrats. Unfortunately, when that bill came to the floor, every Democrat said no.  Mr. Speaker, that was the same thing that happened when we gave the American public tax cuts and created new jobs and the lowest unemployment--unemployment claims gives you the best projection of unemployment--in 44 years. Forty-four years, Mr. Speaker.  Do you know another statistic that just came out?  Small businesses are the greatest creators of new jobs. Since 1974 they have always surveyed them and they asked them this question: Is now a good time to expand?  Mr. Speaker, remember what a small business is. They don't have a great amount of capital. It is at its highest level since they took this poll.  So I don't mind having a philosophical difference of agreement, because there is a contrast between us. There is a contrast in philosophy. One believes it would be Armageddon if you let people keep more of what they earn. The facts don't pan out. Thankfully, we were successful, Mr. Speaker. The American people can keep more.  The other thing that happened, Mr. Speaker, is that 48 out of 50 States have a lower electrical bill. Also, in one company, 1.2 million of their employees have longer maternity leave.  The sad part is, I wish I could have sat here and said: As America, making it a more perfect Union, this whole body voted for it. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, one side had to carry the load.
