 President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding athlete from my home State of Kentucky, Joe Blanton, who was a pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies 2008 World Series Championship team.  Blanton, who played baseball at Edmonson County High School in Brownsville, KY continued his baseball career in the Commonwealth by playing for the University of Kentucky. He was drafted by the Oakland Athletics after college and was traded to the Phillies during the All-Star break this past summer.  Recently, the Daily News in Bowling Green, KY, published an article detailing Mr. Blanton's journey and accomplishments. I will ask to have the full article printed in the Record.  I also ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Joe Blanton for his accomplishments in the 2008 Major League Baseball postseason. Kentucky is proud of his success, and we look forward to seeing more of his prodigious athletic talent on the baseball diamond in the years ahead.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the article to which I referred printed in the Record.  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Daily News, Jan. 24, 2009]   Blanton's Day in Brownsville: Edmonson County Honors World Series                             Champion Pitcher                          (By Micheal Compton)       It's been an offseason to remember for Joe Blanton.       Traded from the Oakland A's to the Philadelphia Phillies in      July, Blanton became a key member of a Philadelphia team that      celebrated its first World Series championship since 1980 by      beating the Tampa Bay Rays in five games in October.       Blanton was honored Saturday at Edmonson County High      School, where he pitched until 1998, getting his jersey      retired in front of family, college coach and Edmonson County      alum Keith Madison and several hundred fans.       Blanton, who signed autographs and took pictures with fans,      said his participation in the fundraiser for the ECHS      baseball program was his way of giving back to a community      that gave him so much as a young man.       ``This is kind of a little way that I hope I can help (the      Edmonson County baseball program) a little bit, to make it      easier on them and give them a few nice things here and      there,'' Blanton said.       Edmonson County coach Clint Clark said Saturday's event has      been in the works since August. But once Blanton won the      World Series with the Phillies in October, the process sped      up.       ``What Joseph means to this community, words can't      describe,'' Clark said. ``By bringing him home and honoring      Joseph and having (former University of Kentucky) coach      Madison back to be a part of it, we wanted to be able to      bring back the tradition here at Edmonson County.''       2008 was a year of highs and lows for Blanton, culminating      in a World Series performance that included one of the most      memorable moments in baseball history.       ``It's been a ride,'' Blanton said. ``When you get traded,      it is definitely weird. It always shocks you a little bit. I      didn't know anybody (in Philadelphia), any of the coaches,      but it seemed to work out pretty good for me.''       Blanton started the season 5-12 with the A's, but during      the All-Star break he was traded from the organization that      drafted him in the first round in 2002. In joining the      Phillies, Blanton was thrust into the National League pennant      race.       Blanton went 4-0 in 13 starts for Philadelphia, helping the      Phillies win the NL's East Division. He pitched the decisive      Game 4 in the NL Division Series against Milwaukee, allowing      one run and five hits in six innings against a Brewers'      lineup that included former Greenwood High School star Corey      Hart.       ``That was awesome getting to face somebody from the area--     somebody I got to play with in summer ball,'' Blanton said.      ``We played together with the Kentucky Colonels. That's real      nice to see somebody else from here have success like he has      had the last couple of years.''       Blanton got a no decision in his lone NL Championship      Series start against the Los Angeles Dodgers.       He saved his best game for last, going six innings and      allowing two runs in a 10-2 victory that helped the Phillies      take a 3-1 lead in the World Series.       But it was Blanton's fifth-inning at-bat that will forever      be remembered--a solo home run to left field that Blanton      said was his first since 1999, when he played for Franklin-     Simpson High School. Blanton's shot was the first World      Series home run by a pitcher in 34 years.       ``It's what you dream about as a kid when you're in the      backyard playing Wiffleball with your buddies or your dad is      throwing you batting practice,'' Blanton said. ``You are      always taking that last swing like it's Game 7 of the World      Series. Mine wasn't Game 7, but it couldn't have been much      better if it was. I think other than maybe throwing a no-     hitter or something, I wouldn't trade it for anything else.''       Three nights later, Blanton charged the mound with his      teammates, celebrating a world title.       ``It still gives me chills just thinking about it,''      Blanton said. ``There's really not another feeling like it in      sports. It's the ultimate team accomplishment. Just having      the dogpile on the field, knowing no one in baseball is      better than you, it is really hard to put into words. It      feels good to be able to accomplish that.''       While the World Series title was a life-altering      experience, Blanton insists he hasn't changed.       ``I'm still the same,'' Blanton said. ``I think if anything      changed, it's getting (to the World Series) made me respect      it a lot more. I played with a guy, Jamie Moyer, who I think      last year was his 22nd year in the majors and that was his      first World Series. That shows you how hard it can be to make      it and win it.''       And Blanton, who recently signed a one-year, $5.475 million      deal with Philadelphia, is determined to work just as hard to      help the Phillies defend their title.       ``I feel like we have a great team coming back,'' Blanton      said. ``We have a solid lineup and a great bullpen. I feel      like we have a great starting staff and all the components      that it takes to win. We're not a one-dimensional team, and      we have a great clubhouse and coaching staff on top of it.''                          ____________________
