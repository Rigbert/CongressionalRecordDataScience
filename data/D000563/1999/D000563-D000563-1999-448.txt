President, today I am joining with Senator Leahy to introduce a resolution calling for the immediate release of three CARE International workers in Yugoslavia. The three humanitarian workers committed no crime and are being held prisoner unjustly. Coercion was used in extracting a televised ``confession'' from one of the workers and the judicial proceedings held against them were a sham, preventing them from mounting a serious defense.  The men, Branko Jelen, Steve Pratt, and Peter Wallace, are three humanitarian workers employed in Yugoslavia by CARE International, which has been providing food, medicines and fuel to more than 50,000 Serbian refugees in Serbia and to displaced ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.  On March 31, 1999, Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, two Australian nationals, were arrested and later accused of operating a spy ring. Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav, was arrested a week later on the same charges. Yugoslav officials forced Steve Pratt to appear on Serbian television on April 11, when he was coerced into saying that he had performed covert intelligence activities. The three were held without access to outsiders for 20 days.  On May 29 a military court dismissed the original indictment, but then convicted the three CARE International workers on an entirely new charge of passing on information to a foreign organization, their employer, CARE International! This charge was introduced at the reading of the verdict, denying lawyers for the three any opportunity to mount an appropriate defense. Pratt was sentenced to 12 years, Jelen to 6 years, and Wallace to 4 years in prison.  These humanitarian workers apparently were convicted of providing ``situation reports'' to their head office and other CARE International offices around the world, based on legitimately gathered information. Such reports are necessary to enable CARE International management to plan their humanitarian assistance and to inform CARE International management of the rapidly changing security situation faced by their staff.  The convictions of these three humanitarian workers raise serious questions regarding the ability of humanitarian aid organizations to operate in Yugoslavia, with implications for their operations in other areas of conflict around the world. Humanitarian workers must feel secure enough to do their work and must not be at risk of going to prison on false charges. Since that is not now the case in Serbia, CARE International regretfully was forced to stop its operations there.  The resolution we introduce today urges the United States and the United Nations to try to secure the release of the three humanitarian workers and calls on the Yugoslavia government to release them. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.                          ____________________
