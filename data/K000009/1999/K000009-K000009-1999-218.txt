Greenspan seems to think that all trade raises the standard of living of the American people. It might raise thestandard of living of people who can afford to take him out to lunch or dinner along Wall Street in New York City or K Street here in Washington, D.C., but it has not raised the wages of the people that the gentleman from New York is talking about here, where we in Congress have to forcibly ratchet up the minimum wage because people are being told where they work here in the United States, well, if you want any kind of a small wage increase, or maybe you want better health insurance or health insurance at all, if you do not agree to that, we are going to Mexico. I do not understand why an intelligent person like Mr. Greenspan cannot feel the pain and understand the impact of these trade agreements on the vast majority of the American public that has not benefited from the big bang on Wall Street.  The average wages of people in this country and their real buying power has not been going up. They are working; thank God we have done some things right in this country, but they are not able to meet prices.  The other day I went to get a blouse back home, and I walked up to this one rack and I pulled it off the rack and I looked at it, it was $129 made in China. And Mr. Greenspan says in his speeches here that this trade is great for America because we get all these cheap goods. Where? Where are the cheap goods? All the garment workers in the gentleman's city who lost their jobs who were making not great wages, but at least they could keep house and home together, when those jobs were wiped out and replaced by Chinese jobs, I really do not see how he can say this helps the standard of living of the ordinary rank and file, the majority of people in this country. It certainly helps those who trade in stocks on Wall Street, would the gentleman not agree?
