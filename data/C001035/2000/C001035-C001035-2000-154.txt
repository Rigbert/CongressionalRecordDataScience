He has done a terrific job. I thank Senator Reid as well for yielding me time so I can discuss this very important matter.  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Jeffords' amendment to finally start on the path toward paying the share of special education costs that the Federal Government promised to pay when the legislation was passed 25 years ago.  During the last recess of the Senate, I met with more than 70 superintendents and principals from northern and eastern Maine to discuss education issues. Originally, my thought was to discuss the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but the No. 1 issue on their minds was the escalating costs of meeting the needs of children with special needs, the costs of special education.  If the U.S. Government kept the promise it made back in 1975, it would mean an additional $60 million to the schools in the State of Maine. That is money that would free up other money so that schools could meet their own needs--whether this is hiring more teachers, improving their libraries, upgrading their science labs or providing special professional development--whatever the need of that particular school and that particular community.  If we take this step of starting to meet our obligations under the special education law, it will make a tremendous difference not only to the schools in Maine but to schools throughout our country. The Jeffords-Collins amendment would mean an additional $155 million to the schools of Maine over the next 5 years.  I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor. This has been one of my priorities since my election to the Senate. I know it is the No. 1 priority of the school districts in the State of Maine.  I thank my colleagues for making the time available to me. If I have additional time, I yield it back to the chairman of the Budget Committee. I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).
