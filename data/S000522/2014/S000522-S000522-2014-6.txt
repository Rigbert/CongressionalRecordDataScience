Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Vargas) for his leadership. This truly is a bipartisan bill. I want to again say how grateful I am to the gentlewoman from Minnesota, Betty McCollum, to be working with her and her staff. Our staffs are all trying to make sure we have a bill that will make a huge difference not only in putting our arms around the existing program but in strengthening it and taking it to the next level.  I do want to point out that this is about a whole of government strategy:all in on the part of the U.S. Government so that everyone is working on all six cylinders to make sure that sustainable development occurs throughout the world in target countries and, as those targets increase, that it is totally inclusive of women.  When we worked on issues like microtargeting, we found--particularly in most parts of Africa--that women have really stepped up to the plate and have done yeoman's work. They are fully included in this effort.  Again, I want to thank all of my colleagues. I want to thank the leadership, the gentleman from California, Kevin McCarthy, and Speaker Boehner, for making sure that this legislation got to the floor. Our hope is that the Senate may take it up. If not, we will be right back here next year. But I do hope that they will take it up because delay is denial. This is an important piece of legislation that will save lives.  I yield back the balance of my time.
