Speaker, on July 22, 2004, the House debated and passed H.R. 3313, the Marriage Protection Act, a bill that would prevent Federal courts from striking down the protection we granted to States in the Defense of Marriage Act. That protection allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriage licenses issued in other States if they so choose.  In the midst of floor debate on H.R. 3313, the Congressional Research Service issued a memorandum to the minority staff of the House Judiciary Committee, which stated: ``We are not aware of any precedent for a law that would deny the inferior Federal courts original jurisdiction or the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of a law of Congress.'' Those on the other side of the aisle made much of this statement, and the statement was widely reported in the press.  I would like to set the record straight. The statement that Congress has never passed a law that would deny Federal courts jurisdiction to hear a constitutional claim is false, and the most cursory review of American history shows that. The very first Judiciary Act of 1789 denied the inferior Federal courts original jurisdiction and the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of literally thousands of Federal statutes under a jurisdictional regime that governed for roughly a century.  The Judiciary Committee majority staff pointed out these precedents to the Congressional Research Service in a letter sent on August 4, 2004, asking CRS if its position continued to be that ``there is not `any precedent for a law that would deny the inferior federal courts original jurisdiction or the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of a law of Congress.' ''  On August 16, the Congressional Research Service responded in a letter that states: ``our earlier memorandum was incorrect.'' (Emphasis added). Let me repeat that. CRS admitted that: ``our earlier memorandum was incorrect.'' CRS goes on to note that it recognizes ``the fact that as written and construed [the Judiciary Act of 1789] did operate to preclude any federal court from deciding the validity of a federal statute from 1789 to 1875.''  I would like to submit for the Record, in addition to my statement, the original erroneous memorandum sent by the Congressional Research Service, the letter to CRS from the majority staff of the committee requesting a clarification of CRS's views, and the response from CRS admitting its error.  So let the record be clear. H.R. 3313, the Marriage Protection Act, has ample precedent in American history, and the Congressional Research Service agrees.                     Congressional Research Service                               Memorandum     To: House Committee on the Judiciary, Attention: Perry          Apelbaum.     From: Johnny H. Killian, Senior Specialist, American          Constitutional Law, American Law Division.     Subject: Precedent for Congressional Bill.       This memorandum is in response to your query, respecting      H.R. 3313, now pending before the House of Representatives,      as to whether there is any precedent for enacted legislation      that would deny judicial review in any federal court of the      constitutionality of a law that Congress has enacted, whether      a law containing the jurisdictional provision or an earlier,      separate law. We are not aware of any precedent for a law      that would deny the inferior federal courts original      jurisdiction or the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction      to review the constitutionality of a law of Congress.                                  ____ [Letter sent to the Congressional Research Service from the Committee                            on the Judiciary]                                                   August 4, 2004.     Mr. Johnny Killian,     Madison Building, Library of Congress,     Washington, DC.       Dear Johnny: In an undated Memorandum from yourself to      Perry Apelbaum, the minority chief counsel of the House      Judiciary Committee, you stated ``We are not aware of any      precedent for a law that would deny the inferior federal      courts original jurisdiction or the Supreme Court of      appellate jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of a      law of Congress.'' This Memorandum was made known to us in      the midst of House floor debate on H.R. 3313, the Marriage      Protection Act, on July 22, 2004.       In the Judiciary Act of 1789, (Footnote Text: Judiciary Act      of 1789, 1 Stat. 85 (1789)) Congress provided no general      federal question jurisdiction in the federal courts below the      Supreme Court. (Footnote Text: See Richard H. Fallon, Daniel      J. Meltzer, and David L. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler's The      Federal Courts and the Federal System (4th ed. 1996) at 33      (stating that in the Judiciary Act of 1789, ``Congress      provided no general federal question jurisdiction in the      lower federal courts'')). The federal circuit courts were      vested with jurisdiction according to the nature of the      parties rather than the nature of the dispute. The Judiciary      Act of 1789 provided ``the circuit courts shall have original      cognizance . . . of all suits of a civil nature at common law      or in equity, where the matter in dispute exceeds . . . the      sum . . . of five hundred dollars, and the United States are      plaintiffs, or petitioners; or an alien is a party, or the      suit is between a citizen of the State where the suit is      brought, and a citizen of another State.'' (Footnote Text:      Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 73, Sec. 11 (1789))       Further, and of relevance here, Section 25 of the Judiciary      Act of 1789 restricted the Supreme Court's appellate      jurisdiction over state court decisions to cases where the      validity of a treaty, statute, or authority of the United      States was drawn into question and the state court's decision      was against their validity (Footnote Text: Judiciary Act of      1789, 1 Stat. 73, Sec. 25 (1789)) or where a state court      construed a United States constitution, treaty, statute, or      commission and decided against a title, right, privilege, or      exemption under any of them. (Footnote Text: Judiciary Act of      1789, 1 Stat. 73, Sec. 25 (1789))       Consequently, under the Judiciary Act of 1789, if the      highest state courts upheld a federal law as constitutional      and decided in favor of a right under such federal statute      (and there was no coincidental federal diversity      jurisdiction), no appeal claiming such federal law was      unconstitutional was allowed to any federal court, including      the Supreme Court. The Judiciary Act of 1789, therefore,      denied the inferior federal courts original jurisdiction      and the Supreme Court appellate jurisdiction to review the      constitutionality of literally thousands of laws of      Congress in the many and various circumstances meeting the      criteria just mentioned.       Congress did not grant a more general federal question      authority to the lower federal courts until after the Civil      War, (Footnote Text: See Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 137, 18      Stat. 470 (1875)) and Congress did not grant the Supreme      Court the authority to review state court rulings upholding a      claim of federal right until 1914. (Footnote Text: See      Judiciary Act of 1914, Act of Dec. 23, 1914, ch. 2, 38 Stat.      790 (1914)) Until 1914, then, a situation existed in which      the constitutionality of literally thousands of federal laws      could not be reviewed in either the inferior federal courts,      or the Supreme Court, or both.       We are not aware of any doubt about these facts among      scholars of federal court jurisdiction.       The Judiciary Act of 1789, of course, went far beyond what      H.R. 3313 would do regarding federal court jurisdiction.      While the Judiciary Act of 1789 precluded all federal court      review of constitutional issues when state courts upheld any      law of Congress (expressing a policy distinctly in favor of      the validity of federal law), H.R. 3313 simply provides that      challenges brought against one section of the Defense of      Marriage Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738C, (Footnote      Text: 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738C states ``No State, territory, or      possession of the United States, or Indian tribe, shall be      required to give effect to any public act, record, or      judicial proceeding of any other State, territory,      possession, or tribe respecting a relationship between      persons of     the same sex that is treated as a marriage under the laws of      such other State, territory, possession, or tribe, or a right      or claim arising from such relationship.'') be brought in      federal court, and in no way favors any particular outcome.       Therefore, I am writing to ask you whether you continue to      believe the statement that there is not ``any precedent for a      law that would deny the inferior federal courts original      jurisdiction or the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction      to review the constitutionality of a law of Congress'' is      correct.       We would appreciate your answer as soon as possible, but no      later than August 16, 2004.           Sincerely,                                                        Phil Kiko,     Chief of Staff/General Counsel.                                  ____    [Letter in response to the letter dated August 4, 2004 from the    Congressional Research Service to the Committee on the Judiciary]                               Congressional Research Service,                                                   August 16, 2004                               Memorandum     To: House Committee on the Judiciary, Attention: Philip C.          Kiko.     From: Johnny H. Killian, Senior Specialist, American          Constitutional Law, American Law Division.     Subject: Congressional Control of Jurisdiction of Federal          Courts.       This memorandum responds to your request that we reassess      an earlier memorandum of ours that was prepared for Congress      in light of construction of an early congressional enactment.       In brief, during consideration of H.R. 3313, the Marriage      Protection Act, in the House of Representatives, we were      asked whether we were aware of any precedent for the      provisions of the bill that would deny all federal courts,      the Supreme Court under its appellate jurisdiction and the      inferior courts under their original jurisdiction, of      authority to review any questions pertaining to the      interpretation of, or the validity under the Constitution of,      28 U.S.C. Sec. 1738C. That statute provides that no State, or      other relevant jurisdiction, is required to give full faith      and credit to any public act, record, or judicial proceeding      that recognizes marriage between two persons of the same sex.      We responded, first orally and then by a brief memorandum,      that we were not aware of any precedent for a law that would      deny to all federal courts the power to review the      constitutionality of a law of Congress.       You have called our attention to provisions of the      Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 85, specifically Sec. Sec. 11,      25, which you contend contradict our memorandum and do deny      all federal courts jurisdiction to review the      constitutionality of acts of Congress. We do acknowledge that      the cited provisions of the first Judiciary Act do in some      respects prevent federal judicial review of the      constitutionality of some acts of Congress, with, however,      some qualifications that we set out below. Nonetheless, there      were, indeed, some circumstances under which federal court      jurisdiction was denied or not provided, so that our      memorandum was not entirely accurate.       Our response requires some analysis. As you point out and      as it is the consensus of the scholarly community, the first      Judiciary Act did not confer on the federal courts, both the      inferior federal courts and the Supreme Court, all the      jurisdiction that might have been conferred under Article III      of the Constitution. (Footnote Text: See R. Fallon, D.      Melzer, & D. Shapiro, Hart & Wechsler's The Federal Courts      and the Federal System (4th ed., 1996), 29-33; W. Casto, The      First Congress's Understanding of Its Authority Over the      Federal Courts' Jurisdiction, 26 B.C. L. Rev. 1101, 1116-     17(1985)). Thus, Sec. 11 of the Judiciary Act generally      conferred diversity jurisdiction, with some limits, on the      inferior federal courts, and a few other grants, but it      did not confer federal question jurisdiction, that is,      jurisdiction arising under the Constitution, laws, and      treaties of the United States. So, absent the ability of      litigants to obtain original jurisdiction in the inferior      federal courts under some other head of jurisdiction, the      constitutionality of federal statutes could not be      attacked in those inferior federal courts. Some few      instances of federal question jurisdiction appeared in the      historical record, but it was not until 1875 when Congress      conferred general federal question jurisdiction on the      inferior federal courts, subject to a jurisdictional      amount limitation. 18 Stat. 470.       However, such actions could be brought in the state courts,      and the Supreme Court had limited appellate jurisdiction to      review the state court decisions. This presents the focal      point of the issue before us. Congress did not confer      complete appellate jurisdiction over such questions decided      by state courts. There were three categories of jurisdiction      (Footnote Text: Casto, cited in fn. 1, 1118-20). That is, the      Supreme Court enjoyed appellate jurisdiction:       1. Where the validity of a treaty, statute, or authority of      the United States is drawn into question and the state      court's decision is against their validity.       2. Where the validity of a state statute or authority is      challenged on the basis of federal law and the state court's      decision is in favor of their validity.       3. Where a state court construes a United States      constitution, treaty, statute, or commission and decides      against a title, privilege, or exemption under any of them.       Thus, the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction in these      cases depended upon the particular results reached by the      state courts. The first grant clearly recognized the federal      interest in having one national, uniform resolution of the      question of the validity of a federal law or a treaty, so      that if a state court decision invalidated either under the      U.S. Constitution the Supreme Court could review it. Only if      the state court upheld the federal law or treaty did the      Supreme Court lack jurisdiction. Obviously, Congress had in      mind the federal interest involved in this situation, but it      is nonetheless true that one challenging the validity of a      federal law could not take that challenge to the Supreme      Court if he lost in the state court.       Similarly, if a litigant challenged a state law as being      invalid under a federal law and the state court upheld the      validity of the state law, the litigant could appeal to the      U.S. Supreme Court and obtain an answer. But if a litigant      was defending in state court a claim under a state law,      including a contention the federal law was invalid, and that      court held the state law invalid under federal law, the      litigant could not appeal that decision to the U.S. Supreme      Court. So the way that Sec. 25 was worded did have the      effect, at least in some instances, of insulating a federal      law from a federal constitutional attack (Footnote Text: The      law, incidentally, was not changed until 1914, 38 Stat. 790,      as a result of the decision in Ives v. South Buffalo Ry., 201      N.Y. 271, 94 N.E. 431 (1911), invalidating a regulatory      measure under a Lochner-like application of the Fourteenth      Amendment's due process clause. One may wonder how often this      kind of thing happened if the law was not changed for 85      years).       Now, one can imagine that federal laws were not forever      protected from constitutional challenge, that a challenge      might only often be postponed. Just consider, the instance      might arise in which a state court invalidated a state law as      in conflict with a federal law, and the losing party in      the state court could not appeal that decision. But in a      Nation of many States, thirteen when the Judiciary Act was      passed in 1789, as compared to some 40 or so by 1875, when      the inferior federal courts were invested with federal      question jurisdiction, how many times is it likely that in      only one State a federal law of general applicability that      could be interpreted as invalidating a state law would be      challenged. No principle of res judicata or collateral      estoppel would prevent a challenge to such state laws      being brought in many States and surely state courts would      be divided. Eventually, the issue would come to the U.S.      Supreme Court.       That the effect of Sec. 25 might only infrequently result      in the constitutionality of a federal statute being insulated      from review does not alter the fact that as written and      construed the section did operate to preclude any federal      court from deciding the validity of a federal statute from      1789 to 1875. Accordingly, our earlier memorandum was      incorrect.                          ____________________
