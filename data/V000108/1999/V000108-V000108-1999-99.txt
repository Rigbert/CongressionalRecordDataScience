Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Asian-American Medical Society will be hosting its 23rd Annual Asian-American Medical Society Charity Gala on Saturday, November 13, 1999, at the Radisson Hotel in Merrillville, Indiana. Each year, the Asian-American Medical Society honors prominent, extraordinary residents of Northwest Indiana for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their tremendous efforts for the betterment of Northwest Indiana, they are honored at a banquet and awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award. This year, four outstanding citizens from Northwest Indiana will be presented with the Crystal Globe Award for their dedication and devotion to the community.  This year's Arts and Humanities recipient, Maestro Tsung Yeh, is one of the most talented citizens of Northwest Indiana. Tsung Yeh is the Music Director and conductor of the Northwest Indiana Symphony Orchestra, a position he officially began with his acclaimed debut at the 1997 Holiday Pops concert. This season also marks Mr. Yeh's twelfth highly successful season as Music Director and Conductor of the South Bend Symphony Orchestra, and his second season as Principal Conductor of the Hong Kong Sinfonietta. In July1997, Maestro Yeh conducted at the reunification ceremonies in Hong Kong. Although his work and community service often constrains his free time, Tsung Yeh has never limited the time he gives to his most important interest, his family. He and his wife Saulan reside in Grainger, Indiana with their three children, Mona, Melina, and Joseph.  Mayor Scott King is this year's Civic Leadership recipient. Scott King was elected Mayor of the City of Gary in 1995, and entered into his official capacity in January of 1996. Before becoming Mayor, King served as a public defender, deputy prosecutor, and assistant U.S. Attorney of the Northern District of Indiana. As Mayor, King serves as not only a respected member of the professional community, but also as a mentor and a community leader. He offers his services and time to many professional organizations and has accepted numerous appointments, including serving as co-chairman of the United States Conference Mayors' Drug Policy Taskforce.  This year's Healthcare recipient, Dr. Mridula Prasaad, is one of the most caring dedicated, and selfless citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. Dr. Prasaad is a Board Certified neurologist who has been in private practice since 1988. She offers her services and time to many professional organizations as the Associate Medical Director of the Rehabilitation Unit of Community Hospital, the Associate Program Director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinic of the Neuroscience Institute of Methodist Hospital, and a Clinical Assistant Professor of Neurology at the Northwest Center for Medical Education, Indiana School of Medicine in Gary. She most recently became the Executive Director of People Helping People, a nonprofit organization she founded to help those with Multiple Sclerosis find assisted and independent living.  Valparaiso University's President, Dr. Alan Harre is this year's Academic Excellence recipient. Dr. Harre became the 17th President of Valparaiso University in October of 1988. Before coming to Valparaiso University, Dr. Harre served as President of Concordia University in St. Paul, Minnesota. As President, Dr. Harre serves as a teacher, mentor, and community volunteer. He offers his services and time to many professional organizations including serving on the board of directors for numerous organizations throughout Northwest Indiana including the Northwest Indiana Forum, the Valparaiso Community Development Corporation, Munster Community Hospital, and the Quality of Life Council. Though Dr. Harre is dedicated to his career and community, he has never limited the love of his family. Dr. Harre and his wife Diane have three children, Andrea, Jennifer, and Eric, as well as four grandchildren, all of whom they are immensely proud.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating the Asian-American Medical Society's 1999 Crystal Globe Award winners. The service, dedication, and altruism displayed by Tsung Yeh, Mayor Scott King, Dr. Mridula Prasaad, and Dr. Alan Harre inspire us all to greater deeds.                          ____________________
