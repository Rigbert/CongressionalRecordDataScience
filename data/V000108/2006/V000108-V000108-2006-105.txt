Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincerity that I take this time to congratulate the individuals who will take their oath of citizenship on July 4, 2006. In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony will take place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the Hammond Public Library andpresided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, will be held at Harrison Park in Hammond, Indiana.  America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for their families. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize the great things America has to offer. They realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success and a good life than here in America.  On July 4, 2006, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oath of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: Ledwin Jose Polanco Abreu, Ruchi Prabhakar Parikh, Fiona Bage, Lyubov Ezerska, Victor Rene De Leon Lopez, Simon Gomez Zuniga, Inese Steinbahs, Edgar Leonel Lopez Juarez, Kyung Ho Yum, Mila Plavsic, Elvira Tirado, Branko Prpa, Miyoko Kawanoue, Doaa Fayez El Malh, Fabian Navarro Patino, Ghali Abdul Waheb Alsaymari, Hiraben Bhogilal Devgania, Doris Monika Cox, Bertha Romero, Grace Haesuk Lee, Vasilj Plavsa, Mary Theckenath, IIir Aliu, Young Jean Choi, lIce Angelkoski, Elizabeth Murphy, Ernesto Berong Chan, Ivonne Golfis, Prajwal Rajappa, Georgios Mihail Krinis, Alejandro Vega, Mohammed Riaz, Eva Lazaroski, Fady Eissa El Malh, Josue Daniel Bojorquez Nunez, Barbara Ivette Quezada, Danilo Djuric, Enero Manguerra Salunga, Jose Peregrino, Maureen Alexis Stevens, Chun Gao Fred Li, John Raymond Tanner, Martha Gutierrez De Rangel, Sayyada Mushthari Begum, Aline Cortes, Sandra Elaine Fraley, Vicente Gil Baltazar, Maria Isabel Maldonado, and Aladean Naji Shalabi.  Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ...``of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who will become citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2006, the day of our Nation's independence. They, too, will be American citizens, and they, too, will be guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
