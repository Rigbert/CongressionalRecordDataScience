 Mr. Speaker, I would hope on behalf of my side, and I have talked to my friend from Missouri (Mr. Blunt) on the other side, I know both of us want to bring this session to a close. Members had hoped to be home certainly this weekend. Christmas is a week from tomorrow. I am hopeful that we can conclude tomorrow, and I would hope that we would all work towards that end.                          ____________________[Pages H12143-H12144]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM  (
