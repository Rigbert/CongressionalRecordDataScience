 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Kentuckian Terry Wilcutt on the occasion of his recent journey to the International Space Station as commander of the space shuttle Atlantis.  Congratulations to Colonel Wilcutt, on achieving the kind of academic and professional success it takes to receive the honor of commanding a flight into space. Colonel Wilcutt has flown to space not once, but four times, and on two such flights he has held the title of mission commander. I, along with my fellow Kentuckians, am certainly proud to call him one of Kentucky's own. His accomplishments speak well for his home state as well as his alma mater, Western Kentucky University.  Colonel Wilcutt is a Kentuckian, born and bred. He was born in Russellville, KY, graduated from Louisville's Southern High School in 1967, and is a 1974 graduate of Western Kentucky University with a bachelor of arts degree in math. Colonel Wilcutt taught high school math for 2 years and then entered the Marine Corps. While in the Marine Corps, he attended the notorious ``Topgun'' Naval Fighter Weapons School, achieved honors at every level of pilot training and has logged over 4,400 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.  Colonel Wilcutt's career in aeronautics began in 1990 when he was selected by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, to become an astronaut. Prior to his September 2000 trip to space, Colonel Wilcutt flew on three missions to space and logged more than 724 hours in space.  On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I congratulate you on your accomplishments. Only a handful of Americans reach the level of excellence required and receive the honor of being selected to lead missions into space. Colonel Wilcutt, I am proud of you, your fellow Kentuckians are proud of you, and your alma mater of Western Kentucky University is proud of you. Thank you for your brave service to our country, and best wishes for further success in the future.                          ____________________
