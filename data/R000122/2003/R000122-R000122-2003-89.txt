President, this amendment would add funding for our libraries and museums. We all understand in every part of this country the vital role that libraries and museums play in education and culture and in community spirit.  Many times President Bush is criticized by Members of Congress for not living up to his expectations in terms of funding. But here is an example where I am proposing to increase funding to the levels President Bush requested in his fiscal year 2004 budget proposal to the Senate.  For the Improving Literacy Through School Libraries program my amendment would add $15.081 million to bring it up to the total of $27.5 million that President Bush requested. For the Library Services and Technology Act I request an additional $24.1 million to bring it up to $171.48 million, the Bush total plus an additional $1.8 million needed to double the minimum state allotment. For the Museum Services Act I ask for $5.18 million to bring it up to the total suggested by the President.  I believe we should support the President on this one and agree to this amendment. It is fully offset.
