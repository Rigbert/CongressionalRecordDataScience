 President, I am pleased that the Conference Report before the Senate contains the State Department authorization bill.  With enactment of this legislation, we will finally--after three years of effort--approve critical legislation to authorize the payment of nearly $1 billion in back dues to the United Nations. Enactment of this legislation will serve, I believe, three important purposes. It should finally end the long-festering feud between the U.N. and Washington about our unpaid back dues; it should bring much-needed reforms to the world body so that it can more effectively perform its missions; and it should, I hope, end the debate about the utility of the U.N., and restore bipartisan support in Congress for the U.N. system.  The agreement before us will allow us to pay $926 million in arrears to the United Nations contingent upon the U.N. achieving specific reform conditions, or ``benchmarks,'' to borrow the Chairman's expression.  The first set of these conditions can be readily certified--thereby releasing $100 million immediately. The second and third set of conditions will be difficult to achieve. But I have great confidence in our ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke. And I believe that with the money on the table--that is, with the assurance that the U.S. payment will be available--the reforms will be easier to obtain then they might otherwise be.  The State Department authorization bill contains several other important provisions which I would like to highlight briefly.  First, the bill authorizes $4.5 billion in funding over the next five years for construction of secure embassies overseas. The tragic embassy bombings in East Africa in August 1998 underscored the current vulnerability of our embassies to terrorist attack. Simply stated, the large majority of our embassies around the world do not meet current security standards. Thousands of U.S. government employees--both Americans and foreign nationals--are at risk, and we must do all that we can to protect them. In addition to authorizing funding, this bill codifies many important security standards, including therequirement of that embassies be set back 100 feet from the street, and the requirement that all agencies be co-located in the embassy compound.  All this is important. But what is essential is that we provide the actual funding. So far, aside from last fall's emergency appropriations bill, funding for embassy security has fallen far short of need. The President requested $3 billion in advance appropriations in his budget request, which was rejected by the Appropriations Committees. We must give our attention to funding this priority matter next year.  Second, the bill provides for the establishment of a Bureau of Verification and Compliance in the Department of State to monitor arms control and non-proliferation agreements. In his plan for the integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency into the State Department, the President proposed that the functions of verification and compliance be handled by a ``Special Adviser'' to the Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security.  We think the Administration's proposal is ill-advised. Given the way the State Department operates--where key policy battles are waged among bureaus at the Assistant Secretary level --this ``adviser'' would be a weak bureaucratic actor, and the function of assuring compliance with arms control treaties and non-proliferation regimes would thereby be unacceptably diminished. Therefore, the conference report includes a provision which requires that this important duty be handled by an Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance.  Third, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia (RFA) for another ten years. RFA, which was established in 1994 pursuant to legislation I introduced, broadcasts news and information to the People's Republic of China and other non-democratic states in East Asia. I am pleased that Congress has given its further stamp of approval to this important instrument of American foreign policy.  It is fitting that this bill is named for two devoted public servants who were deeply involved in the development of foreign policy legislation for the last two decades--James Nance and Meg Donovan.  Admiral James W. Nance, known to everyone as ``Bud'', served as staff director of the Committee on Foreign Relations for most of the 1990s, working with his long-time friend, the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Helms. Admiral Nance was a steady hand in guiding the Committee staff for so many years, and was integral to the initial development of the ``Helms-Biden'' legislation in 1997.  Meg Donovan was long-time staffer for our House counterpart committee, serving under Chairman Dante Fascell. After Chairman Fascell retired, Meg worked closely with the Foreign Relations Committee on behalf of Secretary Christopher, and then Secretary Albright, as a senior deputy in the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. Meg's advice and counsel was important on dozens of occasions--not only to senior State Department officials but also to our committee.  Bud Nance and Meg Donovan were both deeply committed to a bipartisan foreign policy. They were both taken from us too soon. It is therefore in tribute to them that we have named this bill--which represents an important act of bipartisanship--in their honor.              the need for small business superfund relief
