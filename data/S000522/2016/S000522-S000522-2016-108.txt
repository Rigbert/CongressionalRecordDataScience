Doug, thank you very much for your excellent remarks reminding us that Planned Parenthood alone is directly responsible for killing 7 million unborn babies. That is a staggering loss of lives killed by one organization. So thank you for your leadership.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin, Sean Duffy.  Sean offered legislation late last year that would have protected States that decided to defund Planned Parenthood. It passed overwhelmingly, and I want to thank him for his leadership as well.
