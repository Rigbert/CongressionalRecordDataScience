One of the problems we have right now is that during the last administration, there was a war on fossil fuel--which includes coal and nuclear also--and some of the damage has already been done. Unfortunately, we can't come in with a ready fix now and assume--because a lot of the generators out there had done field switching out of coal, so you can't switch it back. So I will say it was help coming not quite on time, but nonetheless it is here now.                          ____________________
