 President, I wish to recognize a fellow Iowan, C. Edward ``Ed'' Brown, FACHE, on his election as the chair of the board of directors of the American Medical Group Association.  Mr. Brown has had a distinguished career in health care in Iowa where he has served for the last 15 years as chief executive officer of the Iowa Clinic, a multispecialty group practice in Des Moines. Ed has a long list of achievements in delivering cutting edge, quality focused health care to the benefit of Iowans, and his achievements include the Iowa Clinic's adoption of electronic medical records and information technology systems. He holds a master's degree in health administration from Washington University in St. Louis, and he is a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives with over 25 years of experience in executive and senior levels of health care management.  As the head of the American Medical Group Association, Ed's vision and management skills will be put to good use in leading an organization that represents some of the Nation's highest quality and most prestigious health care delivery systems. It is wonderful to see someone with such a distinguished health care record in Iowa recognized at the national level as a dedicated leader who is committed to improving health care at such an important time for our Nation's health care system.  Ed's voice will be a valuable contribution to the health care debate in 2009 in Washington, and I congratulate him on this new chairmanship.                          ____________________
