President, Vermont is saddened by the death of the poet David Budbill, whose poetry celebrated the simple pleasures of life in Vermont and highlighted the lives of working Vermonters. He died on Sept 25, at the age of 76.  In the State that gave the world Robert Frost, Vermonters know and love our authentic poets. Through David Budbill's 10 books of poetry, 7 plays, an opera libretto, 2 children's books, and many public performances and readings, he became the most widely known and loved Vermont poet since Robert Frost.  He was born in Cleveland, OH, in 1940, and after attending Union Theological Seminary in New York City and teaching at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, he moved to Vermont--to Wolcott--in 1969.  He then learned to use a chainsaw and worked in the woods to make a living, while also writing poems about the people he met and about his experiences there. His first book of poems, ``The Chain Saw Dance,'' was published in 1976.  Other poems and books of poems followed, and David gradually created a fictionalized version of his own community, which he called Judevine--a place where rough-hewn loggers, sawyers, farm wives, gas station attendants, and shattered Vietnam veterans struggled to make a living amid the rugged beauty of rural Vermont. That material was later shaped into a play, also entitled Judevine, which was widely produced, both in Vermont and nationally.  Then in the 1990s, Budbill's focus deepened. He began writing poems about his own life in Walcott, thinly disguising himself as ``Judevine Mountain,'' an old Chinese sage, who somehow was settled on a nearby Vermont hillside. He wrote with the spareness, directness and clarity of the ancient Asian poets he admired. One short example is ``What Issa Heard.'' Issa is an 18th century Japanese haiku poet. Here is what David wrote:                          ``What Issa Heard''     Two hundred years ago Issa heard the morning birds     singing sutras to this suffering world.     I heard them too, this morning, which must mean,     since we will always have a suffering world,     we must also always have a song.  David wrote poetry and plays that tapped into and expressed the essence of northern Vermont, and he plumbed these subjects so deeply that they became universal through his pen. His rural characters, Antoine, Grace, Tommy, and others, are quintessential Vermonters, but they are also vivid human beings with the same sorts of hopes, fears, triumphs, and disappointments that we all experience. Similarly, his ``Judevine Mountain'' poems were expressions of his own life, but they continue to resonate deeply with the lives of everyone who has read and loved his poems.  In short, David Budbill's poetry and plays accurately, meaningfully and profoundly depict rural Vermont--his place, that is also our place. They have a universality that have and will enrich lives in Vermont and in the larger world forever.                          ____________________
