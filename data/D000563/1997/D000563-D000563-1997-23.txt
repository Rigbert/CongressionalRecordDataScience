President, to mark the celebration of World Food Day on October 16, I rise today to recognize the work of the United Nations' World Food Programme. The U.N.'s World Food Program is the largest international food aid organization in the world. Last year alone it fed over 45.3 million people in 84 countries, transporting 2.2 million tons of food by ship, canoe, river barge, on the backs of donkeys and elephants, and by parachute drop in remote areas.  The World Food Programme distributes food at hospitals, clinics, and schools to fight malnutrition, which kills 11,000 children under the age of 5 every day and stunts the physical growth and intellectual development of those it does not kill.  When disaster strikes, the World Food Programme is there. When severe droughts threatened North Korea and Southern Africa, the World Food Programme helped prevent famine by feeding millions of people, especially children. The World Food Programme has also provided food to ensure the stability of the peace process in Mozambique and to assist refugees when war hit the Caucasus.  The World Food Programme helps people escape the poverty trap by promoting economic self-reliance. In exchange for food, workers repair dykes in Vietnam, install irrigation systems in India, replant forests in Ethiopia, and construct mountainside terraces in Peru which prevent topsoil erosion.  As an essential element of its strategy of combating hunger, the World Food Programme encourages the empowerment of women. In places like rural Pakistan, the World Food Programme promotes female literacy by giving vegetable oil to parents who send their daughters to school.  In war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Guatemala, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, and Bosnia, the World Food Programme trains local people to carry out demining operations which clear roads and land, allowing the delivery and production of food and the safe return of refugees.  Americans can take special pride in the accomplishments of the World Food Programme. Not only is the United States the program's single biggest donor, it also played a central role in its creation, when President Kennedy committed the resources and leadership necessary to make it a reality in 1963.  I urge you, my fellow colleagues, and all my fellow Americans to support the work of the World Food Programme.                          ____________________
