 Mr. McNERNEY. I thank the gentleman.  As currently written, H.R. 910 prohibits the EPA from taking action to control greenhouse gas emissions. However, the bill provides a few narrow exceptions, such as allowing for the continuation of statutorily authorized research, development, and demonstration programs meant to combat climate change. My amendment simply clarifies that voluntary programs to control climate change are also exempted from the bill's prohibitions and can continue to take place.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).  The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Cuellar  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in House Report 112-54.
