There are so many things to consider, as we outlined, such as fast-growing States, large States, small States. I would have to say to the senior Senator from Texas, we in Oklahoma are kind of in the same situation as Texas. We have always been a donor State. We are just delighted to look down the road and see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that we are getting to the point where we will all have a minimum of 95 percent. I can remember when that number was at 77 percent and then 80 percent and then 90.5 percent and now up to 95 percent.  This is one of the difficulties. The Senator from Texas is from one of the three largest States and it is a fast-growing State. In my opening remarks, I mentioned that to come up with a formula, as the Senator from Nevada has said, it is a very difficult thing, because there are fast-growing States. There has to be a ceiling but there also has to be a floor. There has to be consideration for donee and donor.  I thought it was kind of interesting, during the remarks of the Senator from Texas, that the Senator from Nevada came over and said, I wish we were doing as well as Texas on percentages.  Later on we are going to have full-size charts.
