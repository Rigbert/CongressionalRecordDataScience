 President, I will not be objecting, but I do want to briefly make a comment. This is the result of a successful discussion among the majority leader, the White House, and myself. Based on the White House assurance that there will be no recess appointments during the upcoming adjournment, I will not be objecting.  I wish to say to my friend, the majority leader, this is the way we ought to be conducting business. I think it was a successful negotiation, and I certainly do not object.
