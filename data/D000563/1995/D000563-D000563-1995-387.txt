Speaker, I think we all know that when it comes to television ratings, the Simpson trial is going to get a lot more viewers than the proceedings of the House of Representatives, but I hope that America will tune in today to this debate on the balanced budget amendment. It is critically important to every American who values Social Security and Medicare. What the Republicans are proposing is literally to make certain that Social Security will be vulnerable to cuts for years to come. They will not tell you, but I think the facts bear us out.  They are going to call for a 30-percent cut in Medicare as a result of today's debate, and senior citizens will pay more out of pocket, have fewer services, and we will see hospitals closing across America.  These are facts the Republicans do not want to disclose but they are simple facts that are inevitable conclusions from where they stand. We should not be surprised.  Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote in USA Today in 1987, ``It's time to replace Social Security.''  It is no priority for the Republicans, but it is a priority for America to protect our senior citizens, to protect Social Security and to protect Medicare.                          ____________________
