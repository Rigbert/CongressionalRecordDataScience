I hope they will reconsider and join with us in a constructive way to enact comprehensive immigration reform. We do not need more divisiveness and derision. This bill is not the bill I would have designed. It includes many features I do not support and fails to include many that I do. Nonetheless, I will support cloture and will continue to work to enact bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform.
