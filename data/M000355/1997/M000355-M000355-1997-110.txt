 BENNETT. I will be happy to.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Massachusetts was talking about State and local referenda. There have been some. Most of them have either been struck down by the courts, as in the case of Missouri, Minnesota, Oregon, and Cincinnati. The balance are in litigation, such as the new State law in Maine which virtually no one believes will be upheld by the Federal courts.  The Senator is correct, there has been some experimentation at the State and local level. Virtually all of them have been struck down or are on the way to being struck down.
