 President, reserving the right to object--and I will object--I just wanted to say to the majority leader, and particularly to Senators McCain and Feingold, I congratulate them for their success to date on this issue. There was certainly an overwhelming victory in the House yesterday. But, as we all know, this legislation kept being rewritten during the night. It finally passed at 3 a.m.  We have people on my side of this issue who did not prevail in the House yesterday, and they would like to have an adequate time to read the legislation. Fortunately, we are not in session next week, which gives everybody on both sides an opportunity to look at the fine print, because at this stage, I say to my friend from Arizona, we are shooting with real bullets. This could well become law. I don't think any harm is done by simply leaving the majority leader in the same position he would be in a week from Tuesday, to propound a similar unanimous consent request.  For the moment, pending a thorough scrutiny of the legislation that passed at 3 o'clock this morning, I object.
