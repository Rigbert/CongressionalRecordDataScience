 By sharing our bounty we have saved millions in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Angola.  To date, however, our response to North Korea's famine has been cautious and inadequate.  Over the past 12 months, the United States has provided a total of about $60 million in food aid, including the recent announcement of $27.4 million for 100,000 metric tons of grain.  The world, following our restrained lead, has been slow to meet the genuine emergency needs of the North Korean people. According to the World Food Program, the North began 1997 roughly 2 million tons of grain short of what it would need to avoid famine. But as of July 1, the North had received a total of only about 423,000 tons of food aid, It had managed to purchase or barter another 330,000 tons, leaving a shortfall of more than 1 million tons for the remainder of the calendar year.  The United States has never linked politics with emergency food assistance, and we should not do so now.  We can do more.  And we should do more to avert mass starvation and the incumbent risk of political and military instability of the Korean peninsula.                            roots of famine  Why is the North experiencing a famine? North Korean authorities attribute the shortages to a string of bad weather, including serious flooding in 1995 and 1996. Truth be told, however, the famine is largely the result of wrong-headed, discredited Communist economic policies and the devotion of vast resources to the North Korean armed forces.  But this does not make the North Korean people less deserving of emergency relief. It is not ethically permissible to use starvation as a weapon to force the North Korean dictatorship to undertake essential economic reforms.  Some observers worry that the North might divert our food aid from those who are truly hungry to the military or party elite.  But international relief agencies are able to send their monitors through-out the famine-stricken areas where supplies are being delivered. The World Food Program has even chartered a helicopter to facilitate oversight.  United States private voluntary organizations will soon begin directly supervising the distribution of American assistance, opening another window into life inside the hermit kingdom.  The bottom line? We can have a high degree of confidence that the vast majority of any assistance we provide will reach the intended targets.                        why not starve them out?  Opponents of emergency famine relief for North Korea wonder aloud whether the famine might not be a blessing in disguise; the perfect mechanism to bring about the downfall of one of the most repressive regimes left on the planet. But this cynical view is not only immoral, it displays a total disregard for the potentially explosive results of such a policy of strangulation.  Famines are profoundly restabilizing events. No one can predict with confidence how North Korea might respond. But it is obvious to me that we do not want the North--which may possess one or two nuclear weapons--to experience panic, massive population migrations, and instability.  In testimony earlier this month before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Andrew Natsios, director of foreign disaster assistance during the Bush administration and now vice-president of World Vision, a nongovernmental relief organization operating in North Korea, warned that the North's famine could soon reach the irreversible stage.  He added that by the time the world sees CNN broadcasts or emaciated North Korean children too weak to lift themselves off their cots, it will be too late to save them.                             food for peace  Next Tuesday, August 5, representatives of North Korea, South Korea, China, and the United States are scheduled to convene talks aimed at replacing the tattered 1953 Armistice with a peace treaty. If history is any guide, these historic negotiations are likely to be both difficult and protracted.  But while the diplomats talk and the world waits and prays for peace, famished innocent North Koreans move closer to death.  It is time for the United States to lead a comprehensive, humane response to the North's famine.  Not because the North has agreed to peace talks;  Not because the North has frozen its nuclear program and accepted international atomic energy agency monitoring of its Yongbyon nuclear facility; and  Not because the North is cooperating for the first time in 50 years in the search for the remains of America's 8,000 missing servicemen from the Korean war.  We should respond because it is the smart thing to do. It is the noble thing to do. It is an expression of all that is best about America that cannot help but resonate in the hearts of the North Korean people.                          ____________________
