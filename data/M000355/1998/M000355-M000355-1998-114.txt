  The amendments (Nos. 3528 through 3534) are as follows:                           amendment no. 3528       The Senate finds that:       According to the Department of State, Iran continues to      support international terrorism, providing training,      financing, and weapons to such terrorist groups as Hizballah,      Islamic Jihad and Hamas;       Iran continues to oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process and      refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist;       Iran continues aggressively to seek weapons of mass      destruction and the missiles to deliver them;       It is long-standing U.S. policy to offer official      government to government dialogue with the Iranian regime,      such offers having been repeatedly rebuffed by Tehran;       More than a year after the election of President Khatemi,      Iranian foreign policy continues to threaten American      security and that of our allies in the Middle East;       Despite repeated offers and tentative steps toward      rapprochement with Iran by the Clinton administration,      including a decision to waive sanctions under the Iran-Libya      Sanctions Act and the President's veto of the Iran Missile      Proliferation Sanctions Act, Iran has failed to reciprocate      in a meaningful manner.       Therefore it is the sense of the Senate that:       (1) the Administration should make no concessions to the      government of Iran unless and until that government moderates      its objectionable policies, including taking steps to end its      support of international terrorism, opposition to the Middle      East peace process, and the development and proliferation of      weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; and       (2) there should be no change in U.S. policy toward Iran      until there is credible and sustained evidence of a change in      Iranian policies.                           amendment no. 3529(Purpose: To provide additional resources for enhanced alternative crop                   development support in source zone)       On page 10 line 19, insert ``Provided further, That of the      funds appropriated under the previous proviso not less than      $80,000,000 shall be made available for alternative      development programs to drug production in Colombia, Peru and      Bolivia.                           amendment no. 3530   (Purpose: To establish a Joint United States-Canada Commission on Cattle and Beef and dairy products to identify, and recommend means of     resolving, national, regional, and provincial trade-distorting    differences between the countries with respect to the production, processing, and sale of cattle, beef, and dairy products, and for other                                purposes)       At the appropriate place, insert:     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE.       (a) It is the Sense of the Senate that:       (1) The U.S. Department of Agriculture should use the GSM-     102 credit guarantee program to provide 100 percent coverage,      including shipping costs, in some markets where it may be      temporarily necessary to encourage the export of U.S. wheat.       (2) The U.S. Department of Agriculture should increase the      amount of GSM export credit available above the $5.5 billion      level (as it did in the 1991/1992 period). In addition to      other nations, extra allocations should be made in the      following amounts to:       (A) Pakistan--an additional $150 million;       (B) Algeria--an additional $140 million;       (C) Bulgaria--an additional $20 million; and       (D) Romania--an additional $20 million.       (3) The U.S. Department of Agriculture should use the PL-     480 food assistance programs to the fullest extent possible,      including the allocation of assistance to Indonesia and other      Asian nations facing economic hardship.       (4) Given the President's reaffirmation of a Jackson-Vanik      waiver for Vietnam, the U.S. Department of Agriculture should      consider Vietnam for GSM and PL-480 assistance.                           amendment no. 3533       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:      ``That of the funds made available by prior Foreign      Operations Appropriations Acts, not to exceed $750,000 shall      be made available for the Claiborne Pell Institute for      International Relations and Public Policy at Salve Regina      University.''                           amendment no. 3534   (Purpose: to prohibit the availability of funds for Haiti unless                       certain conditions are met)       Beginning on page 90 line 1, after the word ``the'' insert      ``central''.

Mr. President, this amendment reflects a significant change in course on how we administer U.S. assistance in Haiti. From a practical standpoint, the amendment will not decrease our total commitment to the people of Haiti. However, it does place very clear restrictions on assistance to the Haitian government.  To best understand the reasons for this amendment--and why we have chosen to place more conditions on direct aid to the government of Haiti--it is important to first talk about the current situation in Haiti.  Mr. President, I have visited Haiti six times in the past three years. I have taken a great interest in assisting the people of Haiti as they establish, develop and sustain democracy, economic stability and a better quality of life. Through these visits, I have had the opportunity to see what changes have taken place and the general direction of events in Haiti.  My colleagues may recall that on April 3, 1998, I provided the Senate an update on the current economic, and political state of Haiti. At that time, I stated that Haiti's political system was not stable. Little has changed for the better since then. This continued instability is of direct concern to the United States. The concern of course is that this unstable democracy could descend into outright chaos. If this occurs, the result could be an exodus of boat people coming to our shores.  Mr. President, let me mention a few key facts to describe the current situation there.  First, it has been over 14 months since then Haitian Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned due to his frustration with the government's inability to resolve an electoral dispute and implement his economic modernization plan. Since then, a Prime Minister has not been confirmed by the Parliament.  The Prime Minister is designated as the Chief Executive of the Government. He appoints the Cabinet and basically runs the government. Without a Prime Minister, the country simply cannot function. Bills that may be passed by the Haitian Parliament cannot be signed into law and the privatization of any government industries cannot be fully implemented.  It is truly unfortunate, that to date, this vacancy has not been filled. The current Education Minister has been nominated for the position. It is, however, unclear if he will be confirmed by the Haitian Senate. One of the main reasons for this continued delay stems from the Haitian government's inability to resolve the serious discrepancy surrounding the April 1997 elections.  This current political impasse stems from pervasive fraud and improper vote tabulation regarding elections held in April of 1997. Not only have the Haitian opposition political parties demanded that the April 1997 elections be annulled, the international community, including the United Nations, has also deemed the elections--which produced only a meager five percent turnout--fraudulent. The opposition political parties continue to insist that they will not move forward to confirm a Prime Minister until the April 1997 electoral dispute is resolved.  This paralysis in government is being felt everywhere: economic reform efforts have stalled. The legislature still has not passed a budget. It has not enacted structural reforms needed to free up over $100 million in foreign assistance, nor has it approved loans for millions in technical assistance. The process of privatizing key government industries is dramatically slow, as are plans to downsize the public sector. With progress impeded by a political stalemate it is no surprise that potential investors who could play a key role in uplifting Haiti's economic development are discouraged from going forward.  Complicating matters even more was an upcoming national/municipal election in Haiti slated for November 1998. Hundreds of seats were up, including the entire lower chamber of the Haitian Parliament, up to two-thirds of the Senate and all municipal seats. Since there continues to be no resolution to the irregularities surrounding the previous election, however, the elections that constitutionally should be held in November have not been scheduled nor is there reason to believe that they will occur any earlier than next spring. All of this raises even more questions and concerns on Haiti's ability to administer future elections, including the presidential elections scheduled for the year 2000.  Democracy literally is at a standstill in Haiti. And it will remain stagnant until previous electoral disputes are resolved, and a credible, nonpartisan, competent electoral commission to oversee elections is established.  The composition of the electoral commission is the key source of controversy. A number of opposition parties in Haiti would like to have some representation on the commission, or at least make sure that the commission is neutral and not biased.  Mr. President, I understand that Haitian President Preval recently said he will move forward with naming a provisional electoral council. There is concern that he intends not to consult with all opposition parties--meaning that the interests of other political parties will likely be excluded. This step would not seem to be an effective way to resolve the current political impasse.  When I spoke about Haiti last April, I urged that no U.S. assistance be used to underwrite the proposed November elections until a settlement of the April 1997 electoral dispute is reached--and until a fair and independent Electoral Council is established in accordance with the constitution. I am pleased that these conditions on funding are currently in the pending Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill, as well as in the House version.  Even if the electoral disputes are resolved and an electoral commission appointed, democracy cannot be sustained as long as lethal violence is seem as an effective tool to achieve political goals. To date, not one single case of the dozens of political killings that have occurred in Haiti since the early 1990's have been resolved. As a result, no one has been convicted and sentenced for any one of these crimes.  Mr. President, according to a House International Relations Committee staff report released just last week, fears of a new wave of political killings are on the rise following the recent murder of a Catholic priest who was a vocal critic of the current government, as well as of former President Aristide. The report also states that ``A key opposition leader expressed concern that three other political figures may be targeted for assassination.''  Not only have opposition political leaders been allegedly threatened, Haitians working for democratic institutions such as the International Republican Institute have also been targeted for intimidation and threats on their lives. One Haitian IRI employee was even held at gunpoint for his involvement in democratic activities in Haiti.  Mr. President, I also am concerned about new reports of drug corruption within the Haitian government. Specifically, there have been numerous reports in Haitian newspapers that Haitian National Police employees were arrested for involvement in drug trafficking. Haiti has become increasingly attractive as a transit point for international drug traffickers. Unless we address this situation soon, Haiti could turn into a full-fledged narco-state. And that means more and more illegal drugs coming through Haiti to the United States.  Mr. President, I have given you a brief outline and assessment of the current political situation in Haiti.  It has been the policy of this Congress for three years that until the Haitian government is able to meet specific economic, political and social reforms, our assistance to that government should be extremely limited. The money, instead should go to benefit Haitians directly.  That was the fundamental purpose of an amendment originally offered by our former Majority Leader, Bob Dole in 1995. Under the original Dole amendment, benchmarks for reform had to be met if assistance was to be provided. If these conditions were not met, government assistance would be transferred to non-governmental organizations, of NGOs. In the end, the President called for and received from Congress the power to waive these conditions and allow aid to go forward if he believed restricting aid to the Haitian government posed a national security concern to the United States. Congress included this national security waiver with the hope that things would improve in Haiti. Each year for the past three years, we have renewed the Dole amendment with some marginal modifications. Each year, the President has exercised his waiver authority to keep U.S. aid flowing to the Haitian government. And each year we hope the Haitian government will finally get its act together.  Well, Mr. President, three years have gone by. And the situation remains bleak. Based on a review of that situation, I now believe that it is necessary to go back to the original Dole proposal by removing the national security waiver. We have tried--patiently--for three years to work with the Haitian government to establish and sustain democracy there. Yet, I find it extremely difficult to invest in a government that is not willing to make changes to advance democracy and its economic health. We have spent well over $2 billion in the past four years in Haiti.  We should continue to fund programs through NGOs that will benefit Haitians. But giving the government money for programs if they are not willing to implement needed political and economic reforms is wasted money.  Mr. President, let me turn now to an explanation of my amendment to the this bill. Let me first make it clear that this amendment does not prohibit assistance to Haiti. Just like current law, this amendment conditions our assistance to the Government of Haiti--but not the Haitian people. That means that any funds distrtibuted to Haiti through NGOs for the benefit of Haitians will not be threatened nor compromised in any manner.  Let me first outline the important general conditions that the Haitian government must meet before we believe it receives any additional funding from the US government. These conditions are outlined--almost verbatim--in the pending Senate and House Foreign Operations Approprations bill.  These general conditions include:  First, the Haitian government must re-sign the Agreement on Migration Interdiction and Operations with the United States and must cooperate with the US in halting illegal emigration from Haiti. It has been nearly four years since this agreement expired and the US government has been waiting for Haiti to resign this agreement.  The second condition is that the Haitian government must conduct thorough investigations of extrajudicial and political killings and that it must cooperate with US authorities in these investigations. There have been dozens of political murders in Haiti over the past several years. Not a single one has been solved. That has got to change.  Third, the Haitian government must take action to remove from the Haitian National Police, and other national palace and ministerial guards, individuals who are credibly alleged to have engaged in or conspired to conceal gross violations of human rights or to have engaged in narcotics trafficking.  Fourth, that the Haitian government must complete privatization of at least three major public entities. The Haitian government is now years behind its own drafted scheduled in privatizing several key public entities.  The final condition is that the Haitian government must implement the counter-narcotics agreements recently signed between both countries last October. There are a total of six counter-narcotics agreements including the Ship Rider and Maritime Pursuit Agreements which allow US law enforcement to patrol Haitian waters for drug interdiction matters. These agreements basically allow for instantaneous implementation of drug enforcement activities between the two countries.  These are very important and reasonable conditions that must be met before the US government releases any general assistance directly to the government of Haiti. Many of them are not new.  Let me now address a more controversial question--whether the Administration can waive these conditions for national security reasons, and allow funding to go forward. For the past three years, the Administration has exercised its waiver authority to allow funding to go to the government. The pending bill before us continues this waiver; the pending House bill does not. My amendment would adopt the House version on this point. We must send a message to the government of Haiti that we cannot continue to give them money if they lack political will to make necessary reforms.  Mr. President, while my amendment would remove the national security interest waiver; there are several important exceptions to this amendment as well as in the pending bill that would enable the US government to continue funding certain important government programs. Taken together, these exceptions include--counter-narcotics assistance; support for the Haitian National Police's Special Investigative Unit; the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program; customs assistance; anti-corruption programs; urgent humanitarian assistance; and education. There is also a separate provision on conditioning electoral and administration of justice assistance to the government of Haiti under a separate set of conditions.  One additional point I want to make is while I have included several additional exceptions to the Limitation of Assistance provision to the government of Haiti--I intend to explore during the conference of this bill the possible need to limit the total amount of money the Haitian government can receive if conditions set for in this amendment are not met while assistance to the government in these areas continues to flow.  Mr. President, before I conclude, I would like to mention two essential assistance programs that we provide to Haiti through NGO's.  First and foremost, US assistance through P.L. 480 Title II feeding programs to the poor is absolutely critical and should be continued. There are impoverished people in Haiti--particularly children--who desperately need help. They are not responsible for the country's political crisis. They should not have to suffer because of it.  Mr. President, there has been a proliferation of facilities in Haiti which must care not only for a vast number of orphans but also for an increasing number of abandoned and neglected children. The capital city, Port-au-Prince, has seventy orphanages--all of these which are run by only one relief organization, Christian Relief Services (CRS). There are many other orphanages throughout the entire country which take care of thousands and thousands of orphaned and abandoned children in Haiti.  I have visited these facilities in Haiti and I can give you a first-hand account of the heart breaking stories. The flow of desperate children into these orphanges is constant and these institutions face an increasing challenge in accommodating all of these needy children. The sad part is that these many of these orphanages get no other means of support other than the food administered to them through CRS, which in turn receives its resources through AID.  Last year and again this year, I have worked with Senators Cochran and Bumpers--the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee--to ensure we continue the emergency feeding programs in Haiti through the PL 480 Title feeding program. I thank Chairman Cochran and Senator Bumpers for their assistance in funding this program last year and for doing so again in this year's bill.  Similarly, I have worked with Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy to include up to $250,000 to support a pilot program to assist Haitian children in orphanages. The objective behind the program is to find ways to help orphanages better organize and manage themselves to seek outside help for resources for these children. I thank the Chairman, and Senator Leahy for funding this initiative last year and for doing so again in the pending bill.  Another very important assistance program that should be maintained, ifnot expanded, is agricultural assistance programs. Agricultural production in Haiti is extremely low. In the long run, agricultural production is necessary if Haiti is to provide jobs and food for its population.  Haiti today imports two thirds of its food. Every day, thousands of Haitians leave rural areas where they are unable to provide for themselves, and flood into the cities which are unable to sustain the population pressures. In the long run, agricultural and rural development is crucial to the goal of providing jobs, income and food for Haiti's people.  To further develop the rural and agricultural sectors of Haiti, attention needs to be given to a decentralized development strategy. I believe that continued focus on non-governmental organizations is appropriate. In fact, current USAID funding for agriculture and environmental programs in Haiti is all administered through NGOs. I believe that we should be promoting regional development and that associations linking private sector interests with local government need to be established. One way to do this is to link our own successful foundations and institutions of higher education together with local Haitians interested in pursuing this goal.  Given the importance of developing and expanding sound agriculture and environment programs in Haiti, I intend to work with Chairman McConnell and Senator Leahy to ensure that at least 20% of our total assistance for Haiti be for the promotion of agriculture and environment programs in Haiti. It is my hope that they will accept this request in conference report language.  Mr. President, I cannot overestimate enough the need to continue assistance programs to Haiti through the NGO community. We want to help Haitians in terms of feeding programs, agriculture and environment programs, and other initiatives such as basic health and education.  Mr. President, as you can see from the specifics of my speech, I have given serious thought to our assistance policy toward Haiti. U.S. policy toward Haiti is complicated. As I said at the beginning of these remarks, establishing, developing and sustaining democracy in Haiti is an important national interest.  One thing is clear: The U.S. cannot do for Haiti what it will not do for itself. The Haitians first have to realize the need to solve their political crisis. They clearly have not yet hit rock bottom; maybe that's what it will take to create the political will to move forward. Unfortunately, I do not yet see the requisite political will and determination in Haiti.  In the meantime, we cannot just walk away from Haiti completely. We must find ways to help the Haitian people, primarily through NGO's--since the Haitian Government has proven itself to be incapable of providing for its own people.  There's a tough road ahead for Haiti. With this amendment, we are helping to set some realistic conditions whereby that country can succeed.
