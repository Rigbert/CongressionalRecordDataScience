Mr. Speaker, over the years, this Nation has worked hard to take discrimination out of the Constitution, and today, we want to put it back in.  I can recall just a few short years ago that there were laws inscribed in some State constitutions saying that blacks and whites could not marry. We changed that.  Today, we look back on those days, and we laugh. There will come a time when generations yet unborn will look back on this Congress, look back on this debate, and laugh at us. This is not a good day in America. This is a sad day in the House of the people.  For one who faced death, who was beaten and left bloody and unconscious at the Greyhound bus station in Montgomery, Alabama, in May of 1961; for one who had a concussion at the bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965, demonstrating, trying to end discrimination, segregation and separation, this is not the way.  This is unbelievable. It is unreal. I thought as a Nation and as a people we had moved so far down the road toward one family, one House, one America. To pass this legislation would be a step backward.  The institution of marriage is not begging this Congress for protection. No one is running through the halls of Congress. No one is running around this building saying protect us.                              {time}  1615  Whose marriage is threatened? Whose marriage is in danger if two people, in the privacy of their own hearts, decide they want to be committed to each other? Whose marriage is threatened? Whose marriage is in danger if we decide to recognize the dignity, the worth and humanity of all human beings?  The Constitution is a sacred document. It defines who we are as a Nation and as a people. Over the years, we have tried to make it more and more inclusive. We cannot turn back. We do not want to go back. We want to go forward. Today it is gay marriage; tomorrow it will be something else.  Forget about the politics; vote your conscience. Vote with your heart, vote with your soul, vote with your gut. Do what is right and defeat this amendment.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to say that there were people running around the halls screaming ``protect marriage.'' In fact, there were 50 African American pastors trying to meet with the Congressional Black Caucus, who refused to meet with them. So I am going to bring up one letter out of hundreds of thousands of letters that I have from particular pastors.  From this particular pastor, Dr. Creflo A. Dollar of the World Changes Ministries at College Park, Georgia, and I will not read the letter, but I will quote him, because he says that this is not a civil rights issue. This is an African American pastor from an African American church. Dr. Dollar says, ``This is not a civil rights issue, as many would have you believe, and attempts to frame it as such are an insult to the millions of Americans who have been the victims of actual discrimination in the past.''  Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record Dr. Dollar's letter.       It is a privilege for me to voice my enthusiastic support      for the Federal Marriage Protection Amendment currently      pending before Congress. The institution of marriage is a      fundamental building block of the American way of life, and      we are here today to say that it must not be allowed to be      redefined or reconstituted. The American family is under      attack--we are in the middle of a character crisis that      threatens the very foundations of our society--and our      message this morning is clear. There is only one kind of      marriage, and that is between a man and a woman. Any attempt      to deviate from that standard by any means--be it      legislative, judicial or executive--is equivalent to      spiritual treason. The sacred covenant of marriage was      created by God Himself and is not subject to interpretation      by anyone.       Our support for this amendment should not be viewed as      homophobic, exclusionary or discriminatory. The ministries      represented here today extend the love of God to all people,      including those who exemplify lifestyles that we don't agree      with, and our doors are open to everyone. To attempt to      categorize our collective stance in any other way is both      irresponsible and inaccurate. This is not a Civil rights      issue, as many would have you believe, and attempts to frame      it as such are an insult to the millions of Americans who      have been the victims of actual discrimination in the past.      Part of what makes America the greatest country in the world      is the freedoms that our citizens enjoy to make whatever      religious, social, professional and lifestyle choices they      desire, within the reasonable boundaries of a civil society.      However, for America to redefine herself for every movement      that comes along would weaken who we are as a nation, not to      mention the profound negative impact such a change would have      on our children. We speak as one voice for the millions of      Americans in our congregations and all over the country who      can all be heard making the same plea today--please don't      begin a process of de-stabilizing the United States of      America by changing the rules for all of us in order to      accommodate a few of us. For mainstream Americans, this issue      is not negotiable.       We urge the members of Congress to approve this amendment      and to do it swiftly. Part of the responsibility of an      elected official is to represent the best interests of his or      her constituency, and we affirm today that the Federal      Marriage Protection Amendment is the right thing to do for      America. We wholeheartedly support President Bush and his      stance on this vital issue. We must seize this opportunity to      make a lasting statement to all who would alter the      fundamental institution on which our society is based. I      shudder to think about the America my grandchildren will      inherit tomorrow, if we don't take decisive action to protect      our heritage today. We are confident that the members of      Congress will stand up for what is right, and not allow      themselves to be bullied by a noisy minority. Our future as a      nation hangs in the balance. Thank you and God bless you . .      .  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin).
