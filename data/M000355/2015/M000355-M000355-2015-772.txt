 President, Joseph Ponder was proud to be a Kentucky State police trooper. ``He was eager and just absolutely loved his job,'' is how a State police spokesman described him.  Ponder tragically lost his life in the line of duty this week. We are thinking of that 31-year-old Rineyville native today in the Senate. We are praying for his family and for his friends.  I know his fellow officers in the law enforcement community feel the loss and so do Kentuckians whom he worked every day to protect. So I ask the entire Senate community to join me in honoring Trooper Ponder.                          ____________________
