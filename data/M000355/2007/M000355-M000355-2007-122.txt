 President, reserving the right to object--and I certainly will not object--I just want to take a brief moment to say how pleased I am we are able to reach this bipartisan compromise. This package will extend the current Internet tax moratorium for 7 years--nearly twice as long as the bill passed over in the House of Representatives. This is a positive step in protecting American consumers from taxes on Internet access, taxes that strike at the heart of innovation and economic growth in America.  I particularly thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire for his skillful role in bringing this issue before the Senate, for pushing it aggressively, and getting, in my judgment, a much better solution to this problem than was achieved in the House of Representatives. I know he shares my view, and I assume the view of everyone in the Senate, that the House will simply take up the Sununu measure and pass it.
