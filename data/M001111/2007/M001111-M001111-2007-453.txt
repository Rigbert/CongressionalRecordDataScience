 President, the Senate is currently considering the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Earlier, the Senator from Louisiana offered amendment No. 2384. I am concerned that the amendment is being offered to an appropriations bill. That amendment is clearly authorizing on an appropriations bill. Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, it is my understanding that the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee objects to that amendment. Therefore, I raise a point of order under rule XVI.
