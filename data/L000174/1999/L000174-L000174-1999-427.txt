 So colleagues will understand, in last year's Y2K bill which this Senate passed unanimously, which the President signed into law, we had basic consumer protections and business protections. In this bill, we bring forward business protections but we don't bring forward the consumer protections we passed last year.  Let's be consistent; let's make sure we give consumers at least as much protection as we give businesses. That is what I am asking for and all I am asking for in the Leahy amendment. I also say if it passes, it improves the chance of this actually being signed into law.  I yield to the distinguished Senator from South Dakota.
