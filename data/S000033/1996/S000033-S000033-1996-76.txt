 Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for yielding this time to me.  From the first day that I took office here in the Congress in 1991 I have been fighting to raise the minimum wage, and I hope very much that my colleagues finally are going to do the right thing on behalf of tens of millions of workers and raise the minimum wage today.  Mr. Speaker, when the minimum wage was first established in the 1930's, the opponents then said that the world was going to come to an end, the economy was going to collapse. And every single time that an effort has been made since then to raise the minimum wage, the same cries have come forward: The world is going to come to an end, we cannot raise the minimum wage.  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that today, at $4.25 an hour, the minimum wage is a starvation wage. The minimum wage today, in terms of purchasing power, is 26 percent less than it was 20 years ago. In terms of purchasing power it is at its lowest point in the last 40 years.  Mr. Speaker, there are tens of millions of Americans today who are working hard at $4.25 an hour, at $5 an hour, at $5.25 an hour, and they are unable to take care of the financial needs of their family. They are unable to put away money so that their kids can go to college. They cannot go on a vacation. Every single week, despite 40 or 50 hours of work, they are in as bad shape at the end of the week as they were before the week began.  Mr. Speaker, one of the great economic problems facing our country today is that the richest people are becoming richer, the middle class is shrinking, and most of the new jobs are being created are low-wage jobs.
