Glenn was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross six times and holds the Air Medal for his service during both of these conflicts.  As the beginning in a long line of firsts, Senator and Colonel Glenn went on to set a transcontinental speed record from Los Angeles to New York in July 1957. In February 1962, Glenn piloted the Mercury-Atlas 6 Friendship 7 spacecraft on the first manned orbital mission of the United States. After his distinguished service in these two wars and following the first phase of his career as an aviator, John Glenn continued his public service as a Senator representing our home State of Ohio from 1974-1999.  Completing his career of firsts, I was proud to see our former colleague Senator Glenn bring his career of public service full circle in his triumphant 1998 return space voyage; this time as a senior citizen. Today I rise to honor his hard work and lifetime of dedication to public service. He and his devoted wife have inspired all the world with their commitment to family, community, state, nation and the future. Their spirit of patriotism, courage, discovery and self sacrifice cut a path all can emulate and hope to achieve. Godspeed to them for all they have done for others.
