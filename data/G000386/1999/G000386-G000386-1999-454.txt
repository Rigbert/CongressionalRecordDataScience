 President, I rise today to bring your attention to a newspaper column that I believe provides thoughtful commentary on current events taking place in Kosovo and in the United States. The following, written by Mr. A.M. Rosenthal, appeared in the New York Times on April 9, 1999.  I ask that it be printed in the Record.  The material follows:       Do Americans understand that while we have been bombing the      Serbs, the following took place:       Libya was exonerated from responsibility in the destruction      of Pan AM 103.       Saddam Hussein's closedown of the U.N. search for Iraq's      nuclear, chemical and biological weapons went into its eighth      month. Richard Butler, the chief arms inspector, was barred      Wednesday by the Russians from even entering the U.N.      Security Council chamber where his inspection commission was      the agenda, marked for death.       China's Prime Minister was visiting America getting a great      press--plus a step nearer to a trade agreement that will      fatten China's economy and armed forces. On the day Zhu      Rongji arrived in Washington representing the Communist      politburo, President Clinton criticized not China's expanding      arrests of political and religious dissidents, but American      critics of China.       So: do Americans understand that while we fight one      dictatorship, fumbling around trying to heighten the war and      somehow end it at the same time, three other dictatorships      more dangerous to American interests are walking away with      America's pants?       The Libya deal was possible because the Administration      signed off on it. This sweetheart gift to Col. Muammar el-     Qaddafi ends the effective sanctions imposed on Libya for      harboring two Libyans accused of murdering 270 people in the      bombing of Pan AM 103 on Dec. 21, 1988.       American intelligence agents are not allowed to ask the      suspects now held in the Netherlands if perchance Qaddafi      knew what his boys were up to or Syria and Iran were      involved--as Western intelligence agencies had long believed.      And during the trial itself, Libya's Government is not to be      undermined, hear?       For Libya, a no-loser. Even if the men are found guilty,      the sanctions will remain ended. Italy, Russia, France and      other countries have already lined up fat oil and gas deals      with Libya. U.S. companies will follow. The deal is      disgusting, an insult to the dead and their families, and to      all, who fly in U.S. planes.       Do Americans understand that the U.S. delegation to the      U.N. did not stand up and holler at the barring of Mr.      Butler? Let's hope it will when he tries again today.       Do they understand that the President denounced U.S.      critics of China on the very day that Jeff Gerth and James      Risen of The Times were writing that even more Chinese      nuclear espionage took place than the reporters had already      disclosed? Another chapter in Chinese espionage was written      in 1995, reported to Samuel Berger, now the national security      adviser, in April 1996, who told the President in July 1997,      who ordered tightened security--in February 1998.       And do Americans understand that the Administration      disgraced itself in the war on Serbia?       Slobodan Milosevic, not America, is responsible for driving      cold, hungry, terrified Albanian Kosovars from their homes.      But Washington's disgrace is that President Clinton and his      top people did not know and did not expect that Mr. Milosevic      would use the bombing as an opportunity to expel them by the      hundreds of thousands. American leadership still does not      seem able to plan more than a couple of days ahead.       So we need no longer worry about America's credibility; we      have none.       For a democracy, credibility comes not just from smart      weapons but smart leaders, from respect for the intelligence      of the public, domestic and foreign, from a measure of      honesty. In a democracy, pretense in war or peace is      transparent, embarrassing and finally self-destructive.       We need not and should not support Kosovar secession. But      we helped Mr. Milosevic in his fight with the Kosovars by not      foreseeing his mass expulsion plans, and not having our own      plans that would treat the Serbian nation as something more      than a bombing target.       ``When at war, support the troops.'' To me, that means      making sure they have the strength they need, the affection,      respect--and doable mission.       What is does not mean is keeping our mouths shut about      misconduct of a war by an American Government--or about its      failure to protect American interests in other crises that      may inconveniently present themselves. That's not supporting      American armed forces, but walking away from them.                          ____________________
