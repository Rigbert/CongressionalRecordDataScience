 President, I say to the Senator from Iowa, we have a few amendments that may be offered. I am concerned that the offerors will have no time at all to explain their amendments prior to the votes at 11:15. I am wondering if the Senator from Iowa would object if we have Senators who want to offer amendments on our list, which they are entitled to do, prior to the vote at 11:15, how we could accommodate them and give them an opportunity to explain what the amendment was about.
