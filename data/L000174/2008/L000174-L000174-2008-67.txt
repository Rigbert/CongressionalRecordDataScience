President, I am going to momentarily suggest the absence of a quorum. We are into about a 5-minute window to work it out. I respect the rights of all Senators. The suggestion that the IP wait until next year, it is strongly supported by the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, about every Republican group there is. We had worked that out and included things that Republican Senators wanted. As a practical matter, though, if it has to wait any longer, we can assume it is dead. I assume I will still be chairman of the Judiciary Committee next year. I am perfectly happy to bring up all these judges and IP enforcement next year, if that is what my friends on the other side wish.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
