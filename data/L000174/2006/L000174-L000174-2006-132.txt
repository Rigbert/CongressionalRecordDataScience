President, today we consider a nominee for the new position of Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division. All too often, in the Bush-Cheney administration, national security has been cited as a justification for overriding the rule of law and for imposing unprecedented secrecy. With the acquiescence of the Republican-controlled Congress, this administration may be the most unresponsive in history and the most unaccountable.  Ken Wainstein is President Bush's selection to be the first Assistant Attorney General for National Security, a new position created by Congress. I will not oppose this nomination in the hope that Mr. Wainstein will work with us and be responsive to the Senate.  I have concerns about this administration's unilateral approach to national security issues. Four years ago, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department issued a secret legal opinion concluding that the President of the United States had the power to override domestic and international laws outlawing torture. The memo sought to redefine torture and asserted that the President enjoys ``complete authority over the conduct of war'' and asserted that application of the criminal law passed by Congress prohibiting torture ``in a manner that interferes with the president's direction of such core war matters as the detention and interrogation of enemy combatants would be unconstitutional.'' It seemed to assert that the President could immunize people from prosecution for violations of U.S. criminal laws that prohibit torture. This memo was withdrawn only after it became public because it could not withstand public scrutiny.  We have learned through the media of warrantless wiretapping and data-mining conducted by this administration. This, despite the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act and its express provisions, as well as the actions of the Senate in voting to curtail the data-mining programs by Admiral Poindexter at the Defense Department. We have yet to be provided with a convincing legal justification for these programs. We have yet to be able to investigate or hold the administration accountable. Instead, every effort at oversight and accountability has been obstructed or curtailed by the administration. The administration refuses to follow the law and submit matters to the FISA Court and claims state secrets to force court challenges to be dismissed. The administration tells the Senate when, what and how it may investigate. The Department of Justice's own internal Office of Professional Responsibility's probe of whether lawyers at the Department violated ethical rules in justifying these activities was shut down by the Attorney General and the White House.  I was disappointed 2 weeks ago when the Judiciary Committee reported out a bill on party lines that would rubberstamp the administration's warrantless wiretapping. We were told that the administration would only follow the law if we passed the legislation endorsed by Vice President Cheney. This is a bill that would expand governmental power and reduce governmental accountability in an area in which we have been unable to engage in effective oversight. As I have said many times and as I continue to believe, we should not legislate in this area until we know more about the NSA's domestic spying activities and more about why the administration chose to flout the law and bypass both the FISA Court and the Congress.  I support Senator Feinstein's bipartisan bill, which we also reported out of committee, and I commend her for her hard work to get it done. We should follow Senator Feinstein's thoughtful, cautious, and narrowly tailored approach. Her bill addresses the one concrete problem with FISA that the Attorney General identified, by making it easier for the Government to initiate electronic surveillance in emergency situations. It also clarifies that FISA does not require the Government to obtain a warrant in order to intercept foreign-to-foreign communications, regardless of where the interception occurs.  At the same time, we should continue to press the administration for information. We should not take ``no'' for an answer. As this administration continues to expand its power, the Department of Justice should be advising the President to obey the law and respect the Congress and the courts, not just helping to rationalize actions and forestall oversight.  In theory, the new position to which Mr. Wainstein has been nominated might help Department of Justice attorneys to act responsibly on national security issues, rather than just to do the White House's bidding. It should put national security issues into the hands of experts, not political cronies. In fact, the WMD Commission recommended in March of last year that the different components of the Department's dealings with national security, terrorism, counterintelligence, and foreign intelligence surveillance be combined to eliminate deficiencies and inefficiencies in the Department's national security efforts. Congress acted to create the post. This new Assistant Attorney General position can only serve a useful role if the person who occupies it is willing to think independently. This administration has consistently prized loyalty over independence and expertise.  Mr. Wainstein has some experience as a prosecutor, but he has also been a loyal official of this administration for some time now. I hope that he will be able to look at the crucial national security issues to be handled by this new office with a critical eye and a view toward respecting law and the Congress. If he does, he will be a breath of fresh air in the Bush-Cheney administration.  Recently, Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter and I received a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police. The FOP ``endorsed'' Mr. Wainstein ``in order to facilitate his departure from the U.S. Attorney's Office.'' They criticized him for being ``unwilling to perform'' the function of investigating and prosecuting an alleged attack on a police officer. That is not what I would term high praise for his judgment. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Fraternal Order of Police,                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2006.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington. DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman Specter and Senator Leahy: I am writing      on behalf of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to      advise you of our position on the nomination of Kenneth L.      Wainstein, currently the U.S. Attorney for the District of      Columbia, to be the Assistant Attorney General for the      National Security Division at the U.S. Department of Justice.       The F.O.P. is very frustrated by the manner in which Mr.      Wainstein is handling the investigation into the attack on a      Federal law enforcement officer by U.S. Representative      Cynthia L. McKinney. The grand jury has held this case for      more than two months when the usual practice of a Federal      prosecutor is to immediately arrest and swiftly indict people      that attack police officers. It is clear to us that the      accused in this case is receiving special treatment from Mr.      Wainstein. This is unacceptable--had the officer's attacker      in this case been a visitor to the Capitol instead of a U.S.      Representative, it is likely that he or she would have      already stood trial. Instead, under the stewardship of Mr.      Wainstein, we have a seemingly endless grand jury proceeding      and rumored talks of a plea deal, despite the fact that there      has not even been an indictment.       Given that the basic function of a prosecutor is to      investigate and prosecute cases, and given that Mr. Wainstein      seems unwilling to perform this function in a simple assault      case, the F.O.P. was initially reluctant to support his      nomination to Assistant Attorney General. However, upon      further reflection, we have reconsidered. There is a genuine      need to have an effective and appropriately aggressive      Federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia and, because      the responsibilities of the position for which he has been      nominated are largely advisory in nature, we have decided to      advocate his swift and immediate confirmation in order to      facilitate his departure from the U.S. Attorney's office. In      so doing, we hope that his replacement will prove to be      better able to handle pending cases--particularly those      involving assaults on law enforcement officers.       Justice is something that must be vigorously pursued and      Mr. Wainstein is waffling. We feel that someone of his      temperament is better suited to a less operational position      and, for this reason, on behalf of the more than 324,000      members of the Fraternal Order of Police, we urge his      expeditious confirmation. I thank you both in advance for      your consideration of our views on this matter. If I can be      of any further help, please feel free to contact me or      Executive Director Jim Pasco at my Washington office.           Sincerely,                                                 Chuck Canterbury,                                               National President.
