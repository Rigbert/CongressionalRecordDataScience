 President, I had not come to the floor to debate my good friend from Nevada, but let me add a couple of words before we adjourn.  I certainly agree with him, we need more forces in Iraq. Where they need to come from is from the Iraqi people. General Petraeus, the Commander of the famed 101st Airborne who took that unit into Iraq and stationed it in northern Iraq around Mosul for about a year, has now been given his next assignment. His next assignment is to go back to Iraq--and he is there now--to help the Iraqi people develop a military that can deal with the threat.  In the end, the area will be secure only if the Iraqi military and Iraqi police have both the skill and the desire to protect their country from these terrorists.  So, far from hoping we will get additional troops from around the world, even though we have 20,000 troops there from other countries now, the key to additional military in Iraq is in Iraq itself--Iraqi soldiers, well trained, fighting for their own country. And that training is well underway under the skilled leadership of General Petraeus.  With regard to the U.N., I readily concede there are a few things they can do well. They can put on elections. They can hand out humanitarian aid. But they do not have an army. And they are discredited in Iraq because of their involvement in the oil-for-food scandal which robbed Iraqis, for 10 years, of the opportunity to eat while this deal was enriching Saddam Hussein and his henchmen.  So the U.N. does not have a great reputation in Iraq, with good reason. We hope the U.N. will be able to play a useful role in moving Iraq from where it is today to a representative government, where it will be by the end of 2005.                          ____________________
