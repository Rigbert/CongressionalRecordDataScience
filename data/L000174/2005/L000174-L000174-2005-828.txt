President, I rise today to discuss an issue which, while not one that you would likely read about on the front page of the newspapers, is important nonetheless. It concerns the alarming rate of deterioration of the habitat of the Irrawaddy Dolphin in Southeast Asia. Recent statistics indicate that there are fewer than 100 Irrawaddy left in the world.  The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has placed the Irrawaddy Dolphin on its list of critically endangered species. The primary reasons for this sharp decline include destructive fishing practices, such as the use of dynamite or electric current, and mercury runoff from gold mines. These practices are leading to the extinction of an entire species.  Why should we care? Perhaps a quote from President John Kennedy provides the best answers to this question. In a 1963 address at American University, President Kennedy said ``. . . in the final analysis, our most basic common link, is that we all inhabit this small planet, we all breathe the same air, we all cherish our children's futures, and we are all mortal.''  I know every Member of the Senate wants to make the world a better place for our children and grandchildren. I am almost as certain that ensuring the survival of the Irrawaddy dolphin, an extraordinary species, would be something that we could do to help achieve this goal.  Congress has spoken on this issue. In the Senate report that accompanied last year's Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, Congress directed the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, to devise a strategy to help reverse the habitat decline of the Irrawaddy dolphin.  Some important nongovernmental organizations are already working on this issue, including the Wildlife Conservation Society and the Bronx Zoo in their Species Survival Program partnership. I hope USAID's strategy, which is due shortly, will be a first step in forming a public-private partnership that will prevent the Irrawaddy dolphin from going the way of the dodo and the passenger pigeon.  Once a species is gone, it is gone forever. We need to be sure this does not happen.                          ____________________
