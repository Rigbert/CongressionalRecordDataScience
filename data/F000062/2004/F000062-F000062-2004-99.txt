 President, I rise today to offer legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and his wife, Maria Del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals who live in the San Bruno area of California.  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States citizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much longer.  The Plascencias have worked for years to adjust their status through the appropriate legal channels, only to have their efforts thwarted by inattentive legal counsel. Repeatedly, the Plascencias' lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise communicate with them in anyway. He also failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even notify the Plascencias that he had them. Because of the poor representation they received, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia only became aware that they had been ordered to leave the country 15 days prior to their deportation. Although the family was stunned and devastated by this discovery, they acted quickly to secure legitimate counsel and to file the appropriate paperwork to delay their deportation to determine if any other legal action could be taken.  The Plascencias' current date of removal from the United States is set for June 23rd.  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed from the United States.  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded couple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to family and devotion to community.  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's Shellfish for the past 13 years, where his dedication and willingness to learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial position. He now oversees the market's entire packaging operation and several employees. The president of the market, in one of the several dozen letters I have received in support of Mr. Plascencia, referred to him as ``a valuable and respected employee'' who ``handles himself in a very professional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' to other employees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. Plascencia's job performance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' ``trusted,'' ``honest,'' and ``reliable.''  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as a medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. Not satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia went to school, earned her high school equivalency degree and improved her skills to become a medical assistant. Until her work permit expired last week, Mrs. Plascencia was working in Kaiser Permanente's Oncology Department, where she attended to cancer patients. Those who have written to me in support of Mrs. Plascencia, of which there are several, have described her work as ``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.'' In fact, Kaiser Permanente's Director of Internal Medicine, Nurse Rose Carino, wrote to say that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] involved in her community. She and her family are a solid example of the type of immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.'' Mrs. Carino went on to write that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an excellent employee and role model for her colleagues. She works in a very demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by the physicians she works with.''  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional successes to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. They saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health care benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want to send their children to college and give them an even better life.  This legislation is important because it would preserve these achievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to make substantive contributions to the community in the future. It is important, also, because of the positive impact it will have on the couple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen andeach of whom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the Bay Area community.  Christina, 13, is the Plascencias' oldest child, and an honor student with a 3.0 grade-point average at Parkside Intermediate School in San Bruno.  Erika, 9, and Alfredo, Jr., 7, are enrolled at Belle Air Elementary, where they have worked hard at their studies and received praise and good grades from their teachers. In fact, last year, the principal of Erika's school recognized her as the ``Most Artistic'' student in her class. Recently, Erika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked on a report card, ``Erika is a bright spot in my classroom.''  The Plascencias' youngest child is 2 year-old Daisy.  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be tragic for their children. Children who were born in the United States and who through no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation that has the potential to dramatically alter their lives.  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencias' older children--Christina, Erika, and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They are old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their teachers, their friends and their home. They would leave everything that is familiar to them. Their parents would find themselves in Mexico without a job and without a house. The children would have to acclimate to a different culture, language and way of life.  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave their children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which no parents should have to make.  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are not my own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with the Plascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the American spirit. I have sponsored this legislation, and asked my colleagues to support it, because I believe that this is a spirit that we must nurture wherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to leave the United States would extinguish that spirit.  I ask unanimous consent that six of more than 50 letters of support my office has received from members of the San Bruno community be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         H Food Int'l, Inc.,                            San Francisco, CA, September 30, 2002.     Re Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and/or Maria Plascencia     Immigration and Naturalization Service,     San Francisco, CA.       I have known Alfredo Plascencia Lopez for at least nine      years. My company sells product to Vince's Shellfish Company      where Alfredo is employed. I deal directly with Alfredo      regarding the quality of seafood that Vince's Shellfish      receives from me.       Working with Alfredo on a daily basis, I have come to know      Alfredo as an honest, reliable, and hard working family man.      Even though we do a tremendous amount of business, I really      consider him a good friend and caring person.       If Alfredo were to be deported, it would be a great loss      not only to the fish business, but also importantly to his      young and growing family. How hard it would be for them to      continue on, or where would they turn?           Sincerely,                                                        Bobby Ngo,     Tuna Purchaser/Salesman.                                  ____                                               St. Bruno's Church,                                   San Bruno, CA, August 30, 2002.       To Whom It May Concern: the purpose of this letter is to      present my observations on Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria      Plascencia's character and work ethic. I first came to know      them in our church when they came to worship on a Sunday.      This happened around January in 1998.       And so for the last 4 years both Alfredo and Maria have      been two of our outstanding parishioners at St. Bruno's      Church. They come to Sunday Mass and worship, and have been      involved in many ministries and services here in our church      at St. Bruno's. Alfredo has been especially a minister of      hospitality, always welcoming people to church and to      participation in the life of the community, helping to      provide a spirit of acceptance and concern among our people      and providing bread and refreshments for some gatherings.      Maria has been especially involved as a teacher, faithfully      giving to our children the fundamentals of our Faith, of the      Gospel and of a Christian moral life. They have four children      all of whom have been baptized at St. Bruno's Church and come      to our School of Religion and our church.       Alfredo and Maria have been most generous with their time,      their talents and their money, sharing all these with the      members of our Church Community. They have also frequently      donated food to the church and to the Pastor. I have found      them to be really good Christian people, most generous,      considerate, kind, honest and reliable. If they would have to      leave the United States, it will be most difficult for them      and for their children who have been growing in a Christian      environment and are doing so well; it would be a tremendous      loss. We too here in our church would find it difficult      without them. For they are a great asset to this country and      to our church and to many people.       We appreciate whatever you can do for them to help them get      their legal papers of residence in the United States.       Thank you very much.           Sincerely yours,                                                  Rev. Rene Gomez,     Pastor of St. Bruno's Church.                                  ____                                            Kaiser Permanente,     Re Maria Del Refugio Plascencia.     Immigration and Naturalization Service,     South San Francisco, CA.                               San Francisco, CA, August 29, 2002.       To Whom It May Concern: I am writing to attest to the      character and work ethic of Maria Del Refugio Plascencia. I      am the Director of Medicine at Kaiser Permanente, South San      Francisco. I have known Maria since she was hired as a      medical assistant into my department in July 2000.       Maria is an excellent employee and role model for her      colleagues. She is extremely dependable; in the two years she      has worked for me she has called in sick only once. She works      in a very demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and      depended on by the physicians she works with. Maria is      flexible, thorough and proactive. She pays attention to      detail and identifies potential problems before they occur.      In addition, her bilingual skills enhance the patient care      experience for our members who speak Spanish.       In her short tenure here, Maria found time to volunteer      with our community outreach programs. She served as a      volunteer interpreter for our recent Neighbors in Health      event, wherein free health care was provided to uninsured      children in our local community.       I can't say enough about Maria and the type of person she      is. I feel fortunate to have her in my department. She is an      asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we      Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family,      trustworthy and loyal employee, involved in her community.      She and her family are a solid example of the type of      immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.       It would be an incredible miscarriage of justice if Maria      and Alfredo are deported. They came to this country to pursue      a better life and afford their children opportunities that      they wouldn't have in Mexico. They have begun to do just that      by establishing roots in the community and purchasing a home.      They have never taken advantage of the ``system'' by      enrolling on welfare or Medi-Cal, preferring to pay their own      way. Deporting Maria and Alfredo would rip their family apart      and result in either depriving their children of a loving      family or depriving them of their rights as American citizens      if they leave the country of their birth with their parents.       I pray that you will allow them the opportunity to live in      this country.           Sincerely,                                                  Rose Carino, RN,     Director, Department of Medicine.                                  ____      The Permanente Medical Group, Inc. South San Francisco,                                             September 4, 2002.     Immigration and Naturalization Service,     San Francisco, CA.       To Whom It May Concern:       The purpose of this letter is to present my observations of      the character and work ethic of Maria Del-Refugio Plascencia      and Alfredo Plascencia Lopez.       I have worked with Ms. Plascencia for two years: I, as an      Oncology Nurse Practitioner, Maria as a Medical Assistant.      Ms. Plascencia works closely with the oncology patients as an      educator, resource person, translator and compassionate      member of our oncology team at South San Francisco Kaiser.      Ms. Plascencia does an excellent job with the oncology      patients. She also is responsible, efficient and a pleasure      to work with on a daily basis. Ms. Plascencia is a vital      member of the oncology staff. On one occasion I mentioned my      concern regarding a 90-year-old cancer patient with limited      vision, without family or friends. Ms. Plascencia immediately      wanted to know if she and her church group could stop by and      read to this woman.       I have met Mr. Plascencia on several occasions. I find him      to be a pleasant, responsible, and a devoted family man who      works hard to provide for his family.       In conclusion, Maria Del Refugio Plascencia and Alfredo      Plascencia Lopez are two people any citizen of the United      States would be happy and proud to have as neighbors,      employees and friends. If I can be of any further assistance      in this matter, please feel free to contact me at 650-742-     2929.

Immigration and Naturalization Service,     San Francisco, CA.     Re Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and.or Maria Plascencia       To Whom It May Concern:       I've worked at my present job at Vince's Shellfish for some      twelve years. Thru the years I have come to know Alfredo as a      gifted, trusted co-worker, and a loyal friend. He truly has      been with me thru thick and thin.       Alfredo's presence at work and at home with his family will      surely be missed. Please understand a man of his character      deserves to stay with us.           Thank you for your attention.                                                   Doug Gutterman,     Co-Worker & Friend.                                  ____                                  Vince's Shellfish Co., Inc.,                                San Bruno, CA, September 30, 2002.     Immigration and Naturalization Service,     San Francisco, CA.     Re Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and/or Maria Plascencia       Alfredo Plascencia Lopez has been employed here at Vince's      Shellfish for the past 11 years. Alfredo started as a part-     time employee 01/91 and I was so impressed with his work      ethic and loyalty that I was quick to hire him full-time      within a year and a half. Alfredo started full-time      employment at Vince's Shellfish 07/92. Throughout the past 11      years I have observed Alfredo as a responsible, dependable      individual. I can count on him in any type of situation that      arises in my day-to-day business. Alfredo always handles      himself in a very professional manner.       Alfredo Plascencia Lopez is in charge of my entire packing      operation, which consists of managing ten employees. This is      an enormous part of my business and Alfredo is accountable      and running this operation with no problem. The employees      under him have the utmost respect for Alfredo. He is a role      model to many. He has learned the fish business throughout      his past 15 years with great enthusiasm.       I know how important Alfredo's family is to him. I have      seen through the past years how he has worked hard and has      always placed his family first. His wife and children are      always first and important in his life. He has provided a      wonderful life for his family; if Alfredo were to be deported      a beautiful happy family would suffer and be broken up.       At this time I would like to close by saying Alfredo is a      valuable individual to his immediate family and second, a      valuable and respected employee here at Vince's Shellfish.           Sincerely,                                           Christopher N. Svedise,     President.                          ____________________
