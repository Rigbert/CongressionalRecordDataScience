 President, I have a letter from California State Senator K. Maurice Johannessen. This letter points out that the Shasta Paper Company is now closing its doors because of rising natural gas prices and the suspension that has resulted on pulp production. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      California State Senate,                                Sacramento, CA, December 15, 2000.     Re: Request for Immediate Intervention     Hon. Gray Davis,     State Capitol,     Sacramento, CA.       Dear Governor Davis: The State of California currently      teeters on the brink of a major energy crisis that threatens      the well-being of citizens, communities, and the economy. The      significant increase in natural gas prices and looming energy      shortages have caused distress among many Californians.      Couple that with the decision by the United States Forest      Service to halt operations in National Forests, including      forest thinning, fire hazard reduction, and ground disturbing      activities, and we have a formula for disaster brewing in our      state.       In my district alone, the Shasta Paper Company (the only      remaining paper pulp mill in the state) had to close its      doors last week because of rising natural gas prices and the      suspension on pulp production. Although they were able to      reopen this week, they have been forced to do so on a limited      basis, with a substantial reduction in their workforce. They      have taken an enormous financial hit and are in danger of      being priced out of their ability to operate in the future.       The Shasta Paper Company employs nearly 450 people with a      payroll of approximately $1 million per week and revenues of      $144 million yearly. The closing of this plant will not only      devastate the area but deprive the entire state of the      benefits from this valuable enterprise. They are currently      considering alternatives to natural gas but will require a      temporary waiver of emission standards to remain viable. In      the meantime, many once productive members of the workforce      are left to wonder about their personal financial situations.       Burney Forest Power is a 31 megawatt biomass fueled co-     generation plant located in Shasta County that is capable of      supplying power to about 25,000 homes. At a time when every      megawatt produced in the state is precious, the USFS decides      to suspend all timber-related activities to the detriment of      biomass power plants throughout California. While industries      are laying off workers due to the cost of natural gas, these      same workers are being asked to pay higher fuel and energy      costs. The financial impacts to individuals, communities,      social service agencies, and industries may cause irreparable      damage statewide.       I understand that the actions of the USFS were the result      of lawsuits filed by the Earth Island Institute and other      environmental groups as an interim settlement. The agreement      was for suspension by the USFS ``not to offer, advertise,      auction or award any timber sales within the Sierra Nevada      Framework planning area'' from December 11, 2000 to March 1,      2001, or 30 days after the Record of Decision is issued for      the Sierra Nevada Framework Final Environmental Impact      Statement.       Earth Island Institute asserts in their suit that the area      not only has suitable habitat for the California Spotted Owl      but also that the Sierra Nevada province may contain      potentially suitable habitat for the Pacific Fisher. The USFS      agreed to expand the area of consideration from suitable      habitat for the California Spotted Owl and suitable or      potentially suitable habitat for Fisher to include the entire      Sierra Nevada planning area!       I do not believe that the USFS took into account the      impacts on biomass power producers and other industries when      they entered into this agreement. It is not difficult to see      the effect that the loss of these power producers can and      will have on northern Californians as we enter into the      coldest months of the year. What impact can we reasonably      project on the cost of doing business in northern California      when many enterprises rely on natural gas to operate? If      biomass producers are hindered or shut down, the demand for      natural gas will increase, causing an even greater strain on      the current situation.       Governor Davis, California already suffers from      skyrocketing gas and energy prices and the state is in a near      emergency situation. You have sought to preserve current      supplies and I am confident that you will be anxious to      prevent further hardship to the citizens of California. We      are already facing the threat of rolling blackouts and      government offices within California have been directed to      implement energy conservation strategies and actions in      response to current and expected shortages.       I do not believe that the USFS acted maliciously when they      entered into the agreement, however, I do feel that the      action was shortsighted. To have not consulted with the      Governor of a state where such actions will cause harm is      irresponsible, unconscionable, and unacceptable.       I am requesting that you intervene with the Department of      Justice to provide a temporary waiver for emission standards      and address the United States Forest Service's action to      cease all timber-related operations in the Sierra Nevada      planning area.       Your immediate consideration is greatly appreciated.           Sincerely,                                           K. Maurice Johannessen,                                      Assistant Republican Leader.
