Chairman, I would like to say that I very much appreciate the help of the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest] and the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Clement] in discussions for much of today. This amendment is about foghorns. As I was back in my district, as most of us were these last 10 days, my district is along the shore of Lake Michigan, the Coast Guard currently has a proposal to end the maintenance and in essence stop foghorns in a number of ports along Lake Michigan. What this amendment does is a very simple amendment, it just requires the Secretary of Transportation take action as necessary to ensure that the foghorns at 10 ports along Lake Michigan are in working order.  We have been talking to the Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle whose ports are impacted. They all, Republicans and Democrats alike, support this bill. I would urge its passage. I am not going to ask for a recorded vote. I want to thank the staff on the committee as well as again the two gentlemen that I mentioned before in supporting this amendment.
