In fact, the House report language states that the Act ``is intended to enhance statutory protections for the area while maintaining the viability of historic ranching and recreational operations in the Steens Mountain area.'' The real tragedy of this situation is that the running camp conducts most of its operations on the mountain on private lands, and is only in the wilderness areas on the mountain for two eight-hour periods the entire year. Most of the environmental organizations in Oregon support the running camp and the unique experience it offers to high school athletes. It would be a shame if these young runners were denied this experience because of the extreme solitude guidelines that a select few are trying to impose on the area, because I believe that these young people know and appreciate the ecological values of the wilderness that they are using.
