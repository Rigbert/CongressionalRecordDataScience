 President, in order to expedite consideration of the continuing resolution, I have now offered the CR language as an amendment to the House message on H.R. 719. Using this bill as a vehicle means that we can get the CR over to the House more quickly with fewer steps in the process.  Members should expect a cloture vote to occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.                          ____________________
