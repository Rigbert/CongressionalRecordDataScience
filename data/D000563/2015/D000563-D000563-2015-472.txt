President, last week Chicago--and America--lost a civil rights leader and an icon. Rev. Willie T. Barrow passed away at the age of 90. Known as the ``Little Warrior,'' Reverend Barrow stood up to anyone who would deny equality.  In 1936, 10 years before the Montgomery bus boycott, 12-year-old Willie Barrow challenged the segregated Texas school system that refused to bus African-American kids to school. In a recent interview, Reverend Barrow described it this way. One day, Barrow had enough and confronted the bus driver and school officials. ``You got plenty room,'' Barrow said she told the bus driver and school officials. ``Why you want me to get off? Because I'm black? We got to change that.''  She was right. And from that moment, she dedicated her life to fightingfor social justice and standing up for the most vulnerable in our society.  In 1945, she came to Chicago and worked as a youth minister and a field organizer with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the height of the civil rights movement, she followed Dr. King to Atlanta, where she organized meetings, rallies and transportation for volunteers who came to participate in the marches and sit-ins. She also helped organize the 1963 march on Washington.  Reverend Barrow didn't just fight for racial equality, she fought for women's rights, labor rights and gay rights too. While she helped Rev. Jesse Jackson start Operation Breadbasket on the South Side of Chicago, she was fighting sexism within the civil rights movement. During meetings, some even asked Reverend Jackson why he brought his secretary.  But as Operation Breadbasket evolved into the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, Reverend Barrow became the first woman to lead the organization. As the chairman of the board and CEO, Reverend Barrow brought women together from the Chicago Network--an organization comprised of Chicago's most distinguished professional women--to talk about their leadership roles and the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards.  Around Chicago, she was known as ``godmother'' for the work she did with many young community activists--including Barack Obama. She took on causes ranging from AIDS awareness to traveling on missions of peace to Vietnam, Russia, Nicaragua, Cuba and South Africa when Nelson Mandela was released from prison.  Last Sunday, 70,000 people gathered in Selma, AL, to remember and celebrate the civil rights leaders who marched 50 years ago. Sadly, Reverend Barrow couldn't be there. But 50 years ago, Reverend Barrow was on the front lines, marching alongside Dr. King and future Congressman John Lewis.  Years ago, I made the trip to Selma and stood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge where Reverend Barrow marched and John Lewis was beaten unconscious and nearly killed by Alabama State troopers. It was profoundly moving to see the places where leaders like these risked their lives to redeem the promises of America for all of us. And it's because of civil rights leaders like Reverend Barrow that our Nation has made progress in the pursuit of social justice. But we know that bridges run both ways. We can move ahead, or we can turn back. Without the courage, the leadership, and the determination of Rev. Willie T. Barrow, the fight to move forward just got a little harder.                          ____________________
