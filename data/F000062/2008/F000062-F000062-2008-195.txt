 President, I rise to introduce the Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act.  Many Americans now own multiple credit cards. The average American has four credit cards, and 1 in 7 Americans hold more than 10 cards.  The proliferation of credit cards can be traced, in part, to a dramatic increase in credit card solicitation. In 1990, credit card companies sent about 1.1 billion solicitations to American homes; in 2006, they sent over 9.2 billion.  As one would expect, the increase in credit card ownership has also yielded an increase in credit card debt. Individuals get 6, 7, or 8 different credit cards, pay only the minimum payment required, and many end up drowning in debt. That happens in case after case.  Over the past two decades, the credit card debt of American consumers has nearly tripled--from $238 billion in 1989 to a staggering $800 billion in 2005.  As a result, the average American household now has about $9,500 of credit card debt. That is almost twice the average level of credit card debt from just 10 years ago.  In light of these figures it should be no surprise that vast numbers of Americans have been filing for bankruptcy in recent years. In 2005--just before the implementation date of the Bankruptcy Reform Act--over 2 million non-business bankruptcies were filed.  Many of these personal bankruptcies are people who utilize credit cards. The benefits and flexibility these cards offer are enormously attractive. However, these individual credit card holders receive no information on the impact of carrying a balance with compounding interest. Too often individuals make just the minimum payment. They pay it for 1 year, 2 years--they make additional purchases, they get another card, and another, and another.  After, 2 or 3 years, many find that the interest on the debt is larger than the total purchases they originally made, such that they can never repay these cards--and they do not know what to do about it.  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act would help prevent this problem. Let me tell you exactly what the bill would do. It would require credit card companies to add two items to each consumer's monthly credit card statement: a notice warning credit card holders that making only the minimum payment each month will increase the interest theypay and the amount of time it takes to repay their debt; and examples of the amount of time and money required to repay a credit card debt if only minimum payments are made.  If the consumer makes only minimum payments for, 6 consecutive months, the amount of time and money required to repay the individual's specific credit card debt, under the terms of their credit card agreement.  The bill would also require that a toll-free number be included on statements, to allow consumers to call and speak to a live person to get an estimate of the time and money required to repay their balance if only minimum payments are made.  If the consumer makes only minimum payments for 6 consecutive months, they will receive a toll-free number for an accredited credit counseling service.  The disclosure requirements in this bill would only apply if the consumer has a minimum payment that is less than 10 percent of the debt on the credit card. Otherwise, none of these disclosures would be required on their statement.  Statistics vary about the number of individuals who make only the minimum payments. One study in 2004 determined that 35 million people pay only the minimum on their credit cards. In a 2005 poll, 40 percent of respondents said that they pay the minimum or slightly more.  What is certain is that many Americans pay only the minimum, and that paying only the minimum has harsh financial consequences.  I suspect that most people would be surprised to know how much interest can pile up when paying the minimum. Take the average household, with $9,500 of credit card debt, and the average credit card interest rate, which last week was 13.74 percent. If only the 2 percent minimum payment is made, it will take them 35 years and $21,799.07 to pay off the card.  That is if the family doesn't spend another cent on their credit cards--an unlikely assumption. In other words, the family will need to pay over $12,000 in interest to repay just $9,500 of principal.  For individuals or families with more than average debt, the pitfalls are even greater. $20,000 of credit card debt at the average 13.74 percent interest rate will take 42 years and more than $46,300 to pay off if only the minimum payments are made.  Mr. President, 13.74 percent is only the average rate. Interest rates around 20 percent are not uncommon. Penalty interest rates on credit cards average 27.3 percent, and seven major credit cards charge penalty rates of more than 30 percent.  Even if we assume only a 20 percent interest rate, a family that has the average debt of $9,500 at a 20 percent interest rate and makes the minimum payments will need an incredible 82 years and $55,084 to pay off that initial $9,500 of debt. That's $45,584 in interest payments--an amount that approaches 5 times the original debt. These examples are far from extreme.  Last March, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs heard testimony from Wesley Wannemacher, a consumer from Lima, OH.  Mr. Wannemacher charged $3,200 to a credit card in 2001 and 2002. He never charged anything on the card again, but he spent the next 6 years struggling to pay it off, as he experienced the kinds of events that American households routinely face--unexpected medical expenses, a growing family, and so on.  By early 2007 Mr. Wannemacher had paid $6,300 on the initial $3,200 in debt, but he still owed $4,400 on the card. Interest charges, late fees, and $1,500 in fees for going over the limit--even though the balance had only exceeded the limit three times--had resulted in total charges of $10,700 for that initial $3,200 in credit.  Fortunately for Mr. Wannemacher, his credit card company reviewed his account--after it became known that he was going to testify to Congress about his experience. The remaining balance on his account was forgiven.  Mr. President, testifying before a Senate committee is not something that Americans could--or should have to--do to escape from crushing credit card debt.  That is one of the reasons why it is so important for this Congress to pass the Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act.  There will always be people who cannot afford to pay more than their minimum payments. But there is also a large number of consumers who can afford to pay more but feel comfortable paying the minimum payment because they don't realize the consequences of doing so.  Now I am certainly not trying to demonize credit cards or the credit card industry. Credit cards are an important part of everyday life, and they help the economy operate more smoothly by giving consumers and merchants a reliable, convenient way to exchange funds.  However, I do think that people should understand the dangers of paying only their monthly minimums. In this way individuals will be able to act responsibly.  The bottom line is that for many consumers, the two percent minimum payment is a financial trap.  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act is designed to ensure that people are not caught in this trap through lack of information. The bill tracks the language of an amendment I cosponsored during the debate on the 2005 bankruptcy bill.  The language of this bill is based on a California law, the California Credit Card Payment Warning Act, passed in 2001. Unfortunately, in 2002, this California law was struck down in U.S. District Court as being preempted by the 1968 Truth in Lending Act.  The Truth in Lending Act was enacted in part because Congress found that, ``The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers.''  This bill would amend the Truth in Lending Act, and would also further its core purpose.  These disclosures will allow consumers to know exactly what it means for them to carry a balance and only make minimum payments, so they can make informed decisions on credit card use and repayment.  The disclosure required by this bill is straightforward--how much it will cost to pay off the debt if only minimum payments are made, and how long it will take to do it. As for expense, my staff tells me that on the Web site Cardweb.com, there is a free interest calculator that does these calculations in under a second. Moreover, I am told that banks make these calculations internally to determine credit risk. The expense of making these disclosures would be minimal.  Percentage rates and balances are constantly changing, and each month, the credit card companies are able to assess the minimum payment, late fees, over-the-limit fees and finance charges for millions of accounts.  If the credit card companies can put in their bills what the minimum monthly payment is, they can certainly figure out how to disclose to their customers how much it might cost them if they stick to that minimum payment.  The credit card industry is the most profitable sector of banking, and in 2006 it made $36.8 billion in profits--an increase of nearly 80 percent from their profits in 2000. I don't think they will have any trouble implementing the requirements of this bill.  I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily important and that it will reduce bankruptcies. In the face of the subprime mortgage crisis, and as we appear to be heading toward a recession, this bill is needed now more than ever.  The harsh effects of the 2005 bankruptcy bill are starting to become apparent. I continue to believe that a bill requiring a limited but meaningful disclosure by credit card companies is a necessary accompaniment. I think you will see consumers acting more cautiously if these disclosures are made, and I believe that will be good for the bankruptcy courts in terms of reducing their caseloads, and also good for American consumers.  The credit card debt problem facing our Nation is significant. I believe that this bill is an important step in providing individuals with the information needed to act responsibly, and it does so with a minimal burden on the industry.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2542       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
