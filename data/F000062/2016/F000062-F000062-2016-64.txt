 President, I just wanted to compliment the Senator from Indiana on the remarks he has just made and thank him very much.  I also want to urge Members: Please bring amendments to the Energy and Water appropriations bill to the floor. We hope to finish this bill. The only way we are going to do it is if Members bring and file their amendments.
