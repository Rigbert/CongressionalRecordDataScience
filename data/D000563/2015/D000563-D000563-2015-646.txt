President, now that we have purged the calendar of five of the six Democratic amendments, the majority leader tells us it is time to vote.  It doesn't strike me that this is in the best interest of what we are trying to achieve. We are going back and forth in a bipartisan, constructive fashion. I would like to ask the majority leader is he prepared to be in session tomorrow and to consider Democratic and Republican amendments and work through the list, including the ones he just tabled?  Mr. McCONNELL. Does the Senator from Illinois intend to object to my consent?
