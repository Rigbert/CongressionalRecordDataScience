Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, the frustration, I think, that the American public has is that they see us saying, yes, we want to get to a balanced budget. The President now says that he is prepared to negotiate to get there in 7 years. I think that is correct. Others differ, but I think that is correct.  The fact of the matter is, though, whatever CR we pass will not impact on it; it will be the reconciliation bill which has not yet passed this body. I understand it is coming back from the Senate today.  It will be on that bill that we will have to have this very substantive, sometimes contentious, but very important debate, because the gentleman is correct, those assumptions, as the chairman in exile of the Committee on the Budget points out, make a great deal of difference.  So I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Sabo]. I appreciate the work he has done. I would hope that we could get this CR behind us and get Government operating and then come to grips with a very important, and I agree with the Speaker, historic debate on how we get the finances of this country under control and in order, priorities with which I know the chairman and I agree, but with which everybody in the body may not agree.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
