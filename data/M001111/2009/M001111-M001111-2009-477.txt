Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 267       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Summer and Year-Round Jobs      for Youth Stimulus Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. SUMMER AND YEAR-ROUND YOUTH JOBS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) a $1,000,000,000 investment in summer and year-round      employment for youth, through the program supported under      this section, can create up to 1,000,000 jobs for      economically disadvantaged youth and stimulate local      economies;       (2) there is a serious and growing need for employment      opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth (including      young adults), as demonstrated by statistics from the Bureau      of Labor Statistics stating that, in December 2008--       (A) the unemployment rate increased to 7.2 percent, as      compared to 4.9 percent in December 2007;       (B) the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds rose to      20.8 percent, as compared to 16.9 percent in December 2007;      and       (C) the unemployment rate for African-American 16- to 19-     year-olds increased to 33.7 percent, as compared to 28      percent in December 2007;       (3) research from Northwestern University has shown that      every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the      local economy;       (4) summer and year-round jobs for youth help supplement      the income of families living in poverty;       (5) summer and year-round jobs for youth provide valuable      work experience for economically disadvantaged youth;       (6) often, a summer job provided under the Workforce      Investment Act of 1998 is an economically disadvantaged      youth's introduction to the world of work;       (7) according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at      Northeastern University, early work experience is a very      powerful predictor of success and earnings in the labor      market, and early work experience raises earnings over a      lifetime by 10 to 20 percent;       (8) participation in a youth jobs program can contribute to      a reduction in criminal and high-risk behavior for youth; and       (9)(A) youth jobs programs benefit both youth and      communities when designed around principles that promote      mutually beneficial programs;       (B) youth benefit from jobs that provide them with work      readiness skills and that help them make the connection      between responsibility on the job and success in adulthood;      and       (C) communities benefit when youth are engaged      productively, providing much-needed services that meet real      community needs.       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``green-collar      industries'' means industries throughout the economy of the      United States--       (1) that promote energy efficiency, energy conservation,      and environmental protection, including promoting renewable      energy and clean technology;       (2) that offer jobs with substantial pay and benefits; and       (3) that are industries in which there is likely to be      continued demand for workers.
