Mr. Chairman, just a very important point, I think bovine spongiform encephalitis, BSE, has never been found in the United States. We have the most strict meat inspection in the world, and if we pass this resolution the danger is that we complicate the inspection of those downed animals. Downed animals in this country do not go into the human food chain without a thorough health safety investigation.
