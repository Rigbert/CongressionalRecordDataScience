It has been a sad commentary that we know in the year 2015, if I am not mistaken, the Medicare system, as we know it--this current system--is going to go bankrupt, be insolvent. Many seniors want additional benefits to help them stay healthy and independent, like the prescription drug program which we support. When we made an effort on the floor, in a vote just last week we could not rally any support from the Republican side of the aisle for the prescription drug program so that seniors can stay independent and healthy. That, I think, is a shame.  I would like to go home this August and say to seniors and those of us soon to be in the program: We have done something positive. You can live a longer, more independent, and healthier life. But we can't even point to that. Instead, the Republicans suggest we can give tax cuts to wealthy people and special tax breaks to certain businesses.
