 President, what the committee said would happen in fact did happen, and it is continuing to happen this very day.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to also have printed in the Record a table from page 254 of Secretary Perry's March 1996 annual report to the Congress.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follos:               TABLE V-4--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PERSONNEL                              [End of fiscal year strength in thousands]               ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Fiscal year--               Percent                               ------------------------          change                                                          Goal   FY 1987-                                 1987    1996    1997              97   ------------------------------------------------------------------------Active Military...............   2,174   1,482   1,457   1,418       -33  Army........................     781     495     495     475       -37  Navy........................     587     424     407     394       -31  Marine Corps................     199     174     174     174       -13  Air Force...................     607     388     381     375       -37Selected Reserves.............   1,151     931     901     893       -19DoD Civilians.................   1,133     841     807     728       -27------------------------------------------------------------------------
