We have been asked to expedite our remarks tonight so we can finish votes later this evening.  The Federal Government is the largest purchaser of light bulbs. This will save $30 per bulb, hundreds of millions of dollars to the taxpayers every year. It is something that has been adopted on every bill, and I would like to think that we can adopt it by voice again this evening.
