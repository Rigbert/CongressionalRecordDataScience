Speaker, Ned Zechman's retirement as President and CEO of Children's National Medical Center reminds us of the debt of gratitude that we owe him and the institution that he has led for more than 16 years.  Children's National is an invaluable resource for the national capital area and an inspiring model for the entire nation.  Throughout Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia, families appreciate that Children's National is the only exclusive providerof pediatric care in the Washington metropolitan area. When children have illnesses or injuries that require specialized diagnosis and treatment, parents throughout the region can count on Children's internationally recognized team of pediatric healthcare professionals.  Families in my congressional district, including Calvert, Charles, St. Mary's, Anne Arundel, and Prince George's Counties know that friendly, smiling bear--the widely recognized symbol of Children's National--is looking out for our kids.  Over the past decade-and-a-half, under Ned Zechman's leadership, Children's National has expanded its services to our region and our Nation. Annual admissions increased by more than 28 percent to more than 13,000. Emergency Department visits increased by 35 percent to more than 83,000. Surgeries increased by an extraordinary 88 percent to more than 14,000. Diagnostic procedures increased by 36 percent to a remarkable total of more than 100,000.  During Ned Zechman's years as CEO, Children's National provided a model for the Nation in one more way. The institution is not only an example of social responsibility--it is an example of fiscal responsibility.  When Mr. Zechman arrived, Children's National, like many healthcare institutions, faced numerous threats to its fiscal solvency and found it difficult to compete in a changing environment. With Ned's leadership, Children's National adopted a new business model, increased fundraising, and stabilized its finances.  Ned Zechman's living legacy is a unique and thriving institution dedicated to providing the highest quality health care services to the Nation's children and their families: Children's National Medical Center. I wish Ned all the best and thank him for many years of service to our region.                          ____________________
