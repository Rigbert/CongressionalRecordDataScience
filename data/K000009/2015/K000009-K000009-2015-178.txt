Speaker, I rise to remember the life and achievements of Frank E. Miller, who passed from this life at the dawn of Spring, not long after the first ships began arriving after winter's break. Frank was instrumental in the development of Toledo, Ohio's seaport.  Frank Miller was born in Marion, Ohio in 1929 to Carl and Alverta Miller. He married his wife Vera in 1951 and together they raised three children, Gary, Brian and Linda. Frank served in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean War. After coming home, he moved to Toledo, Ohio to work as a crane operator.  In 1962 he became an equipment operator and overseas docks supervisor for the Toledo Lucas County Port Authority. With his 1976 appointment as Director of the Seaport Frank moved the port forward to become a major seaport both domestically and internationally. His claim to fame was as ``the man behind the seaport's `Big Lucas' gantry crane. He designed and operated the large cargo handling crane for many years and taught many others to do the same.'' Frank was a pathbreaking, early leader for development of Toledo's Port, its cranes and storage capacity, now the busiest on the lower Great Lakes. He mounted the equipment and literally, made the Port hum with activity. He was an enthusiastic, persevering advocate for the Port and its global potential.  Frank was a leader in the Association of Great Lakes Ports and served as a director of the American Association of Port Authorities. He also was a self published author and good humored observer of everyday life.  After leaving his imprimatur on the Toledo Lucas County Port Authority, Frank started his own business, Toledo World Industries located in Toledo's East Side. He was also owner and publisher of Business Venture Magazine until his retirement in the 1990s.  A community leader, Frank Miller also found time to enjoy ``golf, Ohio State University football, Detroit Red Wings hockey and spending time on the docks at the Port Authority.'' Most important was his family and he was a supportive grandpa to his five grandchildren.  To Vera, their children, grandchildren and great-grandchild, we offer our prayers that they find comfort in their memories of a wonderful, devoted man who understood what it takes to create a close family and an enterprising community.                          ____________________
