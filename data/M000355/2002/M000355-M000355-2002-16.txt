 President, as the Senate debates the resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, yet another Palestinian suicide bomber killed himself and an innocent bystander in Israel. Twenty-nine others were reportedly injured in that attack.  Those who believe that Saddam Hussein's murderous regime poses no immediate threat to America or our allies would be wise to consider the evidence seized by Israeli forces in their own war against terrorism. According to recent press reports, Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan personally directed the transfer of funds to the families of suicide bombers in amounts ranging from $10,000 to $25,000. The delusional butchers in Baghdad may view this money as a sort of ``martyr fund'', in reality it is no more than a ``murder fund.''  Palestinian and Iraqi extremists are cut from the same cloth as the al-Qaida terrorists who attacked our shores. As a threat to human life and decency, there is only one way to deal with these fanatics and that is to destroy them.  The innocent victims of this latest suicide bombing are in my thoughts and prayers. I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring all those killed by terrorists in the United States and abroad, particularly in Israel.                          ____________________
