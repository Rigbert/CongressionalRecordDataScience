It needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal law.''  My bill slams the door shut on would-be violators by exposing the deals to our competition enforcement agencies.  Under current law, manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so that consumers can enjoy lower generic drug prices.  Current law grants these generic companies a temporary protection from competition to the first manufacturer that gets permission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name drug expires.  This approach then gives the generic company a 180-day headstart on other generic companies.  That was a good idea--the unfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be made that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-day grace period--to block other generic drugs from entering the market--while, at the same time, getting paid by the brand-name manufacturer to not sell the generic drug.
