 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to use this opportunity, if I might, to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula], the chairman of the subcommittee. I want to thank the gentleman for his support over the years for the Marsh-Billings National Historic Park in Woodstock, VT. This park, scheduled to open in 1998, is very important to Vermont and to others interested in sustainable agriculture.
