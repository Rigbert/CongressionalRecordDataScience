 Without turning this into a bouquet-tossing contest, let me thank my friend from Florida. Of course, many of the worst violators are people I call kingpin spammers who are located in his home State. The Senator from Florida brought it to the attention of Senator Burns and I that to have an effective enforcement strategy, we had to have in place tools that would deal with the kind of shady operators who are present in his home State.  The Senator from Florida has hammered on that message. I think by the time we are done this afternoon and have Senator Leahy on the floor as well, Senator Nelson's contribution will be especially helpful, not just in Florida but in terms of dealing with these kingpin spammers, the people who send out millions of e-mail now without consequences.  I thank my colleague for yielding, and I thank him for keeping this issue on the radar.
