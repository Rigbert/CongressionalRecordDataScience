Madam Speaker, it is a shame and a disgrace that the Dalai Lama will not be permitted to attend a peace conference in South Africa this week.  How could a nation, once a symbol of the power of reconciliation, be so wrong today? How could the home of Albert Lituli and Nelson Mandela and other men and women of courage deny their brotherhood with one simple man of peace?  Madam Speaker, I am afraid that this says something very troubling about the leadership of South Africa. It says that they are willing to sacrifice the cause of justice on the cross of trade and monetary gain with China.  Today, I stand with former President F.W. de Klerk, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and others around the world who condemn this unnecessary act.                          ____________________
