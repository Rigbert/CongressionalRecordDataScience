President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, May 5. I further ask that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted and that the Senate then begin a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m., with Senators permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes each with the following exceptions: Senator Hatch, 30 minutes; Senator Dorgan, 15 minutes; Senator Conrad, 15 minutes; and Senator Craig for 10 minutes.
