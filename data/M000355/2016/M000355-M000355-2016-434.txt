 President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, at 11 a.m., Wednesday, July 13, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the conference report to accompany S. 524. I further ask that following the cloture vote, the Chair lay before the Senate the message to accompany H.R. 636, the FAA bill; that the majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendments; and that the time until 1:45 p.m. be equally divided between the leaders or their designees. I ask that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendments to the Senate amendments with no intervening action or debate and that all time allocated for consideration of H.R. 636 count postcloture on S. 524, if cloture is invoked.
