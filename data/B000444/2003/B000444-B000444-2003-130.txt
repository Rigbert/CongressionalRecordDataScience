 President, I, too, thank the Senator from Connecticut for his kind comments. As they say, he uses overly formal language. He is a valued member of their committee. He is more than that. He is more than that. He is one of the engines of the committee. I thank him for his comments. I respect and reflect his comments relative to the chairman.  This is an important bill. As my grandfather used to say: With the grace of God, the good will of the neighbors, and the creek not rising, we may get this finished.  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.
