 President, I will be very brief. I thank Senator Durbin and Senator Kennedy for their support. This amendment has been modified. The H-1B program would increase from $1,500 to $5,000, a $3,500 increase. The new revenue, as I mentioned earlier, would be used to establish a scholarship program so we can begin to see young Americans get the education they need for these professions so that we do not have to go abroad to bring people in to do the jobs that American workers should be doing.  I would appreciate support for this amendment.
