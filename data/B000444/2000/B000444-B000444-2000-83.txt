  As the Senator well knows, the hotline that she and Senator Kennedy, Senator Specter, and others have worked so hard to put in place, that hotline has received literally hundreds of thousands of calls--300,000 all told--tens of thousands of calls over the years since we passed this, saying: Help me, help me. I am trapped.  I say to men who say: Gee, whiz, why don't women just walk away; Why don't they just walk away from this abuse they get; There are a lot of reasons they don't, from being physically intimidated, to being psychologically intimidated, to having no place to go and no financial resources.
