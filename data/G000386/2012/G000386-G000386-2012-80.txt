 President, I didn't come to the floor to speak about the wind energy tax credit, but I wish to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I agree with them, and they probably know I agree with them because I am the author of the wind energy tax credit of 1992. I often tell people that when we worked so hard on that, I did not have the slightest idea it would turn out to be such abig thing; that Iowa would be second in wind energy production in the Nation. I think Texas is No. 1. For sure, I did not know we would have manufacturing in our State as a result of it. We have had companies come from Spain, from Germany and then we have had from Colorado and Arizona component manufacturers that have come to Iowa. There are about 4,000 people, maybe 5,000 people, employed in my State in that, so I hope we can get it reauthorized.
