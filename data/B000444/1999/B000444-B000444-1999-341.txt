 President, I am truly appreciative of the comments myfriends have made--my old-new friends, my old-old friends, and my close buddies from across the State line.  I began to wonder about casting my 10,000th vote on the occasion of the majority leader indicating there would be no more votes for 4 days and the last planes heading west were leaving. I thank my colleagues who put in the Record their comments. I will withhold specific comment until I read them, because God only knows what they said. But let me say that I find it no particular feat to have cast 10,000 votes. If you are around here long enough and still standing, that happens.  I hope I have cast some votes that have made this country a little bit better. I am confident there is none that I have cast that have enhanced the standing of America, or the condition of the American people, that weren't bipartisan. I can't think of any that were done that weren't done in a bipartisan manner in the end.  I look at Orrin Hatch. Orrin Hatch came here, and is still one of the leading conservative lights on the American political scene, and yet we have worked together for years and years and years. I cannot think that we have ever had a cross word to one another in 25 years. We have had very different views.  Paul Sarbanes, who is literally one of the brightest people I have served with--just raw, pure, gray matter, raw horsepower--to have him say the things that he said about me in reference to our personal friendship is meaningful, particularly since my wife, who works as a professor in Delaware and seldom is in Washington, is sitting in the galleries listening to this, and my No. 2 son, who is now living in Washington, heard it as well.  I am sure they know better. But my mother probably believes everything Paul said, because I met Paul's mother as well.  I think, if I can make one, in a sense, political observation, the first vote I cast in January of 1972 was a vote I was told--I didn't remember this--on an Assistant Secretary, I believe, the No. 2 person at State. I am not positive of that.  I remember the day, although I was obviously very junior, when I was sworn in by the Secretary of the Senate, Mr. Valeo, who actually came to me in Wilmington to swear me in, because of unusual circumstances. After he gave me the little certificate that we get when we are sworn in, he said, ``You have arrived to the Senate, to the best of my knowledge, the least senior than any man in history,'' because seniority is based on the previous offices that you have held. It keeps narrowing down to State, size, population, and age ultimately.  But when I got here, there were a number of giants in the Senate. We often hear it said today that there are no giants left in the Senate. In truth there are. There are women and men who serve in this body today who are equal to and in some ways surpass the capacity of some of the great people I have had the honor of serving with over the past almost 27 years.  So the caliber has not changed. What has changed a little bit--and I am referencing this tonight, because of my colleagues who are here on the floor--what has changed since then is the impression that we don't like each other very much, that we don't get along with one another very well, that we are nakedly partisan in all of our undertakings.  I wish the public could see that there is still a degree of camaraderie here, a degree of mutual respect that crosses that sometimes ``chasm'' called the ``center aisle,'' what makes this body more unique than any other legislative body at least in modern history. I will not challenge Senator Byrd about whether it equals or surpasses the Roman Senate, but I am confident that it does surpass any other legislative body in modern history.  I would just conclude by saying the lubricant that allows that to happen is genuine and personal respect that most of us have for one another. I think it is the defining feature of this institution.  I remember now meeting Senator Enzi back in 1972--or 1973, I guess it was--when I received that award. But I have not gotten--because we don't serve on committees together--to know him personally as well as I know my two colleagues who remain. Notwithstanding the wonderful words they have both uttered relating to me, the genuine testimony I take from what they have done is that they are here. It is 9 o'clock at night. There are no votes. The Senator from Maryland has a long drive home, because, he, like me, commutes every day to Baltimore, MD. And he drives. My friend from Utah probably missed a plane to go back to Utah this weekend.  I truly, truly appreciate it.  Let me yield the floor by saying, Mr. President, that I am asked sometimes what is the best, the most significant perk that exists being a Senator. I always answer that there are two things.  Before I became a Senator, as a young man campaigning in the midst of the Vietnam war, and the civil rights crisis, and the assassination of men who I had an incredible regard for in 1968--both Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy--I came here thinking that all that had to happen was that we elected women and men who had a greater degree of intellectual capacity, had a better education and were smarter. I got here and I was truly dumbfounded--truly dumbfounded--by how many people who serve in this body who are so incredibly bright, who are so significantly schooled in the areas in which they speak. I arrived and I found out that Jack Javits could tell you as much about modern art as he could about foreign policy. There was Mike Mansfield, who could tell you as much about Chinese history as he could about the politics in Montana.  Paul Sarbanes can tell you as much about the international monetary system, about the history of the Balkans, about the banking system, as he can tell you about his hometown baseball team and the local politics of Baltimore.  Orrin Hatch is a man who used to be a card-carrying union guy from Pittsburgh, who goes out as a boxer, goes out to his now home State of Utah, and gets elected after having a career as an incredible trial lawyer.  I mean it is amazing--the diversity here.  I will not mention the judge's name. But I was having lunch with a Justice once in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The issue was about pay raises for judges. This particular Justice said publicly--this Justice accidentally said it. He didn't intend to be quoted--that he could understand why the public wouldn't want Congresspersons and Senators to get a raise but judges were different, they were academically qualified. I know the Senator from Utah knows who I am talking about.  To this particular, very competent Justice--I was in his office--I said, ``May I close your door, Mr. Justice?'' I said, ``Mr. Justice, I have sat in the Judiciary Committee for years. I have had the opportunity as either ranking member or chairman for, I think, a 14-year period to look at the background of every single person who has come on the bench.'' At that time it was 10 or 12 years. I said, ``I am willing to make you a bet. I will take the intellectual potential of the Senate''--in the House I didn't know as well--``and match it against the entire judiciary.'' They are bright, they are competent. If I am not mistaken in time, we had, like Senator Sarbanes, seven Rhodes scholars in the Senate. We had a half a dozen Marshall scholars--not me. I don't qualify on that account. We have men and women in here whose academic distinction exceeds that of 99 percent of the people--all the jobs anywhere in America, corporate, labor, business, academia.  The greatest perk I have had as a Senator was access to people with serious, serious minds and a serious sense of purpose, and who cared about something. If I dropped dead tomorrow, I would be thankful to the people of Delaware, for the individuals they have allowed me to be exposed to, to argue with, to fight with, to debate with, to agree with Members. I will be thankful to them for the gift they gave me in having that access. I don't believe there is any other place in the Nation I could have gotten that kind of exposure.  The second thing I found that has been the greatest gift in those 10,000 votes during that period is that this is the ultimate graduate education. If you take this job serious, as all my colleagues do on this floor, you learn one thing: You don't get a driver, you don't get a house, you don't get a bodyguard,nor should we, but what you do get is the ability to pick up the phone and call anybody in the world and they will take your call. You can call Nobel laureates, you can call experts in any field, and if you want to learn, this is the ultimate seminar if you take it seriously. There is no other place I can think of that a person can do that.  Mr. President, I have a lot more to learn. And of those 10,000 votes, I am sure there are many that were not as enlightened as I thought they were at the time I cast them. Hopefully, I have learned. Hopefully, I will get a chance to learn more than I know now. If you want to do it, and if you take it seriously and if you reach out across that chasm, you reach out across that aisle, believe it or not, there is somebody on the other side willing to talk to you, willing to exchange ideas with you. If you work hard enough, you actually may do a little bit--just a little bit--to change the state of affairs in this great country. That is all we can do here.  I have no illusions about the significance of the Senate in terms of determining national policy, but within the context and the role the Senate plays, we get to play little parts. The only time it works is when we cross that chasm. That is the only time it works.  I thank my colleagues. They are honorable men. They are men of achievement. I think the public gets a pretty good buy for their investment in the men that are sitting here on the floor today and the women and men who cast all the votes today; they are competent.  It has been a pleasure working with them. I hope I get to cast a few more votes. I hope I get to convince Orrin Hatch and Senator Enzi to cast more votes my way. The truth of the matter is, as I said, nothing gets done unless you reach across that aisle. I appreciate the fact there has always been somebody on this side to talk to me.  I thank all my colleagues. For those who made other statements, I will respond in the Record and not take the time of my colleagues. The Baltimore-Washington tunnel is probably clear by now. We can both head north.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
