Speaker, today this House will vote on the Republicans' wildly irresponsible tax bill which fails to stimulate our economy or create jobs, explodes the budget deficit and the national debt, and robs Social Security and other key priorities of crucial funding. Our Republican friends continue to make wild claims about this tax bill, but the American people need to ask one very simple question: Do I trust Tom DeLay and the Republican majority who said that we would balance the budget, create jobs, and get the economy moving 2 years ago? Or do we trust an individual like Mr. Buffett, the largest investor, perhaps, in America, who recently said that cutting taxes on corporate dividends, an idea incorporated in the GOP bill, unfairly favors the wealthy and doubted that it would stimulate the economy? That is Warren Buffett. That is not one of us. Democrats strongly agree with him, however.  We offered a plan that is fast-acting, fair and fiscally responsible, a plan that would create five times, over a million jobs, as this GOP bill does.  Reject this failed policy.                          ____________________
