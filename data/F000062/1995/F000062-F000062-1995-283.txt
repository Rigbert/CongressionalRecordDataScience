 President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Nevada to keep the current speed limit in place as it relates to trucks.  According to the California Highway Patrol, the State of California has seen a steady reduction in the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities relating to accidents involving trucks since 1989.  In 1989, 647 people lost their lives and 17,703 people were injured in California as a result of 12,159 truck-related accidents.  By 1994, 451 people were killed and 13,512 injured in California as a result of 9,225 truck-related accidents.  While these figures are nowhere near where we want to be, they do demonstrate that a commitment to truck safety: increased oversight on driver training and hours of operation; regulations on the size and weight of the vehicles; and federally mandatory speed limits. All have significant impacts on the increased safety on America's highways.  In one day this last April, the CHP pulled over 64 big rigs and issued almost 200 violations for everything from bad brakes to violating air pollution rules. That day, police ordered 34 vehicles off the road as a part of a crackdown on the most heavily used truck routes in Los Angeles County.  Now is not the time to begin to turn away from our commitment to make America's roadways safe and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada.
