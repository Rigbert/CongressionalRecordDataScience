Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding me the additional time.  Our bill helps address the many challenges facing our Great Lakes, the largest collection of fresh water on the planet. Our bill prepares our country to mitigate and adapt to climate change, with challenges like the desertization of the West, as well as coastal resiliency on the Atlantic, Pacific, Gulf, and Great Lakes coasts.  Our bill is more necessary than ever to build and gird America going forward in the great spirit of the quote above the Speaker's rostrum here in the House by Daniel Webster, uttered in 1825: ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.''  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Do what is right for America. Vote for this bill.
