Defense is a large expenditure. Then comes interest rates. Right after that, the fourth largest category of spending in this Government is to pay the interest on the savings and loan bailout which totals over $1 trillion. Our children's children will be paying for that.  So when we get in these debt financing arrangements, what we are talking about is obligating the people of our country so far down the road you can hardly even see the end of it.  But in this situation with Mexico, we are not talking about money we own to ourselves. We are talking about money that is owed to investors and creditors to foreign nations. This is a very different animal than that exchange stabilization fund was meant to be used for in the past.  I think what we are seeing is a different form of foreign aid, which does not have to be voted on here in the Congress, and that is not how a democracy should function or a democratic republic should function. We should have the debate here. We as a people must make a decision about what our relationship is to various countries around the world.
