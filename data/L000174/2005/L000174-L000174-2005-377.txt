President, I would like to take this opportunity to publicly congratulate J.J. Hamilton on his retirement as Director of Aviation at the Burlington International Airport.  J.J. and I have been friends since our days together at St. Michael's College, and it has been a great pleasure working with him over the years on aviation, expansion, and economic development issues at the airport in Burlington.  J.J. has been with the airport for 21 years, serving for the past 15 as its top manager. Under his direction, the Burlington airport has been transformed from a sleepy, one-gate operation into an award-winning, 10-gate facility that is a wonderful gateway to our great State of Vermont. The airport has grown to become an important engine in our State's economy.  Perhaps the best words to describe J.J.'s leadership in Burlington are ``measured and responsible.'' As head of Vermont's largest airport, and one that is municipally owned, he has had to delicately balance the urge for large-scale expansion with his financial responsibility to the citizens of Burlington. When opportunities have arisen to attract new air service, J.J. has been careful to make sure that it is sustainable and that the airport grows appropriately to meet the new demand. And when the airport has sought to expand its business offerings, he has worked cooperatively with the neighbors, the National Guard, and the businesses that are based at the airport or that rely on the airport to outline the significance of the development.  I am proud to have worked with J.J. and others to bring the innovative, low-cost air service to Burlington that has fueled record passenger growth at the airport. From JetBlue and Independence Air to the parking expansions to the new gates, J.J. has diligently moved forward not just to compete with the Albanys and Manchesters of the world for passengers, but to make Burlington a destination unto itself.  I ask unanimous consent that a May 11, 2005, Burlington Free Press editorial on J.J.'s accomplishments in Burlington be included at this point in the Record.  There being no objection,the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [The Burlington Free Press, May 11, 2005]                          Building An Airport       J.J. Hamilton has a solid 21-year record at the Burlington      International Airport, 16 of them as director, transforming a      one-gate operation into today's 10-gate facility that      generates $12 million in revenues.       The growth at the airport has occurred gradually over the      years, at a pace that has met Vermont's needs and changing      lifestyles. Along the way, Hamilton has been there to make a      public pitch for significant improvements such as expanding      the parking garage.       Hamilton has presided over one of the most welcoming and      attractive small airports U.S. travelers will ever find.      Where else do you find comfortable rocking chairs set up in      front of picture windows that look out onto runways and      spectacular mountain views? Long lines are rare, and visitors      are treated to a taste of Vermont with displays of local art,      scenic murals and a well-stocked souvenir shop.       In 1997, the airport's garage was built and main terminal      expanded for $19.9 million; a $25 million expansion was      launched five years later. The improvements have encouraged      additional airlines to use the facility, securing Burlington      International's 2002 distinction as the second-fastest-     growing airport in the nation.       Decisions by airlines such as People Express in the 1980s      and JetBlue and Independence Air in recent years have added      to Burlington International Airport's luster.       For many years, Vermonters drove to Manchester, N.H.,      Albany, N.Y., or Boston for cheaper flights out of New      England. Today, with several low-cost carriers operating out      of Burlington, the expanded 1,651-space garage is often      crowded with travelers choosing their home airport.       This is especially important for a relatively small state      like Vermont, where a healthy business climate requires easy,      affordable air service--not to mention the revenues linked      directly and indirectly to air travel.       Hamilton's decision to step down as director leaves a void      at the airport that might be tough to fill for several      reasons.       First, his careful stewardship has established a high bar.      The airport set a record for the most significant growth      period in the airport's history during Hamilton's tenure,      with nearly 635,000 people boarding flights last year.       Second, Hamilton's annual salary of $85,885 isn't highly      competitive with many similar positions elsewhere in the      United States, making it that much harder to recruit the best      and brightest to fill his shoes. The director of the Albany      International Airport in New York, for example, earns      $106,000 annually.       That is not an unusual problem in Vermont, where salaries      tend to lag behind those of more urban areas. More often than      not, people accept the lower salary in exchange for a higher      quality of life. In some cases, out-of-state applicants      argue--successfully--for more money.       The city ought to be somewhat flexible with the incoming      director's salary, but cautiously so. A high wage doesn't      guarantee competence.       Hamilton, 64, has agreed to stay on until his job is      filled, and possibly longer. But Vermonters wish him well as      he moves on.
