Mr. Speaker, what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul? Mr. Speaker, what does it profit one political party to rule this government with an iron fist and destroy the foundation our Founding Fathers built? This is the central question we are asking the Senate Republican conference today.  It is unreal. It is unbelievable that Senators sworn to uphold the Constitution would end filibusters on judicial nominations. This is not only a grab by one party to dominate every branch of American Government. It is a choke hold on the voices of millions of American voters. Where is our honor? Where is our honesty? Where is our respect for the American people who place their trust in all of us, not one political party?  Mr. Speaker, I thought the principles of American democracy stood for something. I hope the Senate Republican leadership will not fall for this miscarriage of justice.                          ____________________
