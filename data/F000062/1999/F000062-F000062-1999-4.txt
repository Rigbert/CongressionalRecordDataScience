 President, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the San Diego Regional Printing Facility of the John H. Harland Company.  The John H. Harland Company was founded in 1923, and is the second largest check printer in the United States.  The John H. Harland Company opened its doors in California in 1969. Today, the San Diego Regional Printing Facility employs 249 employees and fills 98,900 orders per week. The jobs this facility has brought to our state throughout the years have been of great benefit to California.  I offer my congratulations to the John H. Harland Company and its employees on the occasion of its 30th Anniversary and wish it great, continued success in the future.                          ____________________
