SEC. 3. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On July 22, 2004, the House of Representatives and the      Senate declared that the atrocities occurring in the Darfur      region of Sudan are genocide.       (2) On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L.      Powell stated before the Committee on Foreign Relations of      the Senate, ``genocide has been committed in Darfur,'' and      ``the Government of Sudan and the [Janjaweed] bear      responsibility--and genocide may still be occurring''.       (3) On September 21, 2004, in an address before the United      Nations General Assembly, President George W. Bush affirmed      the Secretary of State's finding and stated,``[a]t this hour,      the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible      crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government      has concluded are genocide''.       (4) On July 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council      passed Security Council Resolution 1556, calling upon the      Government of Sudan to disarm the Janjaweed militias and to      apprehend and bring to justice Janjaweed leaders and their      associates who have incited and carried out violations of      human rights and international humanitarian law, and      establishing a ban on the sale or supply of arms and related      materiel of all types, including the provision of related      technical training or assistance, to all nongovernmental      entities and individuals, including the Janjaweed.       (5) On September 18, 2004, the United Nations Security      Council passed Security Council Resolution 1564, determining      that the Government of Sudan had failed to meet its      obligations under Security Council Resolution 1556, calling      for a military flight ban in and over the Darfur region,      demanding the names of Janjaweed militiamen disarmed and      arrested for verification, establishing an International      Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to investigate violations of      international humanitarian and human rights laws, and      threatening sanctions should the Government of Sudan fail to      fully comply with Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1564,      including such actions as to affect Sudan's petroleum sector      or individual members of the Government of Sudan.       (6) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry      on Darfur, submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General      on January 25, 2005, established that the ``Government of the      Sudan and the Janjaweed are responsible for serious      violations of international human rights and humanitarian law      amounting to crimes under international law,'' that ``these      acts were conducted on a widespread and systematic basis, and      therefore may amount to crimes against humanity,'' and that      Sudanese officials and other individuals may have acted with      ``genocidal intent''.       (7) The Report of the International Commission of Inquiry      on Darfur further notes that, pursuant to its mandate and in      the course of its work, the Commission had collected      information relating to individual perpetrators of acts      constituting ``violations of international human rights law      and international humanitarian law, including crimes against      humanity and war crimes'' and that a sealed file containing      the names of those individual perpetrators had been delivered      to the United Nations Secretary-General.       (8) On March 24, 2005, the United Nations Security Council      passed Security Council Resolution 1590, establishing the      United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), consisting of up to      10,000 military personnel and 715 civilian police tasked with      supporting implementation of the Comprehensive Peace      Agreement for Sudan and ``closely and continuously liais[ing]      and coordinat[ing] at all levels with the African Union      Mission in Sudan (AMIS) with a view towards expeditiously      reinforcing the effort to foster peace in Darfur''.       (9) On March 29, 2005, the United Nations Security Council      passed Security Council Resolution 1591, extending the      military embargo established by Security Council Resolution      1556 to all the parties to the N'djamena Ceasefire Agreement      of April 8, 2004, and any other belligerents in the states of      North Darfur, South Darfur, and West Darfur, calling for an      asset freeze and travel ban against those individuals who      impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability in      Darfur and the region, commit violations of international      humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities, are      responsible for offensive military overflights, or violate      the military embargo, and establishing a Committee of the      Security Council and a Panel of Experts to assist in      monitoring compliance with Security Council Resolutions 1556      and 1591.       (10) On March 31, 2005, the United Nations Security Council      passed Security Council Resolution 1593, referring the      situation in Darfur since July 1, 2002, to the prosecutor of      the International Criminal Court and calling on the      Government of Sudan and all parties to the conflict to      cooperate fully with the Court.       (11) In remarks before the G-8 Summit on June 30, 2005,      President Bush reconfirmed that ``the violence in Darfur is      clearly genocide'' and ``the human cost is beyond      calculation''.       (12) On July 30, 2005, Dr. John Garang de Mabior, the newly      appointed Vice President of Sudan and the leader of the Sudan      People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) for the past 21      years, was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in southern      Sudan, sparking riots in Khartoum and challenging the      commitment of all Sudanese to the Comprehensive Peace      Agreement for Sudan.       (13) Since 1993, the Secretary of State has determined that      the Republic of Sudan is a country which has repeatedly      provided support for acts of international terrorism and,      pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of      1979, section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, and section      620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, designated Sudan      as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, thereby restricting United      States assistance, defense exports and sales, and financial      and other transactions with the Government of Sudan.     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is      characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed      against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual      violence committed by the Janjaweed and associated militias      with the complicity and support of the National Congress      Party-led faction of the Government of Sudan;       (2) the Secretary of State should designate the Janjaweed      militia as a foreign terrorist organization pursuant to      section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act;       (3) all parties to the conflict in the Darfur region have      continued to violate the N'djamena     Ceasefire Agreement of April 8, 2004, and the Abuja Protocols      of November 9, 2004, and violence against civilians,      humanitarian aid workers, and personnel of the African Union      Mission in Sudan (AMIS) is increasing;       (4) the African Union should rapidly expand the size and      amend the mandate of the African Union Mission in Sudan to      authorize such action as may be necessary to protect      civilians and humanitarian operations, and deter violence in      the Darfur region without delay;       (5) the international community, including the United      Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the      European Union, and the United States, should immediately act      to mobilize sufficient political, military, and financial      resources to support the expansion of the African Union      Mission in Sudan so that it achieves the size, strength, and      capacity necessary for protecting civilians and humanitarian      operations, and ending the continued violence in the Darfur      region;       (6) if an expanded and reinforced African Union Mission in      Sudan fails to stop genocide in the Darfur region, the      international community should take additional, dispositive      measures to prevent and suppress acts of genocide in the      Darfur region;       (7) acting under Article 5 of the Charter of the United      Nations, the United Nations Security Council should call for      suspension of the Government of Sudan's rights and privileges      of membership by the General Assembly until such time as the      Government of Sudan has honored pledges to cease attacks upon      civilians, demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and      associated militias, and grant free and unfettered access for      deliveries of humanitarian assistance in the Darfur region;       (8) the President should use all necessary and appropriate      diplomatic means to ensure the full discharge of the      responsibilities of the Committee of the United Nations      Security Council and the Panel of Experts established      pursuant to section 3(a) of Security Council Resolution 1591      (March 29, 2005);       (9) the United States should not provide assistance to the      Government of Sudan, other than assistance necessary for the      implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement for      Sudan, the support of the regional Government of Southern      Sudan and marginalized areas in northern Sudan (including the      Nuba Mountains, Southern Blue Nile, Abyei, Eastern Sudan      (Beja), Darfur, and Nubia), as well as marginalized peoples      in and around Khartoum, or for humanitarian purposes in      Sudan, until such time as the Government of Sudan has honored      pledges to cease attacks upon civilians, demobilize and      demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated militias, grant      free and unfettered access for deliveries of humanitarian      assistance in the Darfur region, and allow for the safe and      voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced      persons;       (10) the President should seek to assist members of the      Sudanese diaspora in the United States by establishing a      student loan forgiveness program for those individuals who      commit to return to southern Sudan for a period of not less      than five years for the purpose of contributing professional      skills needed for the reconstruction of southern Sudan;       (11) the President should appoint a Presidential Envoy for      Sudan with appropriate resources and a clear mandate to      provide stewardship of efforts to implement the Comprehensive      Peace Agreement for Sudan, seek ways to bring stability and      peace to the Darfur region, address instability elsewhere in      Sudan and northern Uganda, and pursue a truly comprehensive      peace throughout the region;       (12) to achieve the goals specified in paragraph (10) and      to further promote human rights and civil liberties, build      democracy, and strengthen civil society, the Presidential      Envoy for Sudan should be empowered to promote and encourage      the exchange of individuals pursuant to educational and      cultural programs, including programs funded by the      Government of the United States;       (13) the international community should strongly condemn      attacks against humanitarian workers and demand that all      armed groups in the Darfur region, including the forces of      the Government of Sudan, the Janjaweed, associated militias,      the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A), the Justice and      Equality Movement (JEM), and all other armed groups refrain      from such attacks;       (14) the United States should fully support the      Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan and urge rapid      implementation of its terms; and       (15) the new leadership of the Sudan People's Liberation      Movement (SPLM) should--       (A) seek to transform the SPLM into an inclusive,      transparent, and democratic body;       (B) reaffirm the commitment of the SPLM to bringing peace      not only to southern Sudan, but also to the Darfur region,      eastern Sudan, and northern Uganda; and       (C) remain united in the face of efforts to undermine the      SPLM.

The President shall direct the United States Permanent      Representative to the United Nations to use the voice and      vote of the United States to urge the adoption of a      resolution by the United Nations Security Council that--       (1) supports the expansion of the African Union Mission in      Sudan (AMIS) so that it achieves the mandate, size, strength,      and capacity needed to protect civilians and humanitarian      operations, and dissuade and deter fighting and violence in      the Darfur region of Sudan, and urges Member States of the      United Nations to accelerate political, material, financial,      and other assistance to the African Union toward this end;       (2) reinforces efforts of the African Union to negotiate      peace talks between the Government of Sudan, the Sudan      Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A), the Justice and Equality      Movement (JEM), and associated armed groups in the Darfur      region, calls on the Government of Sudan, the SLM/A, and the      JEM to abide by their obligations under the N'Djamena      Ceasefire Agreement of April 8, 2004 and subsequent      agreements, urges all parties to engage in peace talks      without preconditions and seek to resolve the conflict, and      strongly condemns all attacks against humanitarian workers      and African Union personnel in the Darfur region;       (3) imposes sanctions against the Government of Sudan,      including sanctions against individual members of the      Government of Sudan, and entities controlled or owned by      officials of the Government of Sudan or the National Congress      Party in Sudan until such time as the Government of Sudan has      honored its commitments to cease attacks on civilians,      demobilize and demilitarize the Janjaweed and associated      militias, grant free and unfettered access for deliveries of      humanitarian assistance, and allow for the safe and voluntary      return of refugees and internally displaced persons;       (4) extends the military embargo established by United      Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 (July 30, 2004) and      1591 (March 29, 2005) to include a total prohibition on the      sale or supply of offensive military equipment to the      Government of Sudan, except for use in an internationally-     recognized demobilization program or for non-lethal      assistance necessary to carry out elements of the      Comprehensive Peace Agreement for Sudan; and       (5) calls upon those Member States of the United Nations      that continue to undermine efforts to foster peace in Sudan      by providing military assistance and equipment to the      Government of Sudan, the SLM/A, the JEM, and associated armed      groups in the Darfur region in violation of the embargo on      such assistance and equipment, as called for in United      Nations Security Council Resolutions 1556 and 1591, to      immediately cease and desist.
