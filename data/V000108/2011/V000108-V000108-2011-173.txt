Speaker, on September 13, 2011, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 702 and 703.  Had I been present for rollcall 702, on agreeing to the amendment, Holt of New Jersey Amendment No. 7 to H.R. 2218, the Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act, I would have voted ``Aye.''   Had I been present for rollcall 703, on agreeing to the amendment, King of Iowa Amendment No. 8 to H.R. 2218, the Empowering Parents through Quality Charter Schools Act, I would have voted ``no.''                          ____________________
