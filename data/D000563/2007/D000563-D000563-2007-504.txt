Once this rule is adopted, I expect that, as bills and joint resolutions that contain tax or tariff provisions are brought to the Senate floor, the chairman will, before a vote on a motion to proceed to such a measure, publish a list of all limited tax or tariff benefits therein, identifying each of these provisions, the Senator or Senators requesting the provision, and the entities reasonably anticipated to benefit, to the extent known to the requesting Senator.  Am I correct in my understanding that the chairman will make such information public for each tax or tariff provision in the measure that provides a benefit to a limited group of beneficiaries where the provision results in those beneficiaries being treated more advantageously than entities that, in the absence of such a provision, would be considered similarly situated with regard to the portion of the Tax Code affected by the provision?
