President, I rise today to acknowledge the endeavors of the citizens and Town Council of Westerly, RI, in establishing and promoting Neighbor Day. Neighbor Day is an opportunity to learn more about others in our communities. It is also a celebration of friendship, civility, peace and cooperation. Since 1993, when a dispute between two teenagers left one youth dead and another charged with murder, Westerly has celebrated Neighbor Day in an effort to prevent similar tragedies at home and throughout the world.  Westerly's tradition has been adopted throughout my state. The Rhode IslandGeneral Assembly in 1999 designated the Sunday before Memorial Day as Neighbor Day for annual statewide observance. It is the hope of the citizens of Westerly that Neighbor Day will gain nationwide and worldwide recognition, and that its ideals--community, tolerance, and nonviolence--will one day become a reality for all.  I hope my colleagues will join with me in recognizing Westerly's achievement in encouraging friendship and respect among all people.  I ask that following this statement the resolution of the Rhode Island General Assembly, declaring statewide recognition of Neighbor Day, be printed in the Record. Senate Resolution Declaring May 19, 1996 To Be Neighbor Day in Rhode                                  Island       Whereas, Go out of your way to get in touch with your      neighbors. Ring doorbells and say ``Hello.'' These are but      some of the things we each can do to learn more about the      people in our communities; and       Whereas, In 1993, Westerly became the first town in the      Ocean State to declare the Sunday before Memorial Day to be      Neighbor Day, and the State of Rhode Island swiftly followed      its splendid example. Hopefully national and international      recognition of this special day will make its ideals a      reality for all; and       Whereas, While respect and justice for all is often upon      our lips, it will take a strong personal commitment by each      and every one of us to actualize this dream; now, therefore,      be it       Resolved, That this Senate of the State of Rhode Island and      Providence Plantations hereby declares May 19, 1996 to be      Neighbor Day in Rhode Island. It is so important that all      Rhode Islanders learn that the most important moral      obligation we all share is to ``Love Thy Neighbor''; and be      it further       Resolved, That the Secretary of State be and he hereby is      authorized and directed to transmit a duly certified copy of      this resolution to Mary Jane DiMaio, MJD Enterprises.                          ____________________
