 President, many Americans have already started the process of filling out their tax returns. It is a stressful time of year, but thanks to ObamaCare many are sure to find it even more stressful. Part of this is because of ObamaCare's $1 trillion-plus in tax increases.  If you have health insurance ObamaCare has a tax for that. If you don't have health insurance, ObamaCare has a tax for that too. Whether government bureaucrats deem your coverage generous or not generous enough, ObamaCare has a tax for you.  Some of these taxes are paid by consumers directly. Others are passed along in the form of higher premiums, increased costs, and lost opportunities, but many fall on the shoulders of the middle class.  There is more to the issue, too, because ObamaCare has done what many thought impossible, it has made a mind-numbingly complex Tax Code even more so.  For the first time, the government will be asking on our tax returns if we had health insurance for every month of last year. If someone didn't--well, you guessed it--ObamaCare has a tax for that, too, but this is only a portion of the cost and complexity ObamaCare threatens to impose on millions this tax season.  This is how one health law expert put it:       It will be very easy to find people who are unhappy with      [ObamaCare's] . . . new tax obligations--people who have to      pay a penalty, who have to wait forever to get through to      somebody at the I.R.S. or have to pay back a lot of money      because of overpayments of premium tax credits.  This is from an expert who supports ObamaCare.  The truth is ObamaCare is a law that just keeps on giving, giving headaches to the middle class. It meant millions of cancellation notices, it meant higher costs for many, and now this.  Remember, too, the IRS, the same agency charged with processing our tax returns, is now in charge of implementing vast sections of ObamaCare. The same agency that spent so much time trying to silence free speech--the same agency that awarded bonuses to employees who owed back taxes--is an agency charged with enforcing ObamaCare's web of complexity.  Americans are right to question the IRS's competence to handle so much sensitive information. We just received another reminder of that recently.  One of the Obama administration's own inspectors general released a damning report of this troubled agency. The report found that the IRS recently rehired hundreds of individuals who had left the agency under clouds of misconduct.  It took back individuals who had engaged in sexual harassment, criminal misconduct, and fraud and on at least one occasion ignored case file notes that warned ``Do not rehire.''  The tax collector for America even rehired people who willfully failed to file their tax returns.  I know the chairman of the Finance Committee plans to dig into issues such as these. He wants answers. We all do. The American people deserve them. They are tired of seeing a government that has lost focus on them, and they are tired of enduring ObamaCare's growing list of failed promises.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader
