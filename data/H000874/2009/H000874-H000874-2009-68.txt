Ours is longer because it deals with a broader subject, you're correct, in giving every American health care and including, by the way, expanding protections to senior citizens on the doughnut hole that was incorporated in that bill. There were no amendments offered, and my presumption is your theory was that it had been so carefully constructed that you didn't want to have amendments to that bill, but you did, in fact, allow us a substitute and we offered that substitute.  I would say to the gentleman, as I have said before, that certainly I believe you ought to have, and we are going to invite you to have, a substitute and introduce your alternative that you have been talking about now for some months. I hope that you have submitted it to CBO for scoring, and we would expect 72 hours' notice of that substitute before it's brought to the floor, as you expect us to give you 72 hours' notice of our bill and of our manager's amendment.
