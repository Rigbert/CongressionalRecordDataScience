(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Women around the world are especially vulnerable to      poverty. They tend to work longer hours, are compensated      less, and have less income stability and fewer economic      opportunities than men.       (2) Women's share of the labor force is increasing in      almost all regions of the world. Women comprise more than 40      percent of the global labor force as well as 40 percent of      the labor force in eastern and southeastern Asia, sub-Saharan      Africa, and the Caribbean. Women comprise a third of the      labor force in Central America and nearly a third of total      employment in South Asia. About 250,000,000 young women will      enter the labor force worldwide before 2015.       (3) Women are more likely to work in informal employment      relationships in poor countries compared to men. In sub-     Saharan Africa, 84 percent of women are employed informally      compared to 71 percent of men. In the Middle East, 44 percent      of women are employed informally compared to 29 percent of      men. Informal employment is characterized by lower wages and      greater variability of earnings, less stability, absence of      labor organization, and fewer social protections than formal      employment.       (4) Changes in the economy of a poor country affect women      and men differently. Women are disproportionately affected by      long-term recessions, crises, and economic restructuring and      they often miss out on many of the benefits of growth.       (5) International trade can be an important tool for      economic development and poverty reduction. The benefits of      international trade should extend to all members of society,      particularly the world's poor women.       (6) Policies that promote fair labor practices for women,      and access to information, education, land, credit, physical      capital, and social services can be a means of reducing      poverty, ensuring food security, and boosting productivity      and earnings for the economies of developing countries.       (7) Expanding economic opportunity for women in developing      countries can have a positive effect on child nutrition,      health, and education, as women often invest their income in      their families. Increasing women's income can also decrease      women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence, and      trafficking, and make women more resistant to the impact of      natural disasters.       (8) Policies that promote economic opportunities for women,      including microfinance and microenterprise development and      the promotion of women's small- and medium-sized businesses,      can be a means of generating gainful, safe, and dignified      employment for the poor.       (9) Women play a vital, but often unrecognized, role in      averting violence, resolving conflict, and rebuilding      economies in postconflict societies. Women in conflict-     affected areas face even greater challenges than men do in      accessing employment, training, property rights, credit, and      financial and nonfinancial resources for business      development. Policies designed to ensure economic opportunity      for women in conflict-affected areas play a significant role      in economic rehabilitation and consolidation of peace.       (10) Given the important role of women in the economies of      poor countries, poverty alleviation programs funded by the      United States in poor countries should seek to enhance the      level of economic opportunity available to women in those      countries.       (b) Statement of Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to      ensure that the policies of the United States actively      promote development and economic opportunities for women,      including programs and policies that--       (1) promote women's ability to start      micro-, small-, or medium-sized business enterprises, and      enable women to grow such enterprises, particularly from      micro- to small-sized enterprises and from small- to medium-     sized enterprises, or sustain current business capacity;       (2) promote the rights of women to own, manage, and inherit      property, including land, encourage the adoption of laws and      policies that support women in their efforts to enforce those      rights in administrative and judicial tribunals, and address      conflicts with country-specific legal regimes or practices      (often known as ``customary law'') to increase the ability of      women to inherit and own real property;       (3) increase women's access to employment, enable women to      access higher quality jobs with better remuneration and      working conditions in both informal and formal employment,      and improve the quality of jobs in sectors dominated by women      by improving the remuneration and working conditions for      those jobs; and       (4) bring the benefits of international trade policy to      women in developing countries and continue to ensure that      trade policies and agreements adequately reflect the      respective needs of poor women and men.

Throughout the world, indigenous, local,      nongovernmental and community-based organizations, as well as      financial service providers, are essential to addressing many      of the development challenges facing countries and to      creating stable, functioning democracies.
