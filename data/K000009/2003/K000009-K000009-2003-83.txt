Speaker, this weekend in our local newspaper and across this country, a major story appeared with a photo that is unforgettable, a photo of Sergeant David Borell and Sergeant First Class Bryan Pacholski, both deployed outside of Baghdad, both members of the 323rd Military Police Company based in Toledo, Ohio, the center of my district. The title of the article is ``Children's Suffering Wounds GIs; Toledo Soldier Frustrated by Lack of Response to Medical Need.'' I am going to include this article, the full article, in the Record tonight along with Sergeant Borell's comments; also a letter I am sending to Secretary Rumsfeld this evening asking that based on these reports out of Iraq, I am requesting a personal meeting with the Secretary to propose an expedited schedule by the United States to establish temporary field hospitals in Iraq, perhaps in concert with our Arab allies, serving the wounded and the suffering.  With Baghdad's early fall, sufficient funds have been appropriated by our Appropriations Committee to accommodate these facilities. We can work with other organizations around the world, but without question the United States is in the lead now. It is important that we rise to this moral imperative. It is our sacred obligation to do so.  Let me report what Sergeant David Borell says, who, by the way, should get a promotion by the Department of Defense for his honor. He works close to a sign that reads: ``Working Together With the Iraqi People for Peace and Prosperity.'' That sign is placed near the North Gate to Sustainer Army Airfield northwest of Baghdad. He says, ``The implications of those words, 'Working Together With the Iraqi People for Peace and Prosperity,' it would seem, are far-reaching. Perhaps even all-encompassing. To me, it would seem to say that we, the Americans, are here to help. Help restore the Iraqi economy, help restore law and order, help the Iraqi people build anew that which has been taken from them. And, surely, help them in their times of dire need. Help them when there are truly none others for them to turn to.''  The photo says it all: ``Sergeant First Class Bryan Pacholski comforts Sergeant David Borell, both from Toledo.'' Why is he comforting Sergeant Borell? And it says, Sergeant Borell ``saw something that flies in the face of every moral lesson I have ever learned from my leadership in the military.'' He says, ``I used to be proud of what I'm doing and of being an American soldier, but after today I wonder if I will still be able to carry the title soldier with any pride at all. Or simply with the knowledge that a soldier couldn't even help three small severely burned children.'' He says, ``We came here to depose Saddam Hussein, a mission we accomplished. But the second mission was one of greater importance and purpose, to be part of a force that would serve to provide the Iraqi people with a freedom that they have never known.'' It seemed to him to be the noblest mission of all. In almost 14 yearsof military service, the Army taught him many things, duty, honor, obligation; and though he was also taught to be a warrior, at the same time he thought he was taught to be a humanitarian. But he saw something during his service in the last week which caused him to question all of that.  While working at that North Gate, he was approached by an Iraqi father in need of assistance who took him to the back of his car where his wife and three children waited with a patience which could only have been borne out of a life of adversity. Once there, the father showed him his first son. He was a boy of 10 or 11 years of age. His eyes were a deep shade of brown, and he stared at the sergeant without tears. His mother held him in her arms and gently fanned him with a piece of cardboard both for comfort and to keep flies off of him. Across his body were wounds of unimaginable origin. Most of his legs and arms were singed clean of the top layers of flesh. His face was contorted with the same manner of burns. The sergeant says, ``I can only imagine the intensity of the pain he was in. He said nothing to me, but his eyes pleaded with me nonetheless. He was in need of help, the very help I was trained to offer.''  And so the sergeant called the doctors in the field and it took them an hour to arrive. In the front seat of this same car were his two sisters equally burned, one around 5 years old and the older 8 or 9. One blister on her right hand was the size of a baseball. Like their brother, they did not even complain. They made no sound at all. And the chain of command decided they deserved no treatment, and they turned them away.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to end my remarks tonight and read the last two sentences that say, ``The Army failed three young children in Iraq today for no reason. After today, I wonder if I will still be able to carry the title soldier with any pride at all, because this soldier couldn't even help three small children.''  Secretary Rumsfeld, we need your help. We need field hospitals in Iraq now.       Sirs: The following incident occurred on 13 June 2003. Any      exposure you can create for this would be greatly      appreciated. Also there when this happened were      correspondents or representatives of FoxNews, the Associated      Press, the New York Times, the LA Times, the Chicago Tribune,      and various foreign media.     working together with the iraqi people for peace and      prosperity.       That's what the sign reads at the North Gate to Sustainer      Army Airfield Northwest of Baghdad. The implications of those      words, it would seem, are far-reaching. Perhaps even all-     encompassing. To me, it would seem to say that we, the      Americans, are here to help. Help restore the Iraqi economy,      help restore law and order help the Iraqi people build anew      that which has been taken from the. And, surely, help them in      their times of dire need. Help them when there are truly none      others for them to turn to.       As a military force, we came to this country under two      pretenses. One, to rid the world of what has been termed a      dire and immediate threat to world peace. This threat was      embodied in Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party he led. We      accomplished, if not completely, then at least practically,      that goal. Saddam is no longer in a place of power here.      Instead, we created, hopefully, a foundation for the Iraqi      people to rule themselves. Our second pretense was much more      enigmatic. We came to give the Iraqi people peace and freedom      such as many Americans have known all their lives. This      second mission was, to me, one of greater import and purpose.      I came to be a part of that force that would serve to provide      the Iraqi people with a freedom that they have never known.      It seemed to me a noble mission at the least.       In almost 14 years of military service, the Army has taught      me many things. Most of what I believe about duty, honor and      obligation has come from those things I learned as a young      soldier. I was taught to be a warrior and an unstoppable,      indefatigable combat power, but, at the same time, to be a      humanitarian. To give any assistance I could possibly provide      to those people who were innocent of hostilities or even      those who were not but who no longer represented a threat to      U.S. forces. I learned that the American military was meant      to be much more than a combat force. That we are a      peacekeeping force, trained and equipped not only for the      perils of combat, but also, and sometimes above all else to      help. To build instead of destroy. I came to Iraq as a      Military Policeman to rebuild and practice that which has      been so deeply ingrained in me throughout those years of      military service. And to be a part of that greater purpose I      believe we all seek.       But today, I saw something which caused me to question      exactly where the Army as an institution places it teachings.      I saw something that flies in the face of every moral lesson      I have ever learned from my leadership in the military.      Moreover, it flew in the face of simple human dignity and      obligation.       While working at that North Gate of Sustainer Army      Airfield, not far from the sign at the entrance, I was      approached by an Iraqi father in need of assistance. He took      me back to his car where his wife and three children waited      with a patience that could only have been born of a life of      adversity. Once there, he showed me first his son. He was a      boy of perhaps 10 or 11 years old. His eyes were a deep shade      of brown and stared at me without tears. His mother held him      in her arms and gently fanned his with a piece of cardboard      both for comfort and to keep flies off of him. Across his      body were wounds of unimaginable origin. Most of his legs and      arms were singed clean of the top layers of flesh. His face      was contorted with the same manner of burns. I can only      imagine the intensity of the pain he was in. He said nothing      to me, but his eyes pleaded with me nonetheless. He was in      need of help. The very help that I was trained to offer. In      fact, the very help I was taught, and fervently believe, it      is my duty to offer. He didn't ask much, or so I thought.      Only some relief from the pain that a boy his age should      never have to endure.       But the damage didn't end there. In the front seat were his      sisters. The youngest was around 5 years old and the older      one around 8 or 9. They too were covered in burns. The five      year old had hands covered with burns. The right half of her      face had also been burned. On her right hand was a blister      the size of a baseball. The eight year old suffered the same      agonizing injuries. Both her arms and hands and the left side      of her face were covered. Like their brother, they did not      cry nor even complain. They made no sound at all. One look      into their eyes, though, and no word of complaint was      necessary. No verbal communication could possibly have      conveyed the amount of pain or suffering they were going      through. But, looking into their eyes, I knew that they were      pleading with me to help. If not as an American soldier,      trained and equipped to do so, than as a fellow human. They      were asking me and they were asking America. I could not more      ignore this pleading than if it were to have come from my own      daughters. And it was my own daughters I saw when I looked at      these young girls.       Without hesitation, I made contact with the only people      available to me and requested assistance. My chain of command      contacted the base hospital and, after what seemed an      eternity to me but was more realistically probably only an      hour or so, assistance finally came in the form of two      Majors, both doctors, from the base hospital. But even an      hour of so seemed too long to me. Judging from the traffic on      the radio, there was apparently lengthy discussion as to      whether or not any assistance at all would be forthcoming.      But it did finally come, and I fully believed that these      children would receive at least some care. At minimum, a      token amount to relieve their suffering until something else      could be done. My beliefs, my faith in the Army were not to      be realized.       Both ``doctors'' looked briefly at the son. Perhaps a      minute. No probing, no questioning as to the extent of the      injuries. No discussion as to how they could help. And,      without so much as a cursory examination of the girls,      announced that there was nothing they could do. ``Long-term      care'' is what they said was needed. ``These wounds are not      life-threatening'' was emphatically pronounced. And, most      injuriously to my conscience, that we, as Americans, had not      caused the wounds and, thusly, would not treat them. I was      informed that the ``rules of engagement'' for the treatment      of local nationals was that the wounds had to threaten life,      limb or eyesight or had to have been caused by Americans. The      children were coarsely sent on their way with no treatment      administered. I was left with nothing to answer the pleading      of these children but to empty my first aid bag of anything      useful to give their father. And empty it I did, but to what      end? It wasn't enough and he and I both knew it.       What would it have cost us to treat these children? A few      dollars perhaps. Some investment of time and resources. But      are we not here for just that purpose? Did we not depose the      ``evil regime''? Or did we just replace it with one of our      own making? I cannot imagine the heartlessness required to      look into the eyes of a child in horrid pain and suffering      and, with medical resources only a brief trip up the road,      ignore their plight as though they are insignificant. Only      Iraqis seeking that which they should be able to provide      themselves. ``We are not here to be the treatment center for      the country.'' These words were actually spoken to me by one      of the ``doctors''. But, if not us, then who? The local      ``hospital'', if it can even be called that, had already      refused them treatment. There was no one else.       The last time I checked, prior to the arrival of American      and coalition forces, the Iraqi people had a government,      albeit an appalling one. And they had an infrastructure,      albeit a surely inadequate one. But, we, in our ``noble''      effort to give the Iraqi people freedom and secure peace for      the world, have taken what little they had away. They no      longer have any real form of government, and, lacking that,      no true infrastructure. So who is to provide these things      taken from them? By virtue of the morals and standards taught      me by the Army, we, as Americans, are. It is we who are here      to ``work together''. It is we who mean to give the Iraqis     ``peace and prosperity.'' Apparently, working together does      not mean medical treatment for children who have done nothing      wrong and have nowhere else to turn.       I wear a silver bracelet on my arm. It was given to me by      my wife before I was deployed here. On one side is engraved      ``Duty, Honor, Country'' and on the reverse is ``With Love,      Rachelle''. I wear it to remind me of why I'm here. Why I'm      so far from my wife and children, why I'm sacrificing my time      and my energy and placing myself at personal risk of injury      or death. ``Duty, Honor, Country'' is what I have been taught      for almost 14 years. But the Army failed 3 young children      today for no reason. And, in so doing, they betrayed those      values. I used to be proud of what I'm doing and of being an      American soldier. After today, I wonder if I will still be      able to carry the title ``soldier'' with any pride at all. Or      simply with the knowledge that a ``soldier'' couldn't even      help 3 small children.     David J. Borell,     Sergeant, US Army,     323rd Military Police Company,     Balad, Iraq,     North Gate Sustainer Army Airfield,     (Northwest of Baghdad)                                  ____                 [From the Toledo Blade, June 14, 2003]                    Children's Suffering Wounds GIs          toledo soldier wants to help injured Iraqi children                             (By Joe Mahr)       Ohio Army National Guard Sgt. David Borell peered into a      car outside his Iraqi base yesterday, and the Toledoan's      mission seemed obvious.       There sat three children with burns on their arms, legs,      and faces. One had layers of skin singed from his      extremities. Another had a baseball-sized welt on her hand.      The look in their eyes said one thing: Help.       The military police sergeant quickly radioed for medics,      but it took about an hour for doctors to arrive. Even then,      the doctors refused to help--saying the wounds weren't ``life      threatening.'' And the sergeant could think only of how he'd      react if it were his children back home suffering such pain.       After the doctors left, he broke down.       ``I saw something that flies in the face of every moral      lesson I have ever learned from my leadership in the      military,'' he wrote in an e-mail sent to The Blade last      night.       The 30-year-old's frustration is not the only angst among      family, friends, and soldiers of Toledo's 323rd Military      Police Company, which has been deployed for 16 of the past 20      months.       They've spent the past two months in Kuwait and Iraq--most      of that time based on one of the hottest spots since the      declared end of major combat: Balad, about 40 miles northwest      of Baghdad.       They've been shot at, had rocks thrown at them, and endured      triple-digit heat--with no formal date set for return. Back      home, some of their loved ones have begun asking elected      leaders to get the Army to set a return date, if only a      tentative one, for a unit that could be in Iraq until      January, and perhaps longer.       ``We understand they've got to be there,'' said Brad      Eckhart, whose wife is a medic with 323rd. ``But they're      being jerked around, and that's really damaging morale.''       For Sergeant Borell, he said the frustration erupted during      a shift guarding the north gate of the Sustainer Army      Airfield--where the sign reads ``Working together with the      Iraqi people for peace and prosperity.''       The 1991 Sylvania Southview High School graduate has made a      career of the military, spending 13 years alternating between      the regular forces an the Guard. He said the mission in Iraq      seemed noble when the 323rd arrived: Toppling a cruel      dictator who threatened world peace and helping the Iraqi      people build a new country.       The latter mission seemed a more important and fitting      role, he said, for an Army that taught him ``to be a warrior,      and an unstoppable, indefatigable combat power, but, at the      same time, to be a humanitarian.''       So he didn't hesitate when a father approached him outside      the base gate yesterday to show the sergeant his injured      children--who apparently were playing with explosive      material.       ``He took me back to his car where his wife and three      children waited with a patience that could only have been      born of a life of adversity,'' Sergeant Borell recalled.       The mother held a 10 or 11-year-old in her arms, fanning      the boy's face with a piece of cardboard to keep the flies      off and soothe what the sergeant described as ``wounds of      unimaginable origin.''       ``Most of his legs and arms were singed clean of the top      layers of flesh,'' Sergeant Borell said. ``His face was      contorted with the same manner of burns. I can only imagine      the intensity of the pain he was in.''       In the front seat, a girl age 8 or 9 had her arms, hands,      and the left side of her face covered with burns. Beside her      was a girl about 5, the right side of her face covered with      burns, and a baseball-sized welt on her hand.       They made no sounds, the sergeant said, but it didn't      matter.       ``No verbal communication could possibly have conveyed the      amount on pain of suffering they were going through,'' he      said. ``But looking into their eyes, I knew that they were      pleading with me to help. If not as an American soldier,      trained and equipped to do so, then as a fellow human. They      were asking me and they were asking America.''       The sergeant passed on the request to his commanders, who      contacted the base hospital, which eventually sent two      doctors with the rank of major. They looked at the boy for      ``perhaps a minute . . . and without so much as a cursory      examination of the girls, announced that there was nothing      they could do.''       The doctors told the sergeant that the wounds were not      life-threatening, that the children needed long-term care,      and that it wasn't the Americans' responsibility.       Sergeant Borell said that one doctor told him: ``We are not      here to be the treatment center for the country.''       The local hospital already had refused to treat the      children. So the sergeant gave the father all the supplies      from his personal medical bag, and the father left.       ``The last time I checked, prior to the arrival of American      and coalition forces, the Iraqi people had a government,      albeit an appalling one,'' the sergeant said. ``And they had      an infrastructure, albeit a surely inadequate one. But, we,      in our `noble' effort to give the Iraqi people freedom and      secure peace for the world, have taken what little they had      away . . . So who is to provide these things taken from them?       The incident was the latest for a unit that has been      anything but the old stereotype of ``weekend warriors.''      After the 2001 terrorist attacks, they spent 11 months      guarding Fort Bragg, N.C. They returned home for four months,      only to be called up for the Iraq war.       The military can't provide direct accounts of what the unit      has experienced. But soldiers, in phone calls and e-mails to      family and friends, talk about the night a convoy was      ambushed by gunfire. Nobody was hurt. They talk of being on      patrol and repeatedly having rocks hurled at them.       They now live in an old airport hangar, eating one hot meal      a day and the rest from military Meals Ready to Eat, Mr.      Eckhart said. They must still use ``field toilets.''       And rumors continue to circulate about the unit's fate. A      Toledo TV station erroneously reported recently that the      323rd was coming home ``soon.'' Another rumor has the unit,      or at least some members, headed to Kosovo after Iraq.       Their orders in Iraq are for 365 days, taking them to mid-     January, 2004. The Army could keep them another year, but      that's unlikely, said Maj. Neal O'Brien, of the Ohio National      Guard.       ``Obviously, the hope is that they're back earlier, and any      day less than a year is a good day,'' he said. ``There's      always a chance they could potentially be extended, but it's      certainly not expected.''       Still, he said, the Ohio National Guard has no way of      knowing a formal date of return because when a unit is      mobilized for federal duty, the Army assumes complete control      over the unit. And the Army isn't offering a date of return.       The National Guard leadership, based in Columbus, tries to      keep in touch with its units in Iraq. But Lt. Col. Mike Ore      said he hadn't yet heard of the incident with Sergeant Borell      and didn't know if the soldier's account was accurate.       ``I know the 323rd has been engaged in some pretty heavy      stuff,'' Colonel Ore said.       In previous e-mails back home, Sergeant Borell talked of      heat that reached 126 degrees and how the Iraqis had      stockpiled weapons all over the country. U.S. troops tried to      keep the Iraqi children from playing with the weapons, but it      was difficult.       He didn't complain about military leadership until sending      the latest e-mail to the media and his family last night,      said his father, John Borell.       ``For him to write that e-mail, it must have affected him      greatly,'' his father said.       Sergeant Borell, a father of two and stepfather of one,      ended his e-mail questioning why he was sacrificing his time,      energy, and potentially his life.       ``I used to be proud of what I'm doing and of being an      American soldier,'' he said. ``After today, I wonder if I      will still be able to carry the title `soldier' with any      pride at all. Or simply with the knowledge that a `soldier'      couldn't even help three small children.''                                  ____                 [From the Toledo Blade, June 15, 2003] Kaptur To Press Rumsfield on Toledo GI's `Reality Check', Iraqi Kids'                        Wounds Spark Policy Debate                             (By Joe Mahr)       From his hot and dusty base in northern Iraq, Ohio Army      National Guard Sgt. David Borell typed an e-mail criticizing      the U.S. military's lack of treatment for severely burned      Iraqi children.       A day later, the Sylvania native got the attention of his      congressman, U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D., Toledo). She pledged      yesterday to speak directly with the secretary of defense      himself--an action that could rekindle an international      debate over how much U.S. forces should, or even can, help      injured Iraqis.       ``[Sergeant Borell] is in the finest tradition of the      American military,'' Miss Kaptur said yesterday. ``I am going      to make sure that the fact that he gave a ground-zero reality      check from there can guide policy-makers at the highest      level.''       Sergeant Borell, of the Toldeo-based 323rd Military Police      Company, complained Friday that he tried to get medical help      for three children with severe burns on the arms, legs, and      faces, but Army doctors told him that the children's wounds      were not life-threatening and it was not the Americans' duty      to help.       After having to send the family on its way without      treatment, the sergeant broke down and had to be comforted by      his platoon leader, Sgt. 1st Class Bryan Pacholski. The      moment was captured by an Associated Press photographer, and      the picture was printed yesterday in The Blade and newspapers      across the country.       Upon seeing the picture and article in The Blade, Miss      Kaptur said she shared the outrage of the 30-year-old      military police sergeant. She said it's not only a moral duty      for America, but a strategic one that can help build support      in an Arab world that increasingly questions America's      motives in Iraq.       ``We are losing the battle for respect in that region,''      said Miss Kaptur, who opposed President Bush's decision to go      to war. ``We might command the ground--or hold the ground for      the moment--but we have to gain the hearts and minds of the      people.''       Miss Kaptur's criticism was shared by some who contacted      The Blade yesterday, such as Dave Pacholski, the brother of      the sergeant who comforted Sergeant Borell Friday.       ``I have two little ones, and I find it irresponsible on      anybody's part to just walk away and say there's nothing they      can do,'' he said. ``Not only is that ignorant, but it was      totally against what doctors do.''       But others said the American military is doing the best it      can in what is still a dangerous war zone, and they      questioned whether anyone should pass judgment on a scenario      before hearing the side of military officials, which was not      available Friday or yesterday.       Maj. John Dzienny, a Toledo native now serving with U.S.      Army special forces in Iraq, wrote in an e-mail that he has      seen only ``compassion and resolve'' by American forces.       ``It is the hope of all of us over here to see these people      one day free and safe, just as we enjoy at home. These things      take time, however, and it can strain the heart to not have      an instant solution. All an individual can do is the best he      or she can,'' he said.       It is not a new debate.       The nonprofit group Doctors Without Borders complained      three weeks after U.S. troops rolled into Baghdad that the      U.S.-led coalition hierarchy had failed to restart Iraq's      health-care system.       The group's international council president, Dr. Martin      Rostrup, not only blamed U.S. forces for failing to stop the      looting at many hospitals, but for not setting up an      administrative health system to replace Saddam's--which he      said was required under the Geneva Convention.       ``They are definitely responsible to see that basic      services are put in place very rapidly so as to avoid      suffering of people. And this has not taken place. After      three weeks, the hospitals are in disarray and I find that      unacceptable,'' he told reporters then, according to an      Internet transcript of a May 3 news conference.       It's unclear now how much that's changed. The group's      spokesman said yesterday that he could not provide an      immediate assessment of Iraq's current health-care system.       And the human rights group Amnesty International has yet to      pass judgment on whether the U.S.-led coalition is doing      enough.       ``The legal standard is a hard one to measure,'' group      spokesman Alistair Hodgett said. ``But I think you can't read      an account like that account [by Sergeant Borell] and not      feel like the U.S. should be doing more.''       A U.S. military spokesman said Iraqis have a better health-     care system now than before. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Matthew Klee,      speaking on behalf of the U.S. Central Command, said      yesterday that the military is doing the best it can to help      as many civilians as possible in a country roughly the size      of California.       ``We are providing health care to Iraqis, but we don't have      the infrastructure to support the entire Iraqi civilian      population,'' said Commander Klee, who is based in Tampa.       He said he was unable to immediately provide the military's      detailed rules for when its field hospitals must accept Iraqi      civilians, but he said at the very least military hospitals      treat any civilians with life-threatening injuries. The rest      are referred to local, civilian-run hospitals.       He also said he was unable to immediately conform Sergeant      Borell's account of the burned children not getting medical      attention. But he said that, regardless, the military would      not punish the sergeant for speaking out--a key worry of      Congressman Kaptur.       ``As long as he's speaking of his own personal opinions,      he's more than welcome to do that,'' Commander Klee said.      ``He just can't speak for the military. He can express his      views. But when it comes to policy and official statements,      that's really our bailiwick.''       Contacted vie e-mail at their base 30 miles northwest of      Baghdad, other soldiers in the 323rd also were unable to      confirm the sergeant's account of the incident. But 1st Sgt.      Robert Orwig confirmed that the unit's Balad base treats only      civilians injured by an American or who have an injury that      could involve a loss of life, limb, or an eye.       Still, the 323rd soldiers routinely call the base hospital      anyway when an injured Iraqi approaches, and let the hospital      staff formally refuse to treat the injured.       ``It is hard for our soldiers to have to turn the children      away, but that is the guidance we have and have to go by,''      he said.       ``This wasn't the first incident that children were sent      away,'' he added. ``[It] probably won't be the last.''       Miss Kaptur, however, hopes it is the last.       She said she will seek out Defense Secretary Donald      Rumsfeld as well as House leaders from both parties when she      returns to Washington tomorrow. She said the military should      be able to set up more field hospitals to treat wounded      Iraqis until the Iraqi civilian hospitals can do the job.       If the U.S. military can't do it, Miss Kaptur said, other      international groups or even American citizens should.       ``I know the American people. We could fill a cargo plane      out here at Toldeo Express and equip the first field hospital      ourselves,'' she said.       As for Sergeant Borell, he wrote in an e-mail to The Blade      yesterday that the Iraqi family hadn't returned yet to the      base to seek help for their children.       ``I imagine one refusal is enough for them,'' he said.                                  ____                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 2003.     Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld,     Secretary, Department of Defense,     The Pentagon, Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld: Based on these articles, I am      requesting a personal meeting with you. I wish to propose an      expedited schedule by the U.S. to establish temporary field      hospitals in Iraq, perhaps in concert with our Arab allies,      serving the wounded and suffering. With Baghdad's early fall,      sufficient funds have been appropriated to accommodate these      facilities.       In addition, UN health organizations, Doctors Without      Borders, and Americans from all walks of life should be      engaged in this moral imperative. Our forces, or those of      coalition allies, can be used to secure the perimeters where      such field health services would be offered.       As a representative from the Arab-American crescent that      lies between Toledo, Ohio, Dearborn, Michigan, and Cleveland,      Ohio, I know our region would rise to the occasion of      equipping and staffing the first such hospital. Equally,      America should match our commitment.       It is now our obligation. Thank you.           Sincerely,                                                     Marcy Kaptur,     U.S. Representative.                          ____________________
