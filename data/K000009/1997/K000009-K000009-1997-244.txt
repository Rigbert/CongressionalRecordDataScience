Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 10th anniversary of the Edison Industrial Systems Center. On November 6, 1997 EISC will celebrate its long history of achievement and contribution to the businesses and citizens of Ohio at a celebration to be held at the center of science and industry in downtown Toledo, OH.  EISC has been a tremendous force in helping to link companies to high tech resources in Ohio and throughout the Nation. These connections have been instrumental in increasing production and in improving the quality of products and employee skills in industry.  One of EISC's major accomplishments is the revolutionary and much acclaimed Toledo Technology Academy. The academy's goals are to prepare high school students for high-tech careers or for further education in engineering disciplines.  Food production is Ohio's largest industry and EISC's food technology centers work to modernize food producers who still rely on outdated technology for quality control. Modernization provided by EISC through this program vastly improves plant safety, product consistency and profits.  Among the innovations created under the food technology centers are several new types of food sensors that measure quality. Germ free packaging methods instructed by EISC are another helpful addition to the industry, improving the safety of our food.  The center for technology commercialization offers a variety of services to firms. Attorneys, accountants, and financial institutions maintained by this division are available to companies as a form of cost-effective support.  Companies in the city of Toledo, OH, and throughout the Nation are indebted to EISC for its work. I will be pleased to join my community on November 6, 1997, to commemorate the strides EISC has made in 10 years of growth and betterment to industry.                          ____________________
