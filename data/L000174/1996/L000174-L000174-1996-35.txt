President, I would like to ask a question regarding section 1304 of the pending fiscal year 1997 National Defense Authorization Act. This provision would amend title 10, section 401 entitled ``Humanitarian and civic assistance provided in conjunction with military operations.''  The point that I would like clarified is whether the annual $5 million cap in new subsection (c)(3) would be a U.S. Governmentwide cap, or whether it is a cap on only DOD humanitarian assistance appropriations.
