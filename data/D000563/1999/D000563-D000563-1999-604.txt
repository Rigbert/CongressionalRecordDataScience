I don't have an answer.  Now, I say to the chairman of that committee, I don't know if you were there during that questioning, but if you are looking for an indication of why Senator Wellstone's amendment is important, that statistic alone should give the Senator from Utah some pause. I hope he will consider that we are not going to release anyone who has been charged with a crime but merely step back and try to make sure the administration of justice is color-blind in this country and that it is fair and try to eradicate the statistic which was quoted and verified by General McCaffrey.
