 President, just briefly in conclusion, I was listening to all the speakers on the other side with great interest. Their parties controlled the House of Representatives for 40 long years. I am curious as to why we have not felt the need here in the Senate to dictate this particular House rule in the past. We could have done that at any point. I do not know how long the House has had this practice but probably a long time. I just do not see the urgency or the propriety just because the management currently changed in the House as of last week that the Senate start dictating internal House policy.  I agree with Chairman Grassley that this is just not an appropriate thing to do, and a vote on the second-degree amendment that I have offered is in no way a condoning of the practice that we do not allow here. We serve in this body. We do not allow this. I do not think we ought to start off the year telling the House what ought to be in their internal operating mode.  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to address the Senate.  I yield the floor.
