 President, Thank you very much.  I want to begin by congratulating Senators Grassley and Durbin on getting such strong bipartisan support for this bill, including support from the President.  I am proud to support it, too.  As I have said in the past: I am not a fan of mandatory minimum sentences, particularly those that are very harsh and allow no discretion to a sentencing judge.  Early in my career, I sat on some 5,000 felony cases as a member of the California Women's Board of Terms and Parole. This board set sentences and granted parole to women sentenced to State prison.  I recall one individual sentenced to more than a decade in prison for three marijuana cigarettes.
