Speaker, on the important economic challenge of renegotiating NAFTA, once again, the Trump administration is leading us down a chaotic and unstable path. Our Nation must fix bad trade deals to create good jobs and stop the wage race to the bottom.  President Trump is taking a ``shoot first, ask questions later'' approach. It reminds me of his recent backward walk of words diminishing our NATO allies and his brash capitulating performance in Helsinki.  Closer to home, our continent has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape our trade deals that have resulted in lowered wages for the American people. Starting with NAFTA, we must re-create agreements that raise wages and lift up workers in our Nation and across the world.  Current trade deals exact huge profits for transnational companies that outsource jobs but continue the race to the bottom on wages for workers. So far, Trump's unsteady actions on trade just create more chaos, with businesses putting hiring plans on hold or scaling back whole projects because of their confusion about tariffs. Is his trade rhetoric producing a good outcome for the American people or is it just continuing the red ink of worse trade deficits, suppressed wages, and rising costs for consumers?  According to the PayScale Index, the paychecks of working Americans have fallen 1.4 percent just since 2017 when you adjust for the rising costs of essentials like healthcare, prescription drugs, gas, and groceries. In fact, wages have fallen, actually, 9.3 percent since 2006, as costs go up and up and up but wages stay flat or go down for so many families.  This is not what the American people were promised. They were promised bigger paychecks, more reshoring of jobs--remember Carrier in Indiana--better trade deals, and a President who was on their side. So far, we have just unfulfilled promises and confusion.  NAFTA negotiations press on, but there is concern President Trump willgo the way of his recent NATO meeting. Reports from his trade ambassador seem encouraging, but will this administration follow through on its promises to turn NAFTA into a job-insourcing deal? If his promise to fix healthcare or promises that the GOP tax giveaway to the top 1 percent would raise wages is any indication, then count me as a sceptic.  Since NAFTA's passage in 1993, there has not been a single year in which our Nation has achieved a trade balance with Mexico or Canada. These massive billion-dollar trade deficits power the harmful push of living-wage jobs beyond our borders and reduction in our wages. This low wage race to the bottom pits our workers against those making poverty-level wages in other nations.  Talk is cheap, Mr. President. In Ohio, people judge people by their actions. Words aren't enough to help working families. Our workers and the middle class that powers this country should not be the victim of an ill-thought-out trade war or attacks on our allies.  President Trump, listen to the people in places like Ohio, in both the industrial and agricultural sectors. Listen to the voters who took a chance on you because of trade. More trade chaos is not the path we were promised.  Renegotiate a NAFTA that will result in trade balances, insourcing of jobs to this country with higher paying jobs in our country and rising wages for our workers, and with continental efforts to gain stability working with our trade partners in both Canada and Mexico. That is what a renegotiated NAFTA should look like. Let's hope we get it.                          ____________________
