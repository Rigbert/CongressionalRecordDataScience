I will tell him I know what I am up against. I think the Senator from Florida, being a realist, does too. When you have the major automobile manufacturers who are frightened by the challenge--they are afraid of this challenge. They do not think they can meet it. They have been beaten to the punch by Japan when it comes the hybrid cars. Instead, they started talking about hydrogen fuel vehicles. That may happen in my lifetime, but it is just as likely it will not happen in my lifetime. Instead of dealing with hybrid vehicles that are already successful with consumers in America, they are afraid of this challenge. Because they are afraid of this challenge, they throw up all of these arguments: oh, that car is going to be a golf cart, it is going to be so tiny if it is fuel efficient, it is not going to be safe; there is just no way that American engineers can even figure out how to make them.  I do not buy it. I think, as I said to the Senator and others who are listening, the technology is there. We do not have to compromise safety. What is wrong with the challenge? What is wrong with the challenge from the President and the Congress asking the manufacturers selling cars in America to make them more fuel efficient? This legislation does not do it; my amendment would.
