Speaker, when you say within WRRDA, in the event that that does not occur, would the gentleman believe that we would deal with the assurance of the funding in the CR itself?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, as soon as it is finished, we will be able to put it out. But it is our intention, on the work that we agreed to with Members on your side of the aisle--and I know Speaker Ryan has had discussions with him as well, and he feels very comfortable about where we are and with funding on that--as soon as we are able to finish that up, I think everybody will be quite happy with the outcome. I think this is a work-on-both-sides-of-the-aisle compromise to find common ground to actually solve a problem.
