 President, I rise today to support the nomination of Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Judge Roberts is a man of integrity whose reputation is irrefutable. He has been widely praised for his affable and humble personality as well as his integrity and intellect. Judge Roberts is already greatly respected by his colleagues and current Supreme Court Justices who know him as a leading advocate before that Court.  I believe that Judge Roberts is eminently qualified for this position. He earned both his bachelor's degree and his law degree from Harvard University. In fact, after earning his bachelor's degree summa cum laude, he managed to earn his law degree magna cum laude while serving as the editor of the Harvard Law Review. Following graduation, Judge Roberts earned a clerkship on the Supreme Court for the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  Since that time, Judge Roberts has had a long and distinguished career of service to this country, including serving as an attorney in the Office of the Solicitor General. Most recently, he served as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, widely considered the second most powerful court in the Nation. During his service on the court, he has been consistent and fair.  Judge Roberts has also been a private practice attorney representing the full range of clients before the Supreme Court. He has argued before the Supreme Court 39 times, an impressive record even if you do not consider the fact that his client prevailed in 25 of those cases. In fact, Judge Roberts is widely considered by his colleagues to be one of the most accomplished attorneys to argue before the Supreme Court.  For some time I have been concerned that our judiciary was being overwhelmed by activist judges who attempt to legislate from the bench.
