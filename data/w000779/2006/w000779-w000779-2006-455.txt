President, I thank, particularly, the distinguished Senator from Montana, who is on the floor, Mr. Baucus, and Senator Grassley, for working very closely with me on this issue because I think this illustrates something the Senate is going to have to tackle aggressively in the days ahead. This, at least, makes a modest step in the right direction.  At a time when the oil companies have been making record profits and often charging record prices at the pump, it does not seem, to me, they ought to be receiving record subsidies from the taxpayers.  What this amendment does--and this would mean for the first time in, as far as I can tell, 20 years--the Congress would actually be rolling back a subsidy to the oil industry. This would limit one of the new tax breaks that the major oil companies received in last year's Energy bill.
