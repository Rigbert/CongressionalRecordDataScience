 President, let me again thank Senator Hatfield for his understanding in the offsets of this bill, with our amendment that strikes the portion of section 13 that is found on page 27. We have made an adjustment.  If this amendment is agreed to, and I hope it is, we will continue to work with Senator Hatfield and others in conference to assure that this amendment is properly taken care of.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
