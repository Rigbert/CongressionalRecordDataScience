 President, I oppose this amendment because it sets up a double standard which lets below median-income bankrupts load up on debt on the eve of bankruptcy and then get those debts wiped away without judicial scrutiny. I know the Senator from New York is well-intentioned, but this amendment is a very bad idea.  Last night, the Senator from New York, in proposing his amendment, correctly noted that there is no evidence whatever that below median-income debtors could ever pay a significant amount of their debts. We have taken care of the problem the Senator from New York has raised by totally exempting below median-income debtors from the means test. I think that is fair and reasonable. It is a fact of life. It means the poor won't be forced into repayment plans they could never complete.  However, this amendment raises an entirely different question. This amendment isn't about whether the poor should be given a pass in terms of being forced to repay their debts. This amendment says people below the median income can purchase over $1,000 in luxury goods, such as Gucci loafers, and get over $1,000 in cash advances just minutes before declaring bankruptcy and they won't have to justify their debts to a bankruptcy judge.  This is not good bankruptcy policy. Anybody who loads up on debt on the eve of bankruptcy should have to justify their debts. When it comes to suspicious and perhaps fraudulent behavior, we should treat everyone the same, below median income or above median income. Anybody who loads up on debt right before filing for bankruptcy should have to explain themselves; otherwise, we open the door to an obvious abuse.  Last week, we defeated the Dodd amendment which contained very similar provisions. I ask my colleagues to defeat this amendment.
