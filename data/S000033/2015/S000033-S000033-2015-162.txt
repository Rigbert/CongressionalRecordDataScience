 President, if Senator Cornyn wishes to bring a proposal that has 2 years of free community college to the floor, which is in the President's budget, I invite my friend to do that.  Is the Senator from Texas up for that?  If Senator Cornyn wants to bring a proposal to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, which is in the President's budget, I invite my friend to do that.  Will the Senator from Texas introduce that?
