 President, I rise, for Senator Boxer and myself, to introduce legislation that amends the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to allow the Federal Government to transfer to State and local governments surplus Federal property for use for law enforcement or public safety purposes. This bill expands current authority which restricts this type of property transfer to State and local governments for use only as correctional facilities.  Our law enforcement and public safety officials need the flexibility that this legislation provides. While continuing to allow prisons to be built, this legislation provides communities with the options they need to establish or expand needed law enforcement training facilities, fire fighting academies, and the like given an area's particular need.  The one thing communities need after a military base closure is the flexibility to reuse bases to fulfill their greatest local needs. This bill will continue to facilitate the successful reuse of base realignment and closure sites, like March Air Force Base in California, for civilian and public safety purposes. Fighting crime continues to be a top priority for communities throughout the Nation. It makes sense to allow communities to put former military bases to use in that fight.  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation. Our communities affected by base closures deserve all options to facilitate successful reuse.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 203       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER SURPLUS PROPERTY FOR USE FOR                    LAW ENFORCEMENT OR PUBLIC SAFETY PURPOSES.       (a) In General.--Section 203(p)(1) of the Federal Property      and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(p)(1))      is amended by striking ``required'' and all that follows      through ``offenders as'' and inserting ``needed for use by      the transferee or grantee for a law enforcement or public      safety purpose''.       (b) Application of Law to Prior Transfers and      Conveyances.--Section 203(p) of the Federal Property and      Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(p)) is      amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(4) Any real or related personal property transferred or      conveyed under this subsection before the date of the      enactment of this paragraph may, with the approval of the      Attorney General, be used for a law enforcement or public      safety purpose.''.                                 ______                                    By
