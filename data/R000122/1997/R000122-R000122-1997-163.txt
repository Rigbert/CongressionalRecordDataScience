President, I rise today to commend a fellow Rhode Islander and friend, Dr. Vartan Gregorian. On January 6, Dr. Gregorian announced that he will leave his post as president of Brown University in Providence, RI, to become President of the Carnegie Corp. After 9 years on College Hill, he leaves behind a flourishing campus and community. Brown has more than doubled its endowment during his tenure. An ambitious capital campaign has raised over $500 million under Dr. Gregorian's leadership, and he has brought 275 new faculty members to Brown, including 72 new professors.  But, Mr. President, the true measure of Vartan Gregorian is not his skill as an administrator, booster, and fund raiser, it is his passion for teaching and learning. Even in the midst of the demands of his presidency, he has managed to find time to continue to teach, and I understand that he also continues to serve as an advisor for several fortunate students. In this regard, he is unique among his peers, and they recognize his prodigious efforts. James Freedman, president of Dartmouth, said of Dr. Gregorian, ``He communicates the joy of learning.''  Vartan Gregorian's interest in education is not limited to Brown or to other institutions of higher learning. He is deeply concerned about the condition of the Nation's public schools. As his colleague, Theodore Sizer, said recently, ``No Ivy League president has put his shoulder to the wheel of public education more than Vartan Gregorian.''  Last month, Dr. Gregorian wrote an article in Parade magazine entitled ``10 Things You Can Do to Make Our Schools Better.'' Mr. President, I commend this article to my colleagues, and I hope all Senators read and benefit from Dr. Gregorian's observations, particularly that it is everyone's job to help improve our public schools. Mr. President, I ask that Dr. Gregorian's article be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Mr. President, no matter where he has gone, Vartan Gregorian has taken his appreciation for education and left behind him successful institutions and inspired students. Brown, Providence, and Rhode Island will miss him, but we know he will stay in close touch and that he will continue to lead at his new post at the Carnegie Corp. We wish him well.  The article follows:            10 Things You Can Do To Make Our Schools Better                         (By Vartan Gregorian)       When I was invited by Parade to write an article about      improving our public educational system, I thought for a      moment of titling it ``In Praise of Public School Teachers.''      This is because, while our schools badly need reform and      upgrading, the responsibility for their problems cannot      simply be dumped on our teachers, who by and large are a      dedicated, hardworking and undervalued corps of      professionals.       In fact, even as we acknowledge that our public schools      need help, we ought to recognize their achievements and      successes along with their shortcomings. They face problems      that reflect those of our entire society, and they have to      contend with burdens and restrictions that don't affect most      of the private and parochial schools with which they     are sometimes unfairly compared. Nevertheless, our public      schools should be better--much better--than they are, and      improving them is a job for everyone from parents to college      presidents.       What are some of the things that you, as a concerned      individual, can do right now to better the schools and the      educational process in your own area? Here are 10 practical      steps you can take in this direction.       1. Visit your schools. It's not enough for parents to go      once or twice a year for PTA meetings. I'd like to see      schools make it easier for parents to visit regularly, even      holding weekend and evening open houses for parents who can't      get there during their working hours.       2. Involve the grandparents. This is especially important      in cases of single parents.       3. Make the public school a magnet for the community. Hold      social and community functions in school buildings.       4. Volunteer to help in your school. When rules permit,      parents or others should offer to take over nonteaching jobs,      such as hall monitors or cafeteria supervisors. Teachers      should be treated as professionals whose job is teaching.       5. Read to your children. Nothing is more important than      this. Start your children with nursery rhymes and go on from      there.       6. Give every schoolchild a library card. When I was      president of the New York Public Library, we arranged with      Mayor Ed Koch to give one million library cards to the city's      schoolchildren. We found that the majority of them were put      to good use. Every town library should issue a card to each      child in the community.       7. Organize and attend shows that the children put on. They      encourage children to work together and also serve as a bond      with the community.       8. Recognize that too much television has a terrible      effect. Consider making television a chore rather than an      amusement. Let children watch four hours a day if they want      to, but require them to write papers on what they see. My      objection to television is not only the time it wastes but      also the passivity it brings. It produces isolation, not      communication. If children had to critique what they watched,      it might even serve to reduce the violence on the screen.       9. Let our children go. Schools should take children on      expeditions, and not just to a museum or zoo. Business and      civic leaders could invite whole classes to visit workplaces      for a day--banks, hospitals, universities, factories, police      stations, places of worship, government offices.       10. Restore the arts as a major element in education. We've      made a tremendous mistake in diminishing or eliminating art,      music and dance as fluff or frills. The arts like sports,      play a vital role in bringing students together and promoting      teamwork. Athletics provide stability and a way to release      energy. The arts allow children to develop creativity and      imagination. The Duke Ellington School in Washington, D.C.,      has one of the lowest dropout rates anywhere. Ninety percent      of the participants in The Boys Choir of Harlem go to college      following high school. It's almost impossible to      overemphasize the significance of the creative arts in      education. Make sure that your own school district recognizes      this.       An important challenge faced by today's schools that didn't      exist in the past is the changed expectations of the public.      Today, it is assumed that almost everybody has to go to      college. A university education is regarded more as a      necessity than as something extraordinary. And we glamorize      the past. The 1930s and '40s had high dropout rates too, but      fewer people then were deeply concerned about that. American      society has changed and raised its expectations of what an      educational system should provide.       How can we meet those expectations? The core of the      teaching process is, and always will be, the teacher. I      believe that to become a teacher is to join a noble      profession. Teachers have an awesome responsibility: We      entrust our sons and daughters to teachers to help prepare      them for life. Yet too often teachers are held in low esteem.      We pay them less than we pay plumbers and mechanics, and we      complain about them more readily. As I have suggested,      teachers today are not just teachers--they're called upon to      be supervisors, custodians, counselors, hall and cafeteria      monitors, law and order officers. Despite all this, thousands      and thousands of men and women are public school teachers      because they are dedicated people.       Are teachers' unions part of the solution? Yes. They are      interested in the economic aspects of teaching, and they      should be. But they have a moral; professional and historical      obligation to help rescue and reform our public schools. The      burnout rate among teachers in our nation's public schools is      very high. Unions should join in an effort to allow teachers      to be retrained, re-educated and immersed in the very      disciplines in which they need renewal so they can further      the horizons of education and knowledge.       There is a great need for strengthening the schools of      education in our colleges and universities, so we can raise      our standards of teaching. This is something in which college      presidents can play a part, for too often the school of      education is not regarded as highly as the rest of the      university. The arts and science faculties in many      universities have no close affinity with the schools of      education. Schools of education often stress the technique      rather than the substance of the subject matter. We really      need to rethink our teacher-education and teacher-retraining      programs.       I don't agree with those who feel that school vouchers are      a panacea for our educational ills. Vouchers may solve      individual problems, but not society's. Choice is meaningless      for the millions of Americans who live in rural areas with      few schools. Choice between bad schools is not useful to city      dwellers.       Parents who want their children to attend private schools      learn quickly that parents don't choose private schools--     private schools choose children. I have a drastic solution      for a school that is bad: Shut it down. We don't allow a bad      hospital to function: why should we allow a bad school?       A national consensus exists on the need for school reform.      According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll taken just      before the election, four in 10 voters said education should      be one of the next President's two top priorities. It ranked      evenly with keeping the economy healthy as the No. 1 concern.      During the last decade, there has been a nationwide movement      for school reform, and there is a major national effort now      being made to bring this about--the Annenberg Challenge,      which deserves to be widely recognized.       The Annenberg Challenge is a metaphor for change in our      schools. It was launched in 1993 with a five-year, $500      million grant by Walter Annenberg, our former ambassador to      Great Britain. Since it was a 2-for-1 matching challenge, the      total amount will reach $1.5 billion, the largest such grant      ever made to American public education. The Annenberg      Challenge is not for budget relief; it is for enhancement. A      full 90 percent must go to teaching and to the classroom,      with only 10 percent to be spent on overhead.       The Annenberg Challenge operates on a variety of fronts. It      includes grants to some of the nation's largest urban school      systems, a rural schools initiative and an arts initiative,      as well as aid to such organizations as the New American      Schools Development Corporation, the Education Commission of      the States and the Annenberg Institute of School Reform to      carry forward their respective programs.       Wherever it has been put in operation, the Annenberg      Challenge has required a cooperative effort by the school      boards, labor leaders and legislators, as well as corporate      and foundation executives. In New York City, Chicago,      Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit and other localities where      the Challenge now functions, I actually have witnessed the      encouraging phenomenon of such groups working together to      produce results. As of now, some 4500 schools throughout the      country are benefiting from the program. The Annenberg      Challenge money itself will not reform the entire system, but      it has created laboratories for change.       So I am optimistic about the possibilities of improving our      schools. As a college president, especially, I know how      important it is that we do so, for I do not want to see our      universities turn into remedial schools. The superstructure      cannot stand without a healthy infrastructure. When the      Titanic sinks, you cannot say, ``I was traveling first      class.'' We all are our future's guardians, and our future is      our children.                          ____________________
