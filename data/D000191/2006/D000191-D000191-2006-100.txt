For the most part, they are political. In the case of the Biscuit fire, the professional managers developed a plan that would have yielded somewhere around 175 million boardfeet of salvage.  The administration, in an election year, said that is not enough, we want a lot more. They pulled that plan. They came back with another plan, much bigger numbers, but they haven't even harvested half of the original proposal, which was virtually noncontroversial. So in response, unfortunately, instead of prescribing a professional management in the future that is site specific, that mandates things, we are providing even more discretion to political appointees with this legislation.  As I said to some folks from the timber industry in my district, you may think it is a great bill with Mark Ray down there and George Bush at the White House. But what if the Clintons come back? They said, ``Oh my God, that would be horrible.''  So if you give total discretion to salvage or not salvage, if you fill the bill with mays and mays and mays, which it does, for instance, the point was made as I came to the floor, I have been involved in other committee work, that they are mandating science. Well, actually, no; on page 14 it says ``may,'' the Secretary may conduct one or more catastrophic event research projects.  The bill is rife with discretion for political appointees. We need professional management and certainty. This bill won't get us there.
