 President, I am very pleased to join my chairman, Senator Hutchison, in recommending the 2006 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and related agencies appropriations bill to the Senate. I thank Senators Cochran and Byrd for their leadership and assistance in guiding this bill through the committee and to the floor.  I very much appreciate the support of our leaders in allowing us to take up this bill at this time before we have completed action on the Defense authorization or appropriations bills. I recognize this is not the normal order of business. With the clock running and a large amount of unfinished business facing the Senate, it is imperative we press on with these bills as quickly as possible.  With one disastrous hurricane behind us and another bearing down on Texas, we all recognize there is no time to dawdle. We face enormous challenges with these hurricanes. Both Senator Hutchison and I hope and pray it will not bring another measure of devastation on our coastal States. My heart goes out to my chairman, Senator Hutchison, to her people, our people, in the State of Texas. I hope we can move this bill quickly so she can return to Texas later today to help her constituents prepare for the onslaught of the storm.  I want the Senator to know all on this side wish you and your people Godspeed. I hope it does not hit as hard as it looks like it might.
