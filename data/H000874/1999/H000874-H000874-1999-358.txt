Speaker, I rise today to bring to the attention of this House most disturbing developments in Russia. Anti-Semitism rears its ugly head in public statements blaming Russia's current problems on the ``Yids''--statements not being made by neo-Nazi organizations or fringe groups, but rather by members of the Russian parliament.  In November and December of last year, two prominent Communist Party members of the Duma, Albert Makashob and Viktor Ilyukhin, blamed ``the Yids'' and president Yeltsin's ``Jewish Entourage'' for Russia's current problems. Duma Defense Committee Member Ilyukhin alleged that President Yeltsin had committed ``genocide against the Russian people'' with the help of Jewish advisors. Equally as disturbing is the fact that the chairman of the Communist Party did not rebuke his party members for their actions, rather, he made excuses for their remarks.  Sadly, Mr. Makashov continues on his rabid crusade. I have received reports that on February 22, while addressing a meeting of Cossacks in the southern Rostov region of Russia, Duma Deputy Makashov declared that an organization which he heads, the Movement in Support of the Army, was really the ``Movement against the Yids,'' and called Jews ``impudent and repulsive people.''  In December of last year, Curt Weldon, myself and others met with our colleagues in the Duma and expressed our great dismay about the anti-Semitic statements. In fact, many members of the Duma, as well as President Yeltsin, have condemned Makashov and Ilyukhin. Unfortunately, many Members have simply made excuses. What kind of message does this send to the Russian people at such a critical time?  Mr. Speaker, these comments by leaders of the Russian people are despicable and must be condemned. I have joined with Chairman Chris Smith and other members of the Helsinki Commission in introducing H. Con. Res. 37, which does exactly that, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, looking for scapegoats will not resolve Russia's current crisis. More importantly, the promotion of hatred, anti-Semitism and xenophobia will not further the development of a peaceful, just and prosperous society for the Russian people. Democracy is not built on racism.                          ____________________
