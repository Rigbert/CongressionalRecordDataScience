 Since I am the only working family farmer in the Senate, I think it's important that I point out the biggest problems with the agriculture spending we are considering.  The first problem that I see involves the section on commodity purchases. This section has been described by the chairman as a list of agriculture commodities which have experienced low prices in the 2000 or 2001 crop year. Due to what has been described as an ``economic shortfall'' experienced by these commodities the chairman would like to institute a short-term purchase program.  In the past, when I sat on the Agriculture Committee, we did provide short-term relief for specific commodities. But before we provided that relief and spent tax dollars we justified that spending by reviewing economic data which defined the problems specific commodities were experiencing.  I know that the Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations has also worked on similar assistance packages, and I would bet my farm on the fact that they also justify the cost by reviewing the loss.  My point is that if we are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on these commodities, doesn't theother side need to at least show us the data that led them to include these commodities? I am the ranking member on the committee, and I have not heard from one farmer in America that this is needed. Let us start this discussion as any committee with jurisdiction over this issue would. Show us the average price of these commodities and what percentage of loss they have experienced. At least show us when and where the loss occurred.  While we are talking about where, where are these commodities located? Specifically, which regions of the country benefit from this section. We would have asked this question in the Agriculture Committee, why is no one asking it now? Where are these commodities being produced?  For instance, where is the majority of bison slaughtered? I did a little research and found that one cooperative in North Dakota processes over 60 percent of America's bison meat. In fact, this facility, is the world's first processing plant devoted exclusively to bison meat.  I am not trying to tell everyone that there might not be a need for us to purchase bison meat. Who knows, maybe the Senators from North Dakota can show us that there is a real need for bison to receive some sort of assistance. But, under this bill, even billionaires who dabble in bison ranching will get taxpayer assistance.  What I am trying to demonstrate is that this isn't the committee of jurisdiction for USDA programs and if the Democrats want to give the Finance Committee jurisdiction over USDA because the Agriculture Committee cannot handle its own workload, we should review this as the Agriculture Committee should, or as any committee should review an issue before spending American tax dollars.  The second problem I see is the re-establishment of the Natural Disaster Program. Under this program, producers are compensated if their crop losses are more than 35 percent of historic yields. We enacted this program last year to help farmers deal while we were getting the Agriculture Risk Protection Act up to speed. For those of you who do not remember, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act was the crop insurance bill we spent $8 billion taxpayer dollars on to avoid this specific scenario.  Congress allocated $8 billion dedicated to getting the government out of the disaster business by making crop insurance more affordable. The chairman would lilke to reinstitute a program that compensates producers if their yields fall off. Sounds a lot like crop insurance to me.  Why are we tyring to provide payments to producers who have chosen not to buy insurance? I can see why we did this in the past, but now that the law is in place the U.S. government is subsiding the cost of insurance on wheat at about 55 percent for the family farmer.  The message we will be sending is, ``there is no need to take care of your own risk, Uncle Sam will help you cover your losses. And in turn you punish the family farmers who bought insurance to manage their own risk.  I know that under this program there is a small premium for producers who carry insurance, but this program does not allow more than the worth of the crop. So, if the farmer has insurance that covers his loss, he does not get much out of this program.  It looks like to me we are questioning the policy established in the crop insurance law that the majority of us supported. Isn't this really a question that should be debated at length? Shouldn't the long-term ramifications of this decision at least be considered?  How do we tell farmers to follow the direction established in the crop insurance law and manage their own risk by purchasing affordable insurance tools while we are rewarding those that have chosen to save their money and take on more risk by not purchasing crop insurance?  If the Finance Committee is now the committee of jurisdiction for crop insurance, I think these questions should be addressed.  The third point I want to bring up is the $3 billion to clear the ``backlog'' of Rural Development loan and grant applications at USDA. I realize that this is now being deleted from the chairman's bill, but the Senate was subjected to this awful policy during the markup and up until today, so I think it is worth mentioning.  When I read that provision for the first time my first though was, ``How important is it to clear the backlog at Rural Development quickly?''  The reason I ask this question is due to the fact that the legislation required funds be made available only after the next fiscal year 2002 Ag. Appropriation funds had been exhausted.  Don't we usually provide enough funds based on the need and ability of USDA to process the applications during the next fiscal year?  Under the chairman's proposal, we would have had to first spend the fiscal year 2002 allocation before we used this new money. How many new jobs would this money have created in six months? Not many if we didn't run out of fiscal year 2002 funds until August or September.  It is sad that the press had to inform the other side how poor this idea was instead of the Republicans and Democrats working together because I guarantee you, if anyone on the Democratic side of the aisle had asked me I would have pointed this out immediately. This was terrible policy.  Just to let everyone know, I contacted USDA about the provision the Democrats pulled and they told me that if those funds had been made available USDA would have needed an extra $100 million in salaries and expenses to get all of the possible loans and grants out the door within a year.  My final point is that if this amendment had been successful we would have been asking a mission area of USDA to engage in the single largest expansion of any mission in years, and to do so without an undersecretary.  In summary, the Senate Agriculture Committee seems to be unable to manage its own business so I guess it is trying to ``pass the buck'' to the Finance Committee. These are not light-hearted issues and the impact of these provisions will affect both short and long term policy considerations and precedents.  Madam President, I'd like to take a few minutes to respond to remarks made earlier today by our distinguished majority leader. The majority leader criticized three of the four proposals in the Senate Republican Caucus' stimulus proposal.  The three proposals the majority leader criticized are: one, the acceleration of the marginal tax rate cuts from the bipartisan tax relief package enacted earlier this year; two, the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax; and three, the 30 percent bonus depreciation.  I would like to address his general criticisms of the proposals. Senator Daschle made the following points: one, the proposals were the same old ``leftover'' tax cut proposals; two, that Senate Republicans were using the September 11 events to push ``ideological'' measures; and three, that these proposals had been ``unanimously'' rejected by economists, editors, governors, and others.  I will respond to these general criticisms one by one.  On the first one, the ``leftover'' argument, I would like to point out that, with the exception of the marginal rate acceleration, none of these proposals were included in any tax cut bill considered by the House or Senate for this year or last year for that matter. As a matter of fact, bonus depreciation has not been on the table for nearly a decade. These proposals arose subsequent to September 11 as a response to the major economic problem of declining business investment. So let us not characterize these proposals as leftovers.  Let us go to the ``ideological'' point. Again, with the exception of the marginal rate acceleration, these proposals were not Republican agenda items. I ask: Does anyone recall signs at the Republican Convention with ``bonus depreciation'' or corporate AMT relief?  This charge was coupled with an allegation that Republican Senators were using the events of September 11 to advance these so-called ideological proposals. Of course, these proposals were specifically designed to respond to the economic downturn. Indeed, in a gesture of bipartisanship that has not been reciprocated, Republicans, led by the President, put on the table a proposal that certainly cannot be called a Republican priority, a supplemental rebate. In another gesture of bipartisanship, again with no reciprocation bythe Democratic Leadership, Republicans, led by President Bush, took off the table, an arguably stimulative proposal, capital gains tax cuts.  Actions speak louder than words.  I agree with one part of the majority leader's statement. That is, neither side should use the events of September 11 to advance ideological objectives.  I have pointed out two significant examples of Republicans acting in anti-ideological manner. Where in the Democratic caucus proposal, or Democratic leadership's actions, have we seen similar anti-ideological behavior?  Indeed, it appears that the events of September 11 are being used as another ``salami slice'' tactic to get to a Democratic ideological objective. That objective is a Government-run universal health care system. Just take a look at the new COBRA entitlement, labeled as temporary here.  Now, I would like to address the majority leader's third general criticism. That criticism is that economists and editors have unanimously rejected the Senate Republican caucus stimulus proposal.  I guess if you only include some economists that have served in Democratic administrations or some editors that identify themselves with the Democratic agenda, then I would agree with the majority leader. For instance, much is made of Joseph Stiglitz's criticisms. There is a lot of talk about his Nobel Prize, but you do not hear that he chaired the Council of Economic Advisors in the Clinton Administration. I guarantee there are Nobel Prize winners who worked in Republican administrations who would not agree with Joseph Stiglitz. In fact, they would have problems with the Democratic package.  As an example of the diversity of opinion, you only have to review the statements of Glen Hubbard, the current chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisors.  The charge that economists have ``unanimously'' rejected the Senate Republican caucus stimulus package is not borne out by the facts.  With respect to the charge that editors and opinion writers have `'unanimously'' rejected, I would like to print in the Record a couple of articles. One is an article by Kevin Hassett, who was a witness before the Senate Budget Committee. Another is an article from National Review. These are only two of many articles that show that there is support for elements of the Republican causus position. In addition, even the Governors' letter cited by the majority leader does not reject the Senate Republican caucus stimulus package. I also ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an editorial from the Washington Post, that is highly critical of the Finance Committee's stimulus bill, by pointing out that high-priced lobbyists help put the Democratic bill together.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, Nov. 7, 2001]                            A Silver Lining                         (By Kevin A. Hassett)       The U.S. Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point rate cut Tuesday      came in response to a flurry of extremely negative economic      reports and increasingly widespread pessimism about the      American economy. As the federal funds rate nears zero, many      observers believe that there is little room for further      significant interest rate reductions. With the economy still      declining and the Fed out of ammunition, additional      government stimulus must now be of the fiscal variety.       Corporate tax cuts are a natural fiscal stimulus candidate.      The corporate sector has dropped the sharpest this year, and      business investment has historically responded impressively      to tax cuts. Yet U.S. Senate Democrats have staunchly opposed      Republican efforts to provide corporate tax relief. ``I'm not      even enamored any longer with the word stimulus,'' said      Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle last week, preferring      instead to launch a giant government spending spree. Such      measures reflect the emerging Democratic view that the ``Bush      economy'' is nearing depression, and only a New Deal can save      it.       But if you look closely, things aren't that bad. Marginal      tax-rate cuts might well have difficulty stimulating business      activity if there is significant excess capacity. But the      data don't support such a negative view. Indeed, despite      rumors to the contrary, the American economy was most likely      not in a recession on Sept. 10. The monetary and fiscal      stimulus adopted earlier in the year appears to have done its      job quite well.       That positive news emerged last week when the U.S. Commerce      Department reported that the gross domestic product declined      0.4 percent in the third quarter. Negative GDP growth is a      strong sign of a recession, but analysis of the background      data suggests that the number would have been comfortably      positive absent the attack. First, before the attack, chain-     store sales indicated that consumer spending in September was      at about the same healthy level posted in August. Second,      border closings created turmoil in the auto sector, where      just-in-time inventory techniques led to significant      production interruptions.       It is a simple adding-up exercise to correct for these two      factors, and doing so leads to a surprising conclusion. If      September consumption had continued at the pace registered at      the start of the month and auto production had not jammed up,      the economy would have dodged recession in the third quarter.      GDP would have been more than a percentage point higher--     safely nestled in positive territory.       Although that did not happen, it does put to rest the view      that the terrorist attacks pushed an already devastated Bush      economy into a steep downward spiral. The economy was doing      better than expected, and this was likely because of well-     timed economic policy. Consumer spending has been      particularly strong in interest-sensitive sectors.       Another bit of positive news lurking in the third-quarter      data confirms the view that business tax cuts in particular      could be effective now. The government data available do not      explicitly report third-quarter productivity, but it is      possible to figure this out by using techniques that are also      relied upon by Fed economists (and undoubtedly reported to      board members Tuesday).       These calculations are striking. Even with the sharp      declines in output that occurred at the end of the third      quarter, productivity increased by more than two percentage      points. As economic data watching goes, that remarkable      observation is as good as it gets.       Historically, productivity has almost always declined      sharply just before a recession and softened further during a      recession. This ``procyclical productivity'' pattern is so      reliable that an entire literature exists exploring its      cause. The current consensus appears to be that productivity      drops near recessions because firms are reluctant to lay off      idle workers when demand shrinks, and the proportion of      workers that are not productive increases sharply. Perhaps      that describes the past, but it has not happened this time.      High-tech investments have allowed firms to adjust on the fly      and continue to squeeze more output out of fewer inputs.       In February, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan marveled at the      strong productivity numbers posted in late 2000 when the      economy was softening. The increase was, he remarked in a      Senate Banking Committee hearing, ``at a pace sufficiently      impressive to provide strong support for the view that the      rate of growth of structural productivity remains well above      its pace of a decade ago.'' It's important to note that this      high rate of productivity has continued over the past few      quarters, even as the economy has softened.       Why is this so important? If productivity were declining,      then firms would be faced with many more painful decisions in      coming months. Capital investments that were intended to      improve the bottom line would have failed. Should plants then      be closed? As it is, it looks like the inventory and      investment corrections that occurred in the 12 months before      Sept. 11 had achieved their desired effects. The      ``overhangs'' that presage sharp economic disruptions were      not apparent in the data, and a healthy response to marginal      tax-rate reductions is quite plausible.       But, of course, other factors are present. And they help to      explain why, despite the good news, economic activity has      dropped so sharply.       After years of highly mathematical research in dusty      journals, many economists now believe that the root cause      lies in the distinction between risk and ambiguity that was      first described by University of Chicago economist Frank      Knight in the 1920s. Knight argued that there is a difference      between a circumstance with known probabilities--like a coin      flip--and a situation with high ambiguity, where the      probabilities of different outcomes are not known.      Subsequently, researchers have confirmed Knight's observation      both in theory and with observation.       There are profound differences in behavior when people face      the two different types of uncertainty. Most important, when      ambiguity is high, consumers and firms often act as if the      worst possible outcome will occur for sure. Thus, after the      terrorists attacked, the U.S. entered an ambiguous world with      many horrible possibilities and no probabilities.      Predictably, businesses and consumers assumed that a deep      recession would occur with certainty. Their extremely      cautious response to the assumption helped make the recession      more likely.       So the core fundamentals of the economy remain surprisingly      strong. If there is a recession, it will have been caused by      the terrorist attacks. Therein lies both the hope and the      challenge to policy makers. Absent a rapid and clearly      visible victory in the war on terrorism, consumers and firms      will only gradually return to normal, and a long and deep      recession is possible. Yet the underlying strengths suggest      that there is ample opportunity, and that corporate tax cuts      could ignite further productivity enhancing investments. The      stimulus bill that passed the U.S.     House of Representatives took a step in that direction. It's      time that the Senate stop bickering and do the House one      better.                                  ____                 [From the NRO Financial, Nov. 8, 2001]                     The New Dance of the Crackpots                             (By John Hood)       In this indispensable guide to the New Deal, The Roosevelt      Myth, journalist John T. Flynn wrote about the pivotal couple      of years leading up to the 1936 presidential election.      Roosevelt's early efforts had failed to bring the country out      of depression, and so a bewildering array of left-wing      politicians and journalists offered their own strategies for      getting the economy moving again. It was, in Flynn's      picturesque words, ``The Dance of the Crackpots.''       Its main result was to shove FDR further to the left. His      administration created new credit and spending programs to      steal the thunder of Huey Long and other radicals, and to      induce an artificial inflationary spurt in activity just      before the election--a winning political strategy that      nonetheless resulted in another painful recession in 1937-     '38.       As American battles international terrorism and a slowing      economy, we are now witnessing a new Dance of the Crackpots.      Denigrating President Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut enacted by      Congress earlier this year, critics are coming out of the      woodwork to offer increasingly silly and outdated proposals      to ``stimulate demand'' and ``escape the liquidity trap.''      While draped in New Economy language, these ideas are      basically the same old Keynesian claptrap that the crackpots      of the 1930s indulged in--although, unlike present-day      advocates, the 1930s crackpots had the excuse that most of      their pet ideas had yet to be proven false through      experience.       On prominent exponent of the new (old) philosophy is Robert      Rubin, Clinton's former Treasury Secretary. Advising the      Congress on how to fashion a ``bipartisan'' stimulus package,      Rubin recommended a focus on spending programs and tax      credits directed to poor Americans. ``People at the bottom of      the income scale spend all the money they earn,'' he      reportedly told congressional leaders. ``If you give it to      them, they're going to spend it. If you give it to me, it's      not going to affect my spending patterns.''       Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter made a similar point in a      column criticizing supply-side tax cuts suggested by House      Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas. Armey ``claims to be an      economist,'' Alter sneered. ``But he obviously never learned      about a little concept familiar to every college freshmen      called `supply and demand.' Our supply--or capacity--is just      fine right now; in fact, we've got too much of it. The      problem is consumer demand. It's dangerously flat.''       According to Rubin and his journalistic echo chamber,      government stimulus is needed because Americans aren't      spending enough. This statement is absurd. To say that      Americans aren't spending ``enough'' is to presuppose that      there is some level of spending that is correct, and that      government officials can know such a level. Furthermore, such      a singular focus on broad abstractions like ``supply'' and      ``demand'' leaves these hapless pump-primers without a      connection to the real economy of individual goods and      services exchanged by individual human beings.       It is simply nonsensical to talk about the economy in only      aggregate terms. For example, there was a great deal of      excess capacity in America's buggy-whip manufacturing sector      in the early 20th century. Was that a sign of inadequate      consumer spending? Of course not. It was a sign that      Americans were changing their consumer patterns in response      to changes in technology. When households reduce their      spending on consumer goods, opting instead to pay down debt      or accumulate savings, they aren't failing to buy ``enough''      stuff to keep the economy afloat. They are simply changing      their preferences in favor of future consumption (perhaps of      more expensive, more capital-intensive durable goods) and      away from some goods currently being produced.       Contrary to the crackpot theories of Rubin, Alter, New York      Times columnist Paul Krugman, and other neo-Keynesians,      recessions don't signify ``too much supply and not enough      demand.'' Recessions aren't creatures of human irrationality.      They signify a mismatch between what companies are making and      what their customer actually want at the time. Moreover, they      often signify a mismatch of time preferences, as consumers      signal (through more savings) that they are willing to      finance new investment today in order to buy something they      value more in the future. As long as capital markets are free      to coordinate the interests of producers and consumers, the      latter's increased savings will increase the pool of loanable      funds and thus encourage entrepreneurs (with lower interest      rates) to pursue new investments to satisfy consumer demands.       In other words, it is perfectly rational in a time of      recession for the government to focus its fiscal policy on      removing barriers to investment. These barriers include large      inflationary or deflationary changes in money (because these      destroy the ability of interest rates to communicate time      preferences accurately to entrepreneurs) and excessive taxes      on investment activities. The U.S. tax code retains a strong      and counterproductive bias against savings and investment, so      proposals to accelerate depreciation, reduce marginal tax      rates on capital gains, and reduce double-taxation of      corporate dividends are exactly the right medicine if the      goal is to speed the recovery of the American economy.       The answer to ``excess capacity'' in buggy-whip      manufacturing was not for the government to stimulate demand      for buggy whips. It was to allow industry to make needed      investments in automobile production. Similarly, American      consumers are signaling that the current mix of investment is      not generating what they want. So financial, physical, and      human capital must be redirected to new uses. This necessary      adjustment will happen more rapidly, and more successfully,      if Washington will ignore the new Dance of the Crackpots and      gets its fiscal act together.                                  ____               [From The Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2001]                          Meet Patriotic Pork       In normal times, pork-barrel spending is offensive. When      the nation is at war, it's considerably worse. But the      patriotism felt by most citizens since the terrorist attacks      has done nothing to restrain lobbyists' habit of putting      special interests ahead of national interests. Indeed, some      apparently can't tell the difference. Kenneth Kies of      PricewaterhouseCoopers, who has been pushing tax breaks that      would profit clients such as GE and IBM Corp., told The Post      it would have been ``irresponsible'' and even unpatriotic for      him to behave otherwise.       The provision that Mr. Kies advances would reduce taxes on      corporations' overseas investment income. It's hard to see      how this measure, which would encourage firms to keep money      outside the country, would do anything to stimulate the      American economy. Yet, Mr. Kies has sought to include it in      the stimulus package being prepared in the Senate. Meanwhile,      other lobbyists have pressed for equally egregious giveaways.      The stimulus bill that passed through committee last week      includes money for citrus growers and buffalo farmers and      producing electricity from chicken waste. It includes a tax      break on aviation fuel for crop-dusters. A wage credit      designed to encourage firms to hire welfare recipients has      been extended to businesses in lower Manhattan that hire      anyone.       As it fights a war on terrorism, the United States also      faces the threat of a global recession that could be the      worst in years. Thousands of ordinary workers have already      lost their jobs, and many thousands more may do so. The      economic stimulus will succeed only if it pumps money into      the bits of the economy where it will stimulate demand      effectively. That means targeting it at business investment      and at less well-off consumers, not tossing cash at random      supplicants.       The senators who larded the bill in committee ought to feel      ashamed of themselves, but they're not the only ones. It      seems to us that lobbyists such as Mr. Kies and clients such      as General Electric and IBM also bear some responsibility.      Normally in Washington we assume that such corporations will      grasp for whatever they can get; it's up to those in Congress      to resist their more egregious graspings. But do the chairmen      of GE and IBM really want to pursue their narrow self-     interest at a time when everyone else is being asked to think      of the common good--at a time of war? Imagine the stir it      would cause, and the impact it could have, if just one of      them said, ``Better spend the money on the troops. We'll be      back when the war is over.'' It's not too late for them to      show what patriotism might really mean.
