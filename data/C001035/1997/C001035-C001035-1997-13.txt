President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act which is intended to improve the way we care for people at the end of their lives.  Noted health economist Uwe Reinhardt once observed that ``Americans are the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' Advancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled more and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when medical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, patients and their families should not have to fear that the process of dying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care that is inconsistent with their values or wishes.  The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to reexamine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at the end of their lives. Clearly there is more that we can do to relieve suffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide opportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's conclusion.  Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not currently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life care. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on care at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-technology interventions and rescue care. While four out of five Americans say they would prefer to die at home, studies show that almost 80 percent die in institutions where they may be in pain, and where they are subjected to high-technology treatments that merely prolong suffering.  Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study released earlier this month, where a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient dies. The study found that the amount of medical treatment Americans receive in their final months varies tremendously in the different parts of the country, and it concluded that the determination of whether or not an older patient dies in the hospital probably has more to do with the supply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or preference.  The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help us improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of their lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes to the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate discussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions about end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that every Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing facility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the preparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained professional within the institution. The legislation also requires that if a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a prominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and nurses can clearly see it.  The legislation will expand access to effective and appropriate pain medications for Medicare beneficiaries at the end of their lives. Severe pain, including breakthrough pain that defies usual methods of pain control, is one of the most debilitating aspects of terminal illness. However, the only pain medication currently covered by Medicare in an outpatient setting is that which is administered by a portable pump.  It is widely recognized among physicians treating patients with cancer and other life-threatening diseases that self-administered pain medications, including oral drugs and transdermal patches, offer alternatives that are equally effective in controlling pain, more comfortable for the patient, and much less costly than the pump. Therefore, the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act would expand Medicare to cover self-administered pain medications prescribed for the relief of chronic pain in life-threatening diseases or conditions.  In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to study end-of-life issues for Medicare and Medicaid patients and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models for end-of-life care for Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for the hospice benefit, but who still have chronic debilitating and ultimately fatal illnesses. Currently, in order for a Medicare beneficiary to qualify for the hospice benefit, a physician must document that the person has a life expectancy of 6 months or less. With some conditions--like congestive heart failure--it is difficult to project life expectancy with any certainty. However, these patients still need hospice-like services, including advance planning, support services, symptom management, and other services that are not currently available.  Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide consumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-life issues and medical decisionmaking and directs the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to develop a research agenda for the development of quality measures for end-of-life care.  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in light of the current debate on physician-assisted suicide. As the Bangor Daily News pointed out in an editorial published earlier this year, the desire for assisted suicide is generally driven by concerns about the quality of care for the terminally ill; by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of dignity, and emotional strain on family members. Such worries would recede and support for assisted suicide would evaporate if better palliative care and more effective pain management were widely available, and I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be included in the Record.  Mr. President, patients and their families should be able to trust that the care they receive at the end of their lives is not only of high quality,but also that it respects their desires for peace, autonomy, and dignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act that Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today will give us some of the tools that we need to improve care of the dying in this country, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      Life and Death With Dignity       When Maine legislators consider a bill this session on      physician-assisted suicide, they will face a question that      the nation's medical community has been unable to settle      after long debate. Legislators should respect the enormity of      what they are being asked to consider, recognizing that there      are many steps between the current state of caring for the      terminally ill and hastening their deaths.       Even as the Supreme Court last week was considering      constitutional questions surrounding doctor-assisted suicide,      a coalition of 40 health care, religious and retiree groups      gathered in Washington to find a middle ground to this      debate. The coalition--including the American Medical      Association, the American Association of Retired Persons,      B'nai B'rith and the American Cancer Society--argues that the      desire for assisted suicide often is driven by concerns about      the quality of care for the terminally ill. Thoughts of      doctor-assisted suicide, these groups maintain, are brought      about by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of dignity and the      emotional strain on family members, among other reasons.       The coalition suggests that the nation's medical system has      failed to meet the physical and emotional needs of dying      patients. One study from Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York      estimated that 1.6 million terminally ill people a year would      be good candidates for hospice care but only about 350,000      receive it. Why not try to solve these problems before      codifying doctor-assisted suicide?       The Maine legislation, called the Death With Dignity Act,      is narrowly drawn, based on legislative work on a similar      bill from last session. It would allow physicians to assist      in the suicide of a terminally ill person who makes three      oral and one written request to die and has satisfied a      counselor that he or she is capable of making the decision.      The act goes to some lengths to prevent coercion and to allow      the person to back out of the suicide. It is well-crafted and      sensitive legislation. But absent advances in the quality of      care for the terminally ill, it also may be premature.       And despite the safeguards, doubts about who will be      allowed to pursue this process remain. In a friend-of-the-     court brief addressed to the cases being considered by the      Supreme Court, the America Geriatric Society explains the      source of some of these doubts: ``The image of an      independent, capable person thoughtfully evaluating his or      her options, unaffected by biased third parties or other      circumstances . . . is so far from the experience of dying as      to be fanciful. Dying persons are often very weak, prone to      strong emotions and vulnerable to the suggestions,      expectations and guidance of others.''       The medical community has developed wondrous means for      keeping bodies functioning long beyond what could have been      expected even a few years ago, perhaps even longer than is      desirable. The debate over assisted suicide in state after      state demands that physicians go beyond that now in      respecting the humanity and mortality that resides within      those bodies by providing the terminally ill with the      opportunity for less painful, more dignified deaths.                                 ______                                       By
