 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me in fact talk about the intent of this amendment. Because I am the author of the amendment, I know something about its intent. If we had the ability, we would have brought forth limitation amendments to stop the USTR from doing what they are doing. But we could not do that. So the intent here is to transfer $1 million from Commerce to the USTR only for two purposes:  First, to do a much better job of informing all Members of Congress when a formal trade complaint is filed or threatened at the WTO or other international bodies or when entering into new trade agreements which would compel the repeal or changes in our current national, State, local, tribal, territorial, or D.C. laws.  Second, to do a much better job of defending and arguing in support of our existing trade and trade-related laws that are in dispute between the WTO and other international bodies. This is as far as we can go.  Mr. Chairman, I yield my remaining time to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey].
