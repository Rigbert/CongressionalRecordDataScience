Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his leadership in the legislature before. As the gentleman so aptly pointed out, the numbers of abortion come down when even modest restrictions are passed. The law is a great teacher. We are so happy to have the gentleman from Arizona here inthe House, and I know I speak for many of us on the Pro-Life Caucus.  I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga).
