 President, as Chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, I want to point out a provision in the Small Business Job Protection Act relating to trade that I strongly support. That is the extension of the Generalized System of Preferences [GSP]. This extension is long overdue.  The GSP is important for many reasons. From a foreign relations standpoint, it allows the United States to assist the economy of developing countries without the use of direct foreign aid. But it also is of great benefit to American businesses. That is why it is most appropriate that the extension of the GSP be included in the Small Business Job Protection Act. Many American small businesses import raw materials or other products. The expiration of the GSP has forced these companies to pay a duty, or a tax, on some of these products. That's what a duty is: an additional tax.  By extending the GSP retroactively, these companies will not be required to pay this tax. This tax is significant and can cost U.S. businesses hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact in 1995, American businesses saved $650 million due to the GSP. I wonder how many good, high-paying jobs will be created by cutting taxes by $650 million? So, Mr. President, it is very important that the GSP be extended and it is very appropriate that the Senate consider it as part of this bill.  It is essential to remember, however, that since its inception in the Trade Act of 1974, the GSP program has provided for the exemption of ``articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive.'' This is a very important directive and critical to our most import-impacted producing industries. A clear example of an import sensitive article which should not be subject to GSP and, thus, not subject to the annual petitions of foreign producers that can be filed under this program, is ceramic tile.  It is well documented that the U.S. ceramic tile market repeatedly has been recognized as extremely import-sensitive. During the past 30 years, this U.S. industry had to defend itself against a variety of unfair and illegal import practices carried out by some of our closest trading partners. Imports already dominate the U.S. ceramic tile market and have done so for the last decade. They currently provide approximately 60 percent of the largest and most important glazed tile sector according to 1995 year-end Government figures.  Moreover, one of the guiding principles of the GSP program has been reciprocal market access. Currently, GSP eligible beneficiary countries supply almost one-fourth of the U.S. ceramic tile imports, and they are rapidly increasing their sales and market shares. U.S. ceramic tile manufacturers, however, are still denied access to many of these foreign markets.  Also, previous abuses of the GSP eligible status with regard to some ceramic tile product lines have been well documented. In 1979, the USTR rejected various petitions for duty-free treatment of ceramic tile from certain GSP beneficiary countries. With the acquiescence of the U.S. industry, however, the USTR at that time created a duty-free exception for the then minuscule category of irregular edged specialty mosaic tile. Immediately thereafter, I am told that foreign manufacturers from major GSP beneficiary countries either shifted their production to specialty mosaic tile or simply identified their existing products as specialty mosaic tile on custom invoices and stopped paying duties on these products. These actions flooded the U.S.market with duty-free ceramic tiles that apparently had been superficially restyled or mislabeled.  In light of these factors, the U.S. industry has been recognized by successive Congresses and administrations as import-sensitive dating back to the Dillon and Kennedy Rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet during this same period, the American ceramic tile industry has been forced to defend itself from over a dozen petitions filed by various designated GSP-eligible countries seeking duty-free treatment for their ceramic tile sent into this market.  The domestic ceramic tile industry has been fortunate, to date, because both the USTR and the International Trade Commission have recognized the import-sensitivity of the U.S. market and have denied these repeated petitions. If, however, just one petitioning nation ever succeeds in gaining GSP benefits for ceramic tile, then all GSP beneficiary countries will be entitled to similar treatment. This could eliminate many American tile jobs and devastate the domestic industry. Therefore, it is my strong belief that a proven import sensitive and already import-dominated product, such as ceramic tile, should not continually be subjected to defending against repeated duty-free petitions, but should be exempted from the GSP program.  Mr. President, I would like to address one final trade issue. It is not a part of this bill but it does relate to GSP, because the problem I will discuss is a result of an inequitable tax policy put in place by some countries that are major beneficiaries of the GSP program. This tax policy, known as a differential export tax scheme or DET, is used to confer an unfair competitive advantage for these countries' exports of agricultural products, particularly soybean meal and oil, to the detriment of U.S. producers, processors, and exporters.  Mr. President, I'll briefly describe how this differential export tax scheme operates. Under a DET system, exports of a raw commodity, in this case soybeans, are taxed at a higher rate than exports of the processed derivatives of that commodity, soybean meal and oil. Since this increased tax discourages the export of soybeans, the oilseed crushers in those countries are able to purchase soybeans from their domestic growers at prices well below the world market prices paid by U.S. oilseed crushers. Because they pay a lower cost for their raw materials, these foreign crushers are then able to undercut U.S. processors in the world market for processed soybean products.  For example, the State of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil recently changed its tax structure so that a tax of 13 percent is levied on all exports of raw soybeans, while the export tax on soybean meal and oil is only 5 percent. At current market values, this gives the Brazilian crushers an additional crushing margin of about $22 per ton. This is essentially an indirect subsidy for these crushers and significantly distorts free trade. I assume this practice would be subject to World Trade Organization rules if the subsidy were provided as a direct export subsidy.  The consequence of this type of practice is a drastic loss in the U.S. share of world export markets for processed soybean products, and artificial downward pressure on world price levels for these same products. This is not acceptable. As you know Mr. President, Iowa is, in any given year, either the first or second leading soybean producing state in the nation. This is a distinction we share with our neighbors in Illinois. So this unfair trade practice is of great concern to Iowa farmers and processors, and those in other states as well.  I understand that progress is being made on resolving this issue, but more work must be done. In the case of Brazil, it is my understanding that the Brazilian federal government strongly supports reform of this DET system, and in fact is considering the complete elimination of all taxes levied upon exports of agricultural products, both raw and processed. In the coming weeks and months, I will be closely watching how Brazil, Argentina, and other countries reform these practices. However, I am serving notice today that if these practices are allowed to continue, I will consider pursuing appropriate legislative or administrative measures to counter them.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
