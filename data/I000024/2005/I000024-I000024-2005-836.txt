President, before I yield to the Senator from Alaska, I first wish to say how helpful she has been. I know the needs they have in Alaska are unique. She has been very helpful and a great member of our committee. I thank her publicly very much for that.  I think we are making progress now. We have gotten the amendments under control so we can stay on the schedule that has been outlined by the unanimous consent agreement that has been accepted on both sides.  I express my appreciation for everyone cooperating.  I yield the floor.
