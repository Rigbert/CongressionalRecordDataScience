President, I thank the senior Senator from Pennsylvania for his kind words. I have told him privately, and I will say it publicly, he has acted as a chairman should. I have been here 31 years, now going on my 32nd year. I have seen great chairmen in both parties in this institution. I have seen others who were chairmen in both parties.  Senator Specter is in the mold of the great chairmen. He took a very difficult bill, by his own force of will--as he has with others--and kept us together, made sure we had discussions. We went across the political spectrum. We had people who feel very strongly, and rightly so, who had differing views--all distinguished Members of the Senate. He herded them together, kept us together, and kept us in, doing what has been a rarity: the type of Monday session he had to make it work.  I can assure colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, we would not have this bill on the floor, in an ability where the Senate cannot only work its will but do a fine piece of legislation, were it not for Senator Specter. Senator Specter made it possible with his leadership.  Senator Kennedy, on our side, has worked on these issues since before any of us presently on the floor were in the Senate. And with the work of Senators from both sides of the aisle, we have a bill that provides a realistic, a reasonable system for immigration.  We voted in a bipartisan majority. We have seen, over the years, the Judiciary Committee become more polarized. We have seen, in the past couple of years, more and more strongly bipartisan votes. In this case, it was a bipartisan majority with a vote of 12 to 6, with two-thirds of the members of the committee voting in favor of a bill that protects America's borders, strengthens enforcement, and--and this is what is so important--remains true to American values.  The Judiciary Committee has confronted the challenging problem of how to fix our broken immigration system head on. It has sent to the Senate a good product. The committee met six times to debate a proposal offered by the chairman, meeting for long hours and considering dozens of amendments. The debate was substantive. It was civil. It was bipartisan. It was effective. And it was productive.  I might say, had it not been for superb staff on both sides of the aisle, this would not have been possible. I think of the members of my own staff. I would log on sometimes at midnight, when I would get home from other things, and their e-mails were pouring in from the work they had done. I would go back on the e-mails at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, and there were new ones. They were working around the clock.  We were given a deadline of March 27 by the Senate Republican leadership. I understood that the majority leaderhad committed to turn to the committee bill if we were able to meet his deadline and report a bill by Monday night. It was difficult. At times it was a Herculean task that seemed almost the task of Sisyphus. It seemed undoable and the deadline impossible, but under the steady leadership of the chairman, with the hard work and dedication of so many members of the committee--again, I compliment Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts on our side who worked so hard on this--we worked through the long hours and numerous amendments and accomplished what seemed to be the impossible.  When I mention those two Senators, it is not to leave out other Senators. We had so many who brought up amendment after amendment, who worked hard on it, all trying to get a bipartisan bill.  The Judiciary Committee sent this resounding message, as I said, with a bill with a bipartisan vote of 12 to 6, with strong bipartisan support of every key amendment. These were not party-line amendments. These were bipartisan amendments. It is a bill that is strong on enforcement and in some ways stronger than the bill passed by the other body.  It includes a provision added by Senator Feinstein, for example, to make tunneling under our borders a Federal crime. It is tough on employer enforcement. And it is tough on traffickers.  It is also comprehensive and balanced. It confronts the problem of 12 million undocumented immigrants who live in the shadows. It values work. It respects human dignity. And it includes guest worker provisions that have been supported by both business and labor. It includes a way to pay fines and earn citizenship that has the support of religious and leading Hispanic organizations.  These provisions are not amnesty. I spent enough years in law and enough years as a prosecutor. I know what amnesty is. These are not amnesty. Undocumented immigrants already in the country would not get to cut to the front of the line, but, in accordance with the committee's bipartisan plan, will need to pay fines, pay back taxes, work hard, and wait in line for green cards. They have to pass background checks and play by the rules. With fines and hard work and going to the back of the line, after 11 years, by following a regular path to legal status, the currently undocumented will join as full participants in American society. Following this plan, we could create an orderly system for immigration that is consistent with traditional American values and our history.  Opponents of a fair, comprehensive approach are quick to claim that anything but the most punitive provisions are amnesty. They are wrong. We had an amnesty bill. President Reagan signed an amnesty bill in 1986. This is not an amnesty bill. An editorial in the New York Times entitled ``It Isn't Amnesty'' makes the point that painting the word ``deer'' on a cow and taking it into the woods does not make that cow a deer. Frankly, in the State of Vermont, we deer hunters know the difference between a cow and a deer. We better. Our committee bill should not be falsely labeled. Our bill is more properly called what it is--a smart, tough bill.  The committee also voted to add several constructive and practical measures to the chairman's mark. We added a new version of the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or AgJOBS, a bill I have long supported. I was joined in that bipartisan effort by Senator Larry Craig. AgJOBS will reform the H-2A visa program for temporary agricultural labor. This new version will help dairy farmers in Vermont and many other States to legally hire foreign workers. The bipartisan provision approved by the panel would make dairy workers able to work under visas for up to 3 years, with the opportunity to adjust to permanent residence and achieve their full potential to become eligible for higher paying occupations.  The American people are engaging with us in this debate. The Nation's newspapers reflect the public's growing interest in how these decisions will be settled. In my home State, the Burlington Free Press and the Rutland Daily Herald have offered thoughtful editorial observations about these issues. I commend these editorials to the attention of my colleagues, and I will at the end of my statement include them.  The committee also adopted an amendment to include the bipartisan Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, called the DREAM Act. This provision will allow immigrant students to attend college and become permanent residents if they follow the rules established in the act. It will free eligible students from the constant fear of deportation, while allowing them to work so they can afford to pay for college. By our bipartisan committee vote, we hope to extend Hispanic young people greater educational opportunities so they may realize the American dream and achieve their potential.  The committee agreed--wisely, I believe--to drop several controversial provisions. Early in the process, I led an effort to remove a provision directing the Department of Homeland Security to study building a barrier, a fence, a wall along our northern border with Canada.  If I might just for a moment, I live less than an hour's drive from Canada. I see people go back and forth across that border all the time, families who live on both sides. My wife is a first-generation American. She was born in Vermont literally a couple hundred yards from the Canadian border. Her parents were naturalized citizens coming from the Province of Quebec. When I come home and she is speaking French on the phone, I know she is talking with some of her relatives in Canada. But tens of thousands of families, probably far more than that, cross the northern border.  There are also businesses. We even have a store in Vermont where there is a line painted down the center of the store, a cash register on one side of the store with Canadian money and a cash register on the other side with U.S. money. Why? Because half the store is in Canada and half in the United States. With the proposal that was before us of this barrier, this fence, it was going to be Joe would get a passport and bring me that box of Rice Krispies from the other side of the store. I mean, it gets down to that. There are businesses up and down the same way. When this proposal faced the light of day, we understood it easily.  There were other controversial provisions that we wisely dropped, provisions that would have exposed those who provide humanitarian relief--medical care, shelter, counseling, and other basic services--to undocumented aliens to possible prosecution under felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal law. If somebody is running a food bank or a shelter for battered children and women and they give aid, they help people, they feed the hungry, if you have an order of nuns who feed the hungry, under those circumstances, they faced a chance of being charged with a crime. For shame, for shame. Let's accept the beatitudes as something that should go across all faiths, across all laws. I thank so many in the relief and religious communities for speaking out on this matter. Those criminal provisions should be focused on the smugglers. Under the committee bill, that is what we do--go after the real criminals, the smugglers, people who trade in human lives.  The committee also voted down a measure that would have criminalized mere presence in an undocumented status in the United States. Illegal status is currently a civil offense with very serious consequences, including deportation. But criminalizing that status was punitive and wrong. Let's be realistic. Are you going to go out and lock up over 10 million people? It would have led to further harsh consequences. It would have trapped people in permanent underclass status, unwilling to move into the mainstream of society.  These policies, which were included in the House-passed bill and supported there by congressional Republicans, understandably sparked nationwide protests. They were viewed as anti-immigrant and inconsistent with American values and history, American values that attracted my grandparents to come here from Italy to settle in Vermont or my great grandparents to come from Ireland and do the same.  The committee bill was tough on enforcement and very properly so tough on the smugglers. It is smarter and fairer.  Finally, I thank the chairman for setting aside provisions in the markthat would have consolidated all immigration appeals from around the Nation into the jurisdiction of the Federal circuit, the court of appeals for the Federal circuit. That is a court we have wisely set up in recent years in Washington because it has specialized jurisdiction. It was created to hear patent appeals and cases involving technical intellectual property issues, those issues which have so much to do with the economy of our country. It was not set up to hear immigration appeals. In fact, the Judicial Conference, chaired by now Chief Justice John Roberts and Federal judges from across the country, expressed serious concerns with these proposals. The chairman did the right thing when he agreed to hold a hearing and further consider what provisions will best correct the problems created by former Attorney General Ashcroft's ill-conceived actions with respect to these matters in cutting down the number of people who could handle such matters.  I ask everybody to look at the peaceful demonstrations around the country over the last week. I will pick just one--in Los Angeles, half a million people. I can't help but notice that. We have slightly over 600,000 people in my State. They had almost the population of my State in a peaceful demonstration in Los Angeles. They were calling on us, calling on the Congress, the U.S. Senate and our colleagues in the other body, to recognize the human dignity of all. These aren't numbers. These aren't numbers. These are human beings. Do the right thing. We can do it in keeping with the longstanding American values. Let's not take the attitude that we are here, so no one else should be here. We are a nation of immigrants. We really are. In this case, if we are going to truly have the American dream, we also need a comprehensive solution to what has become a national problem. We need a fair, realistic, and reasonable system that includes both tough enforcement but immigration reform provisions. The bill reported by the Judiciary Committee is that bill.  This could be a pivotal moment in helping to achieve that goal. The Judiciary Committee's debate has produced a bill that I believe would make my grandparents proud. But I think it would make the ancestors of all of us proud. It is worthy of our support. We should stop and think for a moment in this body, this exclusive body--there are only 100 of us who get a chance at any given time to represent almost 290 million Americans--should we not do something that makes the country proud, makes those other 290 million Americans proud and makes us in this body proud?  I thank the many individuals and organizations who were so helpful to us during committee consideration of the bill. Included among those supporting this measure are many labor unions, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups, leading Hispanic organizations such as the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Council of La Raza, many religious organizations, including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.  I ask unanimous consent that editorials from the Rutland Daily Herald, the Burlington Free Press, and the New York Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Mar. 28, 2006]                               One World       Vermont's economy is sending a mixed message. Unemployment      is low, and median family income is growing. But economic      growth is imperiled by a shortage of workers, and the costs      of housing and health care are becoming increasingly      burdensome.       The labor shortage is having several effects in the      economy. One of them is the appearance of large numbers of      illegal immigrants to work on the state's dairy farms. The      problem of illegal immigration will come before Congress this      week, and it is a contentious and complex issue. The      situation in Vermont is a microcosm.       It is often argued that workers from Mexico, legal or      illegal, are essential to the economy because they are      willing to do work that U.S. workers are unwilling to do. But      as Paul Krugman notes in the column below, workers shy away      from low-paying jobs because they are low-paying. If a farm      worker earned as much as a school teacher, there would be      more people willing to milk cows for a living. But farmers      are in a bind. If they had to pay that much for farm labor,      they would either have to raise the price of milk or they      would have to absorb a cost that few could afford. The price      of milk is out of their hands, and as long as illegal      immigrants are available to hire, they play a role providing      low-cost labor.       Thus, farmers who refuse to hire illegal immigrants find      themselves at a competitive disadvantage, forced to pay      higher wages for the same labor. That's why business      interests are among the chief proponents of allowing guest      workers into the country legally. Business reaps the benefit      of low-cost labor.       The result is that there is an underclass of workers, legal      or illegal, willing to work at wages below what is deemed by      many to be livable in the United States. It is a consequence      of our proximity to Mexico. Substandard wages in this country      are desirable to many Mexicans who, even earning low wages,      manage to send home money to support family members left      behind. The economic inequities between Mexico and the United      States cannot be abolished by passing a tough immigration      law, and the result is downward pressure on wages for      Americans.       That downward pressure exists in the industrial sector as      well. Many old companies have departed over the past 40      years, replaced by a new brand of high-tech company or by      service sector jobs that pay less than traditional factory      jobs. Vermont has regained its footing after the industrial      decline that hurt Springfield, Rutland and Bennington so      badly, but continued industrial growth remains hampered by      the labor shortage caused by an aging population.       On top of these pressures are the extra burdens of high      housing and health care costs, which hit low- and middle-     income workers the hardest. Market forces beyond Vermont are      driving up those costs, and efforts in Montpelier by the      Douglas administration and the Legislature to ease the burden      of those costs are essential to future economic growth in the      state.       Thus, it is impossible to talk about Vermont's economy      without talking about the economy of the nation and the      world. The influx of farm workers from Mexico makes that      clear, but the rest of the economy, too, remains enmeshed      with the broader, changing world.                                  ____            [From the Burlington Free Press, Mar. 28, 2006]                  Immigration Bill Should Help Farmers       Vermont needs immigrant labor to help on dairy farms. There      are currently more than 2,000 Mexicans filling relatively      low-paying farm jobs that Vermonters won't accept. Without      that immigrant work force, some dairy farms would go      bankrupt.       That's a reality.       As the U.S. Senate focuses this week on immigration reform      changes, Congress should recognize the needs of farms for      this critical labor source. The Senate should create a      program to allow hard-working immigrants to legally hold jobs      in this country.       That might be structured much like the current program that      allows immigrant labor--primarily from Jamaica--to work for      less than a full year in Vermont picking apples.       The Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday passed a good      version supported by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that suggests      a three-year work program that can be renewed.       The changes cannot create a permanent ``underclass,'' as      some have suggested. Instead, it should be based on ``common      sense, decency and reality,'' said Vermont Agriculture      Secretary Steve Kerr.       This is not a partisan issue. Vermont Sens. Jim Jeffords      and Leahy support such a change. President Bush has also      expressed a desire to enable immigrants to cross the border      and fill job vacancies, and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, has      sponsored an agricultural jobs package.       There is resistance, however, from some senators who worry      about security threats linked to opening the borders in such      a way, and those who don't want to reward immigrants who have      broken the law to enter this country.       While it is important to tighten border security, this does      not preclude taking responsible steps to allow carefully      screened immigrants to hold jobs in Vermont that provide      income for their families and help the state's struggling      dairy industry.       ``This is a deciding issue,'' Kerr told the Free Press on      Monday, as the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington began      serious work on immigration legislation. ``This is a litmus      test.''       Kerr said Vermont farmers would certainly prefer to hire      local labor for these jobs. But, he said, it is virtually      impossible to find people willing to take these low-paying,      physically demanding jobs. The Mexican workers are paid      roughly $8 an hour, and the farmer provides many of the      basics, including housing and heat.       Creating a program that documents the arrival of those      workers makes sense. Local law enforcement would know who is      living in their communities, and the workers would have the      security of moving freely off the farm and knowing they      aren't at risk of automatic deportation.       Most importantly, farmers would have a reliable, hard-     working group of people helping with the milking and other      demanding farm tasks. For some, that might be the difference      between staying In business or throwing In the towel.                                       ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 29, 2006]                            It Isn't Amnesty       Here's one way to kill a cow: take it into the woods in      hunting season, paint the word ``deer'' on it and stand back.       Something like that is happening in the immigration debate      in Washington. Attackers of a smart, tough Senate bill have      smeared it with the most mealy-mouthed word in the      immigration glossary--amnesty--in hopes of rendering it      politically toxic. They claim that the bill would bestow an      official federal blessing of forgiveness on an estimated 12      million people who are living here illegally, rewarding their      brazen crimes and encouraging more of the same.       That isn't true. The bill, approved by the Senate Judiciary      Committee in a 12-to-6 vote on Monday, is one the country      should be proud of. Four Republicans, including the      committee's chairman, Arlen Specter, joined eight Democrats      in endorsing a balanced approach to immigration reform. The      bill does not ignore security and border enforcement. It      would nearly double the number of Border Patrol agents, add      resources for detaining illegal immigrants and deporting them      more quickly, and expand state and local enforcement of      immigration laws. It would create a system to verify workers'      identities and impose tougher punishments on employers who      defied it.       But unlike the bill's counterpart in the House, which makes      a virtue out of being tough but not smart, the Specter bill      would also take on the hard job of trying to sort out the      immigrants who want to stay and follow the rules from those      who don't. It would force them not into buses or jails but      into line, where they could become lawful residents and--if      they showed they deserved it--citizens. Instead of living off      the books, they'd come into the system.       The path to citizenship laid out by the Specter bill      wouldn't be easy. It would take 11 years, a clean record, a      steady job, payment of a $2,000 fine and back taxes, and      knowledge of English and civics. That's not ``amnesty,'' with      its suggestion of getting something for nothing. But the      false label has muddied the issue, playing to people's fear      and indignation, and stoking the opportunism of Bill Frist,      the Senate majority leader. Mr. Frist has his enforcement-     heavy bill in the wings, threatening to make a disgraceful      end run around the committee's work.       The alternatives to the Specter bill are senseless. The      enforcement-only approach--building a 700-mile wall and      engaging in a campaign of mass deportation and harassment to      rip 12 million people from the national fabric--would be an      impossible waste of time and resources. It would destroy      families and weaken the economy. An alternative favored by      many businesses--creating a temporary-worker underclass that      would do our dirtiest jobs and then have to go home, with no      new path to citizenship--is a recipe for indentured      servitude.       It is a weak country that feels it cannot secure its      borders and impose law and order on an unauthorized      population at the same time. And it is a foolish, insecure      country that does not seek to channel the energy of an      industrious, self-motivated population to its own ends, but      tries instead to wall out ``those people.''       It's time for President Bush, who talks a good game on      immigration, to use every means to clarify the issue and to      lead this country out of the ``amnesty'' semantic trap. He      dislikes amnesty. Mr. Frist dislikes amnesty. We dislike      amnesty, too.       The Specter bill isn't amnesty. It's a victory for      thoughtfulness and reason.
