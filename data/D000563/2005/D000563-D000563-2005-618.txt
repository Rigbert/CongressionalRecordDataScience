Senator Harkin joined afterwards. They conceded that they thought it was not a bad idea, if you sell dietary supplements in America, and somebody is harmed, seriously injured or dies as a result, that the manufacturer of that dietary supplement should report that event to the FDA so that they can see if there is a pattern, if it is something that might lead to a decision to take something off the market.  I would like to ask the Senator from Wyoming: Does he agree with that?Does he think that is a reasonable standard to ask the dietary supplement manufacturers to report truly adverse events such as is required of the pharmaceutical companies today?
