President, this is very simple. I hope everyone understands and is listening. We are going to have an opportunity in a few minutes to vote on another amendment which we will describe at that time with 2 minutes equally divided.  If you are opposed to English as the national language of the United States, then vote for the Salazar amendment. That is exactly what it does. His amendment says anyone who receives Federal money is entitled--this is an entitlement--to have the documentation in any language he or she chooses. It could be in Swahili, French, any other language.  So if you are opposed to English as the national language, go ahead and vote for this amendment. But keep in mind, when you do, that 91 percent of Americans are on our side of this issue and want English to be the national language, and 76 percent of the Hispanics, as a result of a poll that was taken in May of this year--a Zogby poll--are for English as the national language.  I ask you to defeat the Salazar amendment.
