Berman for yielding. I thank Ms. Ros-Lehtinen for bringing this resolution to the floor. And I am pleased to join my colleague and friend, Mr. Cantor, in strong support of this resolution.  I believe there is only one lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a future of two states for two peoples living in security and peace with one another. Such a solution is in the best interests of regional peace and in the best interests of both parties. That is why I strongly believe that ensuring the long-term viability of the Jewish democratic State of Israel also requires supporting a homeland for the Palestinian people.  History teaches us that in conflicts such as this, one peace must be negotiated. It cannot and will not be imposed from outside or else it will rest on an unstable and temporary foundation. That is why I strongly oppose Palestinian efforts to impose a solution to the conflict at the United Nations, as well as Palestinian efforts to unilaterally declare statehood. I am concerned that a unilateral declaration will only encourage both sides to dig in and put a lasting negotiated peace further at risk.  As President Obama said, and as Mr. Berman has quoted--and I want to quote a little more of the President's remarks, but I will repeat some of what Mr. Berman said because I think it is relevant--I quote the President of the United States: ``For the Palestinians, efforts to delegitimize Israel will endin failure. Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September won't create an independent state. Palestinian leaders will not achieve peace or prosperity if Hamas insists on a path of terror and rejection. And Palestinians will never realize their independence by denying the right of Israel to exist.''
