I rise today to recall the generous, self-giving life of Sister Ann Brawley, of the Mercy Order of Roman Catholic sisters in Lima who in 2010 has passed from this life into the next. Sr. Ann spent 77 of the 94 years of her life on Earth serving in Christ Jesus' name. She put into practice His words to live by--to ``remain in my love.'' Her joy was complete, as was the joy she conveyed to others.  Sr. Ann's imprimatur on our community is large. Starting as a bookkeeper for Mercy and St. Charles Hospitals in Toledo, she befriended all people who worked and visited the hospitals in which she worked. Of deep and committed social conscience, she was key in the establishment of the Toledo Catholic Diocese's Central Development Office. She offered accounting services to several area schools, the Migrant Information Office, Aurora Shelter for Women, and Bittersweet Farms community for adults with autism. She was invited to help in the development of Lima, Ohio's Kibby Corners Neighborhood Project.  In addition to Sr. Ann's accounting skill, she had a gift and a passion for the course of the Nation and politics. I came to know her when she offered her counsel, prayers and talents to me during my first campaign in 1982. Her humor, wit, and acumen were sharp and appreciated by all whose lives she touched. Not all business, Sr. Ann also had a passion for sports.  Sr. Ann had a compassionate heart and open arms, and the source of her hope was the unconditional love of Jesus. As Sister Joan Nemann, RSM noted in her eulogy, ``More than ten years ago when she asked me to give the homily at her funeral she emphasized these words repeatedly, remain in my love. This was such good news for her--and for us. Today, in her room I found a piece of birch bark that Ann had kept for a number of years. I recall that some years ago I came to the Pines to make a retreat. At that time the birch trees were shedding their bark. I founda lovely piece and wrote on it, `As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you. Remain in my love.' I gave it to Ann, and she kept it all these years since.'' Sister Joan's story illustrates to those of us privileged to know her: to her core, the essence of Love. May Sister be granted eternal rest for her life of abiding good deeds.                          ____________________
