President, I rise in support of the Home Heating Oil Price Stability Act being introduced today by Senator Dodd. In response to Congressional concern raised over volatile heating oil prices, the Department of Energy completed a study of regional oil reserves and issued their report in 1998. This report concluded that regional heating oil reserves, such as the one proposed in this bill, would benefit New England and help guard against the negative effects of volatile fuel prices during the winter months.  The recent price spike in home heating fuel throughout the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions illustrate the need for a regional fuel reserve. Prices of home heating fuel have increased over the last month to unprecedented levels, putting many families and businesses at risk during these cold winter months. Many areas of New England are now facing fuel costs between $1.70 and $2.00 per gallon--nearly double last January's average price of .80 cents per gallon. Home heating fuel has not seen average prices over $1 dollar in nearly ten years. These prices are endangering the welfare of low income Vermonters and threatening the stability of our economy.  This is not the first time we have seen such volatile prices in New England and will certainly not be the last. I remember Vermont in December 1989, when we experienced the coldest temperatures the Northeast has seen in 100 years, and then again in 1993 when the mercury plummeted and the fuel bills rose. Mr. President we need a regional home heating fuel reserve to protect the welfare and the economy of states such as Vermont. The cold winters and the absence of refiners make New England susceptible to fluctuations in the market which leave other parts of the country virtually untouched.                                 ______                                       By
