Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution, an order of business resolution, providing for the consideration of H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2001.  I want to commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions); the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), the chairman of the Committee on Rules; and all the members of the Committee on Rules for reporting a fair, balanced, and appropriate rule for consideration of this important bankruptcy reform bill.  Mr. Speaker, this rule is not unlike rules passed in the 105th and 106th Congress providing for the consideration of bankruptcy reform bills. This structured rule provides ample time for debate and consideration of opposing views. It makes in order one minority substitute and provides one hour of debate on that substitute. It also makes in order a technical amendment which I will be offering which will make some minor technical corrections in the bill.  Mr. Speaker, this is a good rule and I urge the Members to support this resolution.
