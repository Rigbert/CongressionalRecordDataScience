 Whereas the underlying bill suspends all environmental laws to allow salvage operations, my amendment does not permit the agencies to operate above the law. Instead, it requires them to expedite compliance with those laws.  Second, the underlying bill allows salvage on any Federal lands outside of designated wilderness areas where there is insect- or fire-damaged timber. That allows agencies to build roads in pristine roadless areas and harvest trees along our wild and scenic river corridors. My amendment restricts salvage operations to areas outside of the wilderness, roadless areas, and other congressionally designated areas, like wild and scenic river corridors.  Third, like the underlying bill, my amendment would shorten the timelines allowed for appeals, but allow citizens' the right to challenge bad agency decisions. Where the underlying bill prohibits administrative appeals and does not allow temporary injunctions, my bill allows appeals, but dramatically shortens the timelines and procedural requirements.  This is a reasonable, responsible approach. It ensures salvage operations will go forward. It protects workers and towns from the tangle of yet more lawsuits and insures that appropriate environmental protections are in place.  We do need to work with timber communities; they have been waiting a long time. We also need to protect them from the uncertainties of prolonged litigation. My amendment will do that.  Until very recently, the old growth Douglas fir forests in the Pacific Northwest had been shut down because Judge William Dwyer had ruled the agencies were not following the law.  When President Clinton held his forest conference in Portland 2 years ago, he promised a scientifically credible, economically sustainable, legally defensible plan to resolve the crisis. Option 9 is the result of that pledge. Let's be clear about this: Everybody dislikes option 9. The timber communities felt it was inadequate. The environmental groups felt it allowed too much harvesting.  Whatever people felt about it, option 9 was the first serious attempt to resolve an issue that plagued my region for years. Therefore, I supported it.  Judge Dwyer has recently ruled that option 9 satisfies the requirements of Federal law. Today, timber communities are back in the Federal timber harvest business. Unfortunately, they are not back to the degree that they should be. I am very unhappy that the Forest Service has not produced promised volumes.  I wrote the President last week to request a schedule for timber sales under option 9. He responded with details on both option 9 and the salvage program. I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.  [[Page S4872]] There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 21, 1995.     Hon. Bill Clinton,     President, The White House, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: I know you are as concerned as I about      the seeming inability of the Forest Service to produce a      reasonable supply of timber for Pacific Northwest timber      communities under Option 9. You and the rest of your      Administration worked hard to find a solution to the forest      crises we were facing. Despite protestations from all sides,      you supported a compromise plan to provide both      scientifically sound management of our forests and a      sustainable supply of timber to our communities.       Now, almost a year after the Record of Decision and 9      months after the lifting of the injunction, fewer than 300      million board feet of timber have been sold in the 17      National Forests managed under Option 9. I'm sure you agree      that this is unacceptable.       Legislation has passed the House and will soon be      considered by the Senate to suspend all federal environmental      laws applicable to the Forest Service in order to enable the      agency to sell the volume set forth in Option 9 (and to meet      salvage and section 318 sale targets). As a rule, I do not      support such ``sufficiency'' language because I strongly      believe agencies should not be above the law. However, I am      very frustrated by the Forest Service's inability to deliver      on the Option 9 sale targets.       Mr. President, I must have assurances this week that the      Forest service will meet its Option 9 target levels by the      end of this year. I need to know specific plans, timelines,      and changes that the Forest Service intends to take to get      this timber out. And I need to know what, if anything, you      need from Congress.       I believe Option 9 and existing law can produce a      sustainable flow of timber. Unfortunately, my belief has been      shaken by the facts.       Finally, I would appreciate knowing your plans for how the      Forest Service will conduct its salvage operations and any      problems you foresee in this area. Thank you for your      continued interest in finding solutions to these thorny      forest issues.           Sincerely,                                                     Patty Murray,     Senator.                                                                    ____                                              The White House,                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1995.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Patty: Thank you for your letter regarding the status      of the Northwest Forest Plan. I appreciate your concerns and      want to make clear the progress that is being made.       As you know, from the time I took office, I made resolution      of the long-standing Northwest forest dispute--which had      produced years of conflict and litigation--a high priority      for my Administration. The completion of my Northwest Forest      Plan in April 1994 and the subsequent ruling by Judge Dwyer      upholding the plan in December marks the first time since      1991 that forest management has been pushed out of the courts      and back into the communities. That is clearly good news.       I understand that you are concerned about the sales of      timber to date, but, as noted, we have only been out of the      courts since December. In FY 1995 we will offer for sale      approximately 600 million board feet (mmbf). This is      consistent with my commitment under the Forest Plan, which      was to offer 60 percent of the 1997 target (1.1 billion board      feet) in FY 1995. Furthermore, I am assured by the U.S.      Forest Service (FS) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)      that we will meet our commitment under the Plan of 800 mmbf      in FY 1996, and finally 1.1 billion board feet (bbf) in FY      1997. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of      Land Management will offer 1.664 bbf in salvage sales      throughout the country.       The agencies are working hard to expedite the      implementation of the Plan. The FS and BLM, for example, are      now working with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (FWS) and      the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) early in the      process of timber sale preparation. By engaging early on and      working simultaneously on project development, sale layout      and contract preparations will be significantly expedited.       Let me also note that, in addition to getting timber sales      moving, we are engaging state governments and local      communities as never before to create new economic      opportunities. In FY 94 the federal government invested      $126.6 million in the region combined with $164.3 million in      SBA loan guarantees. For example, the U.S. Forest Service      allocated $6.3 million for over 200 Jobs-in-the-Woods      contracts in the Gifford Pinchot, Okanogan, Olympic, Mount      Baker-Snoqualmie, and Wenatchee National Forests. In FY 95,      we will offer $301 million to the region under the Forest      Plan in grants and loan guarantees.       Additionally, with regard to salvage sales, we will be      reducing the time it takes to prepare a salvage sale by about      30 percent.       Let me be clear that legislation to bypass existing      environmental laws and mandate a minimum level of salvage      sales may not increase the flow of timber. In fact, the      Department of Justice has advised that such mandates could      reduce timber, grazing, and mining activities because they      could result in new litigation over every land management      plan, including the Forest Plan.       I share your desire and commitment to a sustainable flow of      timber in Washington. As you know, the gridlock created by      the actions of previous administrations will take years to      turn fully around. But again, our significant investment in      this issue is now beginning to offer hope to communities in      Oregon, Washington, and Northern California. I look forward      to working with you toward productive solutions for the      people of Washington and the entire Pacific Northwest.      Enclosed you will find a schedule of timber sales and a      summary of agency activity to facilitate the flow of timber      in the region.       With best wishes,           Sincerely,     Bill Clinton.                                                                    ____                       Timber Schedule Attachment     FOREST SERVICE AND BLM OR/WA/CA TIMBER SALE PROGRAM FOR FY 1994    ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Non owl                         Volume Sold                 Owl range    range     Total                                              (mmbf)     (mmbf)          ------------------------------------------------------------------------Forest Service...........................        233        257      490BLM......................................       18.5          0     18.5                                          ------------------------------  Total..................................      251.5        257    508.5                                          ==============================Forest Service\1\........................      851.0        376    1,227BLM\1\...................................      154.0          0      154                                          ------------------------------  Total\1\...............................    1,005.0        376    1,381------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\Volume harvested.

Thomas Tuchman, Director, Office of Forestry and                  Economic Development, March 23, 1995)                  increasing short-term timber supply       The Record of Decision (ROD) for the Northwest Forest Plan      allowed all timber sales that were sold and awarded prior to      the effective date of the ROD to go forward at the      purchasers' discretion. Those that were sold but not awarded      could go forward provided they met the requirements of the      Endangered Species Act (ESA). As of January 1, 1995, 96% of      the total Section 318 volume offered had been released. The      remaining volume is awaiting completion of surveys to comply      with the ESA. Agencies are working vigorously to complete the      required analyses and move these sales. A portion of the      remaining Section 318 sales, 13.9 mmbf from the Rogue River      Forest, will be awarded within 60 days. There will be an      additional 20.3 mmbf offered by mid-summer pursuant to      issuance of a biological opinion by the U.S. Fish and      Wildlife Service on unoccupied units for Marble Murrelets.      Please note the attached chart which contains a timber sale      schedule for FY 95 and includes salvage and green sales, in      addition to some outstanding miscellaneous sales that will be      offered by September 30, 1995.       immediate attention to actions improving forest conditions       We agree completely that we ought to move aggressively to      improve the health of forests in the Northwest; therefore,      several months ago we directed the agencies to move      expeditiously forward with immediate actions, such as salvage      sales. On March 8, the heads of four Federal agencies--Bureau      of Land Management (BLM), the U.S. Forest Service (FS), U.S.      Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), National Marine Fisheries      (NMFS)--signed an agreement detailing new consultation time      lines and streamlining processes for forest health projects.      Pursuant to this agreement, compliance with the National      Environmental Policy Act, the ESA, and other statutes will be      significantly accelerated. In fact, by ``reinventing'' the      consultation process, we will be able to cut the time      required to prepare salvage sales by about 30%. These process      improvements will accelerate the flow of timber in Oregon,      specifically on the ``east side.''       Additionally, a meeting is scheduled between BLM, FWS, FS,      and NMFS biologists and others involved in consultation to      work on screens to expedite consultation for salvage sales in      the region. Other streamlining actions will also be      discussed.       With regard to your suggestion concerning proceeds from      commercial thinning, the Forest Service currently has the      authority to fund timber stand improvements and other      restoration from timber receipts under the Knutson-Vandenberg      (K-V) Act. It is current practice for the Forest Service to      utilize these funds through the K-V Act from thinnings and      other timber sales to do timber stand improvements and to      conduct riparian restoration where      applicable. Another option is to consider the use of      stewardship contracts. This is a mechanism we have piloted      in other areas where timber sales pay for activities like      watershed restoration, recreation improvements, and      thinning and salvage sales. This is a tool we are      exploring in your region. If you have any questions about      it, please have someone contact us.                      simplify plan implementation       This Administration is committed to maximizing our      flexibility in implementing the Forest Plan. For example, the      U.S. Forest Service and BLM are expediting Plan      implementation by, for example, working with the FWS and the      NMFS to engage in the appropriate consultations early in the      process of timber sale preparation. By engaging early on and      working simultaneously on project development, we will      expedite sale layout and contract preparation. Further, by      involving FWS and NMFS biologists early in project      development, we should alleviate problems that would      otherwise arise in the final stages.       Also, we are on an accelerated track to complete half of      all the necessary watershed analyses under the Forest Plan by      the end of 1995. As you know, watershed analysis--utilized to      help make informed management decisions--is a new requirement      under the Forest Plan. As the watershed analyses are      completed and timber sales are awarded over the next year,      the timber pipeline will slowing be replenished after having      been fully depleted during the three and-a-half year period      (1991-June 1994) that timber sales were enjoined. This will      allow for an even and steady flow of timber under the Forest      Plan for Oregon and the region.       Overall, the agencies are pursuing better regional      oversight through a prioritization of consultation actions      and quality control of biological assessments submitted to      NMFS. Priorities will be coordinated regionally, rather than      for each Forest or BLM district. This will allow for smoother      implementation under the Forest Plan, as well as facilitate      forest salvage actions in the region.          expedite endangered species act consultation process       We too are concerned about the time it has taken in the      past to consult on management actions and are working to      expedite the process. As a result, land managers are      involving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the      National Marine & Fisheries Service at the beginning of a      project rather than at the end. In addition, they are      ``batching'' projects for consultation in larger groups,      wherever possible, rather than consulting on a sale-by-sale      basis.       Moroever, Secretary Babbitt has asked FWS to conduct an      evaluation of the consultation process with the goal of      further streamlining consultation for forest plan and salvage      sale activities. Additionally, on March 6, Secretary Babbitt      announced a ten point plan for easing ESA restrictions on      harvests from private lands. These and other efforts are      underway to facilitate responsibility the sale of timber in      your region.
