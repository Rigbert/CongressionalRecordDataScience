President, I look forward to a very thoughtful debate tomorrow. Senator McCain has introduced an amendment that would increase spending with respect to the Department of Defense and related functions. In this amendment, we are proposing an additional increase in nondefense programs. I look forward to tomorrow.  I thank the chairman for his consideration through the process of this floor debate.
