Four years ago this month, the terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls in the dead of the night from a school in Chibok, Nigeria, where they were taking final exams.  Some of the girls managed to run away, but Boko Haram abducted 219 girls.  These hundreds of young girls were held captive, abused, made to be slaves, forced into marriage with their abductors, raped, starved, and, in some cases, forcibly converted to Islam.  Some have tragically died while trying to flee or even during childbirth.  You might recall the global campaign on Twitter, #BringBackOurGirls, to urge the rescue of the girls.  Former First Lady Michelle Obama was moved to join the campaign for the release of the girls, as were over 3 million people around the world.  I, myself, was mortified to learn that, for the mere act of seeking an education, the girls were abducted and forced into child marriage or slavery. That is why, back then in 2014, I introduced a resolution condemning the Chibok abduction and calling for the immediate, safe return of the girls.  Since the kidnapping, just over 100 girls have been released, leaving over 100 girls still missing. I fear some may have already perished.  Parents marked the fourth anniversary on Saturday by marching with thousands of others to the school in Chibok where the girls were abducted in 2014.  I think we should join them here in the Senate in remembering this tragic anniversary.  That is why I have introduced, with some of my female colleagues, a resolution calling for the immediate release of all Boko Haram captives, especially the remaining Chibok girls.  The girls who have returned have told of the deplorable abuses Boko Haram fighters made them suffer.  No one should be subject to the depravity of an organization that doesn't value human life, let alone young girls simply trying to get an education.  Unfortunately, since 2012, Boko Haram has conducted a violent campaign of mass kidnappings of women, girls, and boys in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.  Boko Haram remains one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world, killing more than 13,000 people since 2013. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says almost 2.5 million people in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger have been displaced--that is forced from their homes--because of Boko Haram's brutality.  And the terror continues.  Just in February, Boko Haram militants stormed the town of Dapchi in Nigeria and abducted 111 girls and 1 boy.  Thankfully, most of those children have been returned to their families, but, heartbreakingly, some died during their ordeal, and one girl still remains a hostage.  The New York Times recently ran a stirring front page piece about some of the Chibok girls who have been freed. I applaud the extraordinary bravery of those survivors, who have come forward to share their stories and experiences at great risk to themselves.  The courage and strength of the girls who are still being held captive to remain resilient in the face of unspeakable brutality is deeply moving.  As a testament to their fortitude, let us all recommit ourselves to ending discrimination and violence against women and girls, to ensuring the safety and welfare of women and girls, to pursuing policies that guarantee girls education, and to the release of the remaining Boko Haram captives.  Thank you.                          ____________________
