 It was the first military unit to serve at what is now known as the Dover Air Force Base.  The history of the Base actually goes back 2 years further, to 1939, when in response to the Nazi invasion of Poland, the Civilian Aviation Administration, CAA, offered State and local governments on both coasts financial help to build municipal airports. The CAA offered to build one airfield in each of Delaware's three counties; the State did not pursue the offer, but New Castle and Sussex Counties accepted. Kent County passed the issue to the city of Dover, our State capital, and the Dover leaders agreed and purchased the land for a new airfield, in what has been hailed many times since as ``the best investment the city ever made.''  In addition to the anti-submarine mission during World War II, Dover's airfield was used, once the Corps of Engineers had done some of its magic, to train fighter squadrons and then, in 1944, as the site for classified air-launched rocket tests, experiments that led to the use of air-to-surface rockets in both the European and the Pacific Theaters.  After the war, the airfield was placed on caretaker status, and although it remained inactive for the rest of the 1940s, the name was officially changed to Dover Air Force Base in January 13, 1948. Control of the Base was transferred to the Ninth Air Force in February 1949. In February 1951, the Dover Air Force Base was reactivated and put under the jurisdiction of the Air Defense Command, ADC, with different fighter squadrons using the airfield over the course of the next 7 years.  The foundation for a permanent mission was laid when, recognizing Dover's strategic location, the Military Air Transport Service, MATS, assumed control and began, with an appropriation from Congress, to transform the Base into the East Coast embarkation point and foreign clearing base. Four units of the Atlantic Division were organized at Dover: the 1607th Air Base Group, the 1607th Air Base Squadron, the 1607th Maintenance and Supply Squadron, and the 1607th Medical Group. In November 1953, the first two transport squadrons were assigned, forming the core of the 1607th Air Transport Wing, and in December of that year, the Secretary of the Air Force designated the Dover Air Force Base as a permanent military installation.  In 1955, the Aerial Port Mortuary responsibilities were transferred to Dover, and many Americans have become familiar with the Base for its prominence and exceptional service in fulfilling that duty. To offer an incomplete list, the Port Mortuary has received the remains of casualties of the war in Vietnam, a number of plane and helicopter crashes involving military personnel, the mass suicide in Guyana, the attack on the Marine barracks in Beirut, the Challenger explosion, the USS Stark, Pan Am 103, the USS Iowa, the Khobar Towers bombing, the 1998 bombing in Kenya, and most recently, victims of the September 11 attack on the Pentagon.  From the mid-1950s to the mid-Sixties, to offer another incomplete list, Dover Air Force Base participated in Project Ice Cube to construct a Defense Early Warning Network in Northern Canada; the airlift to help combat a polio outbreak in Argentina; Operation Good Hope to Jordan; the Amigo Airlift in response to a devastating earthquake in Chile; an airlift of relief supplies to Honduras after Hurricane Hattie; the airlift of United Nations peace-keepers to the Belgian Congo; the Cuban Missile Crisis; the relief airlift following the Great Alaskan Earthquake; and the delivery of supplies to Guadeloupe Island after Hurricane Cleo, as well as supporting the deepening involvement in Vietnam.  In January 1966, a reorganization led to the designation of the Military Airlift Command and the activation of the 436th Military Airlift Wing to assume command of the Base. The 436th, by the way, has its own proud history, going back to the famed 436th Troop Carrier Group, TCG, which participated in just about every major European campaign of World War II, from Normandy to Operation Market Garden to Bastogne to Operation Varsity.  In 1968, the 912th Military Airlift Group, Associate, along with the 326th Military Airlift, the 912th Support, and the 912th Material Squadrons, were activated at Dover, giving the Base a total of four active and one reserve military airlift squadrons. In 1973, the 512th Military Airlift Wing, A, which is now the 512th Airlift Wing, A, was activated as a replacement to the 912th and its subordinates; the 512th AW remains a key part of Dover's mission. From 1971 to 1973, the transition was undertaken to make Dover home to the first all C-5 equipped wing in the Air Force.  During the Vietnam war, Dover aircrews participated in, among others, Operation Blue Light in January 1966 and Operation Eagle Thrust in 1967, an incredibly ambitious military airlift into a combat zone for which Dover personnel received their first Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.  Among other most notable missions in which Dover crews have participated are Operation Nickel Grass, during which Dover's C-5s flew 71 missions, more than 2,000 hours, delivering more than 5,000 tons of cargo. That operation is considered by many to have been the first real test of the C-5 aircraft. Dover crews also successfully dropped and test-fired a Minuteman I ICBM in 1974, and delivered a 40-ton superconducting magnet to Moscow in 1977 as part of a joint energy research program. The mission to Moscow earned the crew the Mackay Trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year. Missions to Zaire and, in the cause of joint verification, another to the Soviet Union also earned Mackay Trophies for Dover captains and crews.  Dover crews helped evacuate Americans from Iran in 1978, and supported the Marine operation in Lebanon in 1983-84. Dover's C-5s flew 27 missions in the invasion on Grenada also in 1983, and assisted with the clean-up after the Valdez oil spill in 1989. Eighteen missions were flown by Dover crews in Operation Just Cause in Panama, and in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the Persian Gulf War, Dover's C-5s logged more than 30,000 flying hours. Since then, Dover crews have flown in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia; in Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Operations Desert Thunder and Desert Fox in 1998; and in Operation Allied Force against the military structure of Slobodan Milosevic.  Among recent humanitarian missions have been the airlift to Central America following Hurricane Mitch; Joint Task Force Shining Hope to aid Kosovar refugees; airlifts to Turkey following the earthquakes of 1999; the 436 AW also responded to the earthquake that same year in Taiwan; and Operation Atlas Response in Mozambique after the devastating flooding there last year.  And, of course, there is Operation Enduring Freedom, our common cause in which our military men and women bear so much of the burden, the risk and the sacrifice. Our prayers and thanks are with them every day, including the 200 men and women from the 512 Air Reserve Wing who have been activated. I would also note that the 436th Airlift Wing received its 13th Air Force Outstanding Unity Award in October.  I share this history with my colleagues and with the Nation today, not only because the 60th anniversary of the Dover Air Force Base represents our proud military tradition so well, but also because the history of the Dover Air Force Base is very much a part of the history of Delaware. We do not merely co-exist with the Base; it is a part of our State family, a part of our community of friends and neighbors. And so we are especially proud, and so very grateful to those who have served.  Congratulations to Colonel Scott Wuesthoff, the current Commander of the 436th Airlift Wing, to Colonel Bruce Davis, who just assumed command of the 512th Airlift Wing, and to all personnel who serve out of Dover, on the 60th anniversary of the Air Force Base, with the respect and thanks of your neighbors in Delaware, and of all your fellow citizens.                          ____________________
