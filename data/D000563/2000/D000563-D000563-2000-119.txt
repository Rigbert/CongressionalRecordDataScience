President, this letter was sent to me by the executive director of the Illinois Capital Development Board, Kim Robinson. I don't know Kim Robinson personally. But she writes to me in this letter of October 3 that there are certain exceptions to competitive bidding under the Illinois State law. She lists all six of them, and then concludes:       None of these exceptions have ever or will apply to the      library project, as they do not apply to the overwhelming      majority of CDB's projects.  By that statement it is clear to me that there is going to be open competitive bidding on this project.  The point that was raised by Senator Fitzgerald earlier in the debate about qualified bidders is a valid one. Who will be bidding on this project? I do not know. Frankly, no one has come forward to me and suggested that they want to be bidding on this project. It wouldn't do them any good anyway. I am not going to make that decision. I haven't involved myself in the location or design. I leave that to others.  But I hope when this happens and bidders are solicited that it is an entirely open process as well. I will guarantee that there will be more attention paid to this bid for this project in Springfield, IL, than probably anything in its history.  I credit Senator Fitzgerald for bringing that attention forward. But let us proceed with the premise that it is going to be a transparent process. And let us make certain that as it progresses we will have at least an opportunity to assess it every single step of the way.  I also add that during the course of his statement today my colleague has raised questions about previous bidding processes by Governors in the State of Illinois.
