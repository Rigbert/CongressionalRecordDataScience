 Does the Senator understand that by the year 2005 under No Child Left Behind, every public school in America, including the District of Columbia, will have to test every grade every year; but in the current school year, schools are moving toward that goal. In the District of Columbia they are only testing every other year.  It is not a question of changing the test. I am asking the Senator from California, does she understand if we stick to the 2003-2004 standard, she will only be testing every other grade while every public school in the District of Columbia and across the Nation will be moving to every grade, every year by 2005? Her bill, her standards, will not be following that same assessment.
