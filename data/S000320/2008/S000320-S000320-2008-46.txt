 President, Senator Dodd and I agreed to provide an additional $100 million for foreclosure counseling. This is already in addition to the $180 million provided for the same purpose earlier.  It is my strong belief that we should conduct some due diligence on the money we have already provided to ensure that it is being spent properly and, most importantly, that it is actually helping people.  In the interest of reaching an accommodation, I agreed to provide an additional $100 million. It is in the amendment. This brings the total spending for counseling for 2008 up to $280 million, an amount that represents a $238 million increase from last year. That is a lot of money.  If there is a gap between what we have provided and what is needed, that need can be addressed through the normal appropriations process.  I think a point of order has already been raised. I hope it will be sustained.
