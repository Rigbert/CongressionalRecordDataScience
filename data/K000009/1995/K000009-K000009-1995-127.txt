Lenore Donnelly, originally of Worcester, MA, now of Virginia, who, for the last 10 years, has served this House with distinction, vivacity, good humor, and professionalism as Chief of Pages on the Democratic side of the aisle. Today is her last official day in this capacity as she retires to pursue family and personal interests.  Lenny came to Washington to work for Senator John F. Kennedy in the Presidential campaign in 1959 and later became a member of his White House staff. She served in helping to arrange private and congressional tours of the White House and worked on arrangements for the President's trips within the United States and abroad, often traveling on such trips, including the famous trip to Ireland.  After the President's tragic assassination, she continued under President Johnson to serve at the White House during that administration. She worked in Senator Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for President, and after that Senator's tragic assassination, worked out of the New York office on his funeral arrangements at St. Patrick's Cathedral and the historic train ride bringing the Senator's body back to Washington.  Later she became Deputy Chief of the U.S. Capitol Guide Service, responsible for the orientation, supervision, and direction of all Capitol guides and tours. In 1985 she was appointed as Chief of Democratic Pages by Speaker O'Neill and has worked with over 2,000 young American Pages from all over the United States, responsible for their training, orientation, guidance, counseling, and familiarization with House procedures and conduct in this Chamber.  We wish her Godspeed, along with her husband, Ray Donnelly, who has been active in planning the Korean War Veterans Memorial being dedicated on July 27 on the Mall.  America could have had no finer daughter in service to this Nation. She has served millions and millions of our citizens as well as visitors from throughout the world.  Thank you, Mrs. Donnelly.                            ____________________
