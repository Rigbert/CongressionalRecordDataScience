A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the application of the passive loss limitations to equine activities; to the Committee on Finance.                  the equine tax fairness act of 1997  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify application of passive loss limitations to horse activities.  This week the eyes of the sporting world are focused on the 123d running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY. While it is considered one of the greatest sporting events in the world, the Kentucky Derby is part of a much larger and broader horse industry--one that has a $112 billion economic impact in the United States and supports 1.4 million jobs.  Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, or showing horses--or simply enjoying an afternoon ride along the trail--1 of 35 Americans is touched by the horse industry.
