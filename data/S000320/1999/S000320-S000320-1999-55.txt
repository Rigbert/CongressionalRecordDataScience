 President, I agree that the RIMS project described by Senator Abraham indeed appears to be worthy of federal funding, and I would recommend that the Federal Highway Administration provide funding for this project to the extent possible after fully funding the SEMSIM project discussed before. Furthermore, if the final appropriations bill will provide more ITS money for Michigan, I will press to have both of these projects funded as fully as possible, in accordance with the prioritization I have previously discussed.
