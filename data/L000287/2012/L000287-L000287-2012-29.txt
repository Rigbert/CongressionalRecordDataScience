Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Georgia State Representative Elena Parent on the occasion of her retirement from the Georgia General Assembly. In her short time in the Georgia State House, Elena has made a profound impact on the Georgia Legislature, and I know that she will be missed by her constituents from the 81st District.  Outside of public office, Elena is incredibly involved in the Metro Atlanta community, currently serving on the Foundation Board of the Georgia Association of Women Lawyers, the Advisory Board of Directors of It's a Journey, Inc., and the Women and Minorities in the Profession Committee of the State Bar of Georgia. She has also conducted fundraising and development efforts for HOPE Atlanta, a homelessness-prevention non-profit. I commend her for such meaningful service to the people of Georgia.  Elena recently announced that she will begin working as the Executive Director of Georgia Watch, a consumer advocacy group, at the end of her term this year. Having already received numerous awards for her leadership, including inclusion in the Atlanta Business Cronicle's ``40 Under 40,'' Elena is an excellent choice for this position, and I look forward to hearing of her successes in the future.  I wish Elena, her husband, Briley, and their son, Brooks, the very best.                          ____________________
