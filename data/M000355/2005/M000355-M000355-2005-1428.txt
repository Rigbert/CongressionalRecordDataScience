 President, I rise today to commend an accomplished Kentuckian and good friend,Mr. Luther Deaton, Jr. A native of Breathitt County, KY, Mr. Deaton is an esteemed banker, revered community leader, inspiring mentor, and caring father.  Luther began his career in the banking industry as an assistant manager and teller with Central Bank & Trust Co. in Lexington in 1978. Little did he know that initial exposure would lead to a lifetime of professional achievements. Possessed with a resolute and unshakeable determination to advance his employer's cause, Luther rapidly rose through the company's ranks. In January 1996, the Board of Directors promoted Luther to president and CEO of Central Bank, and in March 2002, he was named chairman of the bank. He also serves as the chairman of Commerce Lexington, Inc., which seeks to expand and attract economic development in central Kentucky.  While Central Bank has flourished under Luther, it is his leadership presence in central Kentucky I admire most. His formidable array of accomplishments directly results from his passion to improve the quality of life for his fellow Kentuckians. In September 1997, the Lexington Theological Seminary named Luther as the second recipient of the John R. Wooden Award, an honor given to layman whose life shows commitment to, and active involvement in, a faith community and evidence of putting one's faith to work for the welfare of humankind. In 2001, he was the recipient of the Governor's Economic Development Leadership Award for the State of Kentucky. Additionally, the Junior Achievement of the Bluegrass inducted Luther into the 2004 Bluegrass Business Hall of Fame, due to his labor and vision to improve the quality of life in the Bluegrass area.  Later this month, Luther will be the honoree at the Volunteers of America Tribute Dinner in Lexington, KY. Here the community will have an opportunity to thank him for all of his contributions and honor his achievements.  Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and recognizing one of Kentucky's pre-eminent professionals, Mr. Luther Deaton, Jr.                          ____________________[Pages S4252-S4253]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     TRIBUTE TO LUTHER DEATON, JR.
