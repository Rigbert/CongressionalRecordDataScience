 Speaker, I am inserting this statement regarding my constituent, Gordon D. Ladd, which shows the courage and perseverance he displayed in organizing the first union in northern Vermont in the 1940s, into the Congressional Record as I believe the views of this person will benefit my colleagues.  Gordon D. Ladd--First President of IAM Lodge in Derby Line Vermont               Organizing A Union in Vermont in the 1940's       In 1943 I requested an interview with the superintendent of      management at Butterfield Corporation in Derby Line Vermont      to request a wage increase and my request was denied      emphatically. I informed him that I would return.       I met a friend of mine who used to be a coach, a hockey      coach, and he had relatives in the plant. This guy I met,      Bert, you could call him, he was a machinist for the railroad      in Island Pond, and he belonged to the machinist's union. So      he asked if we had a union up there and what the wages were.      We were good friends, he was coach for a long time, but      anyway, I told him that wages were very low at my workplace,      and he said ``Well, do you think they would be interested in      the union?''. I said ``Well, yeah I'll talk to a few.'' So, I      did.       When I went up to see the boss that first time he asked me      what I was making. I told him ``65 cents an hour''. I had      started at 45 cents and worked three years--I got a 10 cent      raise each year. And it was 65 cents, and he, ah, he's a      rough little character, he slammed his fists down on his desk      and he says ``by god,'' he says, ``that's the highest we will      ever pay at this plant''. So then I got up and said ``We'll      see about that, and I'll be back.''       So now I went to the shop, talked to several guys, they      were all interested, all enthused about it, and said they      would support a union. So then I get back to Burt at Island      Pond, and told him to send us up a representative. It was      then less than a week and the Machinist representative had      arrived from Albany, New York. And he talked to me, he came      to the house a few times, and then we called a meeting, and,      more and more, one meeting after another, at first it was a      small amount, a few men, but then they got bigger and bigger      crowds.       Management of course fought us tooth and nail. Well, one      thing I can remember in particular. The general foreman, he      was under the superintendent, he was putting something on the      union representative's car, on the front end of it, come to      find out, spikes on a rope. And he was seen doing that, and      we called him on it, but he denied it of course. You see they      hit just right and they could blow the tires.       They did little annoying things. They'd send us one of      these, what we'd call suckers down, always coming down and      talking to me, trying to find out things, you know. I just      told them I knew nothing. Another one of these      superintendents came down one day and says ``We know you're      the head of the union,'' and I said ``I've got a perfectly      good right to according to the laws''. And he didn't have too      much more to say.       We also learned that the company had hired an electrician      for the purpose of organizing against the union, see he was a      company plant. So he got up and threw a scare, said that if      we had a union we would lose our bonus, a 10% bonus every six      months. So that killed the first drive right there, see. And      they tried every little trick, they sent the people down that      I knew, they'd come down and fish around, try to get      information from me. Then they called me, offered me 10 cents      an hour more, if I'd stop the union organizing. ``We'll give      you 10 cents an hour raise, but I want you to keep it quiet,      I don't want you to tell anybody.'' Then they'd say, ``If you      tell me the guys that are dissatisfied in the shop, give me      their names, we'd give them 15 cents an hour more.'' And I      said ``Just a minute, if everybody gets 15 cents and hour      we'll go along with it, but other than that,'' I said, ``no      way''. You can pick out a few, that would just start trouble.       So then we call the meeting, the machinist's union, and we      get a hall and call the meeting, and that was the one where      we lost the election the first time.       I don't remember the exact vote total but it was close. But      then comes the good part. We later learned that the company      sent down foremen and group leaders and had them vote too.      But the fact is they shouldn't have been able to vote because      they were management. They even sent down 3 or 4 women down      from the office to vote, and the vote was for production      workers and these were office workers. They shouldn't have      been able to vote either but management wanted more to go in      the ballot box.       So we petitioned for another election. And once again      during the vote the company starting sending down foremen and      group leaders to vote. But this time our union representative      said no way. The Labor Board Representative was there and we      challenged the right of these supervisory men to vote. The      Board Representative put those votes, I think there were 26      of them, in a special envelope. This time we won the election      by a pretty good margin. That was in 1944.       Another little thing here. I was in a barber shop and the      big shot manager from the venier mill came in. My barber was      my landlord, we were renting the house, and he asked me      something about the union. And this management guy from the      mill, he says ``That union'' and he used a few cuss-words      ``won't last six months!'' Well it's a 55 year later and the      union's still there. But the funny part is, in about a year      and a half, they plopped the union in at the venier mill.       Well, the main thing at my plant was wages, because plants      in the state, we checked around a little bit and some of the      plants were paying, at that time, double what we were      getting. We checked around, because some of the guys,      neighbors in Newport were working down in the Springfield      machine shops, at places like Jones-Lampson. When we heard      what they were getting, we thought ``Well, we should be      getting about the same.''       I was elected as the first president of the union lodge in      1944 and served for seven years. We did pretty good with      improving wages and getting benefits--we got health      insurance, a pension plan. I've collected from the pension      plan for 19 years now, and we got pretty good medical. We      didn't have either before the union. It definitely pays to be      union.                               ____________________
