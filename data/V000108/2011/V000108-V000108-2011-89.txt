The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program supports the development of innovation and advanced technologies that create energy jobs and reduce our Nation's dependence on oil.  I believe that this is an energy issue in its truest form as far as reducing our dependency on foreign oil. Another observation I would make: If the amendment is adopted, it would ensure that we would have no oversight, no oversight of the loans that the Department has already issued, ensuring that both Congress and the administration would, therefore, abdicate their responsibility to protect and ensure that taxpayer dollars are used in the manner they were intended and that the recipients follow through on the conditions of those loans.  For these reasons and reasons espoused by my chairman, I again am opposed to the gentleman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Broun).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
