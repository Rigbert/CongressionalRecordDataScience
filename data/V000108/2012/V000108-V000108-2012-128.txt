Speaker, on March 6, 2012, I was absent from the House and missed rollcall votes 96 and 97.  Had I been present for rollcall 96, on a motion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 4105, to apply the countervailing duty provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930 to nonmarket economy countries, I would have voted ``yea.''  Had I been present for rollcall 97, on ordering the previous question of H. Res. 570, providing for consideration of the bill H.R. 2842, to authorize all Bureau of Reclamation conduit facilities for hydropower development under Federal Reclamation law, and for other purposes, I would have voted ``nay.''                          personal explanation
