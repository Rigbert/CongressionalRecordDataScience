Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his response.  The gentleman has cited the marriage constitutional amendment. Mr. Speaker, this bill, as I understand it, has not been marked up in committee at this point in time. Is it the gentleman's expectation that this will come to the floor, the constitutional amendment, without being marked up in the committee?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.  The committee has held four hearings on this bill, and I do anticipate bringing it to the floor without being marked up by the committee, under a rule.
