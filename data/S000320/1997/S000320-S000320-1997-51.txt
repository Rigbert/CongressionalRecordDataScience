 COVERDELL. The city of Atlanta and Hartsfield International Airport have requested a $150 million letter of intent, commonly referred to as an LOI, from the FAA in connection with the construction of a commuter runway. Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport is the second busiest airport in the country and a critical link in our national air transportation system. A major airline headquarted in Atlanta alone has over 600 flights per day out of Atlanta. Over the past several years, there has been an increase in delays at the airport. When Atlanta has a problem with congested air traffic, the effects ripple throughout the national system. Delays at Hartsfield create waves of delay across the country. I strongly believe this project should receive priority consideration from the FAA for an LOI and would ask the chairman and the ranking member, the senior Senator from New Jersey, to support this request.
