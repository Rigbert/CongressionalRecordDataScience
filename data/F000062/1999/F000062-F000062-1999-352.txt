 President, I am offering today, a legislation that previously passed the Senate by unanimous consent but failed to be enacted because the bill was not considered by the House during last Congress.  This legislation provides permanent residency to Suchada Kwong, a recently widowed young mother of a U.S. citizen child who faces the devastation of being separated from her child and family here in the U.S.  Suchada Kwong's U.S. citizen husband, Jimmy Kwong, was tragically killed in an automobile accident in June of 1996, leaving a 3-month-old U.S.-born son and his 29-year-old bride.  Because current law does not allow Suchada to adjust her status to permanent residency without her husband, Suchada now faces deportation.  Suchada and Jimmy Kwong met in Bangkok, Thailand, through a mutual friend in 1993. He communicated with her frequently by phone and visited her every time he was in Bangkok. They fell in love and were married in September 1995 and Suchada gave birth to Ryan Stephen Kwong in May 1996.  Suchada was supposed to have her INS interview on August 15, 1996. However, Jimmy was killed in an accident in June, less than 3 weeks after his son was born and 2 months short of the INS interview. Now, because the petitioner is deceased, Suchada is ineligible to adjust her status. While the immigration law provides for widows of U.S. citizens to self-petition, that provision is only available for people who have been married for over 2 years.  Suchada's deportation will not only cause hardship to her and her young child but to Suchada's mother-in-law, Mrs. Kwong, who faces losing her grandson, only a short time after she lost her only son.  Mrs. Kwong is elderly, and though she is financially capable, could not care for her grandson herself. Mrs. Kwong is proud to be self-supporting, having owned and worked in a small business until her retirement. The family has never used public assistance, and through Jimmy's job, the family has sufficient resources to support Suchada and Ryan. It would also be difficult for Suchada as a single mother in Thailand. Here in the United States, she has the support of Mrs. Kwong and their church.  Suchada was previously granted voluntary departure for one year on October 1996 to explore other options or prepare to leave the United States. During that time period, Suchada and her family have explored all options but failed. Now, the voluntary departure period has expired and Suchada must leave the country immediately, leaving behind her young child and her family here in the U.S.  Suchada has done everything she could to become a permanent resident of this country--except for the tragedy of her husband's death 2 months before she could become a permanent resident. I hope you support this bill so that we can help Suchada rebuild her life in the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 275       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SUCHADA KWONG.       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of      section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, Suchada      Kwong shall be eligible for issuance of an immigrant visa or      for adjustment of status to that of an alien lawfully      admitted for permanent residence upon filing an application      for issuance of an immigrant visa under section 204 of such      Act or for adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident.       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Suchada Kwong enters the      United States before the filing deadline specified in      subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered and      remained lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be      eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the      Immigration and Nationality Act as of the date of the      enactment of this Act.       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the applications      for issuance of immigrant visas or the applications for      adjustment of status are filed with appropriate fees within 2      years after the date of the enactment of this Act.       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting      of an immigrant visa or permanent residence of Suchada Kwong,      the Secretary of State shall instruct the proper officer to      reduce by one, during the current or next following fiscal      year, the total number of immigrant visas that are made      available to natives of the country of the alien's birth      under section 203(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act      or, if applicable, the total number of immigrant visas that      are made available to natives of the country of the alien's      birth under section 202(e) of such Act.                                 ______                                       By
