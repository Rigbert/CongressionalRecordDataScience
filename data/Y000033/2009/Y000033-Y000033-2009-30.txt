Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing Alaska, the greatest State in the Union, the largest State in the Union, with the one congressman that does the whole job of the State of the Union. Thank you. I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This bill was introduced by Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Hastings to allow additional time for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund to raise private funds for the construction of the underground visitors center on The Mall.  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this great piece of legislation.  I reserve the balance of my time.
