Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ralph Neas and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, true leaders in the fight for civil rights. For the last 45 years the conference has worked diligently on this effort and has been successful in accomplishing some of the biggest civil rights victories in our Nation's history.  Many of these victories were won during the past 14 years under the successful leadership of Ralph Neas. Ralph has directed the lobbying, grassroots, legal research, and media efforts of the largest, oldest, and most broadly based civil rights coalition in this Nation. Ralph always believed his professional training as chief legislative assistant to two Senators and his triumph over Guillan-Barre syndrome had adequately prepared him for the challenges which were ahead for LCCR. During his tenure, Ralph served as a coalition builder as he kept the conference's diverse leadership united and effective. Through his work with LCCR, he has earned respect for his ability to build bridges between disparate communities of interest and across the spectrum of political ideologies.  The first major victory which Ralph and his LCCR colleagues won was passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1982. Bipartisanship, creativity, and leadership were all necessary to win this uphill battle. The Leadership Conference, led by Ralph exhibited all of these qualities during the almost 2-year campaign to enact this major piece of legislation. The hard work of LCCR set the stage for what would be numerous victories throughout his next 14 years as executive director.  Ralph Neas was one of the first leaders of the mainstream civil rights movement to recognize the civil rights struggle of people with disabilities. He brought disability issues to the forefront of the civil rights struggle and was instrumental in securing the enactment of the first civil rights laws for people with disabilities, the Americans With Disabilities Act. This would not have been possible without Ralph's vision, leadership, and commitment.  Ralph is also well known as a brilliant legislative strategist. Using that skill, as well as creativity and leadership, he led the fights which resulted in the passage of several additional major legislative initiatives. These initiatives include: the Civil Rights Act of 1991, the fair housing amendments of 1988, the Japanese-American redress bill, and the Civil Rights Restoration Act.  Not only did Ralph Neas experience great legislative success as the executive director of LCCR, he also experienced great institutional successes. His astute management led to a massive growth of the conference. The organization's budget grew seven fold since 1981 and added more than 50 new national organizations. Currently, 180 national organizations with memberships totaling more than 50 million Americans now belong to the conference. This significant growth has allowed LCCR to meet new challenges as an even stronger, more united, and effective group.  In addition to his duties as executive director, Ralph Neas managed the Leadership Conference's education fund, an independent organization that supports educational activities relevant to civil rights. In this capacity, he has supervised projects promoting tolerance an diversity, has led a successful children's antidiscrimination campaign, and published books and reports on emerging civil rights issues.  This month, Ralph will step down as executive director of the Leadership Conference and will embark upon new challenges in his life and career. We can all be assured that the new challenges which lie ahead for him will be marked by continued commitment to justice and equality for all Americans.  It is my pleasure to join many Americans in thanking Ralph for his unselfish service to his Nation and its people. It is also my distinct pleasure to congratulate the Leadership Conference on its 45th anniversary. Due to the Ralph Neas and the Leadership Conference's commitment and dedication to the civil rights movement, the past 45 years have been a strong, legislative, bipartisan reaffirmation of civil rights. We are a greater Nation because of the many successful battles fought and won by Ralph Neas and the Leadership Conference on civil rights, and I know that Ralph and the LCCR will continue to lead the way towards a nation of equality, justice, and strength.                          ____________________
