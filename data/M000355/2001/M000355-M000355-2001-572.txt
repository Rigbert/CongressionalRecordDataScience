 Gregg, Mr. Frist, Mr. Miller,         Mr. Lott, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Sessions,         and Mr. Carper):  S. 316. A bill to provide for teacher liability protection; to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, with my colleagues Senators Gregg, Frist, Miller, Lott, DeWine, Enzi, Hutchinson, Sessions, and Carper, The Paul D. Coverdell Teacher Liability Protection Act. This important legislation extends protections from frivolous lawsuits to teachers, principals, administrators, and other education professionals who are acting within the scope of their professional responsibilities.  The Teacher Liability Protection Act builds upon the good work Congress began in 1997 when it enacted the Volunteer Protection Act. As you may recall, the Volunteer Protection Act provides liability protections to individuals serving their communities as volunteers. After bringing several volunteer protection amendments to the floor throughout the 1990's and introducing the Volunteer Protection Act during the 104th Congress, I was honored to work with our colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell, to steer this measure through the 105th Congress and have it enacted in 1997.  Now, we need to extend similar liability protections to our nation's teachers, principals, and education professionals who are responsible for the safety of our children when they are at school.  Everyone agrees that providing a safe, orderly environment is a critical component of ensuring that every child is able to reach their full academic potential. Teachers who are unable to maintain order in the classroom cannot reasonably be expected to share their knowledge with their pupils, whether it be in math, science, or literature. Disruptive, rowdy, and sometimes violent students not only threaten the immediate safety of their classmates, they threaten the very future of our children by denying them the opportunity to learn.  Unfortunately, teachers, principals, and other education officials share an impediment in their efforts to ensure that students can learn in a safe, orderly learning environment: the fear of lawsuits. All too often, these hard-working professionals find their reasonable actions to instill discipline and maintain order are questioned and second guessed by opportunistic trial lawyers.  Today's teachers will tell you that the threat of litigation is in the back of their minds and forces them at times to act in a manner which might not be in the best interests of their students. A 1999 survey of secondary school principals found that 25 percent of the respondents were involved in lawsuits or out-of-court settlements in the previous two years--an amazing 270 percent increase from only ten years earlier. The same survey found that 20 percent of principals spent 5-10 hours a week in meetings or documenting events in an effort to avoid litigation. This is time that our educators should spend counseling students, developing curriculum, and maintaining order--not fending off frivolous lawsuits.  The legislation is structured similarly to the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and is nearly identical to teacher protection legislation introduced by Paul Coverdell (S. 1721) in the 106th Congress. Simply put, the bill extends a national standard to protect from liability those teachers, principals, and education professionals who act in a reasonable manner to maintain order in the classroom. It does not preempt those States that have already taken action to address this problem and it allows any state legislature that disagrees with these strong protections to opt out at any time. Since this bill builds on Sen. Coverdell's fine work, my colleagues and I thought it would be highly appropriate that it bear his name.  At the same time, it is important to note that this legislation is not a ``carte blanche'' for that minuscule minority of school officials who abuse their authority. The bill does not protect those teachers who engage in ``willful misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety'' of a student. Nor does the bill preclude schools or local law enforcement entities from taking criminal, civil, or administrative actions against a teacher who acts improperly. Rather, the bill is simply designed to protect those teachers, principals, and educational professionals who act responsibly from frivolous lawsuits.  From a historical context, this is not new ground for our colleagues in the Senate. During the 106th Congress, Senator Coverdell sucessfully included his legislation in the Senate's verison of the ESEA Reauthorization bill. Unfortunately, as we all know, efforts to reauthorize the ESEA stalled on the Senate floor. It is now appropriate for the Senate to revisit this issue, and I hope give its full endorsement.  I look forward to working with my fellow original co- sponsors and the rest of the Senate to see that these important protections are enacted into law on behalf of America's hard working and dedicated teachers.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 316       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. TEACHER LIABILITY PROTECTION.       The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20      U.S.C 6301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:                ``TITLE XV--TEACHER LIABILITY PROTECTION     ``SEC. 15001.
