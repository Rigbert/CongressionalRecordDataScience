 We simply do not have it. Therefore, unless Congress enacts this amendment, Social Security funds will be used to balance the budget.  No other way around it. No talk is going to change it. No pounding the breast is going to change it. No vows taken with blood or wine or anything else is going to change it. It will be enshrined in the Constitution of the United States and $3 trillion of money paid in FICA taxes by young people in this country, working men and women, will be used to pay for agriculture, to pay for HUD, to pay for education, to pay for this highway project or that highway project.  I believe that is violative of a public trust, and I believe that what this amendment is all about should not be to gut Social Security, and that is exactly what we would be doing, if we don't exclude Social Security.  So we have taken care of that argument. Congress does not have the option of later excluding Social Security in implementation language.  It is very clear. A vote for a balanced budget amendment that does not have this amendment in it is clearly a vote that puts Social Security on budget and takes its surplus. Let there be no doubt about it.                      [[Page S2365]] Charge Three  Exempting Social Security could create a Social Security deficit.  Actually, the exact opposite is true. Excluding Social Security from the balanced budget amendment protects it while including it in the balanced budget amendment guts it. If you put Social Security in the budget, it is not to protect it. It is to use its revenues and thus increase its insolvency.  In 60 years of Social Security history, the trust funds have never run a deficit. They cannot. If trust funds run out of money, benefits cannot be paid. It is that simple and straightforward.                              Charge Four  Excluding Social Security would allow the Government to gamble with Social Security funds.  According to the Republican policy committee report, and I quote,       Congress might stop using Social Security surpluses to buy      Government securities and let the Social Security trustees      try their hand in the private market. They could start      gambling with trust fund reserves by acquiring industries,      buying up real estate, taking a chance on cattle futures or      speculating on foreign currencies.  Mr. President, to that I say nonsense. To that I say baloney. That is pure flimflam. Social Security is off budget today, and the trust funds are not allowed to be invested anywhere except U.S. Treasury bonds. And they are the safest investment in the world. If they go, our Government goes.  Social Security has never been allowed, nor will it ever be allowed under this amendment, to use trust fund reserves to buy up real estate or cattle futures or to speculate on foreign currencies. This charge is pure obfuscation. It is pure fantasy.  Under this amendment, Social Security would still be required to invest in U.S. Treasury bonds, and there is nearly $5 trillion today of Federal governmental debt. The U.S. Treasury will continue to issue bonds and Social Security will continue to purchase those bonds.  The biggest difference between the practice today and the practice if the balanced budget amendment excluding Social Security is adopted is that when the constitutional amendment takes effect, the U.S. deficit will actually shrink--shrink--for nearly the next two decades, not grow.  And to my mind that is fiscally prudent. As the debt shrinks, interest rates drop. This means businesses can expand and hire new workers, Americans can afford new homes and pay for college for their children. Shrinking the debt is the right objective, and that will happen under this amendment for the next two decades.  Mr. President, in conclusion. I have listened to all the arguments about what is wrong with our amendment to exclude Social Security, but they all boil down to one thing: Members of Congress simply want to use the money to balance the budget.  That is not a real argument. That is a failure to deal truthfully with the American people. To loot Social Security is morally wrong and I cannot support it.  I want to support, as I said before, a balanced budget amendment and I am prepared to do so if Social Security is excluded. Rather than argue about this amendment, my colleagues who support a constitutional balanced budget amendment as I do, why not do the right thing and accept this amendment to exclude Social Security? Then we can move forward in a bipartisan way and get this country back on the right track again.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
