President, I will be very brief.  To respond to my friend from Pennsylvania, No. 1, none of what he has discussed has come up in the Senate Finance Committee. What I can tell you about past debates is that our side was always interested in reform-minded ideas, for example, bringing the private sector into the delivery system of Medicaid. That is No. 1. No. 2, we still have not seen the skinny bill.  I said earlier: Who knows what happened at the Republican Senate lunch between one course and another. We would like to see the skinny bill. I think, once again, we have heard from the other side that they disagree with the umpire. They disagree with the impartial CBO, and I think that is unfortunate.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
