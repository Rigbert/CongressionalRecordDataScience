 President, I want our colleagues to know we are trying to work as diligently as possible to move forward at this time. The Senator from New Jersey wants 10 minutes to speak, and after that I think we can start moving on some of the amendments. So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey to speak for 10 minutes.
