We put these judges through the Senate Judiciary Committee often with a unanimous vote and then they wait here months and months to get a vote on the floor. As the distinguished Senator from Florida noted, that vote is then virtually unanimous.  This effort where if somebody is nominated by President Obama they must be blocked, even if it is somebody everyone supports, is totally unfair to the President, it is completely unfair to the country, but it is devastating to the judiciary because good men and women are not going to be willing to take nominations or appointments to be a Federal judge if they think they are going to wait month after month after month or even a year before they go on the bench.  I appreciate the statement of the distinguished senior Senator from Florida and I share his frustration.
