President, a little later today we are going to receive from the House of Representatives a spending bill which, if passed, will fund the government for the remainer of this fiscal year, which ends on September 30. Included in that vote today are two other votes, separate votes, which were insisted on by the House Republicans. One of the votes will defund Planned Parenthood across the United States.  Under title X, a law which was proposed by President Nixon and passed by Congress--and supported for over 40 years since--we have provided money across America to clinics that take care of women, children, and families who otherwise would have no place to turn.  One of the recipients of those funds is Planned Parenthood.
