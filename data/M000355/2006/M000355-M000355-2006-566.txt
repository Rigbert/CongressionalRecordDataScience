 President, today the Senate unanimously and overwhelmingly passed the Defense authorization bill. I take this opportunity to congratulate Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Levin for the expeditious consideration of that bill.  We had a very important debate concerning two amendments related to the Iraq war. I thought the debate was very respectful and the Senate conducted itself in an extraordinarily exemplary way.  Mr. President, the Senate will be in tomorrow for a period of morning business.  On Monday, we will begin consideration of the anti-flag desecration resolution. We will announce the vote schedule for the beginning of next week during tomorrow's session.                          ____________________[Page S6442]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
