President, I want to touch on one other issue not related to the Estrada nomination before I yield the floor. It will take me about 15 minutes to complete the presentation I am about to make. Then I will be happy to yield the floor. It relates to a decision that was made this week by a county in New York, Suffolk County. They took a historic step to protect the residents of their county from harm, even the dangerous and deadly harm of dietary supplements. You know about these dietary supplements. You cannot walk into any drugstore or turn on the TV or go to a convenience store or a gas station that you don't see someone trying to sell us a pill to make us thin. These dietary supplements, I guess, help some people to loseweight. Doctors argue back and forth about that.  It turns out that some of these dietary supplements contain a chemical--a naturally occurring chemical--called ephedra, which is dangerous. Suffolk County in Long Island banned the sale of ephedra products because the Suffolk County Department of Health Services determined that ``dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloid are too dangerous to be sold within the county of Suffolk.''  Last year, the U.S. Army moved to protect service men and women and the employees who use the base by also banning the sale of ephedra products in commissaries across the United States.  Sadly, it would seem that despite these decisions by local and State governments and by some agencies of the Federal Government, our Federal Government, in general, and particularly our Department of Health and Human Services, has consistently refused to take the necessary action to protect America's families and children from products containing ephedra.  Since last August, I have repeatedly called on Secretary Tommy Thompson, and I renew the call today, to ban ephedra products in the United States. The Secretary has the authority to do so. There is no excuse for the delay. I have asked him to use his authority under DSHEA to declare ephedra an imminent hazard and take it off the market, in the same way as it was done in Suffolk County and other cities and counties, and in certain States it was done in our military posts. The Secretary has refused to respond. His responses have not been helpful.  As chairman of the Government Oversight Committee, last year, I held two hearings on this topic, challenging this administration to act. I am not the only one who has done so. Last year, the Canadian Government banned products containing ephedra. They said you cannot sell them there because they are too dangerous. They kill people.  What kind of products am I talking about? Are these weird, remote things you never run across? No. Metabolife--have you ever heard of it? They do a lot of advertising. Metabolife diet pills--an energy supplement, they call it, to help you lose weight. They do sell a product that contains ephedra. This is what I am talking about. These are the drugs that can be a danger to certain people. There are others. One is called Yellow Jackets. I will get to that in a moment because there is a sad and tragic story about these. It says ``built as an extreme energizer.''  I recently went to a junior high school in Springfield, IL, and I asked the boys and girls: How many have heard of Yellow Jackets? Half of the kids raised their hands. Do you know why. You don't need a prescription. You can walk into any convenience store or gas station and you can buy them two or three at a time.  Sadly, these pills taken by kids can kill them--kill them. I will tell you of a sad story where it occurred near my home. I have given this information to Secretary Thompson. He has ignored it. Nothing has happened. There are no excuses now for what we presently face. The best he can give us is, he says these products ought to have stronger warning labels.  What would a warning label say if it was honest about the product ephedra? It would have to say if you are going to take Metabolife, for example, which is known as a dietary supplement and classified as a food under our strange Federal laws, if you were going to take this product, here is the warning label you would have to put on it: Taking this food product will increase your risk of heart attack, stroke, seizure, and death.  Can one think of another food product sold in America where we identify on the label that it can be lethal if you take it? In most cases, in most civilized nations, we would not allow a product that could kill you to be sold as a food product in any circumstance.  Some people argue, you can take enough aspirin to kill you. This is all true, but when it comes to this product, they are selling it to children--this Yellow Jacket product and this product, Metabolife--to virtually anybody who can put money on the counter, with no warning as to the potential of harm.  In reality, how can the Secretary rely on warning labels for a product that is found to be so dangerous? Let me make it clear, the only reasonable step to take is to take these products off the market. If this administration, and particularly Secretary Thompson, continues to delay this decision, sadly he will have to answer the question of how he can account for the numerous people who continue to lose their lives because of these dangerous products.  The Secretary has the power under existing law to take these products off the market. He has failed and refused to do so. As the Department delays, terrible things occur.  I told you I would recount an incident involving this particular product, Yellow Jacket. Last September, in Lincoln, IL, a few miles from where I live, a young man 16 years old, a healthy, athletic, high school student named Sean Riggins was getting ready for a football game. He went to a local convenience store and bought Yellow Jackets, an extreme energizer. You will find them for sale. You are going to find them in North Dakota. You are going to find them as well in Rhode Island. You are going to find them in Ohio. They are everywhere.  This boy bought this product, grabbed a Mountain Dew, which contains caffeine, washed it down, and died. He bought them at a convenience store, washed them down, and died. It is incredible to think this could happen, and the autopsy confirmed this was the reason for his death.  When we say to Secretary Thompson, for God's sake, protect the children from this happening again, he waits, he fails to respond. He says he is thinking about it.  On September 6 last year, because of these Yellow Jackets, Sean Riggins, a healthy, athletic high school student had a massive heart attack and died. When you look around the Senate, you will see pages working on the floor in the Senate. It is a time-honored tradition. These are young men and women of high school age. When you look at them, you are looking at a person of the age of Sean Riggins who thought he was doing the right thing to get ready for a football game. Sadly, he was preparing for a funeral--his own.  He was the only child of Deb and Kevin Riggins from Lincoln, IL. His parents, thank God, have decided to go on a crusade to try to protect other kids. They turned their grief to positive action. They set up the Sean Riggins Foundation for Substance-Free Schools. I commend them for their courage. They are going to coaches, teachers, and parents saying: For goodness sake, talk to your kids about this. We know about marijuana; we know about cocaine; we know about heroin; we have to do our part in telling them how dangerous it can be. We know how dangerous tobacco and alcohol are. We are ignoring the obvious. These are for sale everywhere. They are cheap and kids are buying them. Let me be honest with you; some kids buy these pills and drink beer with them and think this is a brand new high and die as a result--Metabolife, Yellow Jackets, and a variety of other names.  The question before us now is, Should we act? And the answer is obviously yes. Mr. President, did you know the NCAA, the National Football League, and the International Olympic Committee have all moved to protect their athletes by banning ephedra? And yet, Secretary Thompson refuses to protect innocent children who buy this product.  The Rigginses are not alone in their grief. The Suffolk County, NY, ban I mentioned was imposed this week was also as a result of a young person's death. In 1996, Peter Schlendorf of Northport, Long Island, 20 years old, died from taking ephedra. His parents have joined the Rigginses in this sad alliance in the memory of their sons to try to warn parents.  The 7-Eleven stores--we see them all around--used to be one of the stores that sold ephedra products. They decided it is not safe. They will not carry ephedra products anymore.  Think about it; all this action is taking place without the Federal Government stepping in to protect us. That is hard to believe.  There are also lawsuits underway. The trial lawyers of America are convenient whipping boys. People blame them for a lot of things--too many frivolous lawsuits, high insurance rates, and the like. The fact is, if the trial lawyers of America were not suing this industry, changes would nottake place because this Government is not doing its job. This administration is not doing its job.  If we look at the situation, Metabolife is now peddling a product they say is free of ephedra. They want to make it clear you have a choice. They are trying to figure a way to back off the thousands and thousands of bottles of this product they have already sold.  In October, a Federal jury found Metabolife 356, this dietary supplement, containing ephedra that was ``unreasonably dangerous,'' although you can buy it over the counter without a prescription, and awarded four injured Americans $4.1 million to compensate them for their injuries and the wanton bad behavior of the Metabolife Company. Many other cases have been settled with large awards.  The action is in the courts because there is no action in Washington. Secretary Thompson and the Department of Health and Human Services refuses to respond, refuses to act. People die, and their survivors go to court holding these companies responsible. Why isn't this Government holding these companies responsible? Why aren't we banning the sale of these products now?  The medical evidence is overwhelming. In January of this year, researchers from Yale, the University of Texas at Houston, the University of Michigan, the University of Cincinnati, and Brown University reported in the journal Neurology that those taking one-third of the manufacturer's recommended daily dose of these ephedra products increase their risk of hemorrhagic stroke three times. In February, an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that ephedra use associated with a greatly increased risk for adverse reactions compared with other herbs, and the authors suggested its use should be restricted.  This study found ephedra use resulted in a 720-times increase in adverse reactions compared to ginkgo biloba use and in hundredfold more adverse reactions compared to other herbs that were used which they think are safe. Secretary Thompson knows this. The medical evidence is there.  Metabolife, when they were asked to produce information for Congressman Waxman and myself, said in 1999, for example, they did not have any instance of anybody taking their pills and having a bad result. But when Congressman Waxman and I, as well as the trial lawyers, put them on the spot and made them produce all the information sent to them, we found 100 people before 1999 with serious adverse reactions, including heart attack and stroke.  These companies selling these products have been irresponsible in the marketing of this product. They sell them to children. They know they cause adverse health consequences, and they continue to do so because this Government will not step in and stop them. The burden is on Secretary Thompson and the Bush administration. Do not look the other way. Do not ignore the deaths that are occurring. Do not ignore the fact that 23 States have now moved to restrict the sale of these products because the Federal Government refuses to accept its responsibility.  It is time for us to act and to act now before there are more innocent victims.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Ohio.                          Tribute to Jim McKee  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear and cherished friend, a mentor and a role model, former Yellow Springs, OH, chief of police of 34 years, Jim McKee, who passed away on January 18 of this year at the age of 73.  Raised in Springfield, OH, Jim McKee moved to Yellow Springs when he was 18 years old, fresh out of high school, in search of a job. During his first year in Yellow Springs, Jim held a number of different positions, working in a shoe repair shop and later at Mills Lawn Elementary School.  It was at Mills Lawn Elementary School that I first met my future wife Frances, in first grade, but it was also at Mills Lawn I first met Jim McKee. Jim was the person who kept things going at Mills Lawn. I remember how much respect, love, and admiration the students had for Jim.  I first saw in Jim the ability he had to connect with people. I saw it as a child. I remember he would gather the students together and talk to them about how we needed to keep the place looking good and how important that was. I remember how we looked up to him and how much we respected him.  Eventually, Jim McKee took a job at Wright Patterson Air Force Base near my hometown of Yellow Springs. But by 1957, Jim decided he needed to move on. True to form, Jim saw this change not as a bad thing but really as a new opportunity to do something he had always dreamed of doing, and that was to get involved in law enforcement. This was his chance, his opportunity. Before long, he was realizing that dream. The village of Yellow Springs then hired him as a police officer. He joined a department of two officers and a chief, a small department at the time. Within 2 short years and the recognition of his talent and his hard work, Jim McKee was appointed chief of police.  In this new leadership position, Jim McKee soon found himself dealing with issues he probably did not think he was going to be dealing with, issues of historic importance, because at that time the civil rights movement was beginning to sweep our country. The civil rights movement had reached Yellow Springs, a small community in southwest Ohio, my hometown. It reached Yellow Springs sooner than most other parts of the country.  Jim McKee was one of the few African-American chiefs of police in the State of Ohio. Jim McKee guided my hometown with great skill through a very difficult period of time. As one of the few African-American chiefs of police in the State, really one of the few in the country at the time, Jim McKee faced his own civil rights issues early on in the movement. Everybody in Yellow Springs, a community then and now of great diversity and a community that then and now embodies a person's right to free speech, everybody in Yellow Springs respected and liked Jim McKee. That made all the difference in the world.  Whether Jim realized it or not during this tumultuous era, Jim was in fact playing a part in our American history. Jim McKee kept the peace, maintained order, and all the while respected people's freedom of speech, their right to demonstrate, and their civil rights. He did it in a professional way.  I remember when Dr. Martin Luther King came to Yellow Springs to deliver the commencement address at Antioch College. Chief McKee, of course, provided his security detail. Years later, recalling this experience with Dr. King, Chief McKee had this to say:       At the time there were rumors they were out to get him. I      saw him do his nonviolent teachings. I drove around in the      car with him for 2 days. He was a perfect Christian gentleman      and I was frightened to death because I was providing his      security. We told people he was staying at the Antioch Inn,      but in fact he was right across the street from where I      live--in the home his wife, Coretta, lived in as a student at      Antioch years before. You would think they would have figured      it out, with all the police cruisers parked out front. I was      never so glad to see a plane take off.  Despite whatever concerns Jim McKee may have had, the chief performed his duties with a great sense of professionalism, with honor and courage. Though he dealt with significant issues on the national stage, Chief McKee dedicated his career to Yellow Springs and to keeping the community he loved so much safe and free from crime.  As Members of the Senate know--or may not know--Yellow Springs is not a large city. It is a village. It is a small village where people know their neighbors and watch out for one another. Even today, I believe there are probably only about eight or so police officers on the force. Chief McKee, as the local police chief, was really an icon in his own community. He was greatly admired and respected as an officer, as a protector, but most of all as a friend.  Though I first met him as an elementary school student, actually in the first grade, I had the opportunity later on to reconnect with him. Our lives came together again when I became assistant county prosecuting attorney and he was by that time the dean of the chiefs of police in Greene County. I knew him then and later when I became the prosecutor of our home county. We worked on a number of cases that arose out of Yellow Springs, several very difficult rape cases. Weworked on several of those cases together. During this time, I learned a great deal about how Chief McKee treated people and how he dealt with some of the most tense situations. Perhaps most importantly, though, I saw his great sense of humanity toward both victims and suspects.  Chief Jim McKee taught me there is much more to police work than arrests and convictions. He taught me about the human component in police work. He taught me about people and about compassion.  I remember one instance in particular when I saw and learned about how Jim McKee dealt with a man who had been in an auto accident. This man was involved in a horrible thing, as many accidents are, but he came out of it. He walked out of the accident, but the other person in the other vehicle did not and the other person died. This particular person was actually a suspect, and he could have been charged. The police were looking at and trying to decide whether to charge him. Actually, later on there was a grand jury that was convened. The grand jury had to make a decision whether this person was going to be charged and have to stand trial. Eventually they decided not to charge him, but Jim did not know that at the time. I saw how Jim dealt with this man and showed this man, who was going through great anguish at the time, a man who was really a suspect, and I saw how Jim worked him through this, talked to him and showed great kindness to him. That is how Jim McKee treated everyone, with great kindness and with great compassion, all the time being a professional, all the time doing his job.  It was this compassion that set Jim McKee apart. He cared deeply about people and just knew how to deal with them.  At the end of Chief McKee's distinguished 36-year career in law enforcement, I had the honor of attending his farewell banquet. I was lieutenant governor at the time and was there to pay tribute to the chief on behalf of the entire State of Ohio, and on behalf of Governor, then-Governor George Voinovich. At this reception and this dinner, I was struck by the sheer outpouring of respect and admiration and appreciation for Chief McKee's work and for his selfless contributions to our community. It was clear at this reception how important Chief McKee was to the people, to the village of Yellow Springs, and to the entire law enforcement community across the State of Ohio. I was proud to be part of this memorable event.  Following his retirement from the force in 1993, Chief McKee remained active in the community until the day he died. He was a key member of the Yellow Springs Men's Group, an organization dedicated to studying issues important to the day-to-day lives of Yellow Springs residents. Through this organization, the James A. McKee scholarship fund was established in 2002 as a tribute both to Jim and to his legacy of community involvement.  In the recent days following Jim's death, a number of newspapers ran articles about his life and his legacy. As I read through these tributes, I was especially taken with a statement from my friend, Paul Ford, who had known Chief McKee since 1949. This is what Mr. Ford said:       We've lost a good citizen, a good friend, and a      humanitarian. Once you met Jim, you were a friend.  Indeed, Jim McKee was my friend and someone for whom I had great affection and admiration. This quote really gets to why Chief McKee was so special to the community of Yellow Springs and to all of us who knew him. He dedicated his life to serving the people of Yellow Springs. He worked to keep his community safe and free from crime.  When I think about Jim McKee and his life's work as a police officer, protector of the community, I am reminded of a Bible passage from Matthew: Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God.  Indeed, Chief Jim McKee was a peacemaker and a protector and just a good and decent hard-working man. He was a kind person, a kind human being who always tried to do the right thing for his family, for his community, and for his Nation.  My wife Fran and I extend our heartfelt sympathy and our prayers for the entire McKee family, for his wife of 54 years, Naomi; his four daughters, Bari McKee-Teamor, Karen McKee, Jean McKee, Sandra McKee-Smith; his son, Jimmy, his five grandchildren, and one great grandson. Jim McKee loved his family. He cared deeply for them. I know they, like all of us, will miss him tremendously.  Thank you, Jim, for all you did for Yellow Springs and for our Nation. You will be remembered always in our minds and in our hearts.  I yield the floor.
