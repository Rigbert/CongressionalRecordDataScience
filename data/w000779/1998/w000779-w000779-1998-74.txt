President, I would like to engage the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy to clarify the funding provided for Portland Light Rail. The Committee Report on the Transportation Appropriations Bill has a single line item for the Portland Westside and South-North Light Rail projects. However, the Committee report description is ambiguous as to how the funding provided may be used. The description reads:       Portland Westside and south-north LRT projects.--The      Committee recommends $26,700,000 for the Portland Westside      LRT project. . . .  The report then goes on to describe both projects. It is the Committee's intention to provide this funding for both the Westside and south-north project?
