Speaker, we are learning new information each day about just how critical the first 3 years of life are for a child's brain development, intellectual growth, and emotional, social, and moral development. These factors will help determine the health and productivity of a child in later life. In 1993, the National Education Goals Panel reported that nearly half of infants in the United States do not have what they need to grow and thrive. High quality care from a parent or other adult is necessary to facilitate growth and development. Five million children under age 3 are in the care of other adults while their parents work outside the home. Parents of very young children have few child care service options. Many cannot afford to stay home with their children or to pay for safe, high quality developmental child care services. The Federal Government's involvement in the development of our children and grandchildren has become even more critical.  Child care providers are a valuable asset to their communities. Their contributions to providing quality child care is the backbone to economic stability throughout this country. For example, over 85 percent of the children in child care in southern Maryland participate because their parents work. Without quality child care options, parents will not be able to provide their children with the early childhood development they need to get a quality start to their future.  Child care needs in Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary's Counties in southern Maryland are a prime example of the national need for quality child care. In 1990, the number of children under age 3 in these three counties ranged between 2,500 and 5,000. Child care providers in southern Maryland, and throughout the country, are doing a good job at meeting child care needs, but there is the possibility that resources will become strained in the future. Child care providers cannot provide quality services without the Federal Government's support.  I have been committed to ensuring that the Federal Government provide sufficient resources to increase the quality of child care throughout the country. One of the programs that I have focused on is the Child Care and Development Block Grant. This program makes funds available for child care services and activities to improve the availability, accessibility, and affordability of child care. A portion of the funding is set aside to improve the quality and availability of healthy and safe child care for all families, including quality activities such as training.  The Child Care and Development Block Grant was reauthorized last year as part of the welfare reform bill. A portion of this legislation permitted a slight increase in funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant. But, in order for child care providers to be able to provide the type of quality care we all want for our children and grandchildren, they need to have access to sufficient resources.  This is why Congresswoman DeLauro, Congressman McGovern, and I are working toward getting child care providers the resources they need by further increasing the amount of funding that goes toward the Child Care and Development Block Grant. The Early Learning and Opportunity Act, which we introduced, does just that. The bill creates flexible, competitive State grants to improve the quality of care for children under age 3. In addition, it increases funding for Head Start and more than doubles funding for Early Head Start, a crucial component to quality child care.  The White House is hosting a conference in October on child care. The national attention to be focused on quality child care during this conference will be critical. I am confident that it will lead to local and national quality child care improvements. I look forward to participating in this conference and working with other Members of Congress to ensure that early childhood education and child care funding this country so desperately needs becomes available.                          ____________________
