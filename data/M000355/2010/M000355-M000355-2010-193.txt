  It has one thing in common with every other version they have offered: it adds new taxes and over $30 billion to an already staggering $13 trillion national debt despite consistent bipartisan rejection of that idea.  Both sides have offered ways to address the programs in this bill that both sides agree should be extended. And now we even agree on redirecting untimely and untargeted money from the failed stimulus bill. The only difference is that the Republican proposal reduces the deficit while the Democrat proposal adds to it.  So the only thing Democrats are insisting on in this debate is that we add to the debt.  The principle they are defending here is not some program. The principle Democrats are defending is that they will not pass a bill unless it adds to the debt.                          ____________________
