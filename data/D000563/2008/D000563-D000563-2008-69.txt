President, we are honored being the home of your mother's birthplace. I failed to mention one other bill that I think is so important, and that is the extraordinary assistance Senator Warner gave to his colleague, Senator Webb, when it came to the new GI bill. That bill passed, and it will dramatically improve the lives of so many veterans and their families because we stepped forward in a bipartisan fashion. It was the first thing Senator Webb said to me as a new Senator was his goal, and he would be the first to add he could never have achieved it without the support of his colleague from Virginia.
