  The EFFECT Act will provide tax incentives to encourage homeowners and businesses to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings and equipment. This legislation will stimulate the economy, cut energy bills, reduce energy usage, and reduce pollution.  This bill was originally introduced in the 107th Congress to address the Western energy crisis which, as we all know, created exorbitantly high prices for power and rolling blackouts. This legislation incorporates improvements based on last year's Senate energy tax bill.  While conditions in the West have improved because there are more plants coming online and families and businesses have reduced their energy usage, it is important to take steps to continue to increase our energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption.  Simply put, there are only two things one can do when there is not enough power to go around: increase supply or decrease demand.  Without a doubt, the quickest way to address future demand and supply imbalances is to provide incentives to increase energy efficiency to reduce demand.  This bill creates economic incentives for Americans to increase energy efficiency by establishing the following tax deductions and tax credits for commercial and residential properties using specific energy efficient technologies:  A tax deduction of $2.25 per square foot for newly constructed or remodeled commercial buildings, including schools and other public buildings as well as rental housing, that achieve a 50-percent reduction in total annual energy costs, compared to existing national standards.  A $2,000 tax credit to builders of new homes that use 50 percent less energy than a national model standard.  A performance-based tax credit of as much as $6,000 for installing solar technology.  A tax credit of as much as $300 if businesses install a super-efficient, new electric heat pump, a new central air-conditioner, or a new gas or electric water heater.  A tax credit of as much as $500 if homeowners, tenants, or landlords retrofit their homes to achieve a 30 percent or 50 percent reduction in annual energy costs.  The benefits of increasing energy efficiency are immense.  First, increasing energy efficiency will cut heating, cooling, and electricity costs. Homeowners and businesses spend over $250 billion each year on heat, air-conditioning, and related energy costs for their businesses and homes. If we can reduce energy costs by increasing energy efficiency, money will be freed to fuel the economy in other areas and create new jobs. Furthermore, increasing energy efficiency will reduce the impact of future energy price spikes that harm families and businesses. And the incentives will cause businesses to invest in producing more efficient equipment and services beginning immediately after the bill is enacted.  Second, increasing energy efficiency will reduce air pollution. Energy generation to heat, cool, and light our homes and offices produces 35 percent of the air pollution emitted nationwide. If we increase efficiency, then less energy will be needed to power our buildings, and consequently, we will be able to reduce emissions from powerplants.  Third, increasing energy efficiency will help maintain the reliability of our Nation's electricity supply. Since most of our peak electricity demand comes from heating, cooling, or lighting needs, increasing energy efficiency will lower the probability of blackouts or brownouts.  In fact, with this legislation in place, peak electricity demand in the summer would be reduced by tens of thousands of negawatts nationwide after a decade--or the equivalent output produced by hundreds of large powerplants.  This could result in over 10,000 MW of savings over the summer just in our State and much more on the Western grid that California shares with neighboring States.  Meanwhile, this legislation will also create a market for firms to develop more energy-efficient products, such as air-conditioners, heat pumps, lighting equipment, windows, insulation, water heaters, and solar panels.  Just think how conditions could have improved in California during the Western energy crisis if we had been able to reduce our energy consumption instead of purchasing power at exorbitant rates from out-of-State suppliers.  According to the Department of Energy, California is already one of the most energy-efficient States in the Nation--ranking fourth in overall energy efficiency and second in electricity efficiency.  Nevertheless, Californians responded to the crisis and further increased their energy efficiency. This legislation will take energy efficiency to the next level and create the opportunity for all families and businesses nationwide to make energy efficient improvements.  Instead of waiting for the next energy emergency to occur, we should take steps now to reduce energy consumption across the board.  The bill introduced in the 107th Congress had the support of California Governor Gray Davis, the California Energy Commission, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Union of Concerned Scientists, the California Building Industry Association, most California utilities and many other organizations and businesses. We expect similar widespread support for the bill we are reintroducing today.  This bill is an important step to help reduce demand. It provides financial incentives to offset some of the costs of building new energy-efficient buildings and homes, and improving existing structures to make them more energy efficient.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
