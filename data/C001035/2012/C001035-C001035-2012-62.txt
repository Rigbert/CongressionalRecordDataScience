 Mr. President, I urge support of Senator DeMint's amendment. It protects the first amendment rights of postal workers by requiring that unions obtain prior approval from workers before spending their dues on political purposes.  I think this is probably the one and only amendment where I will diverge with my chairman, but I do urge support of Senator DeMint's amendment.
