Speaker, it is with great pride and sincerity that I wish to congratulate Monsignor Joseph Semancik as he celebrates the 50th anniversary of his ordination into the priesthood. He will be honored by his parishioners with a luncheon following an 11:00 am Mass at Sacred Heart Parish in East Chicago, Indiana on Sunday, May 2, 2003.  A native of Northwest Indiana, Monsignor Semancik was born in Whiting on March 3, 1929 to Frank Semancik and Lillian Duray. He attended St. John the Baptist School and Catholic Central High School. After graduating from high school, Monsignor Semancik's passion for his faith led him to study at Sacred Heart Seminary in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and later at St. Meinrad Seminary in Southern Indiana. He was ordained into the priesthood on May 1, 1953, and this important event became a stepping stone for his lifelong dedication to the citizens of Northwest Indiana.  Monsignor Semancik began his career as an Assistant Priest for Assumption Parish in East Chicago and at St. Catherine of Siena in Hammond, Indiana. He was appointed administrator at Sacred Heart Parish in 1960, a position he held until being named pastor at Holy Trinity Church in Gary in 1969. After five years as pastor for Holy Trinity, MonsignorSemancik returned to Sacred Heart as pastor, a position he has held to this day.  Mr. Speaker, in addition to his exceptional efforts to guide his congregation at Sacred Heart, Monsignor Semancik also has worked extensively with Catholic Charities in Northwest Indiana. He began his mission with Catholic Charities in 1960, and was named Diocesan Director in 1962, a position he held until 1998. Under his guidance, the agency provided social services throughout the four counties that comprise Northwest Indiana and expanded to seven offices throughout the region. Monsignor Semancik has also served Catholic Charities, USA as a member of the Board of Directors, as well as serving as a member of the Study Cadre that redirected the mission of Catholic Charities. He also ably served as Chairman of various Catholic Charities's committees.  Monsignor Semancik has also enriched the Northwest Indiana community through his work in other community organizations, such as serving as the President of both the Lake County Economic Opportunity Council and the Lake County Community Development Council. He was one of the founders of the Indiana Catholic Conference and of the Hospice of the Calumet Area. He has received many commendations for his work, including the Sagamore of the Wabash Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Governor of Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Monsignor Joseph Semancik as he celebrates the 50th anniversary of his ordination into the priesthood. Monsignor Semancik has been a fixture in Northwest Indiana throughout his career in the ministry, and he has touched the lives of many throughout the community. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to those in need is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
