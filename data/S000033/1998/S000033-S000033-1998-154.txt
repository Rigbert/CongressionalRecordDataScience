 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record these statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young people will benefit my colleagues    Statement by Erica Lewis and Dan Johnson regarding Drunk Driving       ERICA LEWIS: We would like to express a concern that is      becoming a big issue with teen Vermonters today. Our concern      is probably the same as many others: Teen driving under the      influence of alcohol       Young adults are usually both inexperienced drivers as well      as inexperienced drinkers. These two combined is a fatality      waiting to happen. Alcohol, when consumed, decreases      alertness, causes depression, nausea, unconsciousness,      hangovers, and possible overdose, which could lead to death.      We, as teenagers, should be aware of the serious risks that      are involved when wrong choices are made and lives are at      stake. Driving should be considered a privilege, not a right,      for we all have the right to be safe while driving, and when      alcohol is involved, no one can predict the outcome. Anyone      of us here today could be driving down the road next week      and, because of a drunk driver, never make it to where we      were headed. Because of this increasing problem, there needs      to be more awareness of alcohol and its effects. It is up to      us, the younger generation, to make an impression on our      peers and those that follow, and most of all to prove to our      elders that we have what it takes to make the right decisions      and follow through.       There is no overall solution to this problem, but we, as      mature young adults, should make a strong effort to plan      ahead before it gets to a point where it might be too late,      whether that be make arrangements for a designated driver or      staying until you are capable of driving.       DAN JOHNSON. A suggestion that we have and strongly agree      with is a paper called a contract for life. It is an      agreement between teenagers and their parents stating, if at      any given time that either they feel incapable of driving,      there will be transportation provided, and safe      transportation for them. This contract was given to us from      our drivers ed teachers at the Essex Technical Center. Other      suggestions that we agree with is larger penalties for adults      in furnishing alcohol for minors at stores to sell this. Teen      drinking and driving will always be a problem, but,      hopefully, with our help, we can reduce it. Thank you for our      time.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS. A very important contribution to this      discussion. Thank very much. Statement by Bill Doe, Nick Bullard, Mike Currier and Heather Doloff              Regarding Teen Drinking and Drug Usage Survey       BILL DOE: First of all, we would like to thank you for      inviting us to this event today. And we would like to make a      minor correction on the program guide. Our presentation is      focused mainly on the alcohol abuse and not so much drug      abuse.       In preparation for this presentation, we conducted a survey      amongst our junior and senior peers. The topic of the survey      was underaged drinking. Some of our survey questions were as      follows:       MIKE CURRIER: It goes: How old are you? Do you drink? If      so, how often? Do you ever drink and drive, or ride with      somebody who has been drinking? Why do you drink? To be      rebellious; tastes good; to get rid of problems; to get      wasted; and, a social drinker. The last question was: What do      you think about lowering the drinking age?       HEATHER DOFOFF: And our results turned out to be most of      the people who drank were age 18, 17, 16, and we had a few      who were aged 19, and we did not take surveys from people      under 16.       On the average, people drink and they tend to drink once or      two times monthly, and a few do drink more than that, and we      did have just under 20 people who we surveyed, out of a      hundred, who did not drink at all.       And, overall, people don't drive when they have been      drinking or don't ride with someone who has been drinking.      Only about 30 people we surveyed said that they did, 10 said      sometimes, and 60 said not at all, which is encouraging.       And the most common cause for people to drink was that they      are a social drinker, which leads me to believe that peer      pressure is playing a large role in it.       BILL DOE: We also found that many of the people that we      interviewed or surveyed, actually, would have liked the      drinking age to be lowered to 16. Now, I tend to think that      was more of a case of not being mature, they want to go out      and party and have a good time, and wouldn't be young enough      to be able to do it legally.       In many countries, you will find the drinking age is very      young, perhaps, I think, 16. And it has proven to actually      work in many countries, I think only because it has kind of      been found as, you know, it is just a given, that is what      their society accepts, and they have grown to a certain      maturity level that they can live with that.       If we were to, perhaps, lower the drinking age, I think we      would have to do it gradually, perhaps like one year at a      time, or lower it to like maybe 20 in five years, or 19 the      next five years, gradually getting down to maybe 18, perhaps.      And maybe then our society will be mature enough to handle it      and perhaps be mature about it.       NICK BULLARD: As you can see from our graphs, we have done      extensive work with certain questions dealing with underage      drinking. In this year alone, the drinking problem in this      state has risen greatly, with numerous deaths resulting. This      is why the State is cracking down on underage drinking, from      the special task force known as START Team to DUI teams.      These peoples' only job is to control drinking and driving in      Vermont. START concentrates only on underage drinking.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Thanks very much.   Statement by Elizabeth Cartier, Anne Mitiguy, Jason Magnani, Eric   Moran, Danielle Pezzimenti and Ted Demulder Regarding Teen Drinking       ELIZABETH CARTIER: Today we would like to express our      concern about alcohol advertising and the effects it has on      youth. Alcohol is the number one drug used among young      people. Eight teenagers a day die due to alcohol-related      accidents. About two-thirds of teenagers who drink say they      can buy their own alcohol. It is said that one out of every      280 babies born today will die in an automobile accident that      is alcohol related. Traffic accidents are the single greatest      cause of death between the ages of 6 and 28. About 47 percent      of these accidents are alcohol-related. 56 percent of      students in grades 5 through 12 say that alcohol advertising      encourages them to drink.       TED DEMULDER: We have a poster to illustrate underage      drinking. There are 10 million underage drinkers in the      United States. Of those 10 million, 4.4 million are binge      drinkers, which means they have 5 drinks or more, and 1.7      million teens drink heavily on a regular basis.       JASON MAGNANI: Teenagers are known to be more susceptible      to alcoholic advertising than adults. This is especially true      when it comes to radio and television broadcasting. In June      of 1996, the Seagrams America Company began running Crown      Royal brand whiskey commercials in Corpus Christi, Texas. It      featured a dog labeled Obedience School Graduate who was      carrying a newspaper. Another dog labeled Valedictorian was      carrying a bottle of Crown Royal. In this ad, Seagrams      positioned liquor as an award for achievement.       When liquor ads started to run on television, public health      groups and government officials reacted in an alarming way.      They said that, by running liquor ads on television, they      would be seen by young people and that sometimes they were      deliberately targeted at young people. In November of '96,      after the liquor ads came out, 26 members of Congress wrote      to the Federal Communications Corporation, urging them to      further investigate the liquor ads on television. They said      that they did not want children to get an image of academic      and athletic success, gained through drinking alcohol      beverages.       ANNE MITIGUY: Consumer and public health groups scoff at      alcohol ads that are aimed at teenagers. They say that beer      is heavily advertised during televised sporting events. These      are mostly watched by high school and college aged students.      The Seagrams ads about the obedience dogs and the Budweiser      frogs are designed to catch the eye of young viewers. The      alcohol industry critics say that young people decide to      sample alcohol because of peer pressure but that advertising      reinforces their inner thoughts. The ads are mostly young,      attractive and healthy-looking adults. Most of the time, you      can't even really tell how old they are. They are drinking      beer, and at the end of the commercial, one of them says ``It      just can't get much better than this.'' These ads don't show      both sides. As they say, it might not get any better, but it      can get a whole lot worse. This is a side that should be      shown more often, but isn't.       TED DEMULDER: In flipping through two mainstream magazines      for our collage, Newsweek and People, we came across various      alcohol advertisements. The Barcardi ads shows an unrealistic      view of what happens to people when they drink. The Absolut      ads have become coffee book material for many teenagers that      collect them. The slogan ``Forget the rules and enjoy the      wine'' shows how irresponsible people are, and basically the      companies are saying anyone can drink.       ERIC MORIN: Because alcohol ads are very glorified and      intensified, more today than ever were before, they can be      very harmful to our generation and generations to come. These      ads exert constant and powerful pressure on today's youth.      With more and more     kids exploring the Internet and the Worldwide web there is a      growing trend of advertising and promotional material.      Oftentimes the corporations use such techniques as up-to-the-     minute sports scores, games and contests to promote their      type of alcohol. With all the advertising that is going on,      there is a growing influence upon youth today. What the      corporations have in mind is that, if they gear their ads      towards young adults, they will start to drink at a younger      age. Once they start to drink, soon the corporation will have      a lifelong customer. Our main concern about ads today is that      they are giving us an unrealistic view about what alcoholic      beverages are and what they can do to you.       Congressman Sanders, after hearing this information, we      leave it in your hands to make proposals to remedy this      problem, such as placing more responsibility on the alcohol      companies to direct their ads at older and more mature      audiences, instituting stricter penalties to whose who      procure alcohol for teens, as well as those teens who try to      purchase it, and initiating a stronger community involvement      with alternatives to alcohol, such as rec centers, sports      leagues, and school-related affairs.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Excellent.                                 ____________________
