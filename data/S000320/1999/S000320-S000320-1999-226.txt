 President, I commend Senator Bingaman for offering this amendment. I believe it is constructive in nature. It is something we believe will, at the end of the day, clarify what we are trying to do. That is what this legislation is all about--to restructure the labs, making it harder for espionage to go on at the labs. So it is a good amendment. I urge that at the proper time we adopt it.
