Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) clearly stated that there is an exemption in this bill on civil rights law and this bill does not apply to the development of new civil rights laws. Further, the survey of the judges that I have referred to in the past, 95 percent of the 751 federal judges believe that the old Rule 11, which the gentleman from Virginia complains of, did not impede the development of the law. That is, 19 judges out of 20 said that the assertion that the gentleman from Virginia made was not correct in their opinion. That is why this bill is a good one and it ought to be passed.
