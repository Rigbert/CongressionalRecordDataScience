President, I would also like to honor the life and sacrifice of Army SSG William D. Scates, of Oklahoma City, OK who died with three other servicemembers on August 11, 2007, of wounds suffered from a roadside bomb while serving his Nation in Arab Jabour, Iraq.  Born March 8, 1976 in Oklahoma City, Dan was a graduate of Western Heights High School and had a lifelong passion to join the military. ``When he was a little boy, he was always drawing pictures of soldiers. That's all he ever wanted to be,'' said his mother. He had been in the Oklahoma Army National Guard before joining the Active Duty Army where he was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, GA.  A memorial service was held September 1, 2007 in Oklahoma City with interment in Fort Bliss National Cemetery in El Paso, TX. His mother Moreana Whitson said her son wanted to be buried there because it was in El Paso where he met his wife Raquel, while in training.  Dan is survived by his wife Raquel; daughters Jade 9, and 7-month-old Kendra; his mother Moreana Whitson; his stepfather Randy Whitson; and two sisters Courtney Champagne of Idaho and Shannon Scates of Oklahoma City. He was preceded in death by his father William Leon Scates, who died when Dan was a child.  At the memorial service, the Rev. Michael Jackson noted that Dan ``as a child protected kids in the neighborhood from the bullies'' and said he was doing the same thing in Iraq.  The minister read a poem that Dan's mother had written some time ago about her son, who was serving his third tour of duty in Iraq.  ``A long time ago, when you were just a little bitty fellar,'' she wrote, ``little did I know the hero in you. We are not here today to mourn,'' Jackson said. ``We are here to celebrate a hero who is going home to receive his greatest award . . . his greatest honor.''  ``I believe he was a hero before he was born,'' Jackson said. ``Then he lived up to that calling, not just as an adult, but through his whole life.''  I extend our deepest gratitude and condolences to Dan's family. He lived a life of love for his family, friends, and our country. He will be remembered for his commitment to and belief in the greatness of our Nation. I am honored to pay tribute to this true American hero who volunteered to go into the fight and made the ultimate sacrifice of his life for our freedom.
