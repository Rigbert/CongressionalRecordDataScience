President, today, following my remarks and the remarks of Senator McConnell, there will be a period of morning business until 11:30 a.m., with the time equally divided and controlled. The majority will control the first 30 minutes, and the Republicans will control the next 30 minutes.  Following morning business, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the budget conference report. There will be 15 minutes for debate equally divided prior to a vote on adoption of the conference report. Therefore, Senators should expect the first vote to begin at 11:45 a.m.  Upon disposition of the budget conference report, I expect the Senate to begin consideration of the climate change bill.                          ____________________
