President, today marks the 60th wedding anniversary of Richard and Virginia Howrigan. I am happy to have the opportunity to congratulate my good friends who have given so much to the State of Vermont.  The Howrigans are one of the best-known families in Franklin County; their family name has been synonymous with successful and conscientious dairy farming for decades. Marcelle and I value our friendship with them.  Over the course of the past 60 years, Robert and Virginia have worked and grown together. They are wonderful parents, hard workers, and have always remained true to their faith.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an excerpt from a February 8, 2009, Burlington Free Press article honoring the Howrigans printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, Feb. 8, 2009]                Couples Share Secrets of Love, Marriage                           (By Sally Pollack)       Flowers, chocolates and candlelight dinners mark      Valentine's Day. But what marks marriage, day after day, year      by year, decade upon decade? The Burlington Free Press asked      four couples who together have been married a combined 240      years what it takes to make a marriage work. We'll let the      pros do the talking:           Virginia and Robert Howrigan, Fairfield, 60 years       Virginia and Robert Howrigan will celebrate their 60th      anniversary Thursday. They are retired farmers who live in      Fairfield. The couple worked together on their dairy farm and      raised nine children.       Robert Howrigan will turn 90 in May; Virginia is 80. They      met at a soda fountain in a St. Albans drugstore, where      Virginia scooped ice cream. For the Howrigans, who were      married on Lincoln's birthday, Valentine's Day was never a      significant event. ``Mostly we remember Lincoln,'' Virginia      said.       Robert milked cows the morning the couple were married at a      church in St. Albans. The work went on and on: The Howrigans      stopped doing farm chores four years ago. Tolerance, patience      and perseverance are central to the marriage's longevity,      Virginia said.       ``You make the best of what you have and keep going,''      Virginia said. ``You get up in the morning and go with the      flow. You know what you've got to do. You don't have to look      around for work. There's plenty of it everywhere.'' Robert      and Virginia and their children ate all their meals together.      Together, the couple talked everything over.       ``We were able to keep family together,'' she said. ``All      our decisions were joint. We do     our bills together.'' Robert said two things form the      cornerstone of his 60-year marriage: Love and understanding.                          ____________________
