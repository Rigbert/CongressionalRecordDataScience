 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2016.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: This responds to your letter to the      Attorney General, dated October 27, 2016, regarding proposed      amendments to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal      Procedure, recently approved by the Supreme Court. We are      sending identical responses to the Senators and Members who      joined in your letter.       The amendments to Rule 41, which are scheduled to take      effect on December 1, 2016,     mark the end of a three-year deliberation process, which      included extensive written comments and public testimony.      After hearing the public's views, the federal judiciary's      Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Criminal      Procedure, which includes federal and state judges, law      professors, attorneys in private practice, and others in the      legal community, approved the amendments and rejected      criticisms of the proposal. The amendments were then      considered and unanimously approved by the Standing Committee      on Rules and the Judicial Conference, and adopted by the      United States Supreme Court.       It is important to note that the amendments do not change      any of the traditional protections and procedures under the      Fourth Amendment, such as the requirement that the government      establish probable cause. Rather, the amendments would merely      ensure that venue exists so that at least one court is      available to consider whether a particular warrant      application comports with the Fourth Amendment.       Further, the amendments would not authorize the government      to undertake any search or seizure or use any remote search      technique, whether inside or outside the United States, that      is not already permitted under current law. The use of remote      searches is not new, and warrants for remote searches are      currently issued under Rule 41. In addition, courts already      permit the search of multiple computers pursuant to a single      warrant, so long as the necessary legal requirements are met      with respect to each computer. Nothing in the amendments      changes the existing legal requirements.       The amendments apply in two narrow circumstances. First,      where a criminal suspect has hidden the location of his      computer using technological means, the changes to Rule 41      would ensure that federal agents know which magistrate judge      to go to in order to apply for a warrant. For example, if      agents are investigating criminals who are sexually      exploiting children and uploading videos of that exploitation      for others to see--but concealing their locations through      anonymizing technology--agents will be able to apply for a      search warrant to discover where they are located.       An investigation of the Playpen website--a Tor site used by      more than 100,000 pedophiles to encourage sexual abuse and      exploitation of children and to trade sexually explicit      images of the abuse--illustrates the importance of this      change. During the investigation, authorities were able to      wrest control of the site from its administrators, and then      obtained approval from a federal court to use a remote search      tool to undo the anonymity promised by Tor. The search would      occur only if a Playpen user accessed child pornography on      the site (a federal crime), in which case the tool would      cause the user's computer to transmit to investigators a      limited amount of information, including the user's true IP      address, to help locate and identify the user and his      computer. Based on that information, investigators could then      conduct a traditional, real-world investigation, such as by      running a criminal records check, interviewing neighbors, or      applying for an additional warrant to search a suspect's      house for incriminating evidence. Those court-authorized      remote searches in the Playpen case have led to more than 200      active prosecutions--including the prosecution of at least 48      alleged abusers--and the identification or rescue of at least      49 American children who were subject to sexual abuse.      Nonetheless, despite the success of the Playpen      investigation, Federal courts have ordered the suppression of      evidence in some of the resulting prosecutions because of the      lack of clear venue in the current version of Rule 41. In      other cases, courts have declined to suppress evidence      because the law was not clear, but have suggested that they      would do so in future cases.       Second, where the crime involves criminals hacking      computers located in five or more different judicial      districts, the changes to Rule 41 would ensure that federal      agents may identify one judge to review an application for a      search warrant rather than be required to submit separate      warrant applications in each district--up to 94--where a      computer is affected. For example, agents may seek a search      warrant to assist in the investigation of a ransomware scheme      facilitated by a botnet that enables criminals abroad to      extort thousands of Americans. Such botnets, which range in      size from hundreds to millions of infected computers and may      be used for a variety of criminal purposes, represent one of      the fastest-growing species of computer crime and are among      the key cybersecurity threats facing American citizens and      businesses. Absent the amendments to Rule 41, however, the      requirement to obtain up to 94 simultaneous search warrants      may prevent cyber investigators from taking needed action to      liberate computers infected with such malware. This change      would not permit indiscriminate surveillance of thousands of      victim computers--that is not permissible now and will      continue to be prohibited when the amendment goes into      effect. This is because other than identifying a court to      consider the warrant application, the amendment makes no      change to the substantive law governing when a warrant      application should be granted or denied.       The amended rule limits forum shopping by restricting the      venue in which a magistrate judge may issue a warrant for a      remote search to ``any district where activities related to a      crime may have occurred.'' Often, this language will leave      only a single district in which investigators can seek a      warrant. For example, where a victim has received death      threats, extortion demands, or ransomware demands from a      criminal hiding behind Internet anonymizing technologies, the      victim's district would likely be the only district in which      a warrant could be issued for a remote search to identify the      perpetrator.       In cases involving widespread criminal conduct, activities      related to the crime may have occurred in multiple districts,      and thus there may be multiple districts in which      investigators may seek a warrant under the new amendment. For      many years, however, existing laws have recognized the need      for warrants to be issued in a district connected to      criminal activity even when the information sought may not      be present in the district. The language of the new Rule      41(6)(6) amendment limiting warrant venue to ``any      district where activities related to a crime may have      occurred'' was copied verbatim from the existing warrant      venue provisions in Rule 41(6)(3) and (b)(5), which      authorize judges to issue out-of-district warrants in      cases involving terrorism and searches of U.S. territories      and overseas diplomatic premises. Thus, the new venue      provision of Rule 41(b)(6) for remote searches is      consistent with existing practices in these other      contexts. Similarly, warrants for email and other stored      electronic communications are sought tens of thousands of      times a year in a wide range of investigations. Such      warrants may be issued in any district by a court that      ``has jurisdiction over the offense being investigated.''      18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2703 & 2711(3).       As with law enforcement activities in the physical world,      law enforcement actions to prevent or redress online crime      can never be completely free of risk. Before we conduct      online investigations, the Department of Justice (the      Department) carefully considers both the need to prevent harm      to the public caused by criminals and the potential risks of      taking action. In particular, when conducting complex online      operations, we typically work closely with sophisticated      computer security researchers both inside and outside the      government. As part of operational planning, investigators      conduct pre-deployment verification and validation of      computer tools. Such testing is designed to ensure that tools      work as intended and do not create unintended consequences.      That kind of careful consideration of any future technical      measures will continue, and we welcome continued      collaboration with the private sector and cybersecurity      experts in the development and use of botnet mitigation      techniques. The Department's antibotnet successes have      demonstrated that the Department can disrupt and dismantle      botnets while avoiding collateral damage to victims. And of      course, choosing to do nothing has its own cost: leaving      victims' computers under the control of criminals who will      continue to invade their privacy, extort money from them      through ransomware, or steal their financial information.       Law enforcement could obtain identifying information (such      as an IP address) from infected computers comprising a botnet      in order to make sure owners are warned of the infection      (typically, by their Internet service provider). Or law      enforcement might engage in an online operation that is      designed to disrupt the botnet and restore full control over      computers to their legal owners. Both of these techniques,      however, could involve conduct that some courts might hold      constitutes a search or seizure under the Fourth Amendment.      In general, we anticipate that the items to be searched or      seized from victim computers pursuant to a botnet warrant      will be quite limited. For example, we believe that it may be      reasonable in a botnet investigation to take steps to measure      the size of the botnet by having each victim computer report      a unique identifier; but it would not be lawful in such      circumstances to search the victims' unrelated private files.      Whether or not a warrant authorizing a remote search is      proper is a question of Fourth Amendment law, which is not      changed by the amendments to Rule 41. Simply put, the      amendments do not authorize the government to undertake any      search or seizure or use any remote search technique that is      not already permitted under the Fourth Amendment. They merely      ensure that searches that are appropriate under the Fourth      Amendment and necessary to help free victim computers from      criminal control are not, as a practical matter, blocked by      outmoded venue rules.       The amendment's notice requirement mandates that when      executing a warrant for a remote search, ``the officer must      make reasonable efforts to serve a copy of the warrant on the      person whose property was searched or whose information was      seized or copied,'' and that ``[s]ervice may be accomplished      by any means, including electronic means, reasonably      calculated to reach that person.'' What means are reasonably      available to notify an individual who has concealed his      location and identity will of course vary from case to case.      If the remote search is successful in identifying the      suspect, then notice can be provided in the traditional      manner (following existing rules for delaying notice where      appropriate in ongoing investigations). If the search is      unsuccessful, then investigators would have to consider other      means that may be available, for example through a known      email address. In an investigation involving botnet victims,      the Department would make reasonable efforts to     notify victims of any search conducted pursuant to warrant.      For example, if investigators obtained victims' IP addresses      at a particular date and time in order to measure the size of      the botnet, investigators could ask the victims' Internet      service providers to notify the individuals whose computers      were identified as being under the control of criminal bot      herders. Under such an approach, it would not even be      necessary for investigators to learn the identities of      specific victims. The Department will, of course, also      consider other appropriate mechanisms to provide notice      consistent with the amended Rule 41.       Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the government must      establish the authenticity of any item of electronic evidence      it moves to admit in evidence. To do so, it must offer      evidence ``sufficient to support a finding that the item is''      what the government claims it to be, and a criminal defendant      may object to the admission of evidence on the basis that the      government has not established its authenticity. The      amendments to Rule 41 do not make any change to the law      governing the admissibility of lawfully obtained evidence at      trial, whether on the basis of authenticity or any other      basis, and to our knowledge authenticity objections have not      played a substantial role in prior federal criminal trials at      which evidence obtained as a result of remote searches was      introduced.       Protecting victims' privacy is one of the Department's top      priorities. To the extent that investigators collect any      information concerning botnet victims, the Department will      take all appropriate steps to safeguard any such information      from improper use or disclosure. The Department presently and      vigorously protects the private information collected      pursuant to search warrants for computers and documents      seized from a home or business and the Department will follow      the same exacting standards for any warrant executed under      the amendments to Rule 41.       We hope that this information is helpful. Please do not      hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional      assistance regarding this or any other matter.           Sincerely,                                                  Peter J. Kadzik,                                       Assistant Attorney General.
