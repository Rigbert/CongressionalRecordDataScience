 President, in the 1980's as the Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe were casting off the Soviet yoke, then-Professor Albright conducted research into the attitudes of the people of these countries, and she wrote about the need to assist them in their transition from communism to freedom.  That is where Senator Helms and I and others on the Foreign Relations Committee got to see her again because she came and testified about that research and the polling data that she conducted.  Her academic and personal understanding of these issues will allow her to formulate policies to encourage the continued spread of political and economic freedom throughout the world as she attempts to implement this administration's foreign policy.  At the United Nations, Ambassador Albright successfully advanced and defended American interests and enlisted the support of others for our policies. Her straight talk and tireless commitment won her the admiration of Democrats and Republicans alike. She recognizes that while it is sometimes in America's interest to act alone, always acting alone is ineffective and an unnecessary use of our resources.  Two weeks ago, Ambassador Albright came before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and outlined a comprehensive framework for American foreign policy into the next century, one in which none of us, I think, is likely to accept wholesale. But that is the way the process is supposed to work.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that her insightful statement to our committee be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Statement by Secretary of State-Designate Madeleine K. Albright Before         the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--January 8, 1997       Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a great      honor and pleasure to be here with you this morning. I want      to begin by thanking the President for his trust in      nominating me to this high and very challenging position.       I am very grateful to Secretary Christopher both for his      kind words of introduction and for the opportunity he has      given me these past four years to observe how a steady and      determined diplomat conducts business.       And I appreciate very much the Committee's courtesy in      scheduling this hearing so promptly.       Mr. Chairman, we have reached a point more than halfway      between the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the start      of a new century. Our nation is respected and at peace. Our      alliances are vigorous. Our economy is strong. And from the      distant corners of Asia, to the emerging democracies of      Central Europe and Africa, to the community of democracies      that exists within our own hemisphere--and to the one      impermanent exception to that community, Castro's Cuba--     American institutions and ideals are a model for those who      have, or who aspire to, freedom.       All this is no accident, and its continuation is by no      means inevitable. Democratic progress must be sustained as it      was built--by American leadership. And our leadership must be      sustained if our interests are to be protected around the      world.       Do not doubt, those interests are not geopolitical      abstractions, they are real.       It matters to our children whether they grow up in a world      where the dangers posed by weapons of mass destruction have      been minimized or allowed to run out of control.       It matters to the millions of Americans who work, farm or      invest whether the global economy continues to create good      new jobs and open new markets, or whether--through      miscalculation or protectionism--it begins to spiral      downward.       It matters to our families whether illegal drugs continue      to pour into our neighborhoods from overseas.       It matters to Americans who travel abroad or go about their      daily business at home whether the scourge of international      terrorism is reduced.       It matters to our workers and businesspeople whether they      will be unfairly forced to compete against companies that      violate fair labor standards, despoil the environment or gain      contracts not through competition but corruption.       And it matters to us all whether through inattention or      indifference, we allow small wars to grow into large ones      that put our safety and freedom at risk.       To defeat the dangers and seize the opportunities, we must      be more than audience, more even than actors, we must be the      authors of the history of our age.       A half century ago, after the devastation caused by      Depression, holocaust and war, it was not enough to say that      what we were against had failed. Leaders such as Truman,      Marshall and Vandenberg were determined to build a lasting      peace. And together with our allies, they forged a set of      institutions that would defend freedom, rebuild economies,      uphold law and preserve peace.       Today, it is not enough for us to say that Communism has      failed. We must continue building a new framework--adapted to      the demands of a new century--that will protect our citizens      and our friends; reinforce our values; and secure our future.       In so doing, we must direct our energies, not as our      predecessors did, against a single virulent ideology. We face      a variety of threats, some as old as ethnic conflict; some as      new as letter bombs; some as long-term as global warming;      some as dangerous as nuclear weapons falling into the wrong      hands.       To cope with such a variety of threats, we will need a full      range of foreign policy tools.       That is why our armed forces must remain the best-led,      best-trained, best-equipped and most respected in the world.      And as President Clinton has pledged, and our military      leaders ensure, they will.       It is also why we need first-class diplomacy. Force, and      the credible possibility of its use, are essential to defend      our vital interests and to keep America safe. But force alone      can be a blunt instrument, and there are many problems it      cannot solve.       To be effective, force and diplomacy must complement and      reinforce each other. For there will be many occasions, in      many places, where we will rely on diplomacy to protect our      interests, and we will expect our diplomats to defend those      interests with skill, knowledge and spine.       If confirmed, one of my most important tasks will be to      work with Congress to ensure that we have the superb      diplomatic representation that our people deserve and our      interests demand. We cannot have that on the cheap. We must      invest the resources needed to maintain American leadership.      Consider the stakes. We are talking here about one percent of      our federal budget, but that one percent may well determine      fifty     percent of the history that is written about our era.       Unfortunately, as Senator Lugar recently pointed out,      currently, ``our international operations are underfunded and      understaffed.'' He noted, as well, that not only our      interests, but our efforts to balance the budget would be      damaged if American disengagement were to result in ``nuclear      terrorism, a trade war, an energy crisis, a major regional      conflict . . . or some other preventable disaster.       Mr. Chairman, we are the world's richest, strongest, most      respected nation. We are also the largest debtor to the      United Nations and the international financial institutions.      We provide a smaller percentage of our wealth to support      democracy and growth in the developing world than any other      industrialized nation.       And over the past four years, the Department of State has      cut more than 2000 employees, downgraded positions, closed      more than 30 embassies or consulates, and deferred badly-     needed modernization of infrastructure and communications. We      have also suffered a 30% reduction in our foreign assistance      programs since 1991.       It is said that we have moved from an era where the big      devour the small to an era where the fast devour the slow. If      that is the case, your State Department, with its obsolete      technology, $300 million in deferred maintenance and a      shrinking base of skilled personnel, is in trouble.       If confirmed, I will strive to fulfill my obligation to      manage our foreign policy effectively and efficiently. I will      work with this Committee and the Congress to ensure that the      American public gets full value for each tax dollar spent.      But I will also want to ensure that our foreign policy      successfully promotes and protects the interests of the      American people.       In addition, I will want to work with you to spur continued      reform and to pay our bills at the United Nations, an      organization that Americans helped create, that reflects      ideals that we share and that serves goals of stability, law      and international cooperation that are in our interests.       The debate over adequate funding for foreign policy is not      new in America. It has been joined repeatedly from the time      the Continental Congress sent Ben Franklin to Paris, to the      proposals for Lend Lease and the Marshall Plan that bracketed      World War II, to the start of the SEED and Nunn-Lugar      programs a few years ago. In each case, history has looked      more kindly on those who argued for our engagement than on      those who said we just could not afford to lead.       Mr. Chairman, any framework for American leadership must      include measures to control the threats posed by weapons of      mass destruction and terror; to seize the opportunities that      exist for setting dangerous regional conflicts; to maintain      America as the hub of an expanding global economy; and to      defend cherished principles of democracy and law.       At the center of that framework, however, are our key      alliances and relationships. These are the bonds that hold      together not only our foreign policy, but the entire      international system. When we are able to act cooperatively      with the other leading nations, we create a dynamic web of      principle, power and purpose that elevates standards and      propels progress around the globe. This is our opportunity,      for in the post Cold War era, big power diplomacy is not a      zero-sum game.                     the trans-atlantic partnership       A foremost example is the trans-Atlantic partnership.       It is a central lesson of this century that America must      remain a European power. We have an interest in European      security, because we wish to avoid the instability that drew      five million Americans across the Atlantic to fight in two      world wars. We have an interest in European democracy,      because it was the triumph of freedom there that ended the      Cold War. We have an interest in European prosperity, because      our own prosperity depends on having partners that are open      to our exports, investment and ideas.       Today, thanks to the efforts of President Clinton and      Secretary Christopher, American leadership in Europe is on      solid ground.       European institutions are evolving in directions that are      making the continent more free, unified and peaceful than at      any time in history.       Our key bilateral relationships, albeit spirited at times,      are as strong and resilient as they have ever been.       The terrible carnage in Bosnia has ended.       The Partnership for Peace has broadened cooperation on      security matters.       And there is continued progress on political and market      reforms within Central Europe and the New Independent States.       If confirmed, I will be returning to this Committee often      to ask your support for our vision of an integrated, stable      and democratic Europe.       In July, at the NATO summit in Madrid, the alliance will      discuss European security, including NATO adaptation to new      missions and structures, a framework for enhanced      consultation and cooperation with Russia, and enlargement.       The purpose of enlargement is to do for Europe's east what      NATO did 50 years ago for Europe's west: to integrate new      democracies, defeat old hatreds, provide confidence in      economic recovery and deter conflict.       Those who say NATO enlargement should wait until a military      threat appears miss the main point. NATO is a not a wild west      posse that we mobilize only when grave danger is near. It is      a permanent alliance, a linchpin of stability, designed to      prevent serious threats from ever arising.       To those who worry about enlargement dividing Europe, I say      that NATO cannot and should not preserve the old Iron Curtain      as its eastern frontier. That was an artificial division,      imposed upon proud nations, some of which are now ready to      contribute to the continent's security. What NATO must and      will do is keep open the door to membership to every European      nation that can shoulder alliance responsibilities and      contribute to its goals, while building a strong and enduring      partnership with all of Europe's democracies.       Building a more cooperative and integrated Europe will be      one of many issues that President Clinton will be discussing      with President Yeltsin during his visit here to the United      States in March. A democratic Russia can and must be a strong      partner in achieving this shared goal.       We know that Russia remains in the midst of a wrenching      transition, but gains made during the past five years are      increasingly irreversible. Despite the threats posed by      corruption and crime, open markets and democratic      institutions have taken hold. And last summer marked the      first fully democratic election of national leaders in      Russia's long history.       President Yeltsin's challenge in his second term will be to      restore the momentum behind internal reforms and accelerate      Russia's integration with the west. We have a profound      interest in encouraging that great country to remain on a      democratic course, to respect fully the sovereignty of its      neighbors and to join with us in addressing a full range of      regional and global issues.       Our deepening friendship with a democratic Ukraine is also      fundamental to Europe's integration. Ukraine was the first of      the New Independent States to transfer power from one      democratically-elected government to another. And, under      President Kuchma, it has launched ambitious economic reforms      that have subdued inflation and prevented economic collapse.       In our relations both with Russia and Ukraine, the      binational commissions established with Vice-President Gore      as the lead U.S. representative will serve as a valuable aid      for setting the agenda, and facilitating cooperation across a      broad range of endeavors.       Finally, the future of European stability and democracy      depends, as well, on continued implementation of the Dayton      Accords.       Although IFOR completed its military tasks brilliantly in      Bosnia, more time is needed for economic reconstruction and      political healing. SFOR's goal is to provide the time for      peace to become self-sustaining.       Although the full promise of Dayton is not yet fulfilled,      much has changed during the past 13 months. The fighting has      stopped, peaceful elections have been held, and the framework      for national democratic institutions has taken shape.       Much of this is due to American leadership. Our plan now,      in cooperation with our many partners, is to consolidate and      build on those gains. Our strategy is to continue diminishing      the need for an international military presence by      establishing a stable military balance, improving judicial      and legal institutions, helping more people return safely to      their homes and seeing that more of those indicted as war      criminals are arrested and prosecuted.       Given the ongoing challenges, it is encouraging to note the      history-making dimension of the process set in motion by the      Dayton Accords.       Today, in Bosnia, virtually every nation in Europe is      working together to bring stability to a region where      conflict earlier this century tore the continent apart.       This reflects a sharp departure from the spheres of      influence or balance of power diplomacy of the past, and an      explicit rejection of politics based on ethnic      identification. And it validates the premise of the      Partnership for Peace by demonstrating the growth of a common      understanding within Europe of how a common sense of security      may be achieved.       The experience of IFOR and now SFOR in Bosnia heightens the      potential for security cooperation among the full range of      NATO and non-NATO European states. In Bosnia, soldiers from      NATO, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Romania and many other nations      trust, defend and depend on each other. Our challenge is to      extend that spirit to other joint endeavors and to keep it      thriving long after SFOR concludes its work.       European stability depends in large measure on continued      American engagement and leadership. And as history attests,      European stability is also vital to our national interests.      As a result, we will remain engaged, we will continue to      lead, we will strengthen our alliances and we will continue      to build with our democratic partners a Europe in which every      nation is free and every free nation is our partner.            promoting mutual security and prosperity in asia       Mr. Chairman, America must remain a European power. We      must, and will, remain a Pacific power, as well.       Asia is a continent undergoing breathtaking economic      expansion and measured, but steady, movement in the direction      of democracy. Its commercial vigor reinforces our own and      contributes to the vital interest we have in its security.      This is, after all, an area in which America has fought three      wars     during the past six decades, and in which 100,000 American      Troops are based.       President Clinton has elevated this dynamic region on our      agenda, and I plan to devote much of my attention to its      promise and perils.       Our priorities here are to maintain the strength of our      core alliances while successfully managing our multi-faceted      relationship with China.       Because of our commitment to regional security, we have      maintained our forward-deployed military presence in the      Western Pacific. We are encouraging regional efforts to      settle territorial and other disputes without violence. We      are working hard to open markets for American goods and      services, both bilaterally and through APEC, which the      President lifted to the summit level. We are broadening our      diplomatic and security ties in Southeast Asia, home to the      world's fastest growing economies. And we will continue to      promote respect for internationally-recognized human rights      and the spread of freedom.       Our closest and most wide-ranging bilateral relationship in      the region is with Japan, with whom we have strongly      reaffirmed our alliance.       We consult Japan regularly on a broad range of foreign      policy questions from security in Asia to development in      Africa. We appreciate its generous financial support for      peace efforts from Bosnia to the Middle East. And we are      working with Japan and another valued ally, the Republic of      Korea, to implement the Framework agreement freezing North      Korean development of nuclear arms. In recent weeks, we and      Seoul have worked together successfully to reduce tensions,      reinforce the nuclear freeze and improve prospects for      dialogue on the Peninsula.       I look forward, if confirmed, to visiting both Japan and      the Republic of Korea at an early date.       I am also looking forward to the visit here soon of the      Chinese Foreign Minister.       A strong bilateral relationship between the United States      and China is needed to expand areas of cooperation, reduce      the potential for misunderstanding and encourage China's full      emergence as a responsible member of the international      community.       To make progress, our two countries must act towards each      other on the basis of mutual frankness. We have important      differences, especially on trade, arms transfers and human      rights, including Tibet. We have concerns about Chinese      policy towards the reversion of Hong Kong. While adhering to      our one China policy, we will maintain robust unofficial ties      with Taiwan. But we also have many interests in common, and      have worked together on issues including the Korean      peninsula, crime, the global environment and nuclear testing.       U.S. policy towards China has long been an issue of      controversy in Congress and among the American people. There      are disagreements about the proper balancing of the various      elements of that policy. There should be no doubt, however,      about the importance of this relationship, and about the need      to pursue a strategy aimed at Chinese integration, not      isolation.         preventive defense through the control of deadly arms       The Cold War may be over, but the threat to our security      posed by nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction has      only been reduced, not ended. Arms control and      nonproliferation remain a vital element in our foreign policy      framework.       With our leadership, much has been accomplished. Russian      warheads no longer target our homes. Nuclear weapons have      been removed from Belarus and Kazakhstan and in Ukraine, the      last missile silos are being planted over with sunflowers.      Iraq's nuclear capability has been dismantled, and North      Korea's frozen. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty has been      extended, indefinitely and without conditions. A      comprehensive ban on nuclear tests has been approved and a      chemical weapons ban will soon be in effect.       Mr. Chairman, these efforts to reduce the spread and number      of weapons of mass destruction contribute to what Defense      Secretary Perry has called ``preventive defense''. They are      designed to keep Americans safe. We pursue them not as favors      to others, but in support of our own national interests. But      arms control and nonproliferation are works in progress, and      we will need your help and that of this Committee and the      Senate to continue that progress.       First, we will be asking your consent to the ratification      of the Chemical Weapons Convention, or CWC, before it enters      into force in late April.       As this Committee well knows, the CWC was begun under      President Reagan and negotiated under President Bush. It is      supported by many in both parties, by the business community      and by our military. The CWC is no panacea, but it will make      it more difficult for rogue states and others hostile to our      interests to develop or obtain chemical weapons. I hope, Mr.      Chairman, that we will be able to work together to get this      Treaty approved in time for the United States to be an      original party.       We will also be seeking your early approval of the CFE      Flank agreement, which is essential to sustain the CFR      Treaty, which in turn contributes mightily to European      security.       Overseas, we will be working with Russia to secure prompt      ratification by the Duma of the START II Treaty, and then to      pursue further reductions and limits on strategic nuclear      arms.       We will also continue efforts to fulfill the President's      call for negotiations leading to a worldwide ban on the use,      stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel      landmines. The humanitarian problems created by the misuse of      anti-personnel landmines can only be dealt with on a global      basis. In September, the President told the UN General      Assembly that ``our children deserve to walk the Earth in      safety.'' This will be a major arms control objective of the      next four years.       Arms control and nonproliferation are closely linked to our      policies toward rogue states. We have a major interest in      preventing weapons of mass destruction from being obtained by      regimes with a proven disrespect for the rule of law.      Accordingly, we will continue working to improve the security      and prevent the diversion of fissile materials. We will      continue to oppose strongly the sale or transfer of advanced      weapons or technologies to Iran. And we will insist on      maintaining tough UN sanctions against Iraq unless and until      that regime complies with relevant Security Council      resolutions.                 vigorous diplomacy in support of peace       Mr. Chairman, the appropriate American role in helping to      end conflicts and respond to crises overseas has been debated      widely, not only in our time, but throughout American      history.       Because we have unique capabilities and unmatched power, it      is natural that others turn to us in time of emergency. We      have an unlimited number of opportunities to act around the      world. But we do not have unlimited resources, nor do we have      unlimited responsibilities. If we are to protect our own      interests and maintain our credibility, we have to weigh our      commitments carefully, and be selective and disciplined in      what we agree to do.       Recognizing this, we have a strong incentive to strengthen      other mechanisms for responding to emergencies and conflicts,      including the United Nations and regional organizations. We      should work closely with the entire network of public and      nongovernmental organizations that has evolved to predict,      prevent, contain and minimize the human and other costs of      natural and human-caused disaster. And we should insist that      other capable nations do their fair share financially,      technically and--if necessary--militarily.       The primary obligation of the United States is to its own      citizens. We are not a charity or a fire department. We will      defend firmly our own vital interests.       But we recognize that our interests and those of our allies      may also be affected by regional or civil wars, power vacuums      that create targets of opportunity for criminals and      terrorists, dire humanitarian emergencies and threats to      democracy. Then, as President Clinton said recently, ``The      United States cannot and should not try to solve every      problem, but where our interests are clear, our values are at      stake, (and) where we can make a difference, we must act and      we must lead.''       During the past four years, under President Clinton and      Secretary Christopher, the United States has been steadfast      in supporting the peacemakers over the bombthrowers in      historically troubled areas of the globe. Our goal has been      to build an environment in which threats to our security and      that of our allies are diminished, and the likelihood of      American forces being sent into combat is reduced.       We recognize that, in most of these situations, neither the      United States nor any other outside force can impose a      solution. But we can make it easier for those inclined      towards peace to take the risks required to achieve it.       As this statement is being prepared, sustained U.S.      diplomacy in the Middle East has helped to build a renewed      dialogue between Israel and its Palestinian partners,      producing significant progress on Israeli redeployment in      Hebron.       While an agreement is not yet in hand, the intensive      negotiations which have been conducted over the past three      months--including direct discussions between Prime Minister      Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat--have restored a sense of      momentum and greater confidence between the sides. This      process began during the Washington summit called by      President Clinton last October and has been sustained and      advanced through our active diplomatic engagement.       Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat have      reaffirmed to President Clinton their determination to      continue their joint efforts for peace. The United States      will stand by them as they do.       Today, there remain two competing visions in the Middle      East. One is focused on the grievances and tragedies of the      past; the other on the possibilities of the future. An      agreement on Hebron would serve as a catalyst, strengthening      the supporters of peace. Under the President's leadership, we      intend to press vigorously on all tracks to realize a secure,      comprehensive and lasting peace between Israel and her Arab      neighbors.       Throughout, we will be guided by America's unshakeable      commitment to Israel's security, and by our opposition to      those who would disrupt this process through terrorism and      violence.       Secretary Christopher leaves office after four years of      historic progress in facilitating peace in the Middle East.      While his presence will be missed, I will maintain fully the      State Department's commitment to an active U.S. role in this      long-troubled and strategic part of the globe.       Across the Mediterranean in Cyprus, another longstanding      disagreement remains unresolved. In 1996, the parties moved      no closer to a final decision on the status of the island.      Moreover, disturbing incidents of violence marred the climate      for negotiations, while underlining their urgency. The      dispute here and related differences between our two NATO      allies, Turkey and Greece, affect European stability and our      vital interests. Accordingly, we are prepared in this new      year to play a heightened role in promoting a resolution in      Cyprus, but for any initiative to bear fruit, the parties      must agree to steps that will reduce tensions and make direct      negotiations possible.       In Northern Ireland, we are encouraged that multi-party      talks began but we are disappointed by the lack of progress      made, and strongly condemn the IRA's return to violence. We      will continue to work with the Irish and British governments      and the parties to help promote substantive progress in the      talks. And we note that former Senator George Mitchell, who      is chairing the multi-party talks, has been crucial to the      forward steps that have been taken.       As we enter the 50th anniversary year of independence for      both India and Pakistan, we will again consider the prospects      for reducing the tensions that have long existed between      these two friends of the United States.       We have a wealth of equities in this region, and a      particular concern about the regional arms race and nuclear      nonproliferation. India and Pakistan should both know that we      will do what we can to strengthen their relations with us and      encourage better relations between them, and that we expect      both to avoid actions calculated to provoke the other.       Another dispute tangled by history and geography concerns      Armenia, Azerbaijan and the status of Nagorno-Karabakh. The      good news here is that the ceasefire has now held for more      than two years. The bad news is that progress under the      OSCE's Minsk process has been agonizingly slow. We have very      substantial economic, political and humanitarian interests in      this region, and are prepared to play a more visible role in      helping to arrange a settlement. One step that Congress could      take to increase our influence would be to lift restrictions      on nonmilitary assistance to Azerbaijan, while maintaining      support for our generous aid program in Armenia.       Finally, in Central Africa, we are striving with regional      leaders and our allies to prevent a still-volatile situation      from erupting into even greater tragedy. We are encouraging      the repatriation of the remaining Rwandan refugees and      assisting in their re-integration into Rwandan society.      Through the efforts of Special Envoy Howard Wolpe, we are      promoting a dialogue between the opposing parties in Burundi.      And we support and end to conflict in Zaire based on      recognition of Zaire's territorial integrity and full respect      for human rights.       Mr. Chairman, I visited Central Africa last year. In      Rwanda, in the beautiful region where they filmed ``Gorillas      in the Mist'', there is an old stone church. By its side,      American and other volunteers work with little brushes to      clean and reassemble the skeletons of people slaughtered      there in 1994. Among the hundreds of skeletons there, I      happened to notice one in particular that was only two feet      long, about the size of my little grandson.       It is said that foreign policy should not be influenced by      emotion. That is true. But let us remember that murdered      children are not emotions; they are human beings whose      potential contributions are forever lost. America has an      interest, as do all civilized people, to act where possible      to prevent and oppose genocide.       One practical step we can take is to increase the capacity      of African countries to engage successfully in peacekeeping      efforts within their region. That is the purpose of the      African Crisis Response Force proposed by the Administration      last fall. This proposal has generated considerable interest      both within and outside the region. With Congressional      support, it will be a priority in the coming year.                    leadership for a global economy       The Clinton Administration has had extraordinary success      these past four years in creating jobs for Americans at home      by opening markets abroad. The more than 200 trade agreements      negotiated have helped our exports grow by 34% since 1993 and      created 1.6 million new jobs. By passing NAFTA, concluding      the GATT Uruguay Round and forging the Miami summit      commitment to achieve free and open trade in our hemisphere      by 2005 and the APEC commitment to do the same in the Asia-     Pacific by 2020, the President has positioned the United      States to become an even more dynamic hub of the global      economy in the 21st century.       As Secretary of State, I would do all I can to see that      this momentum continues. Already, I have talked with Treasury      Secretary Rubin, Commerce Secretary-designate Bill Daley and      Trade Representative-designate Charlene Barshefsky. We      intend, if confirmed, to function as a team--America's team.      And we intend to be a very tough team.       Competition for the world's markets is fierce. Often, our      firms go head-to-head with foreign competitors who are      receiving active support from their own governments. A      principal responsibility of the Department of State is to see      that the interests of American companies and workers receive      fair treatment, and that inequitable barriers to competition      are overcome. Accordingly, the doors to the Department of      State and our embassies around the world are open--and will      remain open--to U.S. businesspeople seeking to share their      ideas and to ask our help.       In the years ahead, we must continue shaping a global      economic system that works for America. Because our people      are so productive and inventive, we will thrive in any true      competition. However, maintaining the equity of the system      requires constant effort. Experience tells us that there will      always be some who will seek to take advantage by denying      access to our products, pirating our copyrighted goods or      under-pricing us through sweatshop labor.       That is why our diplomacy will continue to emphasize high      standards on working conditions, the environment and labor      and business practices. And it is why we will work for a      trading system that establishes and enforces fair rules.       Although we will continue to work closely with our G-7      partners, the benefits of economic integration and expanded      trade are not--and should not be--limited to the most      developed nations. Especially now, when our bilateral foreign      assistance program is in decline, public and private sector      economic initiatives are everywhere an important part of our      foreign policy. We can also leverage resources for results by      working with and supporting the international financial      institutions.       In Latin America, a region of democracies, we will be      building on the 1994 Summit of the Americas to strengthen      judicial and other political institutions and to promote      higher standards of living through free trade and economic      integration. I am pleased that, in this effort, we will have      the assistance of the newly-designated special envoy for the      Americas, Mack Mclarty.       Although much poverty remains, substantial gains have been      made in many parts of the hemisphere through economic      reforms, increased commerce, lower inflation and higher      foreign investment. We believe that further progress can be      achieved that will benefit us, as well as our hemispheric      partners, through agreement on a Free Trade Area for the      Americas by the year 2005. We also place a high priority on      the early addition of Chile to the North American Free Trade      Agreement on equitable terms, and on the extension to Central      America and the Caribbean of Arrangements equivalent to      NAFTA.       Even closer to home, we are encouraging continued economic      and political reform in Mexico, with whom we share a 2000      mile border and a host of common concerns, including crime,      narcotics, immigration and the environment.       In Africa, the overall economic outlook is improving, but      daunting problems of debt, strife, environmental stress and      inadequate investment remain.       It is in our interest to help the region's leaders overcome      these problems and to build an Africa that is more      prosperous, democratic and stable.       We know, however, that the primary impetus for development      here, as elsewhere, must come from the private sector.       It is encouraging, therefore, that many African governments      are facilitating growth through policies that allow private      enterprise to take hold, while investing public resources      wisely in education, health and measures that expand      opportunities for women.       If confirmed, I will place great emphasis on working with      Africa's democratic leaders to broaden and deepen these      trends. More specifically, we will work towards the      integration of Africa into the world's economy, participate      in efforts to ease debt burdens, and help deserving      countries, where we can, through targeted programs of      bilateral aid.            promoting freedom and extending the rule of law       Mr. Chairman, the representative of a foreign power said      once that his country had no permanent allies, only permanent      interests.       It might be said of America that we have no permanent      enemies, only permanent principles.       Those principles are founded in respect for law, human      dignity and freedom not just for some, but for all people.       If I am confirmed, I can assure you that the United States      will not hesitate to address frankly the violation of      internationally-recognized human rights, whether those      violations occur in Cuba or Afghanistan; Burma, Belgrade or      Beijing.       We will work with others to defeat the forces of      international crime and to put those who traffic in drugs      permanently out of business.       We will pursue a hard line against international terror,      insisting on the principle that sponsoring, sheltering or      subsidizing terrorists cannot be rationalized; it is wrong;      and those guilty should not be appeased, but isolated and      punished.       We will maintain our strong backing for the international      war crimes tribunal for Rwanda and the Balkans, because we      believe that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing should be      held accountable, and those who consider rape just another      tactic of war should answer for their crimes.       And we will continue to promote and advocate democracy      because we know that democracy is a parent to peace, and that      the American constitution remains the most     revolutionary and inspiring source of change in the world.                      the environmental mainstream       One final note, Mr. Chairman. Before closing I wanted to      make it clear that I intend, if confirmed, to build upon      Secretary Christopher's wise decision to incorporate      environmental goals into the mainstream of our foreign      policy.       Over the past several years, I have traveled to almost      every region of the world. I have seen the congestion caused      by over-development, and the deforestation that results when      expanding populations compete for shrinking natural      resources. I have smelled the air of smoke-clogged cities      where the environmental techniques made possible by modern      technology have not yet been applied.       The threats we face from environmental damage are not as      spectacular as those of a terrorist's bomb or a hostile      missile. But they directly affect the health, safety and      quality of life of families everywhere. We can choose to be      passive in responding to those threats, and leave the hard      work to our children, or we can be active and forward-looking      now. I choose the latter course, and will not be shy in      seeking congressional and public support.                               conclusion       Members of the Committee, I am deeply honored to appear      here today. I have laid out some, but by no means all, of      what I see as the principal challenges and opportunities we      will face over the next four years. Clearly, we have a lot to      do.       I could say to you that it had always been my ambition to      be Secretary of State of the United States. But that is not      true. Frankly, I did not think it was possible.       I arrived in America when I was 11 years old. My family      came here to escape Communism and to find freedom and we did.      My ambition at that time was only to speak English well,      please my parents, study hard, and grow up to be an American.       The newspaper in Denver, where we lived, had a motto that      read, `` `Tis a privilege to live in Colorado.''       My father used to repeat that motto on a regular basis, but      he would often add a reminder: ``Kids,'' he would say,      ``never forget that it is also a privilege to live in the      United States.''       Long after I left home, my mother would call on the Fourth      of July to ask my children, her grandchildren: ``Tell me, are      you singing any patriotic songs?''       Senators, you on your side of the table and I on my side,      have a unique opportunity to be partners in creating a new      and enduring framework for American Leadership. One of my      predecessors, Dean Acheson, wrote about being present at the      creation of a new era. You and I have the challenge and the      responsibility to help co-author the newest chapter in our      history.       In so doing, let us remember that there is not a page of      American history of which we are proud that was written by a      chronic complainer or prophet of despair.       We are doers.       By rejecting the temptations of isolation, and by standing      with those around the world who share our values, we will      advance our own interests; honor our best traditions; and      help to answer a prayer that has been offered over many years      in a multitude of tongues, in accordance with diverse      customs, in response to a common yearning.       That prayer is the prayer for peace, freedom, food on the      table and what President Clinton once so eloquently referred      to as ``the quiet miracle of a normal life.''       If with your consent, I am confirmed as Secretary of State,      I will ask you to join me in doing all we can, as      representatives of the indispensable nation, and with the      help of God, to answer that prayer.       Thank you very much.
