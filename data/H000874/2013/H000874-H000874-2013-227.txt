And so I think as open a rule process and debate process as is possible will be helpful to the final product. I would hope that we can follow that.  Mr. Leader, you mentioned the Unborn Pain bill. I understand and I have some information that says that the text of that bill coming out of committee may be modified in the Rules Committee. Is the gentleman aware of that? And if so, is the gentleman aware of what textual change there may be from the bill that was reported out of the committee?  I yield to my friend.
