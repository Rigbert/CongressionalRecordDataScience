 President, I have spoken twice on the issue of committing this legislation to the committees to express the point of view that there is a lot of turmoil in working out compromises on the floor of the Senate. That is not a very good way to draft a piece of legislation.  If the leadership had not immediately brought this bill to the Senate Chamber, and the committees had done their work, this bill would have been handled in a much more expeditious way, but, more importantly, it would have been in a way in which we would have had a lot of confidence in the substance of the legislation, with a lot fewer questions asked. I think when people see a product from the Senate, they want to make sure that product is done right.  So I offer to my colleagues the motion and hope that they will vote yes on the motion to commit the legislation to the respective committees--Health, Education, Labor; Judiciary; and Finance--for the fair consideration of this legislation and a final, good product that we know serves the best interests of the people, which obviously is to make sure that everybody is protected with a Patients' Bill of Rights.  I yield the floor.
