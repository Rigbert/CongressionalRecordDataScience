Mr. John J. Baker has ably served the people of Oregon and the Oregon Department of Transportation for over thirty years. A transportation economist with a deep background in the Federal-aid Highway Program and its formulas, Mr. Baker's work has benefitted major transportation projects and communities across the entire state of Oregon.  Mr. Baker's creative work with federal funding formulas helped support many legislative decisions that resulted in millions in additional federal funding for Oregon. Similarly, his intimate knowledge of federal transportation grants and the federal grant making process has helped bring untold millions in grant funding to the state and to local governments in Oregon.  I relied on his expertise on a number of occasions to ensure that Oregon, with more thanhalf of its land owned by the federal government, receives a fair share of the Federal Lands Access Program (known as FLAP) so we can continue to enjoy access to our amazing natural wonders. In 2012, the Obama Administration proposed replacing the existing Forest Highways Program with the new FLAP. My office turned to Mr. Baker to provide the analysis needed to ensure that the new program worked as intended, to ensure that Oregon and western states with huge tracts of federal lands would not be disadvantaged, and helped me safeguard program funding for States with the greatest needs.  This summer, Oregon's first Transportation Asset Management Plan will be finalized thanks to Mr. Baker's steady guiding influence. With his deep professional connection to federal transportation policy and funding, it is only fitting that Mr. Baker be recognized here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives for his remarkable career.  The Oregon Department of Transportation will suffer an irreplaceable departure this month when Mr. Baker retires. Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me and all Oregonians in thanking John Baker for his long and dedicated service to the people of Oregon. My home state is an immeasurably better place because of Mr. Baker's contributions. Simply put, Oregon would not be Oregon without people like John Baker.                          ____________________
