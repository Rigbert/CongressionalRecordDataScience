If there are opportunities to challenge regulations, and we are just talking about the procedure for doing a regulatory flexibility analysis throughout the country, you would have various conclusions and also, frankly, you would be requiring to send agency lawyers from Washington all around the country, which the taxpayers are paying, when in fact they could simply take their own vehicle or a cab or a subway to the district court here in Washington and litigate this issue.  Again, we have to recognize what we are talking about here is not the substance of any of these rules. We are talking about a determination of whether the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously in not doing a regulatory flexibility analysis or in doing one that was so insufficient that it demonstrated such arbitrary and capricious behavior. I think this amendment is a wise one. I would hope that the gentleman from Pennsylvania might accept it.
