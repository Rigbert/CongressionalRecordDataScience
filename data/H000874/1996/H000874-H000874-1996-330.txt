Speaker, with the passage of the 1994 crime bill, we made a landmark commitment to provide an additional 100,000 police officers on the streets and sidewalks of our communities across America. When I talk to law enforcement officers and members of orange hat patrols, PTA presidents and parents in my district, they tell me that putting cops on the beat is the best way to fight crime. These officers walk the streets of our communities, get to know the people they serve, and the community members to get to know them. Their presence deters crime and instills a sense of safety in our neighborhoods.  But the Commerce, Justice, State apprpopriations bill which has been adopted by the Republican majority of this House eviscerates the COPS Program and its goal. This was the primary reasons President Clinton vetoed this bill. I applaud his actions, and urge my colleagues to sustain his veto.  No one can argue that the COPS Program isn't working. In the Fifth District of Maryland, the towns of Crofton, La Plata, Greenbelt, Laurel, Hyattsville, and the counties of Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, and Prince George's have all received funds to hire additional police officers. More than half the police departments in the country have been scheduled to receive additional officers.  Why are the Republicans dismantling this effective program? Why are they eliminating the funding for community officers? Why are they lumping money for COPS into a block grant that adds bureaurcracy? Sheriffs across the country, including those in my district, Republican and Democrat alike, are opposed to this change. Fred Davis, the sheriff of Charles County and a Republican, told me that he wanted this funding to remain intact. Block granting it, he argues, will jeopardize the goal of adding 100,000 cops. ``My concern is that would be lost,'' he says. If the money is given to States, it ``could be used for other programs. I think to change the way it is now done adds another layer of bureaucracy. It's going to slow things down.'' Our superintendent of the Maryland State Police, David Mitchell, has also voiced his support for the COPS Program and I would like to submit it for the Record.  Mr. Speaker, the Republicans in the House should listen to the voices of those like Sheriff Davis, Chief Mitchell and law enforcement organizations like the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, and the National Sheriffs' Association, and keep street smart law enforcement officers on the streets of America.  Crime is a national emergency. We know that putting more police on the streets is an effective response to this crisis. We know that the COPS Program puts police officers in the place where they make the most difference--on the streets. I urge my colleagues to uphold the President's veto and support the Cops on the Beat Program.                                            State of Maryland,                                                Department of Maryland                                                 State Police,                                  Pikesville, MD, January 3, 1996.     Hon. Steny Hamilton Hoyer,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Hoyer: The Violent Crime Control and      Law Enforcement Act of 1994 provides needed assistance to      many governmental agencies. In particular, the Community      Oriented Policy Services (COPS) program provides much needed      funding for manpower and equipment for the law enforcement      community. Moreover, the COPS program provides an excellent      framework from which to build a consistent community policing      approach throughout the country. Additionally, many police      departments would not otherwise be able to afford      implementation of this innovative approach to policing      without federal assistance.       Another extremely important component of the violent Crime      Control Act is funding for addressing the problem of violence      against women. The law enforcement community benefits greatly      from funding for education, training and the formation of      special investigative units to fight this terrible plague on      society. Without continued funding many gains will be      negated.       Should funding for this important act diminish or be      abolished, the adverse impact will be felt at state and local      levels throughout our country. Without the centralized      administration and direction from the COPS office, much      progress in these important endeavors will be lost. Ceasing      these programs in their infancy will cause disruption in      service to our communities, as most state and local      governments cannot afford to pick up lost funding with local      funds at this time.       As this act is of vital importance to the communities in      Maryland, I strongly urge your support for continued funding      by the federal government. The partnership currently in place      among the federal, state and local governments, the police      and our communities is far too important to allow to      dissolve.           Sincerely,                                                David B. Mitchell,                                                   Superintendent.
