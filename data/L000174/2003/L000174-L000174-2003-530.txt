President, I rise today to introduce my Child Nutrition Initiatives Act of 2003. This legislation consists of a number of proposals that I believe will significantly improve the nutrition benefits available to our Nation's children through Federal child nutrition programs.  I am hoping that this legislation will serve as a starting point in the Senate's debate over how to improve child nutrition programs this year. It is not meant to be a comprehensive proposal for reauthorization, nor does it represent all of the potential improvements that could be made to the programs that I will be supporting in the Agriculture Committee. I look forward to working with Chairman Cochran and with Senator Harkin, the ranking Democrat on the Committee, as well as the rest of the Committee to craft a comprehensive bill.  The Committee has already held two hearings on child nutrition legislation, where we heard from a wide variety of nutritionists, school food service operators and others interested in these programs. They presented us with a wide variety of ideas, some of them appearing in my bill, which underlined the immense impact of these programs to the nutritional health and well-being of all of our children and grandchildren. Undersecretary Bost also testified, and he too offered an array of proposals for improving these programs. I look forward to more detailed proposals from the Department of Agriculture on how we can better serve the children in these programs.  I was encouraged to hear that the Administration is interested in providing much-needed financial help for schools choosing to improve their nutritional environment. We know that many school food service directors and employees want to offer healthier, more appetizing options to the children they serve, yet the cost of providing attractive fresh fruits and vegetables, or milk in child-friendly plastic containers kept chilled in a cooler, is often prohibitive. Increased per-meal reimbursements will encourage school cafeterias to spend more on the foods that are healthiest for kids. With these funds, schools will be able to make the salad bar and the milk cooler just as attractive to school children as less nutritious foods.  Healthier food in the school cafeteria does little good if children do not understand the benefits of eating apples over high-fat junk food. For years, the Nutrition Education and Training, NET, program provided critical support for state and local efforts to increase and improve nutrition education in classrooms. It is in the classrooms where the most effective and innovative nutrition education is happening, and NET offered teachers the resources they needed to develop a nutritional curriculum for their students. Unfortunately, this program has not been funded in the last few years. My bill would reinstate funding for the NET program, and encourage strong nutrition education at the local level.  It is amazing how many kids do not know where the food that they eat comes from. It's also amazing how far some farm products travel to get to the cafeteria table. My bill includes a farm-to-cafeteria program that will provide one-time grants to connect farms with their local school system. These grants would be used to buy equipment and pay for other costs to provide the freshest farm products available to our children. Projects funded by the farm-to-cafeteria program would also give children first-hand experience about how food is produced. This new program would also provide economic benefits for small, local firms by keeping food dollars within the community.  My support for these new farm-to-cafeteria projects comes in part from the amazing successes demonstrated by the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program. Years ago, I helped create this program, which provides vouchers to WIC families good for fruits and vegetables at their local farmers market. The effects of this program have been stunning. In Vermont, recipients and farmers are raving about this program, which provides fresh, local, and healthy food to those who need it most. There has also been an unexpected educational component to this program, with many recipients reporting that the farmers who sell them the food have also helped them learn how to best prepare it. This is a win-win situation. My bill will secure steady and predictable funding for the Farmers Market Nutrition Program.  Every State receives a small amount of funds to administer and ensure the integrity of all Federal child nutrition programs. Though these funds are distributed based on usage of the programs, there has been an all-State minimum to ensure that all States still have enough funds to meet the basic administrative requirements mandated by law. This minimum, however, has not been raised since 1981, despite inflation and expansion of the responsibilities of the states. My bill updates the minimum funding level to reflect inflation since 1981 and also indexes it for inflation into the future.  I am pleased that my bill has the support of the American School Food Service Association, the National Association for Farmers Market Nutrition Programs, the National Milk Producers Federation, the International Dairy Foods Association, and the Community Food Service Coalition.  Opponents of my bill will undoubtedly point to the cost of these programs, stating ``there is no money for such programs.'' Well, I answer themwith one word: priorities. Our Nation is faced with a growing health crisis. Children are growing up and growing out. They eat more, eat less nutritious foods and exercise less. It is a health epidemic that plagues them throughout life. By acting now, we can increase the quality of life for these children and save in healthcare costs down the line. For example, a study for the American School Food Service Association and the National Dairy Council found that by improving the quality, and therefore consumption, of milk in our school lunch programs, we could save between $800 million to $1.1 billion in health care costs every year.  I joined with a number of fellow senators in requesting that Congress provide a modest increase of $1 billion per year in the Budget Resolution so that we on the authorizing committees might make some long-awaited and essential improvements to the child nutrition programs. I am disappointed that increased funds were not provided. The Senate sent a clear message to America's children: we would rather give a several hundred billion dollar tax cut to a small minority of health adults than protect our children, through $1 billion in programming, from a health crisis.  The Federal Government reaches well over 25 million children each year with these programs. We have a tremendous opportunity to be proactive--to teach kids about food and give them nutritious options. We have a growing health crisis on our hands as our children grow wider because of unhealthy diets and less exercise. We must get serious about finding solutions to the problem. Or we can wait, and allow a system already doing its very best, working at maximum capacity, to deteriorate. I am for acting now and I hope the Senate is too.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 995       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
