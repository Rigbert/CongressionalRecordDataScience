Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Cathedral as they join together in the celebration of their 40th anniversary. They will be celebrating this very momentous and special occasion on Saturday, November 20, 2004.  The Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Elijah the Prophet is comprised of faithful descendants who came from many parts of the world such as Hercegovina, Bosnia, Lika, Banat, Dalmatia, and Serbia. Some also came from sections of America and Canada. The thriving steel mills offered ready employment. For many descendants, their relatives, friends, and acquaintances were already located in Northwest Indiana. Each soul believed that Eastern Orthodoxy and the Serbian Orthodox Church, as well as the continuance of their Patronal Feast ``Krsna Slava,'' was a priceless inheritance and worthy of great sacrifice. They gathered together under the banner and intercessions of St. Elijah the Prophet, with faith in God Almighty in Trinity to found a church-school congregation in Merrillville, Indiana.  St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Cathedral is led in its faith by the Very Reverend Archpriest Lazar Kostur. In 1986, Protopresbyter Stavrofor George Lazich, retired, and the St. Elijah Cathedral Church Congregation elected Father Lazar to the status of permanent parish priest. On November 5, 1989 he was elevated to the dignity of an Archpriest by Bishop Mitrophan. Father Lazar, along with his wife, Protinica Mira and their beautiful children has served the Serbian Orthodox Church faithfully. The proud parishioners are thankful for the spiritual and emotional leadership he has provided during the years since his ordination.  His Eminence Metropolitan Christopher, His Grace Bishop Longin, His Grace Bishop Mitrophan, and His Grace Bishop Peter have all been invited along with clergy of the Gracanica Diocese and Midwestern Metropolitanate. St. Elijah Cathedral Choir will sing the responses in the church. Hieromonk Irinej Dobrijevic of Belgrade, Serbia, and consultant to the Holy Assembly of Bishops will be the featured speaker. The celebration will include performances by the St. Elijah ``Frula'' Folklore Group, St. Elijah Cathedral Choir and the Czar Lazar Men's Choir of Pittsburgh. A dance with live music from Mladost and Drina will begin after Vespers.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating St. Elijah Serbian Orthodox Cathedral on their 40th anniversary. The members of St. Elijah have dedicated themselves to providing a spiritual and guiding light through the protection of the Serbian Orthodox faith and traditions for all of Northwest Indiana. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of the highest commendation.                          ____________________
