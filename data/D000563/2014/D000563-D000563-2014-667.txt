This language should not be interpreted to supersede section 2822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014.  I concur with the reporting requirements and limitations established by section 2822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and fully expect the Department of Defense to comply with them prior to obligating funds for projects in Guam.  We have also sent a letter to Secretary Hagel from me, Vice Chairman Cochran, and Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Visclosky of the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee directing the Department to comply with the requirements in section 2822 prior to obligating funds.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint letter sent to Secretary Hagel on this subject be printed in the Record.
