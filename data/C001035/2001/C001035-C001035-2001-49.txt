This legislation will authorize the conveyance of a petroleum tank farm at MackPoint in Searsport, ME, from the United States Air Force, USAF, to the Maine Port Authority to promote economic development in the state of Maine. The bill would ultimately allow the transfer of a petroleum tank farm to the Maine Port Authority in the State Department of Transportation, which will provide critical support for the redevelopment strategy in the region. The Port Authority in Maine has developed a three-port strategic goal for economic development in Northern/Central Maine. This economic development remains high on my list of priorities, and this bill would bring us one step closer toward this goal.  I am introducing this bill as a companion to legislation, The Loring Pipeline Reunification Act, which I introduced on the floor earlier this year. This companion legislation would convey a section of a pipeline connected to the tank farm, from the USAF to the Loring Development Authority, LDA, also to contribute to the re-development of the former Loring Air Force Base. Created by the Maine State Legislature, Loring Development Authority is responsible for promoting and marketing the development of the former base so as to attract more economic development to Northern/Central Maine.  The tank farm and pipeline originally were built to supply the former Loring Air Base with fuel products critical to its mission as a support base for B-52 bombers and KC-135 tankers. Prior to the base's closure in 1994, Defense Fuels would deliver fuel products by tanker to the Searsport tank farm, where the line originates, and then pump them through the line to the base. For a period following the base closure, the Maine Air National Guard continued to use the Searsport Tank Farm and the pipeline segment from Searsport to Bangor to supply their activities in Bangor. After a study conducted by the Defense Energy Support Center, a division of the Defense Logistics Agency however, the Air National Guard changed their means of transporting fuel from pipeline to truck.  The Air National Guard supports the vision of re-unifying the pipeline and tank farm, as does the Maine State Department of Transportation, and Sprague Industries, the current owner of the land on which part of the tank farm sits. In consideration of the large geographical expanse of my State, with often treacherous winter conditions, and the fuel shortages that have vexed the Northeast over the past two winters, I believe that the conveyance of this tank farm and the adjoining pipeline would serve the public well. It would provide a safer means of transporting fuel and, by presenting a more efficient means of accessing fuel, manufacturing and processing plants currently considering new operations in the economically-challenged area would be better connected to the resources of the Eastern seaboard.                                 ______                                       By
