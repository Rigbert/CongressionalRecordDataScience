President, I am submitting two letters into the Congressional Record in order to clarify the application of the Congressional Review Act, CRA, to the recent rule Rev. Proc. 2018-38, issued by the Treasury Department and the IRS, to dramatically weaken the disclosure rules for large contributions to certain tax-exempt organizations, including many that engage in political activity, what I and others call the dark money rule. In doing so, I also want to take the opportunity to comment on the rule itself and on the inappropriate and irresponsible approach that the administration is taking to the application of the CRA to the dark money rule.  By way of background, in 1971, as part of a general effort to improve the ability of the IRS to assure that tax-exempt organizations are complying with the tax and election laws, the Treasury Department promulgated a legislative regulation requiring certain tax-exempt organizations to disclose to the IRS, as part of their annual filing, the identity of those who contribute $5,000 or more to the organization. This information is not made available to the public, except in certain cases, but it is can be used by the IRS, State tax administrators, and other Federal agencies.  In recent years, this disclosure requirement has become controversial. Some, particularly conservative groups, have called for the rule to be repealed in an attempt to keep donor information out of the hands of State tax administrators and law enforcement. Others have urged that the disclosure rules be strengthened. I am one of them. Following the 2010 Citizens United decision, more and more dark money has flooded into secretive tax-exempt organizations and into election campaigns in the form of such things as anonymous ``issue ads.'' I have urged that the contributor information be made available to the public and, further, that the IRS improve its application of the rules designed to prevent tax-exempt organizations from engaging in excessive political campaign activity under false pretenses of ``social welfare.'' For example, I have been particularly concerned about reports that a group that is tax exempt under Tax Code section 501(c)(4) that is associated with the National Rifle Association, which has engaged in extensive political activity, may have received large contributions from foreign sources.  In the midst of all of this controversy, on July 16, without any public notice and comment or any consultation with me as ranking Democratic member of the Finance Committee, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2018-38, which invokes a narrow provision that allows the Treasury Secretary to waive particular reporting requirements in appropriate situations, to effectively repeal the entire 1971 regulation requiring the disclosure of large contributions. Perhaps coincidentally and certainly ironically, this was done late in the evening of the day in which the Justice Department arrested an alleged Russian agent, Maria Butina, for attempting to influence American political discourse through a ``gun rights organization,'' later revealed to be the National Rifle Association, a 501(c)(4) dark money political organization.  This was an outrage. It was terrible policy and a terrible process. As I said at the time, the political brazenness of this action shocks the conscience. At a time when the U.S. intelligence community is warning that foreign actors are actively working to interfere in American elections, the Trump administration has decided to tie the hands of the only Federal agency with visibility into financial flows of foreign funds into dark money political organizations.  When the administration proposed the dark money rule, it submitted the rule to Congress for review under the CRA, which allows Congress to disapprove rules after they have been issued. The administration's submission to Congress explicitly states it was a ``Submission of Federal Rules under the Congressional Review Act.'' Senator Tester and I were determined to invoke this process in order to overturn the dark money rule.  There was, however, a procedural problem. The CRA includes a ``clock,'' limiting the period for challenging a new rule, and, under the terms of the CRA, that clock begins on the later of the date the rule is submitted to Congress, and the date it is published in the Federal Register, ``if so published.'' In this case, apparently for the first time, we were dealing with a rule that had been submitted to Congress for review under the CRA but not published in the Federal Register because this is the sort of material that the IRS publishes in the Internal Revenue Bulletin IRB, rather than in the Federal Register. This created a technical question about how to apply the CRA time clock to the IRS rule. To be clear, the question was not whether the CRA applied to the dark money rule, but rather, when the clock for congressional review began.  After consulting with the Parliamentarian, who advised that the CRA process would be clarified if the IRS would confirm, in writing, that the rule would not be published in the Federal Register, I sent Acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter a brief letter asking him to do so. This seemed to me to be a very straightforward request. The IRS's own internal procedure manual makes clear that matters that are issued as ``revenue procedures'' are published in the IRB rather than the Federal Register. Further, an IRS official had informally confirmed by email that would be the case here. On top of that, the dark money rule was in fact published in the IRB on July 30.  I ask unanimous consent that my August 21, 2018, letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             United States Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                  Washington, DC, August 21, 2018.     Hon. David Kautter,     Acting Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury          for Tax Policy, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC.       Dear Acting Commissioner Kautter: As you know, on July 26,      the Treasury Department and IRS submitted to the Senate,     under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), Rev. Proc. 2018-38,      which modifies the information to be reported to the IRS by      certain organizations exempt from tax under section 501(a) of      the Internal Revenue Code.       Under the CRA, the period for potential Congressional      review begins on the later of the date of submission to      Congress or publication in the Federal Register, ``if so      published.'' My understanding is that revenue procedures are      not published in the Federal Register but instead are      published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.       In light of this, it would facilitate the Congressional      review process if the IRS would confirm in writing that the      IRS will not submit Rev. Proc. 2018-39 for publication in the      Federal Register. I would appreciate it if you would do so.       Please call me or have a member of your staff contact      Tiffany Smith or Mike Evans of the Finance Committee      Democratic staff if you have any questions.       Thank you for your assistance with this.           Sincerely,                                                    Ron Wyden,                                                   Ranking Member,                                             Committee on Finance.
