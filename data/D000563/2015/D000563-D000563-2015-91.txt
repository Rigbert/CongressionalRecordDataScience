President, I hope the Senator from Hawaii can stay for just a moment.  If a student is about to graduate from high school, looking for a college, and goes online and types in the word ``college'' or ``university,'' watch what happens. The page is flooded. The University of Phoenix, DeVry, Kaplan--all of these different schools are flooding the page saying: Come to our school. How does a student know if it is good or not? The only yardstick that can be used is, well, do they receive Federal Pell grants for their students? Do their students receive Federal loans? The answer, when it comes to for-profit schools, is yes.  Senator Schatz has put his finger on the problem. They accredit themselves. They decide among themselves who will stay in business. Guess what. They all stay in business.  So the unsuspecting student goes to a worthless, for-profit school, gets a worthless diploma, goes deep in debt, and thinks, I thought this was a good school. How can I get a Federal Pell grant to this school and get a worthless diploma?  The Department of Education is not doing its job. Congress is not doing its job. We have to enforce these standards.  Corinthian was one of the giants. Corinthian went bankrupt. They measured how many students came out of Corinthian and got a job. The numbers were pretty encouraging. The Huffington Post writer started followingthe students that got the jobs. Do you know what Corinthian was doing? They were giving $2,000 to employers to hire their graduates for 1 month so they could report to the Federal Government that their graduates all have jobs. When they were caught with it, they went bankrupt.  Do my colleagues know what we ended up losing, what the Federal taxpayers lost? It could be billions. Who ended up on the hook? The students. The students ended up with the debt, and the taxpayers ended up as losers. Corinthian should never have been accredited.
