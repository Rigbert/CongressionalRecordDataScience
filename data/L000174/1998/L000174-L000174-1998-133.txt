 The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Only one amendment remains at the desk. It has been withdrawn. That is amendment No. 3519. That will not be offered. After Senator Hatch has spoken, I will be making a motion to table the Dodd amendment.  So I say to all Senators that is the last vote prior to final passage. We should have two votes--a vote on the motion to table the Dodd amendment and then a vote on final passage--and we will be finished with this bill.
