President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 prepared by my staff be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006--Summary       This legislation will provide the structure and the      resources needed to better protect the American people from      attack through our seaports that are both vulnerable points      of entry and vital centers of economic activity. Each year,      more than 11 million containers pass through the ports and      53,000 foreign-flagged vessels call at U.S. ports. This bill      is a comprehensive approach that addresses all major aspects      of maritime cargo security. The bill reflects not only      bipartisan consultation and support, but coordination among      the Senate Homeland Security, Commerce, and Finance      Committees.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Must Establish Strategies and                                Standards       Strategic Plan. The Secretary of Homeland Security must      develop a strategic plan to enhance international supply      chain security for all modes of transportation by which      containers arrive in, depart from or move through seaports of      the United States. The Secretary must clarify roles,      responsibilities, and authorities of all government agencies      at all levels and private sector stakeholders. The plan must      provide measurable goals for furthering the security of      commercial operations from point of origin to point of      destination, build on available resources and consider costs      and benefits; and identify response and recovery methods.       Container Security Standards. Because container security      standards have languished at the Department of Homeland      Security (DHS), the legislation requires the Secretary to      establish minimum standards for the movement and storage of      containers within 180 days of the enactment of the bill. It      can base these regulations on its experience with the cargo      security programs that it currently operates. In addition,      the Secretary is directed to seek to establish international      standards through multilateral agreements or international      bodies.       Resumption of Operations at Seaports. The Secretary shall      develop protocols for the resumption of trade in the event of      a security incident or a disruption to trade at seaports. To      handle the immediate response to an incident, the Secretary      must establish protocols that make clear who is the initial      incident commander and the lead agency that will execute and      coordinate the response so that there will be no confusion.      In reestablishing the flow of trade through U.S. ports,      preference shall be given to vessels with a valid security      plan that are manned with individuals who have undergone      background checks and are operated by validated C-TPAT      participants. Preference should be given to cargo that is      entering a U.S. port from a CSI port and handled by a      validated participant in C-TPAT.                        Cargo Security Programs       Improved Automated Targeting System. A critical component      of the targeting of cargo for inspection is the Automated      Targeting System. This computer-based system helps DHS to      determine which cargo presents a high security risk. The      legislation requires the Secretary to identify and seek the      submission of data related to the importation of cargo in      order to improve the targeting of high-risk cargo. It also      requires the Secretary to establish an independent review of      the system.       Container Security Initiative (CSI). The bill establishes      CSI to identify and examine maritime containers that pose a      risk for terrorism at foreign ports in order to keep      potential threats far from America's shores. In CSI, U.S.      Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel work closely      with foreign government officials to target and inspect      cargo headed to the U.S. at foreign ports. Before the      Secretary may designate a foreign port under CSI, the      Secretary must conduct a full assessment of the risk of      terrorists compromising containers; the capabilities and      level of cooperation of the intended host country; and the      potential for validation of security practices by the      Department.       Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). This      legislation establishes the C-TPAT program to strengthen and      improve the overall security of the international supply      chain. This voluntary program encourages participants to take      steps to ensure that their supply chains are secure. Based on      a participant's efforts in the program, they are placed on      one of three tiers. The legislation requires the Secretary to      validate the supply chain security practices of each      participant and offer benefits to participants based on their      levels of certification and validation.       C-TPAT Top Tier. The top tier (Tier 3) or GreenLane status      for C-TPAT participants provides the highest level of      benefits, which may include the following: reduced      examinations, priority examinations and searches, and the      expedited release of cargo during all threat levels.       Uniform Data for Government-Wide Usage. To simplify the      filing of documentation needed to import cargo and facilitate      the compilation of data, the Secretary of Treasury shall      complete the implementation of the International Trade Data      System, a single, uniform data system for the electronic      collection, dissemination, and sharing of import and export      information.       Radiation Detection and Radiation Safety. Radiation      detection equipment is critical to ensuring that no      radiological device leaves a U.S. port. The bill directs the      Secretary of DHS to install radiation portal monitors at the      22 largest U.S. ports by the end of 2007. This will cover 98      percent of incoming container traffic.       100 Percent Scanning Pilot Program. The Secretary shall      establish a pilot program at three foreign ports to test the      practicality and effectiveness of systems designed to scan      100 percent of cargo. The scanning systems must couple non-     intrusive imaging and radiation detection equipment.       In-Bond Cargo. Cargo that travels in-bond through the U.S.      from the ports is a major vulnerability because the final      destination of the cargo is not known. The bill requires a      report on in-bond cargo that would include whether additional      information should be required for in-bond cargo, a plan for      tracking in-bond cargo in the to-be-developed ACE system, and      an assessment of how to ensure 100 percent reconciliation      between the port of arrival and destination.              Resources and Coordination for Port Security       Port Security Grants and Training. The bill establishes      risk-based grants, training, and exercises for port security.      The legislation authorizes $400 million in appropriations for      port security grants.       Office of Cargo Security Policy. This legislation      establishes within the Department of Homeland Security an      Office of Cargo Security Policy to coordinate department-wide      efforts regarding cargo security policies and programs.       Interagency Operations Centers. The bill directs the      Secretary to establish Interagency Operation Centers for      Maritime and Cargo Security at all high-priority ports to      enhance information sharing and facilitate day-to-day      operational coordination, and incident management and      response between agencies. The agencies at the operations      centers include the Coast Guard, CBP, the FBI, Department of      Defense, state and local law enforcement or port security      personnel, and private sector stakeholders, as the Secretary      determines is appropriate.       Research. Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E). The      Secretary must direct RDT&E efforts in furtherance of      maritime and cargo security, encourage the ingenuity of the      private sector in developing and testing such technologies,      and evaiuate such technologies. The Secretary shall ensure      all Department RDT&E efforts are coordinated to avoid      duplicative efforts and share results.
