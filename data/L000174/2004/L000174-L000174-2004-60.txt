I am not accusing the Senator from Connecticut of doing that, but we suddenly have this thing plopped on our desks as people are leaving for the long-promised recess, and we are told: Here, we just have to put this all together right now.

I think had we had those hearings, had we discussed it, you would have found a vast majority of Americans would assume the Secret Service carries out their law enforcement functions.
