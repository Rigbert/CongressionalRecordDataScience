 President, I too want to comment on the great service of Terry Gainer and Daryl Chappelle.  Our departing Sergeant at Arms, Terry Gainer, whose decade-plus period of Senate service has been the capstone to a very long and distinguished career.  Terry is a familiar presence in the halls of the Capitol and always a reassuring one. Whenever you saw Terry, you always had the sense that things were under control around here, even though you knew how much work and preparation went into it. It is the same feeling you might have being around the father of a large family or a veteran big city cop, and I think it is no accident that Terry is both of those as well.  He has the bearing of a guy with long experience who has seen it all. We have all gotten the benefit of that experience over his years here, and that is something that just can't be bought.  Those of you who have watched the majority leader and I spar down here on the floor in the mornings know we don't agree on much, but picking Terry was one decision he got just right.  Terry's resume is pretty well known by now. He spent nearly half a century enforcing the law at the Federal, State, and city levels in a number of very demanding, high-profile posts. He started his law enforcement career in Chicago during the tumultuous year of 1968, making him one of five boys in his family to serve in the Chicago Police Department. That is to say nothing of his extended family. It is a point of pride in the Gainer family that there has been a Gainer on the Chicago PD for more than a century.  Terry volunteered to serve his country in Vietnam and served with distinction. He spent several years as a homicide detective in Chicago before moving over to the State police. He later served as an official at the Transportation Department, and for a time he was No. 2 in the DC Police Department. Somehow along the way he also got a law degree and helped negotiate Chicago's first-ever labor contract with the police union there.  He is the only person ever to serve as both the Chief of the Capitol Police and the Senate Sergeant at Arms. During his tenure as the Senate's top law enforcement officer, he has overseen a dedicated team of 850 professionals. He has presided over major improvements to the physical safety of the Capitol Complex and the Senate's IT infrastructure here and in our State offices. He has kept us all informed during emergencies.  For one night every January, he is the public face of the institution. I know Terry says he tries to get out of camera shot during the State of the Union, but we won't blame a guy with 14 grandkids for sneaking in a little face time on the State of the Union night.  Terry recently admitted to having a few secret signals for the grandkids--sort of like a third base coach. One time, he even got President Obama and the First Lady to pose for a photo with Flat Stanley. It is just one of the fond memories he says he will carry with him into his next chapter, and we wish him all the best.  We will miss his intelligence, his professionalism, and his good humor. Terry's colleagues will tell us that among his many other qualities, he is a lot of fun to be around. We will also miss the wisdom and judgment he brought to the job every morning. Terry leaves a legacy of excellence and a stellar example for his successors.  Let me add on that note that one of the most impressive aspects of Terry's legacy is the fact that despite the incredible demands of a high-pressure, high-profile career, he and Irene managed to raise six wonderful kids. I know they both share a deep and lively faith and would attribute much of their success to that. But it is still impressive, and we are glad the family will get to spend even more time with Terry now.  So, Terry, thanks for your service. You are a credit to your profession, your native Chicago, and to the Senate you have served so well. You have every reason to be proud. Now go enjoy your retirement, at least for awhile.                       Tribute To Daryl Chappelle  Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to another beloved member of the Senate family, Mr. Daryl Chappelle. Daryl has been here for more than four decades, and this week he takes his final turn at the helm of one of the two subway cars that run from Russell to the Capitol.  Daryl came here right out of Springarn High School, over in northeast Washington, when he was 19 yearsold, and by all accounts he has been an exemplary worker. He began his career in the night labor division of the Senate superintendent's office in 1972. Since 1986, he has worked off and on as a mechanic and driver for the subway service. By one estimate, he has taken 130,000 trips between Russell and the Capitol.  But it is not the length of Daryl's tenure that I wish to honor this morning, as impressive as that is. It is the spirit in which Daryl did his job every day. It is literally legendary.
