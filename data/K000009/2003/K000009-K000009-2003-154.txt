Speaker, this year, the Oberlin, Ohio, Fire Department celebrates its 150th anniversary. Established in 1853, today the department boasts a staff of 30, state-of-the-art equipment, safety and educational programming, and professional recognition. The community has celebrated the sesquicentennial with a parade, summertime events, a traditional firefighter competition featuring an old-fashioned bucket brigade, hose race, and water ball contest, displays and an open house, and culminating in a special dinner this fall.  The mission of the Oberlin Fire Department is ``To proudly protect lives and property by providing prompt, skillful, cost-effective protection and life safety services.'' It is routinely recognized for successfully meeting this mission with the prestigious yearly Life Safety Achievement Award. It serves the 10,000 people of Oberlin and New Russia Township in northeast Ohio with emergency responses, college fire safety courses, school and community educational services, and fire prevention efforts.  For a century and a half, ordinary men and women have conducted themselves with extraordinary bravery as they skillfully guarded the safety of their fellow citizens in Oberlin. I am proud and humbled to represent these fine people, and join with the community in a resounding ``thank you!''                          ____________________
