 President, we are perilously close to finishing all but the habeas amendments. The Nunn-Biden [[Page S7768]] amendment on posse comitatus is either going to be debated very shortly or accepted very shortly.  That leaves, I think, after the vote on the Specter-Simon amendment, we will know then on the outcome of that vote, whether or not the Abraham amendment is still relevant. If Specter-Simon prevails, as I hope it does, then the Abraham amendment would be dropped.  The only amendment I am aware of on the Republican side which we do not have any agreement on at this point--we thought we did--was the Brown amendment. If Senator Brown is available, we are ready to enter into a very short time agreement and debate that amendment tonight.
