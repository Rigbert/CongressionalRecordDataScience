President, last week marked the end of Francis Brooks' tenure as the sergeant-at-arms of the Vermont State House. The position of sergeant-at-arms is one of great importance, playing a pivotal role in maintaining the order and decorum that Vermonters have come to expect of their State government. It is a job that demands a comprehensive understanding of the people who conduct the important work within the building, and the building itself.  Francis Brooks has served the people of the city of Montpelier in a number of roles. He taught chemistry and physics at Montpelier High School for 32 years; he was a State legislator for 25 years; and he has volunteered with the Montpelier Fire Department for 40 years. This level of dedication alone is worthy of appreciation and respect, but Francis's service did not stop there. For the last 7 years, Francis has served his State as sergeant-at-arms.  I have fond memories of the Vermont State House. My parents owned the Leahy Press, located just across the street, and now home to the Vermont Arts Council. From our early years and onward, my brother and sister and I were always encouraged by our parents to pay attention to what happened within those walls and to respect the building for what it represented. As a young boy I rode my bicycle through the halls of the capitol in Montpelier, sometimes wandering into the private office of the Governor, where he sat from behind his desk peering down at me. Francis upheld what I treasure most about our State's capitol--an open and welcoming building for all Vermonters. He has not only overseenthe preservation and safety of the Vermont State House, but he has encouraged the public to use the space to enhance our community through events like the Farmers Night Concert Series, the U.S. Academy Nominations Ceremony, public discussion forums like the Opiate Conference, statewide high school debate competitions, and the continued involvement of young people in our State's political system through the legislative page program. Every year, Francis chose 30 eighth graders to serve at the Vermont State House in 6-week periods. Upon these students' successful completion of the program, Francis would send them to apply for the U.S. Senate page program--and I was always impressed by the quality of students who represented Vermont in the Nation's Capital.  Marcelle and I thank Francis Brooks for the several decades of selfless loyalty he has shown to Montpelier and to the State of Vermont. In a 2011 interview with a Vermont newspaper Seven Days, Francis described the role of the sergeant-at-arms by saying, ``If the inside of the [State House] is considered a town, then I'm the town manager.'' Vermont is lucky to have such an inspiring, well-grounded and selfless public servant.                          ____________________
