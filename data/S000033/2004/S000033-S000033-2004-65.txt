 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and I were originally going to offer an amendment, but we are not going to do that. We are withdrawing the amendment; and instead, we look forward to engaging in a colloquy with the chairman and the ranking member.  Mr. Chairman, the issue that we are discussing today is of extraordinary importance. In the midst of Iraq and Afghanistan, let us never forget that 100,000 veterans from the first Gulf War continue to suffer from a yet not fully understood debilitating illness commonly known as Gulf War Illness.  The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and I for a number of years have been working together on this issue, and I want to applaud him for his leadership. The fact of the matter is that over the years, while the Congress has appropriated many, many millions of dollars to research and tried to understand Gulf War Illness, in fact, much of that money has not been effective in getting us to better understand this problem.  As many will recall, at the beginning of this discussion, the DOD and the VA were both saying, hey, there is no problem; and then more and more veterans came forward and they said, well, there is a problem, but it is stress related. Finally, after many, many years, I think both the VA and the DOD now understand that we have a very serious physical problem.  Mr. Chairman, I am happy to inform my colleagues that the good news is that real progress is now being made in our understanding of Gulf War Illness. Medical researchers like Dr. Robert Haley of the University of Texas and other researchers can now measure real physical neurological damage in many Gulf War Illness sufferers. These injuries are likely the result of low-level exposure to chemical nerve agents during the first Gulf War. Much of the evidence suggests that exposure to these nerve agents is the direct result of the destruction of a major chemical weapons dump in Iraq by the U.S. military that created a plume of chemicals that may have exposed hundreds of thousands of U.S. military personnel and civilians in the region.  In hearings held by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) in the last couple of weeks, we heard from Dr. Haley about the status of his research. Dr. Haley's findings were corroborated at the hearing by Dr. Paul Greengard, a 2000 Nobel Laureate and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at the Rockefeller University. He agreed that research into neurological damage caused by low-level nerve agents is the most promising in terms of finding a cause and a treatment for Gulf War Illness.  There has also been a change in attitude in the Pentagon and the VA about this illness. It appears that both now acknowledge that this is a very real physical injury. Secretary of VA Anthony Principi has taken an active interest in supporting Gulf War Illness research and has committed $15 million to continuing the fight.  Mr. Chairman, I would introduce into the Record at this point a letter from Jim Binns, who is the chairman of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illnesses, who supports this line of research.                                                 VA Eastern Kansas                                            Healthcare System,                                        Topeka, KS, June 22, 2004.     Hon. Christopher Shays,     Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats          and International Relations, Committee on Government          Reform, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to testify      before your subcommittee on June 1. As you could tell from      the hearing, we are at a moment of truth on Gulf War      illnesses. On the one hand, the science is finally there to      show that this is a medical problem, an important component      of which is neurological in nature. Furthermore, researchers      like Dr. Paul Greengard of Rockefeller University are waiting      in the wings with projects that have a real chance of      producing a cure. As you know, Dr. Greengard received the      Nobel Prize in medicine in 2000 for his work to uncover the      brain mechanisms involved in Parkinsons disease and to      develop a treatment for that disease, and he testified that      the same approach can succeed in Gulf War illnesses. In      response to these new scientific findings, research managers      at VA and DoD recognize the opportunity to pursue this type      of research.       On the other hand, while Secretary Principi is going to      increase VA funding to $15 million, DoD, which has      historically funded three-quarters of Gulf War illnesses      research, is currently funding no new projects in this area      because of its internal priorities. In addition to the      financial implications, this withdrawal of DoD from Gulf War      illnesses research dramatically limits the universe of      researchers whose talents can be brought to bear, because VA      by law can only fund VA internal research. Unlike DoD or NIH,      VA cannot give grants to outside researchers. Thus,      researchers like Dr. Greengard and others who have done      important, DoD-funded work in the past, cannot be funded with      the possible exception of minor sub-contractor roles. Other      respected scientists with relevant expertise similarly cannot      be engaged unless they work for VA. So just as there is      finally something solid to research, and a willingness on the      part of the research managers to spend in the right places,      funding is dramatically down, and the cadre of potential      researchers is dramatically limited.       On behalf of the membership of the Research Advisory      Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illnesses, I urgently request      you to seek an amendment to the DoD appropriations bill to      provide $30 million to the U.S. Army Medical Research and      Materiel Command for Gulf War illnesses research in FY 2005.      I have been told that Gulf War illnesses formerly was a line      item in the DoD budget, in the period when federal spending      was at the $45 million annual level (direct and indirect) in      1999-2002.       It would also be constructive to include language requiring      that ninety percent of this funding be placed with non-     governmental researchers, that DoD develop with VA and NIH      (specifically the National Institute of Neurological      Disorders and Stroke) a comprehensive federal research plan      for Gulf War veterans illnesses, and that DoD seek the input      and review of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War      Veterans Illnesses in the creation of this plan and decisions      on which research to fund in pursuit of the plan.       I apologize not to have brought this matter to your      attention earlier, but our energies have been focuses on VA.      Thank you for your consideration of this request at this      critical juncture.           Respectfully,                                               James H. Binns,                                       Chairman, Research Advisory                         Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illnesses.  Mr. Chairman, I would also enter into the Record at this point a letter from Ross Perot, who has been one of the leaders on this issue over the years, who also understands that we are dealing with neurological illness.                                                    Plano, TX,                                                    June 22, 2004.     Congressmen Bernie Sanders and Chris Shays,     Congress of the United States,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressmen Sanders and Shays: As you both know, I      have long been active in promoting and funding research to      find treatments and a cure for Gulf War Illness--which now      affects over 100,000 veterans of the first Gulf War.       In recent years, great strides have been made in our      understanding of the actual physical harm that these veterans      have suffered. Researchers like Dr. Haley and others have      been able to detect brain damage that likely resulted from      exposure to low levels of sarin nerve agents.       While the advances have been impressive, so much more still      needs to be done. That is why I am pleased to support your      amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill to      provide $30 million in Gulf War Illness research.       Not only will this type of research help victims of Gulf      War Illness, but it could provide us with knowledge that      would increase our ability to defend soldiers and civilians      against future chemical attacks.       This research could also provide clues to other illnesses      in both the military and civilian context that may be caused      by low level chemical exposure.       Once again, I strongly support this amendment and look      forward to working together to end the terrible suffering      that so many Gulf War veterans are suffering.           Sincerely,                                                       Ross Perot.  Mr. Chairman, I now move into the colloquy between the chairman and the ranking member, if I might.  Am I correct that the gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) are committing to work with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and me to secure additionalfunding for Gulf War Illness research when the bill goes to conference?
