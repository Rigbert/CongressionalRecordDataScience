Chairman, this is an important debate. I recognize that we have had Federal agencies that have had overreach and have done things that go beyond their training and possibly should be done by other agencies. I won't disagree with that; but doing this in an appropriation bill is not the right place to do this.  The authorizers should have this debate, and we shouldn't be making these determinations with an appropriations bill which just broadly states that we are going to get rid of a whole swath of law enforcement, whether they are good or bad. It doesn't determine that because we can't do that in this type of legislative process.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, if I may inquire how much time is remaining so I don't consume all the gentleman's time?  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 45 seconds remaining.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I will just be short and sweet. I support the gentleman from California's strong objection to this amendment and would encourage people not to vote for it.  Let me conclude with this: an EPA law enforcement official deserves the right to come home to their families safe at night, and so they should have the tools that they need in order to do that.
