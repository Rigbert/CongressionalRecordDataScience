Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. LaTourette), who is chairman of the Subcommitteeon Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, and they oversee FEMA.  Mr. LaTOURETTE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, there are few new thoughts we can add at this hour of the evening about our reflected thoughts of the last 36 hours, but I do appreciate the fact that the House has made it available for every Member who wanted to offer a thought to do so.  Aside from an expression of sincere sympathy to all those who have lost a loved one, a prayer today for the souls of those who have perished, and an expression of admiration and thanks to all of those who have struggled mightily to recover and rescue people they do not even know, I would hope that we might all take a moment to contemplate the inhumanity of people who would commandeer four aircraft full of innocent people, including children, with the intent to propel them into buildings filled with thousands of other innocent people who did nothing more than show up to work on a Tuesday morning.  These terrorists, Mr. Speaker, are not people in the accepted understanding of the word, and the world will not be safe until they are blotted from the face of the Earth. I have every reason and hope to believe that this Congress is united in its commitment to provide the President of the United States with every resource necessary to search and recover the victims of this horrible tragedy and to search, discover, and destroy this blight upon the human race.
