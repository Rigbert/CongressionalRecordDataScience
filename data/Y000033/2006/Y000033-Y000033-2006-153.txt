Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order that the language contained in section 425 beginning with ``the Congress finds that,'' on page 125, line 3, through ``contributors of global emissions'' on page 125, line 25, violates clause 2 of rule XXI of the rules of the House representing prohibited legislation in appropriation bills.  The language that I have cited contains congressional findings and a sense of Congress on global warming. This language clearly constitutes legislation in appropriations bill, and such violates clause 2 of rule XXI.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any Member wish to be heard on the point of order?
