Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate some of the most dedicated and skilled workers in Northwest Indiana. On September 18, 1998, in a salute to their workers' durability and longevity, the Sheet Metal Workers, Local #20, of Gary, Indiana, honored their members of fifty years, forty years, and twenty-five years continued service. These individuals, in addition to the other Local #20 members who have served Northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long time, are a testament to the proto-typical American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hard-working.  The men and women of Local #20 are a fine representation of America's union men and women; I am proud to represent such dedicated men and women in Congress. The Sheet Metal Workers Constitution states, ``. . . to establish and maintain desirable working conditions and thus provide for themselves and their families that measure of comfort, happiness, and security to which every citizen is entitled in return for his labor, from a deep sense of pride in our trade, to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.'' For fifty years, the following individuals have followed this creed: John Bitner, Alan Bradford, Henry Eckstein, Clem Gora, Arthur Kekeis, Raymond Klodzen, Ton Mason, Andrew Mushinsky, John Piecuch, Joseph Pollock, Allen Tucker, and John Wesbecher. In 1958, Eugene Bitner, Harold Couma, John Downing, Harry Hamilton, Franklin Klee, Ralph Lasky, and Frank Macewicz, Arthur Panek, Willie Peters, Levi Richmond, Thomas Schaeffer, George Sweat, and Jack Teitge began their own forty years of service to Northwest Indiana and membership in the Sheet Metal Workers trade union. In addition to the great service and dedication displayed by the fifty and forty-year continued service members, the members with twenty-five years of continued service were honored. They are Robert Allen, Howard Alward, Keith Benson, Joseph Bloomfield, Robert Bonner, David Condon, Henry Cook, Benjamin Dear, Randall Hamilton, Terrence Henney, Arthur Herr, Donald Hill, David Hoffman, Kevin Hoffman, Clifford Hynd, David Jorgenson, John Klein, James Knapik, Carlton Kobe, Jerry Krachinski, Thomas Labney, Gerald Levendouski, Raymond Levendouski, Dan Londacre, John McShane, David Masterson, Gus Martakis, Richard Mendez, Earl Miller, Marty Mushinsky, Floyd Nelson, John Oros, Joseph Poropat, Rocky Richardson, Joseph Ring, Steven Sasko, William Schaeffer, Michael Shammert, Louis Schest, Jacob Sherwood, Eugene Skalba, Charles Spicker, Robert Swisher, Michael Switt, Larry Tayler, Walter Thomas, Charles Thompson, Robert Vaughn, Frank Vidimos, Wayne Werdin, Roger Wright, and Paul Zander.  As Orville Dewey said, ``Labor is man's greatest function. He is nothing, he can do nothing, he can achieve nothing, he can fulfill nothing, without working.'' The men of Local #20, in addition to all of the local unions in Northwest Indiana, form the backbone of our economy and community. Without their blood, sweat, and tears, Indiana's First Congressional District would not be a place of which to be proud, it would not be the place I love, nor would it be my home.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, upstanding members of Local #20, in addition to all the hard-working union men and women of America. Their hard labor and dauntless courage are the achievement and fulfillment of the American dream.                          ____________________
