Mr. Speaker, in a rollcall on September 26, 1996, the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act of 1996, which would reestablish the Congress as the ultimate decisionmaker in managing public lands and maintain sovereign control of lands in the United States, failed--by a 246 to 178 vote--to receive the two-thirds majority necessary to suspend the rules and pass the bill. The bill simply requires congressional approval of international land designations in the United States, primarily UNESCO World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves. These designations, as presently handled, are an open invitation to the international community to interfere in U.S. domestic land-use decisions.  I am amazed that a single Member of Congress would oppose legislation requiring congressional oversight of international land designations within the borders of the United States. What is unreasonable about Congress insisting that no land be designated for inclusion in international land use programs without the clear and direct approval of Congress? What is unreasonable about having local citizens and public officials participate in decisions on designating land near their homes for inclusion in an international land program?  Many, many Americans from all sections of our country have called my office to say that they are concerned about the lack of congressional oversight over UNESCO international land designations in the United States and to express their support for H.R. 3752. I want to say to them that this fight has not ended. I plan to introduce this bill again in the 105th Congress.  I would like to include the following recent articles about the debate over H.R. 3752. I urge my colleagues to read these commentaries.           Congress Fails To Veto U.N. Role in National Parks                           (By Cliff Kincaid)       In a sign of mounting anti-United Nations sentiment, Rep.      Don Young (R-Alaska) got about 60% of House members--246 to      178 (see rollcall next week)--to vote in favor of his      ``American Land Sovereignty Protection Act'' (H.R. 3753) on      September 26, but because the bill didn't get the two-thirds      approval needed under suspension of the rules procedures, it      ultimately failed. Thirty-three Democrats voted for the      popular piece of legislation, 15 Republicans voted against      it.       The bill would have required congressional approval before      federal officials seek special U.N. status for U.S. parks and      public lands. It was brought to the House floor just two      weeks after Rep. Young had convened an informative September      12 hearing of his House Resources. Committee to highlight how      the United Nations has been brought in to ``protect''      literally tens of millions of acres of federal land. The      hearing focused on how President Clinton complied with a U.N.      recommendation to kill a gold mine project outside      Yellowstone National Park.       Citizens and local officials from Montana, New Mexico,      Wyoming, Colorado and even New York testified that the United      Nations has been involved in labeling public lands in their      communities as World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves      without their knowledge or consent. They said the U.N.      involvement including proposals for ``buffer zones'' around      these areas, threatens private property rights, property      values and economic development.       In the United States there are now 20 World Heritage Sites,      designated under the terms of a 1972 treaty, and 47 Biosphere      Reserves, designated under a 1970 U.N.-sponsored ``Man and      the Biosphere'' program that has been implemented without the      benefit of a treaty. The programs are run out of the U.N      Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in      Paris.       According to Rep. Young, these U.N.-designated areas      comprise more than 51 million acres--68% of all National      Parks, Preserves and Monuments, including the Statute of      Liberty and Independence Hall.       Unwilling to take the side of the United Nations against      Congress, not one major environmentalist group accepted an      invitation to testify and no Democrats on the committee      showed up at the hearing to oppose the bill. The Clinton      Administration did, however, send Assistant Interior      Secretary George Frampton to testify against the Young bill.      Frampton was clearly perturbed by Young's effort to promote      his legislation by asking his congressional colleagues, ``Is      Boutros Boutros-Ghali zoning land in your district?''       Ironically, Frampton's own dealings with the United Nations      in the Yellowstone matter were a major factor in prompting      the hearings and the proposed legislation.                       clinton's yellowstone deal       Circumventing the lawful process of completing an      Environmental Impact Statement to determine what threat, if      any, was posed by a proposed gold mine, Frampton last year      invited a foreign U.N. delegation to make a brief visit to      Yellowstone, which is both a World Heritage Site and a      Biosphere Reserve, to call for a ``buffer zone'' around the      park and to declare it ``in danger'' from the mining project.      The leader of the delegation was a German, Bernd Von Droste,      who has called for global energy taxes to enable the United      Nations to better ``protect'' these areas.       After the U.N intervention, the mining company, Crown Butte      Mines Inc., agreed to White House demands to cancel the      project in return for a vague presidential promise of some      federal land somewhere else. ``This President believed the      U.N. has more value than the Congress,'' Rep. Young angrily      declared, vowing to push his sovereignty bill and subject      Clinton's Yellowstone deal to congressional scrutiny.       But the administration's Frampton dismissed these concerns.      ``People are nervous the U.N. is coming,'' he sniffed. He      insisted the U.N. designations simply promote environmental      cooperation and actually serve to attract tourists. When      told, however, that the United Nations had complained that      Yellowstone was too crowded by tourists, he just replied, ``I      was not aware of that.'' Indeed, environmental groups not      only wanted the gold mine stopped, but have suggested greatly      restricting tourism within the park.       Myron Ebell of Frontiers of Freedom, a group started by      former Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R.-Wyo.), said Frampton was part      of a ``cabal'' of federal agencies and environmental groups      that regard the United Nations as a `'weapon'' in their      campaign to deindustrialize America. Paul C. Jones, executive      director of the Colorado-based Minerals Exploration      Coalition, said the involvement of the United Nations in      Yellowstone was ``unprecedented'' and amounted to an      international ``land grab.'' The House support for the Young      legislation is only one indication that opposition is      building.       Rep. Tim Hutchinson (R.-Ark.) testified that citizens in      his own state, including a group called ``Take Back      Arkansas,'' had thwarted the designation of the Ozark      National Forest as a Biosphere Reserve because they didn't      want their ``prized national treasures'' subjected to      international agreements that might conflict with U.S. law.      In a case involving Mount Mitchell State Park in North      Carolina, citizen action forced park authorities to actually      take the words ``United Nations'' off a wooden sign leading      into the park.       For her part, Nina Sibal of UNESCO testified that passage      of Young's legislation was ``a sovereign decision'' of the      United States. Her French UNESCO associate, Pierre Lasserre,      however, did venture the opinion that the name of the ``Man      and the Biosphere'' program should be changed because it      sounds ``sexist.''               U.N.-Sponsored Aliens Land in Yellowstone                         (By Gayle M.B. Hanson)       The Clinton administration allowed an obscure treaty to      establish U.N. authority over Yellowstone National Park, the      Statue of Liberty and other American sites. House Democrats      backed the power grab.       Okay, so maybe there were only a handful of individuals      involved, and maybe they didn't actually arrive in the dead      of night protected by whirring black helicopters and hell-     bent on clandestine maneuvers. But the fact that four members      of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural      Organization's, or UNESCO's, World Heritage Committee      traveled from halfway around the globe to the Idaho-Montana-     Wyoming border area in summer 1995 to investigate a      ``dangerous'' situation unfolding at Yellowstone National      Park has some people still scratching their heads in      disbelief.       The aforementioned (dare we say it?) aliens were invited to      poke around on their fact-finding mission at Yellowstone by      Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish and Wildlife and      Parks George Frampton Jr. Frampton, at the behest of the U.S.      Park Service and a cavalcade of environmental groups      including the Sierra Club, the National Audubon Society and      the Wilderness Society, an organization Frampton once led,      officially sought the intervention of UNESCO's World Heritage      Committee to remedy what they called ``extremely serious      threats'' by a proposed gold mine near the park.       The initial correspondence from the environmental groups to      the World Heritage Centre in March 1995 requested that      Yellowstone be put on the List of the World Heritage in      Danger due to the mine that was planned on its perimeter. The      World Heritage Centre followed up with a letter to Frampton      in June     requesting a detailed analysis of the site to determine      whether it should be included for consideration as endangered      at their July meeting in Paris. On June 27, Frampton      responded on behalf of the Clinton administration in a      lengthy letter in which he pleaded for intervention by the      U.N. group and urged that international investigators      immediately be sent to Yellowstone.       ``[Interior] Secretary Babbit and I are informed of the      nongovernmental conservation group concerns as transmitted to      the Centre,'' Frampton wrote to Bernd von Droste, the World      Heritage Centre director. ``We believe that a potential      danger to the values of the park and surrounding waters and      fisheries exists and the Committee should be informed that      the property as inscribed in the World Heritage List is in      danger.''       In short, invoking a madcap treaty, the Clinton      administration accepted U.N. sovereignty in these matters and      called upon a U.N. agency to save Yellowstone. Several months      later four individuals from the Centre flew to the rescue.      ``I was there the entire time they visited,'' says Paul C.      Jones, executive director of the Minerals Exploration      Coalition, a mining-advocacy group. ``We were in the midst of      a very long, very serious, congressionally mandated process      to produce an environmental-impact statement on the mine      proposed for the park. We were strictly following the rules      as spelled out by the National Environmental Protection Act.      When suddenly, with the appearance of the U.N., what had been      an ordinary process became a political debate. And it was      apparent that these people had made up their minds before      they even got there.''       During their visit to the proposed site for New World Mine,      north of Cooke City, Mont., the four visitors had the      opportunity to interact with many of the more common local      species including environmentalists, park-service      representatives and mining-industry honchos. In fact, each      member of the visiting U.N. team traveled in an overland      vehicle (read Jeep) with their own locally supplied good-guy      environmentalist and evil mine representative. This allowed      for a continuing dialogue to be maintained wherein each side      could bark loudly at the other.       The visitors also took time out from their research to      discuss the future of the park with the many reporters who      had gathered from around the globe. Adul Wichiencharoen of      Thailand, who heads the World Heritage Committee, went so far      as to tell a reporter from Montana's Billings Gazette that      the park might be improved by the addition of several million      additional acres of land. ``Certainly the forest areas around      Yellowstone belong to the same ecosystem,'' he said. ``All of      these lands must have protection so their integrity is not      threatened.''       The end result was that the visitors returned to the World      Heritage Centre, presented their findings in Berlin that      November and the world body voted to place Yellowstone on its      lists of endangered sites. The resulting international bad      press effectively derailed the permit process and in late      August the mine owners agreed to a land swap with the U.S.      government, ridding them of their parcel of $65 million worth      of property in a location yet to be determined.       Where was Yogi Bear when he was needed? It isn't certain.      But the circus of events that took place in the mountains was      enough to send House Resources Committee Chairman Don Young      of Alaska to urge passage of the American Land Sovereignty      Protection Act of 1996 faster than you could say Boutros      Boutros-Ghali.       Young's proposal simply provided that Congress be allowed      to assert its authority over what American landmarks make the      World Heritage List. The World Heritage List is a product of      the UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World      Cultural and National Heritage, a treaty taking precedence at      law over the U.S. Constitution. Since it was adopted in 1972      (the United States was its initiator and first signatory),      the convention has been used to project the authority of a      U.N. agency over an ever-growing list of officially      designated cultural and natural sites. Commemorative photos      are taken. Plaques are installed at qualifying locations.      National sovereignty is eroded.       At present 496 cultural and natural sites throughout the      world are included on the list. They cover a diverse      compendium, including such buildings as Independence Hall,      the Statue of Liberty and the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and such      areas of regional and national interest as the Florida      Everglades and Mount Everest.       ``Land designations under the World Heritage and Biosphere      Reserve programs have been created with virtually no      congressional over-sight and no congressional hearings. The      public and local governments are rarely consulted,'' says      Young.       Instead, in the case of the World Heritage List, sites      generally are recommended for this internationalization by      the National Park Service. Twenty such sites are within the      confines of the U.S. borders; two additional sites,      Yellowstone and the Everglades, are on the list of endangered      heritage sites. Hundreds of additional sites around the globe      are pending inclusion on the list. If neither the first      McDonald's nor Yankee Stadium has yet to be included, it      could be an oversight.       Certainly the UNESCO folks are looking to improve their      holdings. ``An analysis of the World Heritage List has shown      that the industrialized world, religious Christian movements,      historical cities, historical periods and `elitist'      architecture are over-represented,'' according to World      Heritage Centre documents. Well, so much for getting      McDonald's on the list.       Now the World Heritage Centre is willing to admit that for      the moment it is a dog that barks but has no bite. It can't      yet force the United States to do anything about its national      parks or turn over the Statue of Liberty. But these people      are nothing if not ambitious. Although UNESCO admits that it      has no enforcement teeth (which begs the question of why      there should be such a list in the first place), the Clinton      administration first strongly asserted its desire that      Yellowstone be put on the endangered list and then opposed      passage of Young's bill, which would have taken nomination of      sites to the World Heritage List out from under the      relatively opaque operations of the Interior Department and      placed them in the hands of Congress.       ``If Congress wishes to micromanage these international      programs, it could assume that responsibility,'' claimed Rep.      George Miller of California, the senior Democratic member of      the House Resources Committee. ``However, it is very ironic      that this Congress is willing to spend its waning days fixing      programs that are not broken. . . .''       Critics slap their heads, roll their eyes and wonder if a      treaty really has ceded American sovereignty over the Statue      of Liberty and Independence Hall. They note with suspicion      the administration's loathing of the proposed Young bill,      going so far as to promise a presidential veto had it passed.      They ask why we have Clinton protecting a list that      supposedly doesn't matter--from a bill that supposedly      doesn't matter.       Some who testified in favor of the bill argue strongly that      congressional oversight is constitutional necessity. ``If      these international programs are seen as harmless because      they are merely symbolic, Congress is entitled to think      competing concerns also deserve `symbolic' recognition,''      testified Jeremy A. Rabkin, an expert in constitutional law      from Cornell University. ``[The bill] seems to me a modest      but useful statement that global enthusiasms should not be      allowed to run roughshod over our traditional constitutional      principles.''       But if the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act of 1996      didn't stand a chance this time around, and the bill, while      it received a majority of votes, did not receive the two-     thirds vote necessary for it to pass under the rules of      suspension, it still is not a fight that's finished. Young      has vowed to keep the pressure on when the 105th Congress      convenes.       ``While I'm pleased that a strong majority of the House      supported this legislation, I'm amazed that a single member      of Congress would oppose having congressional oversight of      international land designations within the borders of the      United States,'' Young says. Clinton administration claims of      U.N. authority over Yellowstone and the Statue of Liberty are      meanwhile continuing to give conservatives a bad case of      dyspepsia.                          ____________________
