  We should not forget, just as Government regulatory agencies swelled in number and size since President Roosevelt and President Johnson set America on a path to big Government and Government control of the economy, the Federal courts have also increased in size. The size of the Federal judiciary is an indicator, in the view of many people, including myself, of the degree of unnecessary Federal intervention in State and local affairs.  To some degree, I must admit, this is our fault. Whenever we in the Congress try to create a Federal solution to a State and local problem, we give the Federal judiciary more work to do. So we have to, of course, shoulder some blame for this, and it would not take a lot of research that every Senator, including this one, has done some things, promoted some legislation to increase the workloads of the Federal judiciary.  Is that right? No, it is not right. It is a fact. We have an opportunity now to review some of this. We have a bill before the Senate that extends temporary judgeships that were created 5 years ago for another short period of time, to get us over a hurdle.  We are going do that, obviously, but it calls for the consideration of how we do this, how often we do it, and whether we do it in too willy-nilly of a fashion.  Like most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, I do not necessarily support Federal solutions to local problems. With the Republican victory last November, I am confident that some common sense will be restored to the way that we do business up here in Washington.  Mr. President, all of what I have described is expensive. When we ask for more Government, more committees, more employees on the Hill, more bureaucrats downtown, and even more judges, it is all very expensive. So it is time we in Congress step up to the plate on the issue of the Federal judiciary and its size and we make some tough budgetary choices.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1             When It Comes to Judges, Many Say Less Is More                          (By Frank J. Murray)       The U.S. Senate may be about to abolish an appeals court      judgeship because there's not enough work to justify the job.       This has happened only once before, in 1868, when Congress      cut the U.S. Supreme Court from 10 justices to nine.       But the mood to cut judgeships is growing.       At issue is whether to cut the 12-judge U.S. Court of      Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the nation's second most      important court. Three of the nine current Supreme Court      justices were elevated from that court.       Yesterday, Judge Randall R. Rader of the Federal Circuit      told The Washington Times that 12-judge appeals court also      could be better off if its current vacant slot were      abolished.       ``I think circuit courts work better in smaller numbers. I      think that the Federal Circuit would work as well with 11      [judges], perhaps more efficiently,'' Judge Rader said.       In the Eastern District of Louisiana, Chief Judge Morey L.      Sear is asking the Senate not to fill two vacancies on the      U.S. District Court bench.       And Judge Laurence H. Silberman of the D.C. Circuit      advocates cutting one judge from that court.       Sen. Charles E. Grassley, Iowa Republican and chairman of      the Senate Judiciary oversight subcommittee, says he has      found support for reducing the number of judges on the D.C.      Circuit and elsewhere during soundings of sentiment among      appeals judges nationwide.       Chief Circuit Judge Harry T. Edwards, who opposes the      reduction, acknowledges that Judge Silberman speaks for a      significant faction of the court, although its 11 judges have      taken no vote.       Chief Judge Edwards says any decision not to leave the      question to the U.S. Judicial Conference could suggest ``some      agenda that has nothing to do with the quality of justice.''       In opening a committee hearing last week, Mr. Grassley said      his choices fall between filling the vacancy and cutting the      bench by as many as three positions.       Each circuit judgeship costs about $800,000 a year,      including salaries for a support staff of five. Such      judgeships must be eliminated when vacant because the      Constitution guarantees incumbent judges the jobs and their      salary levels for life.       ``We think the [D.C. Circuit] seat should be filled,'' says      White House spokeswoman      Ginny Terzano. ``It's not a political issue. It's a question of whether      this seat should exist or not, and the administration thinks      it should.''       In separate interviews, Judges Edwards and Silberman says      they respect each other's opinions on an issue laden with      political overtones.       ``If the question to me is, are we better off with 12      judges--do we serve the public better and do our jobs      better?--my answer is yes,'' Judge Edwards says. But he      concedes he can't effectively challenge those who rely on a      formula allotting the circuit just 9\1/2\ judges because of      declining workload.       ``I can't say there's any magic number and produce that      number to prove the point,'' Chief Judge Edwards says. ``I      admitted it is a difficult assessment in those terms.''      Although the number of cases accepted for review fell over a      10-year period, the backlog of 2,000 is up 70 percent.       ``I do think the 12 judges is excessive and therefore a      diversion of judicial resources,'' Judge Silberman told the      Judiciary Committee. He says 11 is the right number and nine      is too few.       The resolution of the dispute could determine whether Mr.      Clinton eventually undoes what Ronald Reagan wrought. The      D.C. Circuit has five Reagan nominees, two Bush appointees,      two Clinton nominees and two Carter appointees--including      Chief Judge Edwards. Judge Silberman was appointed by      President Reagan.       ``I am in favor of the abolition of the 12th judgeship no      matter who is president or who controls the Senate. We simply      do not need a 12th judgeship, and there is a cost in the      quality of our decisionmaking,'' Judge Silberman says. He      says he expressed this view privately months before Mr.      Garland's nomination and wrote a Sept. 26 letter spelling out      his position at Mr. Grassley's invitation.       ``The fact that I am in some measure of disagreement with      the chief judge on this issue has not affected my enormous      respect and affection for him,'' Judge Silberman says. Says      Chief Judge Edwards: ``Everyone else who's testified has      supported the 12th judge. I don't care to say anything on      that. Our relationship is good. I'll leave it that way.''                               Exhibit 2                                             U.S. Court of Appeals                                        For the Sixth Circuit,                                      Cincinnati, OH, May 5, 1994.     Re temporary judgeship in Western District of Michigan.     David L. Cook,     Chief, Statistics Division Administrative Office of the U.S.          Courts, Federal Judiciary Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Cook: At a meeting of the Sixth Circuit Judicial      Council held on May 4, 1994, the Council approved the request      of the Western District of Michigan that no action be taken      to extend the temporary judgeship for the Western District of      Michigan.           Sincerely,                                                 James A. Wiggins,                                                Circuit Executive.
