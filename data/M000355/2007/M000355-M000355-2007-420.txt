 President, we probably shouldn't prolong this any further, because this is keeping us from handling amendments on this bill, which we desperately need to do, but we haven't had a major immigration reform bill in 21 years. So far on this bill we have had nine rollcall votes. By any objective standard that is not nearly enough. Let us proceed to work on the bill, and, hopefully, we can get somewhere during the course of the week.  I yield the floor.
