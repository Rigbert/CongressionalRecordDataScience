President, I rise today in honor and acknowledgment of African American History Month, a great tradition honoring and celebrating African Americans. This 74 year tradition, proposed by Dr. Carter G. Woodson, a son of former slaves, seeks to broaden our vision of the world, the legacy of African Americans in our nation's history, and their role in our nation's future.  When Dr. Woodson, the Father of Black History, was earning his bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Chicago, this country had only the slightest respect for people of color. Dr. Wilson's devotion to ensuring that Blacks would escape ``the awful fate of becoming a negligible factor in world thought'' was ridiculed and attacked. However, in the end he prevailed and pioneered the celebration of Negro History Week, now Black History Month. The theme for this year's celebration is ``Heritage and Horizons: The African American Legacy and the Challenge of the 21st Century.''  The African American legacy in my home state of Illinois is great. Illinois is the birthplace of prominent African American writers such as Ellis Cose, Charles Johnson and Lorraine Hansberry. Illinois' native sons, James Cleveland and Miles Davis, are two of the world's greatest musical composers who transcend racial lines. And beloved daughter of Illinois, Katherine Dunham, dancer and choreographer, continues to bring the tradition of great African dance to a wide audience.  In addition to a rich history in the arts, African American Illinoisans also have played a significant role in state, local and federal government. Consider, for example, John Jones, the first African American elected to any public office in Cook County; Floy Clements, the first woman elected to the Illinois legislature; Harold Washington, former mayor of Chicago; and Carol Moseley-Braun, the first African American woman elected to the United States Senate. These African Americans, like those who have come before them, continue to shape our nation's history and inspire new generations of African Americans.  Today's African Americans have made great strides and overcome a variety of color barriers. The unemployment rate for African Americans has fallen from 14.2% in 1992 to 8.3% in 1999, the lowest annual level on record. The real wages of African Americans have risen rapidly, over 5% in the past two years. Moreover, while the African American child poverty rate is still too high, it fell to 36.7% in 1998, the lowest level on record. However, as these data suggest, there is still more work to be done.  The rate of firearm-related injuries is still unacceptably high. Racial profiling on our highways and in our airports and housing developments continues to be a serious problem. The rising cost of tuition continues to place ethnic minorities at an academic and economic disadvantage. The poor conditions and quality of too many of our schools keep children from low socioeconomic households from breeching the digital divide. Racial disparities in mental health and health care are pervasive in our society. And in the Chicago metropolitan area, after a two year decline, the number of reported AIDS cases has jumped 24 percent. Although African Americans represent 13% of the US population, they account for more than half of new HIV infections.  AIDS knows no boundaries. This month, as we examine and reflect on the legacy and challenges of African Americans, we must not forget our brothers and sisters in Africa. Approximately 23.3 million adults and children are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, which has about 10% of the world's population but nearly 70% of the world's infected people. I recently witnessed the devastation of this deadly virus first hand--isolation, prejudice, and a multitude of new orphans. This month, as we celebrate the heritage and horizons of African Americans, we must ask ourselves, what is on the horizon for our African brothers and sisters?  These are just some of the problems which require our attention if we are to fulfill the dreams of visionaries like Dr. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other African Americans who continue to serve as role models for all Americans. Dr. Woodson believed in looking back in order to look forward. In this special month that seeks to learn from the past and shape our future, we need to examine how to build on the legacy of hope left to us from those who have gone before us.  As we move forward into this new millennium, let us extend Dr. Woodson's mission past the month of February and make it part of the fabric of our lives. Let us look to our forefathers, no matter what their race, creed, or color, and unite in our diversity to build one America and to build a world where every child has hope for the future.                          ____________________
