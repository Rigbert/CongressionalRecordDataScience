(B) Procedures.--       (i) Written direct statements.--The written direct      statements of the proceeding parties shall be filed by a date      specified by the Electronic Payment System Judges, which may      be not earlier than 4 months, and not later than 5 months,      after the end of the voluntary negotiation period under      paragraph (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the      Electronic Payment System Judges may allow a proceeding party      to file an amended written direct statement based on new      information received during the discovery process, not later      than 15 days after the end of the discovery period specified      in clause (ii).       (ii) Discovery schedule.--Following the submission to the      Electronic Payment System Judges of written direct statements      by the proceeding parties, the Electronic Payment System      Judges shall meet with the proceeding parties to set a      schedule for conducting and completing discovery. Such      schedule shall be determined by the Electronic Payment System      Judges. Discovery in such proceedings shall be permitted for      a period of not longer than 60 days, except for discovery      ordered by the Electronic Payment System Judges in connection      with the resolution of motions, orders, and disputes pending      at the end of such period.       (iii) Initial disclosures.--       (I) In general.--In a proceeding under this Act to      determine fees and terms for access to a covered electronic      payment system, certain persons shall make initial      disclosures not later than 30 days after the date of      commencement of the proceeding, in accordance with this      clause.       (II) Issuers, acquirers, and owners.--Any person who is 1      of the 10 largest issuers for a covered electronic payment      system in terms of number of cards issued, any person who is      1 of the 10 largest acquirers for a covered electronic      payment system based on dollar amount of transactions made by      merchants they serve, and any person who owns or controls the      relevant covered electronic payment system and establishes      the terms and conditions through which issuers and acquirers      participate in the covered electronic payment system, shall      produce to the Electronic Payment System Judges and to both      proceedings parties--       (aa) an itemized list of the costs necessary to operate the      covered electronic payment system that were incurred by the      person during the most recent full calendar year before the      initiation of the proceeding; and       (bb) any access agreement between that person and 1 or more      merchants with regard to that covered electronic payment      system.       (III) Merchants.--Any person who is 1 of the 10 largest      merchants using the relevant covered electronic payment      system, determined based on dollar amount of transactions      made with the covered electronic payment system, shall      produce to the Electronic Payment System Judges and to both      proceeding parties--       (aa) an itemized list of the costs necessary to access the      electronic payment system during the most recent full      calendar year prior to the initiation of the proceeding; and       (bb) any access agreement between that person and 1 or more      providers with regard to that covered electronic payment      system.       (IV) Disagreement.--Any disagreement regarding whether a      person is required to make an initial disclosure under this      clause, or the contents of such a disclosure, shall be      resolved by the Electronic Payment System Judges.       (iv) Depositions.--       (I) In general.--In a proceeding under this Act to      determine fees and terms for access to a covered electronic      payment system, each proceeding party shall be permitted to      take depositions of every witness identified by the other      proceeding party. Except as provided in subclause (III), each      proceeding party also shall be permitted to take 5 additional      depositions in the entire proceeding.       (II) Organizational entities.--A deposition notice or      subpoena may name as the deponent a person who is an      individual or a person who is not an individual. Such      deposition notice or subpoena shall describe with reasonable      particularity the matters on which examination is requested.      If the deposition notice or subpoena names a person who is      not an individual, the deponent person so named shall      designate 1 or more officers, directors, or managing agents,      or other individual persons who consent to testify on behalf      of the deponent person, and may set forth, for each      individual person designated, the matters on which the      individual person will testify. A subpoena shall advise a      nonparty deponent person of the duty of the deponent person      to make such a designation. An individual person designated      under this subclause shall testify as to matters known or      reasonably available to the deponent person.       (III) Additional depositions.--The Electronic Payment      System Judges may increase the permitted number of      depositions for good cause in exceptional circumstances, and      shall resolve any disputes among persons within either      proceeding party regarding the allocation of the depositions      permitted under this clause.       (v) Written discovery.--In a proceeding under this Act to      determine fees and terms for access to a covered electronic      payment system, each proceeding party shall be permitted to      serve written discovery requests on 10 persons. These written      discovery requests may include requests for production or      inspection, a total of no more than 10 requests for admission      in the entire proceeding, and a total of no more than 25      interrogatories in the entire proceeding. The Electronic      Payment System Judges may increase the permitted number of      requests for admission or interrogatories for good cause in      exceptional circumstances, and shall resolve any disputes      among persons within either proceeding party regarding the      allocation of the requests for admission or interrogatories      permitted under this clause.       (vi) Subpoenas.--Upon the request of a party to a      proceeding to determine fees and terms for access to a      covered electronic payment system, the Electronic Payment      System Judges may issue a subpoena commanding a person to      appear and give testimony, or to produce and permit      inspection of documents or tangible things, if the resolution      of the proceeding by the Electronic Payment System Judges may      be substantially impaired by the absence of such testimony or      production of documents or tangible things. A subpoena under      this clause shall specify with reasonable particularity the      materials to be produced or the scope and nature of the      required testimony. Nothing in this clause shall preclude the      Electronic Payment System Judges from requesting the      production by a person of information or materials relevant      to the resolution by the Electronic Payment System Judges of      a material issue of fact.       (vii) Objections to discovery requests.--       (I) In general.--Any objection to a request or subpoena      under clause (v) or (vi) shall be resolved by a motion or      request to compel production made to the Electronic Payment      System Judges in accordance with regulations adopted by the      Electronic Payment System Judges. Each motion or request to      compel discovery shall be determined by the Electronic      Payment System Judges, or by an Electronic Payment System      Judge when permitted under subsection (a)(2). Upon such      motion or request to compel discovery, the Electronic Payment      System Judges may order discovery under regulations      established under this paragraph.       (II) Considerations.--In determining whether discovery will      be granted under this clause, the Electronic Payment System      Judges may consider--       (aa) whether the burden or expense of producing the      requested information or materials outweighs the likely      benefit, taking into account the needs and resources of the      proceeding parties, the importance of the issues at stake,      and the probative value of the requested information or      materials in resolving such issues;       (bb) whether the requested information or materials would      be unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable      from another source that is more convenient, less burdensome,      or less expensive; and       (cc) whether the proceeding party seeking discovery has had      ample opportunity by discovery in the proceeding or by other      means to obtain the information sought.       (viii) Voluntarily negotiated access agreements.--In      proceedings to determine fees and terms for access to a      covered electronic payment system, the Electronic Payment      System Judges shall make available to the proceeding parties      all documents filed under section 3(c)(1).       (ix) Settlement conference.--The Electronic Payment System      Judges shall order a settlement conference between the      proceeding parties to facilitate the presentation of offers      of settlement between the parties. The settlement conference      shall be held during the 21-day period beginning on the date      on which the discovery period ends and shall take place      outside the presence of the Electronic Payment System Judges.       (x) Direct and rebuttal hearings.--At the conclusion of the      21-day period described in clause (ix), the Electronic      Payment System Judges shall determine if further proceedings      under this Act are necessary. If the Electronic Payment      System Judges determine further proceedings under this Act      are necessary, the Electronic Payment System Judges shall      schedule a direct hearing of not more than 30 court days and      a rebuttal hearing of not more than 20 court days during      which both proceeding parties will be allowed to offer      witness testimony and documents.       (xi) Sponsoring witnesses.--No evidence, including      exhibits, may be submitted in the written direct statement or      written rebuttal statement of a proceeding party without a      sponsoring witness, except for--       (I) requests for admission that have been admitted by the      receiving proceeding party;       (II) evidence of which the Electronic Payment System Judges      have taken official notice;       (III) incorporation by reference of past records; or       (IV) good cause shown.       (xii) Hearsay.--Hearsay may be admitted in proceedings      under this Act to the extent determined relevant and reliable      by the Electronic Payment System Judges.       (xiii) Applicability of the federal rules of evidence.--To      the extent not inconsistent with this subparagraph, the      Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply to proceedings under      this Act.       (5) Penalties for failure to comply with a discovery      request.--       (A) Failure to comply.--A person has failed to comply with      a discovery request if the person, or an employee or agent of      the person, fails, without substantial justification, to--       (i) make initial disclosures required under paragraph      (4)(B)(iii);       (ii) be sworn or answer a question as a deponent after      being directed to do so by the Electronic Payment System      Judges under clause (iv) or (vi) of paragraph (4)(B);       (iii) answer an interrogatory submitted under paragraph      (4)(B)(v);       (iv) produce nonprivileged documents requested under clause      (v) or (vi) of paragraph (4)(B); or       (v) admit the genuineness of any document or the truth of      any matter as requested under paragraph (4)(B)(v), and the      person requesting the admissions thereafter proves the      genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter.       (B) False or misleading responses.--For purposes of this      Act, any disclosure, answer, or response that is false or      substantially misleading, evasive, or incomplete shall be      deemed a failure to comply with a discovery request.       (C) Negative inference in current proceeding.--If any      person fails to comply with a discovery request, the      Electronic Payment System Judges may issue an order that the      matters regarding which the order was made or any other      designated facts shall be taken to be established for the      purposes of the current proceeding in accordance with the      claim of the proceeding party seeking discovery and obtaining      the order.       (D) Civil penalty.--       (i) Generally.--Any person who fails to comply with a      discovery request under this Act shall be subject to a civil      penalty, which shall be assessed by the Electronic Payment      System Judges, of not more than $25,000 for each violation.      Each day of violation shall constitute a separate violation.       (ii) Notice and hearings.--No civil penalty may be assessed      under this subparagraph except under an order of the      Electronic Payment System Judges and unless the person      accused of the violation was given prior notice and      opportunity to request and participate in a hearing before      the Electronic Payment System Judges with respect to the      violation.       (iii) Determining amount.--In determining the amount of any      penalty assessed under this subparagraph, the Electronic      Payment System Judges shall take into account the nature,      circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation or      violations and, with respect to the violator, ability to pay,      any prior history of such violations, the degree of      culpability, economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting      from the violation, and such other matters as justice may      require.       (iv) Review.--Any person who requested a hearing with      respect to a civil penalty under this subparagraph and who is      aggrieved by an order assessing the civil penalty may file a      petition for judicial review of such order with the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.      Such a petition may be filed not later than 30 days after the      date on which the order making such assessment was issued.      The United States Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment      affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part,      an order of the Electronic Payment System Judges under this      subparagraph, or the court may remand the proceeding to the      Electronic Payment System Judges for such further action as      the court may direct. The Attorney General shall represent      the Electronic Payment System Judges before the court.       (v) Enforcement.--If any person fails to pay an assessment      of a civil penalty after the civil penalty has become a final      and unappealable order or after the appropriate court has      entered final judgment, the Electronic Payment System Judges      shall request the Attorney General to institute a civil      action in an appropriate district court of the United States      to collect the penalty, and such court shall have      jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. In hearing      such action, the court shall have authority to review the      violation and the assessment of the civil penalty on the      record.       (c) Determination of Electronic Payment System Judges.--       (1) Timing.--The Electronic Payment System Judges shall      issue a determination in a proceeding not later than the      earlier of--       (A) 11 months after the end of the 21-day settlement      conference period under subsection (b)(4)(B)(ix); or       (B) 15 days before the date on which the fees and terms in      effect for the relevant covered electronic payment system      expire.       (2) Determination.--       (A) Filing of final offer.--Before the commencement of a      direct hearing in a proceeding under subsection (b)(4)(B)(x),      each proceeding party shall file with the Electronic Payment      System Judges and with the other proceeding party a final      offer of fees and terms for access to the covered electronic      payment system. A proceeding party may not amend a final      offer submitted under this subparagraph, except with the      express consent of the Electronic Payment System Judges and      the other proceeding party.       (B) Selection between final offers.--After the conclusion      of the direct hearing and rebuttal hearing, the Electronic      Payment System Judges shall make their determination by      selecting 1 of the 2 final offers filed by the proceeding      parties. The Electronic Payment System Judges shall make      their selection in accordance with the standards described in      section 3(c)(3)(C).       (C) Voting and dissenting opinions.--A final determination      of the Electronic Payment System Judges in a proceeding under      this Act shall be made by majority vote. An Electronic      Payment System Judge dissenting from the majority on any      determination under this Act may issue a dissenting opinion,      which shall be included with the determination.       (3) Rehearings.--       (A) In general.--The Electronic Payment System Judges may,      in exceptional cases, upon motion of a proceeding party,      order a rehearing, after the determination in the proceeding      is issued under paragraph (2), on such matters as the      Electronic Payment System Judges determine to be appropriate.       (B) Timing for filing motion.--Any motion for a rehearing      under subparagraph (A) shall be filed not later than 15 days      after the date on which the Electronic Payment System Judges      deliver to the parties in the proceeding their initial      determination concerning fees and terms.       (C) Participation by opposing party not required.--In any      case in which a rehearing is ordered under this paragraph,      any opposing proceeding party shall not be required to      participate in the rehearing, except that nonparticipation      may give rise to the limitations with respect to judicial      review provided for in subsection (d)(1).       (D) No negative inference.--The Electronic Payment System      Judges may not draw a negative inference from lack of      participation in a rehearing.       (E) Continuity of fees and terms.--       (i) In general.--If the decision of the Electronic Payment      System Judges on any motion for a rehearing is not rendered      before the expiration of the fees and terms in effect for the      relevant covered electronic payment system, in the case of a      proceeding to determine successor fees and terms for fees and      terms that expire on a specified date, the initial      determination of the Electronic Payment System Judges that is      the subject of the rehearing motion shall be effective as of      the day following the date on which the fees and terms that      were previously in effect expire.       (ii) Fee payments.--The pendency of a motion for a      rehearing under this paragraph shall not relieve a person      obligated to make fee payments for access to a covered      electronic payment system who would be affected by the      determination on that motion from paying the fees required      and complying with the terms under the relevant      determination.       (iii) Overpayments and underpayments.--Notwithstanding      clause (ii), if fees described in clause (ii) are paid--       (I) the recipient of such fees shall, not later than 60      days after the date on which the motion for rehearing is      resolved or, if the motion is granted, 60 days after the date      on which the rehearing is concluded, return any excess fees      described in clause (ii), to the extent necessary to comply      with the final determination by the Electronic Payment System      Judges of fees and terms for access to the covered electronic      payment system; and       (II) a person obligated to make fee payments shall, not      later than 60 days after the date on which the motion for      rehearing is resolved or, if the motion is granted, 60 days      after the date on which the rehearing is concluded, pay the      recipient the amount of any underpayment of fees described in      clause (ii), to the extent necessary to comply with the final      determination by the Electronic Payment System Judges of fees      and terms for access to the covered electronic payment      system.       (4) Contents of determination.--A determination of the      Electronic Payment System Judges shall establish the fees and      terms for access to the relevant covered electronic payment      system, shall be supported by the written record, and shall      set forth the findings of fact relied on by the Electronic      Payment System Judges. The Electronic Payment System Judges      shall make publicly available in their entirety all      determinations issued under this paragraph.       (5) Continuing jurisdiction.--The Electronic Payment System      Judges may, with the approval of the Attorney General and the      Chairman, issue an amendment to a written determination to      correct any technical or clerical errors in the determination      in response to unforeseen circumstances that would frustrate      the proper implementation of such determination. Such      amendment shall be set forth in a written addendum to the      determination that shall be distributed to the proceeding      parties and shall be published in the Federal Register.       (6) Protective order.--The Electronic Payment System Judges      may issue such orders as may be appropriate to protect      confidential information, including orders excluding      confidential information from the record of the determination      that is published or made available to the public, except      that any fees and terms of an access agreement, including      voluntarily negotiated access agreements filed under section      3(c)(1), may not be excluded from publication.       (7) Publication of determination.--Not later than 60 days      after the date on which the Electronic Payment System Judges      issue a determination under this subsection, the Attorney      General and the Chairman shall cause the determination, and      any corrections thereto, to be published in the Federal      Register. The Electronic Payment System Judges also shall      publicize the determination and any corrections in such other      manner as the Attorney General and the Chairman consider      appropriate, including publication on the Internet. The      Electronic Payment System Judges also shall make the      determination, corrections, and the accompanying record      available for public inspection and copying.       (8) Late payment.--A determination of Electronic Payment      System Judges--       (A) may include terms with respect to late payment; and       (B) may not include any provision in such terms described      in subparagraph (A) that prevents a provider of a covered      electronic payment system from asserting other rights or      remedies provided under this Act.       (d) Judicial Review.--       (1) Appeal.--Any determination of the Electronic Payment      System Judges under subsection (c) may, not later than 30      days after the date of publication of the determination in      the Federal Register, be appealed, to the United States Court      of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by any      aggrieved member of a proceeding party under this Act who      would be bound by the determination. Any proceeding party      that did not participate in a rehearing may not raise any      issue that was the subject of that rehearing at any stage of      judicial review of the hearing determination. If no appeal is      brought within the 30-day period under this paragraph, the      determination of the Electronic Payment System Judges shall      be final, and shall take effect as described in paragraph      (2).       (2) Effect of fees and terms.--       (A) Fee payments.--The pendency of an appeal under this      subsection shall not relieve a person obligated to make fee      payments for access to a covered electronic payment system      who would be affected by the determination on appeal from      paying the fees required and complying with the terms under      the relevant determination or regulations.       (B) Overpayments and underpayments.--Notwithstanding      subparagraph (A), if fees described in subparagraph (A) are      paid--       (i) the recipient of such fees shall, not later than 60      days after the date on which the appeal is resolved return      any excess fees described in subparagraph (A) (and interest      thereon, if ordered under paragraph (3)), to the extent      necessary to comply with the final determination of fees and      terms on appeal; and       (ii) a person obligated to make fee payments shall, not      later than 60 days after the date on which the appeal is      resolved, pay the recipient the amount of any underpayment of      fees described in subparagraph (A) (and interest thereon, if      ordered under paragraph (3)), to the extent necessary to      comply with the final determination of fees and terms on      appeal.       (3) Jurisdiction of court.--If the United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, under section      706 of title 5, United States Code, modifies or vacates a      determination of the Electronic Payment System Judges, the      court may enter its own determination with respect to the      amount or distribution of fees and costs, and order the      repayment of any excess fees, the payment of any underpaid      fees, and the payment of interest pertaining respectively      thereto, in accordance with its final judgment. The court      also may vacate the determination of the Electronic Payment      System Judges and remand the case to the Electronic Payment      System Judges for further proceedings.       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized      to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out      this Act.     SEC. 6. INSTITUTION OF PROCEEDINGS BEFORE ELECTRONIC PAYMENT                    SYSTEM JUDGES.       (a) Initial Proceedings.--       (1) Timing.--Proceedings under this Act shall be commenced      as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of this      Act to establish fees and terms for access to covered      electronic payment systems under section 3(c), which shall be      effective during the period beginning on January 1, 2011, and      ending on December 31, 2012. The Electronic Payment System      Judges shall cause notice of commencement of such proceedings      to be published in the Federal Register.       (2) Procedures specific to the initial proceedings.--       (A) Discovery period.--Notwithstanding section      5(b)(4)(B)(ii), discovery in the initial proceedings      described in paragraph (1) shall be permitted for a period of      90 days, except for discovery ordered by the Electronic      Payment System Judges in connection with the resolution of      motions, orders, and disputes pending at the end of such      period.       (B) Consideration of changes in fees and terms between date      of enactment and initial determination.--In establishing the      fees and terms under section 3(c) for access to covered      electronic payment systems, to be effective during the period      beginning on January 1, 2011, and ending on December 31,      2012, the Electronic Payment System Judges shall consider      changes in fees and terms made by a covered electronic      payments system between the date of enactment of this Act and      such initial determination. Based upon such consideration,      the Electronic Payment System Judges may adjust the fees      established for the period beginning on January 1, 2011, and      ending on December 31, 2012, to reflect the economic impact      such changes had on the parties.       (b) Subsequent Proceedings.--After completion of the      proceedings required under subsection (a), proceedings under      section 3(c) to establish fees and terms for access to      covered electronic payment systems shall be commenced in      2011, and every 3 years thereafter.     SEC. 7. GENERAL RULE FOR VOLUNTARILY NEGOTIATED ACCESS                    AGREEMENTS.       (a) In General.--Any fees or terms described in subsection      (b) shall remain in effect for such period of time as would      otherwise apply to fees and terms established under this Act,      except that the Electronic Payment System Judges shall adjust      any such fees to reflect inflation during any additional      period the fees remain in effect beyond that contemplated in      the voluntarily negotiated access agreement.       (b) Fees and Terms.--The fees or terms described in this      subsection are fees or terms for access to a covered      electronic payment system under this Act that--       (1) are agreed upon as part of a voluntarily negotiated      access agreement for a period shorter than would otherwise      apply under a determination under this Act; and       (2) are adopted by the Electronic Payment System Judges as      part of a determination under this Act.                                 ______                                       By
