 President, I stand before you today in honor of someone who has made a substantial contribution to the people of Caldwell County, KY, for his work in the field of journalism: Mr. Chip Hutcheson, publisher of Caldwell County's local periodical, the Princeton Times Leader. Mr. Hutcheson was recently inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in Lexington, KY, along with five other esteemed broadcasting and journalism colleagues from all over the Commonwealth.  The relationship between Chip Hutcheson and the paper that would become the Princeton Times Leader began when Chip was just 10 months old. His parents, the late John and Betsy Hutcheson, purchased the then-Princeton Leader and moved to Princeton, KY, just after the birth of their son, Chip. John and Betsy shared a love for their chosen profession of journalism, a love of the trade that Chip, too, would inherit at a young age.  Looking back, Chip recalls the paper being a big part of his adolescent life. He remembers writing sports news all throughout his teenage years. Chip left Princeton after high school to attend the University of Kentucky, just like his father before him. He enlisted in the U.S. Army after graduating from the college and served 4 months of active duty in Vietnam.  Upon his return from the service, he immediately re-entered the field he had been passionately involved with for so long. He understood that journalism was his calling, and he wanted to make a career out of bringing the news to the people of Caldwell County, just as his beloved mother and father had. Chip remembered a piece of advice his father gave him about the media industry: ``He said, This is a good business, but remember this--you will never be caught up; there will always be one more advertiser you can see, one more story you can write.'''  After watching his parents run a newspaper throughout his childhood, Chip was no doubt aware of the difficulties of producing a new edition day in and day out, but he was okay with it. He had a deep desire to be in the thick of reporting. He wanted to follow leads, piece together stories, record monumental events, and most importantly, inform the citizens of Princeton of the goings on of the world around them.  Chip became publisher of the Princeton Leader in 1976, assumed the role of publisher of the Times Leader in 1992, and has been doing an outstanding job ever since. Chip Hutcheson is a testament to the success one can achieve when one enters a field of work one has a true passion for.  It is with the most sincere gratitude that I congratulate Mr. Chip Hutcheson on his induction to the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame and thank him for the heartfelt devotion he has shown the people of Princeton, Caldwell County, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky throughout the years. And I would like to ask my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in commemorating Mr. Chip Hutcheson for his many accomplishments in the field of journalism.  There was recently an article published in the Princeton Times Leader which made note of Chip Hutcheson's induction into the 2012 Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:            [From the Princeton Times Leader, Apr. 14, 2012]                 TL Publisher Joins Hall of Fame Ranks                           (By Jared Nelson)       Times Leader Publisher Chip Hutcheson and two others with      western Kentucky connections were among a class of six      individuals inducted into the 2012 class of the Kentucky      Journalism Hall of Fame this week.       The induction ceremony followed a luncheon hosted by the      University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni Association and the      UK School of Journalism and Telecommunications in Lexington      Wednesday.       Other inductees included: D.J. Everett III, president of      Ham Broadcasting Company, which operates the WKDZ and WHVO      radio stations; Dr. Bob McGaughey, retired chairman of the      Department of Journalism and Mass Communications at Murray      State University; Albert B. ``Ben'' Chandler, Jr., longtime      publisher of the Woodford Sun; Bill Luster, retired photo-     journalist with the Louisville Courier-Journal and two-time      Pulitzer Prize winner; and Michael M. York, a former      Lexington Herald-Leader and Washington Post reporter, also a      Pulitzer Prize winner.       Duane Bonifer, president of the alumni association, noted      April as national Jazz Appreciation Month and drew parallels      between the work of great jazz musicians and great      journalists, their balance of innovation and improvisation.       ``We're going to celebrate the artistry of Chandler,      Everett, Hutcheson, Luster, McGaughey, and York,'' he said.      ``That's not a bad sextet to be jamming with on a Wednesday      afternoon in Lexington.''       Hutcheson has served as publisher of the Times Leader since      its 1992 creation, when the community's two newspapers, the      Caldwell County Times and the Princeton Leader, were      purchased by the Kentucky New Era and merged.       Hutcheson had published the Leader, taking over from his      parents, in 1976.       In his induction speech Wednesday, he recalled a life spent      in the business.       ``If anyone has ink in their veins, that would be me,'' he      said.       His parents, the late John and Betsy Hutcheson, bought the      Leader when their son was 10 months old and moved to      Princeton, a town where the only person they knew was the      paper's prior owner.       ``But that paper was a labor of love for my parents, and in      turn for me,'' he said.       The paper, he said, was a major part of his life throughout      childhood and into his teenage years, when he began writing      sports news.       He enrolled at UK, following his father's footsteps.       Faced with the prospect of being drafted into the U.S. Army      after graduating, he returned to Princeton.       He was hired as a sports editor for the Kentucky New Era,      taking his father's advice to gain experience outside the      family business.       The day before he was to be drafted, he was able to enlist      in the Army Reserve. ``That meant four months of active duty      rather than two years, so my time away from the New Era was      brief,'' he said.       He served as sports editor there from 1970 to 1976, when      his father retired from the Leader and handed the reins to      his son.       ``My father only offered one piece of advice, and I have      never forgotten it,'' he told the Lexington crowd.       ``He said `This is a good business, but remember this--you      will never be caught up; there will always be one more      advertiser you can see, one more story you can write.'       ``It was that philosophy that has guided me ever since.''       Hutcheson credited the support of his family in the years      since: his mother, who worked 60-plus hours each week at the      paper into her 70s, retiring only when the papers merged; his      wife, Karen, a nurse by profession who became a utility      employee; and children Cindy and John Mark, who spent much      time in the newspaper office during their formative years.       ``The Leader truly was a `family' business,'' he said ``I      regret that my parents are not here today for this honor my      dad died 10 years ago and my mother just last year--because      they were the ones who instilled in me this love of community      journalism.''       He also gave thanks to the employees of the Times Leader      for their support, and to the community at large for being a      ``strong newspaper town.''       The publisher quoted Lou Gehrig's famous farewell speech to      a 1939 Yankee Stadium--``Today I consider myself the luckiest      man on the face of this earth''--in closing.       ``I'm not the luckiest man,'' Hutcheson said. ``I'm the      most blessed man. I'm blessed to work with the people I work      with. I'm blessed to be in the community I live in, and I'm      blessed to have a family who thinks much more highly of me      than I deserve.''                          ____________________
