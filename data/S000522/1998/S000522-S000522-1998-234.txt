Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Commission on Security andCooperation in Europe--the Helsinki Commission--held a hearing on the latest atrocities in Kosovo. Senator Alfonse D'Amato and I co-chair the Commission and felt it critical to hold a hearing on the crisis in Kosovo. Other Commissioners--Senator Frank Lautenberg and our colleagues Representatives Steny Hoyer and Ben Cardin--joined us at the hearing. Representative Ben Gilman, Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, and Representative Eliot Engel, a longstanding Kosovo advocate, were there as well.  The Commission, as most of you know, has a mandate and an obligation to document human rights violations where they occur in Europe. This is especially the case when these violations are, in fact, atrocities and crimes against humanity. Sadly, such violations are still taking place.  The hearing focused on the atrocities and the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo today as viewed by two individuals--Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck and Senator Bob Dole--who have just returned from Kosovo and also from Belgrade, where they met with Milosevic himself. We heard what they saw firsthand in Kosovo and also what Belgrade says about what they saw. Both were excellent in their presentations, and their well-known records as public officials and as human rights advocates added to their effectiveness.  Secretary Shattuck, who heads the Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, spoke in detail about the disturbing accounts of men and boys being separated from women and small children. This is exactly what would precede massacres in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Shattuck spoke about the heavily shelled and sometimes still burning towns which they saw, ``abandoned to packs of wild dogs and heavily armed Serb police and Yugoslav army forces. Among the displaced children * * * there was evidence of the beginning of malnutrition.''  Senator Dole added that many of the children have scabies and other skin ailments and sores in their mouths. He reported that personnel from humanitarian organizations are being harassed and even attacked, noting in particular the killing of three workers for the Mother Theresa Society.  As with Bosnia, Mr. Speaker, we must go beyond mere documentation of the tragedy in Kosovo. We must witness, but we must also act. No one can see or hear what has happened in Kosovo this year without asking what can be done to stop it from continuing. Half-measures will not address the central causes of this conflict. They may, in fact, make efforts to address those causes more difficult to undertake. We all learned from the Bosnian conflict that diplomacy alone will not work. Nor will more and more humanitarian assistance, as welcomed as such help might be. Decisive outside intervention is what is required, and NATO is the most likely organization to do this. Of course, NATO intervention has its risks, and we in the Congress and the U.S. Government must assess whether those risks are worth taking. The hearing certainly helped the Commissioners and other Members present understand the situation on the ground.  ``What is urgently needed now is American leadership and a firm commitment to a genuine and just peace in Kosovo,'' said Senator Dole. ``Bush gave Milosevic the green light, and it hasn't been turned off.'' ``Yet, if we do not act before winter sets in,'' he added, ``if the Kosovars in the mountains begin to freeze to death, then Milosevic can get away with the claim that he didn't murder them. To do the right thing, we don't have much time.'' Secretary Shattuck added that ``crimes against humanity have been committed. [Thus] the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague is a critical piece of the long-term process of bringing a political solution in Kosovo.''  In conclusion, the attacks on the people of Kosovo are inhumane and brutal beyond comprehension. The intentional displacement of the civilian population, the execution of people held in detention, the destruction of food supplies, and the prevention of aid deliveries all have happened so repeatedly that they cannot be dismissed as anything short of a deliberate policy to destroy. That policy originates in Belgrade, with Slobodan Milosevic at the helm. All the complexities of the Balkans do not erase that simple fact. Both the House and the Senate are on record as believing Milosevic is a war criminal. We would hope that, if we stop Milosevic, the problems in the region could be resolved in a peaceful and democratic way. Bosnia taught us the hard lesson that delayed action results in the loss of more and more lives.  Mr. Speaker, I have not been known as someone who readily recommends a military response, but, if we do not act in this case, knowing--as we do know--that many more people will die as a result, we share some responsibility for what does happen. We become, in effect, a partner in the crime. That happened in Bosnia. NATO must act in Kosovo. NATO must act now.                          ____________________
