So we felt the case was very persuasive for the kind of organizational structure we came up with. That was recommended by the 9/11 Commission.  Having said that, I am sure it is not perfect. I am sure we are going to learn from it. That is why we have reports required back to Congress after a year's time and by the General Accounting Office Accountability Office in 2 year's time, because we want to make sure we get this right.  I think we have struck the right balance in the organizational structure we propose.
