President, I am glad that we have been able to achieve passage of a bill that will help protect children from sexual predators.  As the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is the responsibility of Chairman Hatch and myself to schedule legislation for consideration by the Committee and to draft changes, if warranted. Many bills never are scheduled for committee votes, and as the legislative session draws to a close, it becomes increasingly important that any bills brought to the Senate Floor adequately address concerns raised, to improve their chances for enactment. At this stage of the legislative process, even one senator can prevent passage of an ill-considered or controversial bill. Passage today of the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute to H.R. 3494 is due to the efforts of those members who have worked to resolve the legitimate concerns raised by the original bill we received from the House.  In the case of H.R. 3494, the Chairman and I, joined by Senator DeWine. worked hard to bring forward a bill that was both strong and sensible and that would have a chance to win enactment in the short time remaining in the legislative session.  Unlike some who may just want to score political points, we actually want to enact this bill to protect children, something that I worked hard to do as a prosecutor, when I convicted child molesters in the state of Vermont. We wanted to bring forward a bill that could pass.  The problem area is the original House bill as it reached the Committee centered on its unintended consequences for law enforcement, regulation of the Internet, and important privacy rights that have nothing to do with child pornography.  As I have said before, the whole world watches when the United States regulates the Internet, and we have a special obligation to do it right.  The goal of H.R. 3494, and of the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute, is to provide stronger protections for children from those who would prey upon them. Concerns over protecting our children have only intensified in recent years with the growing popularity of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Cyberspace gives users access to a wealth of information; it connects people from around the world. But is also creates new opportunities for sexual predators and child pornographers to ply their trade.  The challenge is to protect children from exploitation in cyberspace while ensuring that the vast democratic forum of the Internet remains an engine for the free exchange of ideas and information.  The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine version of the bill meets this challenge. While neither version is a cure-all for the scourge of child pornography, the substitute is a useful step toward limiting the ability of cyber-pornographers and predators from harming children.  The bill has come a long way since it was passed by the House last June. Significant objections were raised by civil liberties organizations and others to provisions in the original H.R. 3494, and we worked hard on a bipartisan basis to ensure that this bill would pass in the short time remaining in this Congress.  I thank the Chairman and Senator DeWine, and other members of the Committee, for working together to address the legitimate concerns about certain provisions in the House-passed bill, and to make this substitute more focused and measured. Briefly, I would like to highlight and explain some of the changes we made, and why we made them.  As passed by the House, H.R. 3494 would make it a crime, punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment, to do nothing more than ``contact'' a minor, or even just attempt to ``contact'' a minor, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. This provision, which would be extremely difficult to enforce and would invite court challenges, does not appear in the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute. In criminal law terms, the act of making contact is not very far along the spectrum of an overt criminal act. Targeting ``attempts'' to make contact would be even more like prosecuting a thought crime. It is difficult to see how such a provision would be enforced without inviting significant litigation.  Another new crime created by the House bill prohibited the transmittal of identifying information about any person under 18 for the purpose of encouraging unlawful sexual activity. In its original incarnation, this provision would have had the absurd result of prohibiting a person under the age of consent from e-mailing her own address or telephone number to her boyfriend. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute fixes this problem by making it clear that a violation must involve the transmission of someone else's identifying information. In addition, to eliminate any notice problem arising from the variations in state statutory rape laws, the Senate bill conforms the bill to the federal age of consent--16--in provisions regarding the age of the identified minor. The Senate bill also clarifies that the defendant must know that the person about whom he was transmitting identifying information was, in fact, under 16. This change was particularly important because, in the anonymous world of cyberspace, a person may have no way of knowing the age of the faceless person with whom he is communicating.  Another provision of the House bill, which makes it a crime to transfer obscene material to a minor, raised similar concerns. Again, the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine bill lowers the age of minority from 18 to 16--the federal age of majority--and provides that the defendant must know he is dealing with someone so young. This provision of the Senate bill, like the House bill, applies only to ``obscene'' material--that is, material that enjoys no First Amendment protection whatever--material that is patently offensive to the average adult. The bill does not purport to proscribe the transferral of constitutionally protected material.  The original House bill would also have criminalized certain conduct directed at a person who had been ``represented '' to be a minor, even if that person was, in fact, an adult. The evident purpose was to make clear that the targets of sting operations are not relieved of criminal liability merely because their intended victim turned out to be an undercover agent and not a child. The new ``sting'' provisions addressed a problem that simply does not currently exist: No court has ever endorsed an impossibility defense along the lines anticipated by the House bill. The creation of special ``sting'' provisions in this one area could unintentionally harm law enforcement interests by lending credence to impossibility defenses raised in other sting and undercover situations. At the same time, these provisions would have criminalized conduct that was otherwise lawful: It is not a crime for adults to communicate with each other about sex, even if one of the adults pretends to be a child. Given these significant concerns, the ``sting'' provisions have been stricken from the House Leahy-DeWine substitute.  Another concern with the House bill was its modification of the child pornography possession laws. Current law requires possession of three or more pornographic images in order for there to be criminal liability. Congress wrote this requirement into the law as a way of protecting against government overreaching. By eliminating this numericrequirement, the House bill put at risk the unsuspecting Internet user who, by inadvertence or mistake, downleaded a single pornographic image of a child. While we support the concept of zero tolerance for child pornography, the inevitable result of the House language in overriding the earlier congressional definition would be to chill the free exchange of information over the Web by making users fearful that, if they download illegal material by mistake, they could go to jail.  More importantly, this provision could also inadvertently harm law enforcement interests by chilling those who inadvertently or mistakenly come upon child pornography from bringing the material to the attention of law enforcement officers. Technically, under the House-passed bill, these law-abiding citizens would be subject to criminal liabiilty.  Efforts to avoid these unintended consequences, while promoting zero tolerance of child pornography, could not be resolved in the time constraints facing the Committee. However, our bipartisan efforts to draft workable language have borne fruit. The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine-Sessions amendment accommodates the objective of ``zero balance'' for child pornography, but permits a narrow affirmative defense for certain defendants who, in good faith, destroyed the prohibited material or reported it to law enforcement authorities. With this amendment, we have achieved zero tolerance without unintended consequences for innocent Internet users and for law enforcement.  The House bill would have given the Attorney General sweeping administrative authority to subpoena records and witnesses investigations involving crimes against children. This proposed authority to issue administrative subpoenas would have given federal agents the power to compel disclosures without any oversight by a judge, prosecutor, or grand jury, and without any of the grand jury secrecy requirements. We appreciate that such secretary requirements may pose obstacles to full and efficient cooperation of federal/state task forces in their joint efforts to reduce the steadily increasing use of the Internet to perpetrate crimes against children, including crimes involving the distribution of child pornography. In addition, we understand that some U.S. Attorneys' Offices are reluctant to open grand jury investigations when the only goal is to identify individuals who have not yet, and may never, commit a federal (as opposed to state or local) offense.  The Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute accommodates these competing interests by granting the Department a narrowly drawn authority to subpoena the information that it most needs: Routine subscriber account information from Internet Service Providers (ISPS), which may provide appropriate notice to subscribers.  The new reporting requirement established by H.R. 3494 would also create new problems. Under current law, ISPs are generally free to report suspicious communications to law enforcement authorities. Under H.R. 3494, ISPs would be required to report such communications when they involve child pornography; failure to do so would be punishable by a substantial fine.  In addressing this issue, the Chairman, Senator DeWine and I are committed to eradicating the market of child pornography, believing that child pornography is inherently harmful to children. ISPs that come across such material should report it, and, in most cases, they already do. We must tread cautiously, however, before we compel private citizens to act as good Samaritans or to assume duties and responsibilities that are better left to law enforcement following statutory defined procedures to safeguard privacy and ensure due process.  The ISPs have cooperated in refining this provision of the House bill to make it more workable. Particular consideration was given to the appropriate standard for triggering a duty to report. We wanted to make the bar sufficiently high to discourage ISPs from erring on the side of over-reporting every questionable image. Over-reporting would overwhelm law enforcement agencies with worthless investigative leads and make it more difficult for them to isolate the leads worth pursuing. Over-reporting would also jeopardize the First Amendment rights of Internet users, while needlessly magnifying the administrative burden of the ISPs.  Under H.R. 3494, ISPs have a duty to make a report to law enforcement authorities only when they obtain knowledge of material from which a violation of the federal child pornography laws ``is apparent.'' While the committee-reported bill required ISPs to make a report only when they had ``probable cause'' to believe that the child pornography laws were being violated, the substitute passed today adopts an ``is apparent'' standard. The latter standard is stricter than the ``probable cause'' standard and so will reduce any incentive for over-reporting. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from America Online regarding the ``is apparent'' standard be included in the record.  If the ``is apparent'' standard is met, an ISP must expeditiously file a report with law enforcement authorities. This report is to include the ``facts or circumstances'' from which a violation of the law is apparent, so that law enforcement agencies can determine whether or not further investigation or prosecution is called for. Information in the ISP's files identifying the name of a subscriber does not fall within this description, since child pornography offenses will either be apparent or not, without regard to the name of a party to an image transmission or other violative act. If law enforcement determines that further investigation is warranted, it may subpoena, the ISP for any identifying information that the ISP may possess. The new administrative subpoena power should expedite this process.  The substitute also refines the reporting requirement in other ways:  First, by providing that there is no liability for failing to make a report unless the ISP knew both of the existence of child pornography and of the duty to report it (if it rises to the level of probable cause).  Second, by making clear that we are not imposing a monitoring requirement of any kind: ISPs must report child pornography when they come across it or it is brought to their attention, but they are not obligated to go out looking for it, which raises significant privacy concerns and conflicts with other laws.  Third, by adding privacy protections for any information reported under the bill.  Fourth, to protect smaller ISPs who could be put out of business for a first offense, by lowering the maximum fine for first offenders to $50,000; a second or subsequent failure to report, however, may still result in a fine of up to $100,000.  Thus, improved, the reporting requirement will accomplish its objectives without violating the privacy rights of Internet users, unduly burdening the ISPs, or inundating law enforcement with a lot of worthless information.  In conclusion, I commend Senators Hatch and DeWine for their efforts to address the terrible problem of child predators and pornographers. I am glad that we were able to join forces to construct a substitute that goes a long way toward achieving our common goals.                                          America Online Inc.,                               Washington, DC, September 25, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee, US Senate, Washington,          DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to follow up on the letter      of September 18 on the ISP reporting provisions of H.R. 3494,      to which America Online was a signatory.       In discussions preceding markup, there was an ISP request      for a tighter standard for the duty-to-report screening test,      to avoid unnecessary and counter-productive reporting. In      response, the committee used a ``probable cause'' standard.      While we are grateful for your intent, there has remained      some uncertainty about the effect of the original ``is      apparent'' standard and, thus, about which standard is      actually more limiting of the material covered, and thus more      workable for ISP's. Subsequently, a number of ISP's have      analyzed and discussed the question, and it is our collective      judgment that the ``is apparent'' standard is preferable.      This is the basis for our request that the language be      changed.       To elaborate: under proposed 227(b)(1) of the Victims of      Child Abuse Act, as added by Sec. 604 of H.R. 3494, Internet      and online service providers (ISP's) would have a duty to      report to a law enforcement authority any child pornography      of which it gains knowledge in the provision of its service.      In each case the ISP must judge whether material is covered      under this duty or not. The test it     uses in this process of analysis is the subject of our      request. Based on our review of the history of the ``is      apparent'' standard, we believe it to result in a narrower      reporting scope than ``probably cause,'' which at best calls      for an uncertain ``more likely than not'' judgment.       A more workable approach is to trigger the duty when the      ISP receives knowledge of ``facts or circumstances from which      a violation of [applicable law] is apparent****'' While the      ISP has no duty to monitor its users, in essence this      language creates a ``red flag:'' if the ISP in the operation      of its service obtains knowledge of material which is clearly      child pornography, a red flag should be raised. Such material      must be reported to the authorities. It is not, the ISP may      be heavily fined--it ignores the red flag at its peril.       As you are aware, this standard originated in Title II of      the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, developed in the      Judiciary Committee and passed 99-0 by the Senate earlier      this summer. For material present on ISPs' servers or      material to which ISP's link on the Internet, committee      desired to create a standard of liability triggered by      disregard of any ``red flags''. It sought a test falling      between the familiar ``should have known, could have known''      standard, which was deemed too broad in its coverage, and      absolute certainty of infringement, which was deemed too      narrow. ``Apparent'' has more the meaning of ``clear on its      face,'' and is a higher standard of evidence of illegality      than ``probable cause'', which implies ``more likely than      not, based on all the circumstances.''. As the bill's      extensively-negotiated ``Section by Section'' written      analysis states: ``Under this standard, a service provider      would have no obligation to seek out copyright infringement,      but it would not qualify for the safe habor if it had turned      a blind eye to `red flags' of obvious infringement.''       Again, given this history and understanding of the ``is      apparent'' standard, we believe it will be a significant      improvement over ``probable cause'' in H.R. 3494's duty-to-     report provisions.       In conclusion, thank you for your willingness to continue      working with us on this point. Your sensitivity, and that of      the Chairman, have once again been crucial in laying down a      workable legislative road map for the Internet/online medium.           Very truly yours,                                               Jill A. Lesser,                                    Director, Law & Public Policy,                                        Assistant General Counsel.
