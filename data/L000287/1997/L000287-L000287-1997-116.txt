Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Visual Pollution Reduction Act, legislation that would reduce the clutter of billboards along our Nation's roads and highways.  Today, Scenic America released a report entitled ``The Highway Beautification Act--A Broken Law.'' The report detailed how, despite the Highway Beautification Act, the number of billboards along our Nation's highways has continued to grow. Each year 5,000 to 15,000 additional billboards are built. Billboards that do not conform to States and local zoning ordinances continue to clutter our Nation's roads. In addition, State highway departments subsidize the billboard industry by operating permitting programs that lose money and use taxpayer funds to cut down trees to improve billboard visibility.  Billboards destroy the scenic beauty of our countryside and the architectural beauty of our inner cities. Billboards sell liquor and cigarettes to our Nation's children, especially in inner-city neighborhoods and poor communities. Billboards are visual pollution.  For this reason, I am introducing the Visual Pollution Reduction Act. This bill would prohibit new billboards in unzoned, rural areas. It would place a cap, at the current level, on the total number of billboards permitted in a State. And, it would prohibit States from removing trees and other vegetation to make a billboard more visible.  The Highway Beautification Act is broken. We must fix it. I hope that Congress will do the right thing and pass the Visual Pollution Reduction Act. America's highways would be visibly improved.                          ____________________
