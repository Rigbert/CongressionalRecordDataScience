President, I want to speak briefly about a recent decision of the Government of Colombia to end the aerial fumigation of coca.  Since the beginning of Plan Colombia 15 years ago, the United States, at huge cost, has financed a fleet of aircraft, fuel, herbicide, and pilots to spray coca fields in Colombia. When this first began we were told that in 5 years the spraying, along with billions of dollars in U.S. military and other aid, would cut by half the flow of cocaine coming to the United States.  Fifteen years later, that goal remains elusive. While the cultivation of coca has been reduced, aerial fumigation was never the solution to this problem. It is prohibitively expensive and unsustainable by the Government of Colombia. It also defies common sense. One Colombian official told me the cost of aerial fumigation is approximately $7,000 per hectare, while the cost to purchase the coca produced in one hectare is $400. In other words, for one-fifteenth the cost of aerial fumigation you could buy the coca and burn it.  The process also ignores the reality of rural Colombia where most coca farmers are impoverished and have no comparable means of earning income. Absent viable economic alternatives they resort to the dangerous business of growing coca, often at the behest of the FARC rebels or other armed groups.  The active ingredient in the herbicide used in the fumigation is glyphosate, a common weed killer. It is used by farmers and gardeners in the United States and other countries, including Colombia.  But controversy has plagued the aerial fumigation since its inception. It is no surprise that Monsanto, which manufactures the chemical, insists that glyphosate poses no threat to humans. But some Colombian farmers, whose homes are often located next to their fields, have claimed that they or their children suffered skin rashes, difficulty breathing, and other health problems after their property was sprayed. Others have complained that the herbicide has drifted into and destroyed licit food crops.  Scientists have studied glyphosate for many years and have differed about its safety. Some studies have concluded it is harmless. The Environmental Protection Agency says it has ``low acute toxicity.'' Others have linked it to birth deformities in amphibians. Most recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, an affiliate of the World Health Organization, reported that glyphosate is ``probably carcinogenic to humans,'' and that there is ``limited evidence'' that it can cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer.  I have been concerned for years about aerial fumigation in Colombia. While I am no scientist, I have wondered how the people of my State would react to the repeated aerial spraying of a chemical herbicide in areas where they live, grow food, and raise animals. I have also noted the conflicting views in the scientific literature, and we are all aware of instances when manufacturers insisted that a product was safe only to discover years later--too late for some who were exposed--that it was not. And, of course, there have been times when companies knew of the risk and chose to either ignore it or cover it up, motivated by profit over the welfare of the public.  It is for these reasons that I have included a provision in the annual Department of State and foreign operations appropriations bill that requires the Secretary of State to certify that ``the herbicides do not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans, including pregnant women and children, or the environment, including endemic species.'' Each year, the Secretary has made the certification.  The IARC study changes things. Although glyphosate remains controversial and Monsanto points out that the IARC study is not based on new field research, President Santos has responded in the only responsible way unless further research definitively contradicts it. It would simply be unconscionable for the Government of Colombia to ignore a study by the World Health Organization that a chemical sprayed over inhabited areas is potentially carcinogenic.  I commend President Santos for this decision. I am sure it was not an easy one, as it will inevitably be blamed for increases in coca cultivation. But anyone who thinks that spraying chemicals from the air is a solution to the illegal drug trade is deluding themselves. It is enormously expensive and not something U.S. taxpayers can or should pay for indefinitely. It has already gone on for a decade and a half. And it does nothing to counter the economic incentive of coca farmers to support their families.  The Department of State reacted with the following statement:       Any decision about the future of aerial eradication in      Colombia is a sovereign decision of the Colombian government,      and we will respect that. The United States began eradication      at the government's request and our collaboration has always      been based on Colombia's willingness to deploy this useful      tool. Given the recent suspension, we intend to redouble our      efforts to use other tools such as enhanced manual      eradication; interdiction (both land and maritime); and      improved methods to investigate, dismantle, and prosecute      criminal organizations, including through anti-money      laundering programs. We will also continue our longer-term      capacity building programs, especially those related to rule      of law institutions, and continue to help Colombia increase      its governmental presence in the countryside as we recognize      those to be the real keys to permanent change.  That was the right response. President Santos has staked his legacy on negotiations to end the armed conflict in Colombia. After five decades of war that have uprooted millions of people and destroyed the lives of countless others, a peace agreement would finally make it possible to address the lawlessness, injustice, and poverty that are at the root of the conflict. The United States should support him.                          ____________________
