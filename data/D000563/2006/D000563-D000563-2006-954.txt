President, last week, by a vote of 99 to 0, we created a humanitarian waiver for undocumented people in the United States who are seeking to get on the pathway to legalization. We said we would allow a nonreviewable look by the Secretary of Homeland Security at the cases of certain undocumented immigrants who would otherwise by ineligible for legalization.  This amendment says if you are currently legally in the United States and, as a result of changes in the law made by this bill, may be deportable for failing to include a piece of information on an immigration form, an immaterial omission, you also could qualify for the same kind of humanitarian waiver, nonreviewable by a court.  It is the same standard for legal residents that last week we approved for the undocumented. I hope the Senators on both sides will support the amendment.
