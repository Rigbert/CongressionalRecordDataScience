Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to respond to the concerns of my colleagues that have been expressed about the provision of the bill that has the legal immigration provisions sunsetting in the year 2006 and explain to my colleagues the reason for having this provision in the bill. It was put in there at the recommendation of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims simply because we wanted to force Congress to address the very complex subject of immigration on a regular basis.  There was no nefarious plot here involved in trying to sunset the legal immigration numbers. In fact, I am on record numerous times as being opposed to a moratorium. So I hope my friend will realize that, although he suggested I was endorsing a moratorium, I have never done such, nor is that the purpose of this provision of the bill. Once again, the motive is very good, and I have agreed to this amendment to try to avoid any misinterpretation or misconstruction of the original provision.  Mr. Chairman, the motive again was to force Congress to do something that it has never really done before, and that is take a look at our immigration policy on a regular basis. We have found so often in the past that by not forcing Congress to address this subject, our immigration policies oftentimes have developed in ways unexpected. And we certainly hope that will not be the case here.  I might say also I hope we will not come to regret that this amendment passes and 7 or 10 years down the road want to address immigration but not have any mandate to do so.  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Foley].                                  1900
