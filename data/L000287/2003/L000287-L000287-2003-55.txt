Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my outrage at this irresponsible and unfair tax bill. Those at the very top would get a generous tax cut, but those at the bottom would do no better. And there is no evidence that this bill would create even one job.  We can do better. We have the ability. We have the capacity to do better and we must do better. We owe it to the hardworking American who will not benefit under this bill, and we owe it to the 2.7 million people who have lost their jobs since President Bush took office.  This bill has no compassion, not one ounce of compassion. It is a shame and it is a disgrace and I just do not understand it. I cannot for the life of me understand how we can spend billions of dollars to rebuild Iraq, to build schools, to provide health care, and yet we cannot find a cent for the unemployed here at home. That is not right. That is not fair and that is not just. As a great Nation we must do better. I ask my colleagues to vote down this irresponsible and unfair deal.
