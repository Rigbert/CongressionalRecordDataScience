 President, in recent weeks we have seen mounting evidence that teenage drug use in this country is on the increase after more than a decade of decline. One of the principal reasons for this change is that we have lost the public message that drug use is wrong. As a result, a new generation of America's young people are growing up without a clear message about the dangers of drug use. This is not a situation that we can afford to let continue. The last time this happened, in the 1960's and 1970's, we saw an epidemic of use that cost us tens of thousands of lives. Now we see teenage drug use on the rise again. Recent surveys confirm this disturbing trend and indications are that data to be released in the next few days will only confirm the worst fears. It is for this reason that Senator Dole and I held a press conference yesterday with major family groups, including the National Family Partnership, National Families in Action, CADCA, and PRIDE, to draw attention to the problems of returning teen drug use and the dangerous normalization of this use you can now see and hear on TV, in the movies, and in rock music. For this reason I am submitting a Senate resolution, cosponsored by over a dozen members, to declare November 1, 1995, National Drug Awareness Day. It is important that we all recognize the importance of the issue. We need to renew our commitment to fighting drug use, to prevent a new generation from becoming victims of those who would mislead them into believing that drug use is just an alternative lifestyle with no adverse consequences. Drugs kill, they maim, they ruin lives, they cripple potential. We saw what happened when we ignored the problem once. We cannot let this happen again.                          ____________________
