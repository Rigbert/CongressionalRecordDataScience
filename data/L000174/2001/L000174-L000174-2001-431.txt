President, I rise today to congratulate William Hazelett of Colchester who was chosen as the United States Small Business Administration National Exporter of the Year. Bill has shown extraordinary innovation and vision in building a very successful business in Vermont.  Bill Hazelett and his wife Dawn are old friends of mine and Marcelle's. Bill is the president of Hazelett Strip-Casting Corp., a manufacturing firm that designs and makes continuous metal casting machines designed to produce long sheets of metal and wire for everything from pennies to aluminum siding to automobile bodies. Hazelett Strip-Casting now employs 145 people. Foreign business accounts for 70 percent of its $23 million in annual sales, and Hazelett Strip-Casting has clients all around the world, including much of Europe, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Chile. Bill moved his company to Vermont from Connecticut in 1957 because, as he says, ``I wanted to ski.'' We are very happy he came and decided to stay.  I commend Bill and Dawn for receipt of this prestigious award.  I ask that a copy of a May 9, 2001, article in the Burlington Free Press outlining Bill Hazelett's achievements be printed in the Record.  The article follows:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 9, 2001]        Colchester Man Named SBA's National Exporter of the Year       R. William Hazelett of Colchester on Tuesday received the      U.S. Small Business Administration's National Exporter of the      Year award from President George W. Bush in a White House      ceremony. Hazelett, 82, president of Hazelett Strip-Casting      Corp., was honored for building a manufacturing firm for      which foreign business accounts for 70 percent of its $23      million in annual sales.       Hazelett had a simple reason for the recognition. ``We have      a technology that is superior to any other technology in      fabricating sheet metal,'' he said. ``My business was      selected (for the award) as being very, very good at creating      exporting business for the United States.'' The company      designs and makes continuous metal casting machines,      behemoths designed to produce long sheets of metal and wire      that can weigh as much as 120 tons and cost $15 million. The      machines produce sheet metal for everything from pennies to      aluminum siding to auto bodies, Hazelett said.       Clients are scattered all over the world, including much of      Europe, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, Brazil      and Chile, he said. Earlier this year, a Hazelett      representative was part of the trade mission that traveled to      Argentina with Gov. Howard Dean. Though no sale was made on      the trip, it started a process that will lead to a sale,      Hazelett said. ``You don't sell one of these machines      overnight because a machine might cost $15 million,'' he      said. ``You've got a whole plant that might cost $150 million      that they go into. It's a very long-term consideration.''      Hazelett was confident a deal would be signed. ``We will get      the business because we are the best in the world,'' he said.       Hazelett, which does all of its engineering and      manufacturing in Vermont, employs 145 people. The company      moved here in 1957 from Connecticut because, Hazelett said,      ``I wanted to ski.''       In naming Hazelett for the honor, the SBA noted his      company's ``stellar success in export marketing.'' ``Bill      Hazelett's contribution to Vermont's stature as a world-class      exporter center is absolutely outstanding,'' said Kenneth      Silver, director of the SBA's Vermont district      office.                          ____________________
