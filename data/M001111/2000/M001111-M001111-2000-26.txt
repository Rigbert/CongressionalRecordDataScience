 President, I am introducing legislation today to provide a long overdue honor to a distinguished group of American veterans. The United States Naval Armed Guard made heroic contributions to our naval efforts in World War I and World War II and the time has come for a grateful nation to recognize these brave veterans.  The Armed Guard consisted of the officers, gunners, radiomen, signalmen and later medics and radarmen who were placed on cargo ships to protect them from armed assault.  The U.S. Navy Armed Guard was first constituted during World War I and armed gunners served on 384 ships. During World War II, the U.S. Navy Armed Guard served on 6,236 merchant ships. 710 of these ships were sunk and many more were damaged in combat. The Armed Guard has 144,970 men assigned to it before the war ended in 1945. 1,810 men were killed during engagements with the enemy.  I am here today because the contributions to victories in the two world wars of these fine patriots has never been recognized by our Government or the Navy. I believe the Congress should act to honor these veterans whose recognition is both deserved and long overdue.  The wartime contributions of these men were absolutely vital to the safe delivery of cargos that took the war to our enemies. Many times they stayed in the fight even as the decks of their ships were awash and sinking. What is most notable is that other nations that now are free because of the contributing sacrifices of the U.S. Navy Armed Guards, have awarded special medals in recognition of the heroic actions of the members of the U.S. Navy Armed Guard Special Force.  Mr. President, It is high time we did the right thing and recognized these fine fighting men for their service. This legislation would honor these men in a very fitting way. It will recognized former members of the U.S. Armed Guard Special Force with a special medal that honors them as American heroes. It will recognize the military character of their service by awarding each of them at least one of the three World War II campaign medals for service in the American, Asiatic-Pacific, and Europe-Africa-Middle East theaters of war. Let's do the right thing for this unrecognized group of American veterans who sacrificed so much for their country. For more than fifty years, members of the Naval Armed Guard have shared their wartime stories of sacrifice and commitment with one another. Now is the time for all Americans to acknowledge their service in a heart felt way.  I urge prompt Senate consideration and passage of this legislation.                          ____________________
