 President, I stand here to pledge my support for the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator Domenici, which preserves the Legal Services Corporation.  This organization has been both efficient and effective in providing legal services to the poor, so that those who are most vulnerable in our society have access to the courts, not just those who can afford it.  Contrary to the rhetoric of some of my colleagues who oppose the Domenici amendment, the vast majority of cases handled by the Legal Services Corporation are not controversial--they are individual cases arising out of everyday unfortunate problems--losing a job, suffering a serious illness, facing the breakdown of family relations of simply dealing with Government redtape.  As someone who has long sought to do what I could do to prevent and to fight against family violence, I am most grateful for the help that the Legal Services Corporation provides to victims of family violence.  In fact, representation of victims of family violence is the single largest category of cases handled by local legal services programs--accounting for one out of every three cases processed last year.  In 1994 alone--the year we passed the Violence Against Women Act--local legal services programs handled more than 50,000 cases in which women sought legal protection from abusive husbands, and over 9,000 cases involving neglected and abused children.  This amendment places a number of prohibitions on the Legal Services Corporation, but keeps this much-needed organization intact, enabling it to continue to provide traditional legal services to those who desperately need them.  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting Senator Domenici's amendment.
