President, one week ago, I stood behind President Bush as he signed the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 into law. The President gave a short speech about the importance of the legislation and his commitment to defending it. He even distributed a letter to all those in attendance celebrating this reauthorization. In his letter he acknowledged that ``further work remains in the fight against injustice, and each generation has a responsibility to write a new chapter in the unfinished story of freedom.'' I ask unanimous consent to insert his letter into the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
