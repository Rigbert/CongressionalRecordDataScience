  A few weeks ago, President Trump and Republican attorneys general argued in court to create a healthcare crisis for families in our country. If Republicans win their blatantly partisan lawsuit, the consequences could be sweeping and devastating. Tens of millions of people who have healthcare coverage through Medicaid Expansion or the exchanges could lose it, as could many young adults who are on their parents' insurance.  Over 100 million people with preexisting conditions could lose protections that stop insurance companies from charging them more, excluding benefits they need or denying them coverage entirely. Patients could lose protections that require insurers to cover essential health benefits like prescription drug costs, maternity care, emergency care, or mental healthcare and more. Limits on how much patients have to pay out of pocket could go away, while lifetime and annual caps on patients' benefits could come back even to those insured through their employers.  Republicans have refused to acknowledge what is actually at stake now for the patients and families whose health they are putting at risk, and they have made it all too clear that despite the horrible consequences they are setting up, despite the lives they are throwing needlessly into jeopardy, Republicans are going to go full steam ahead with this reckless lawsuit to strike down healthcare for millions and without any plan to do anything if they win.  Some Republicans have tried to dodge this fact by saying they will figure it out after they win. That is an incredibly telling and incredibly alarming position. It is about as comforting as an arsonist telling you he will rebuild your house after he burns it down.  Let's be clear. Republicans have no plans for the patients who lose their coverage, no plans for the families who will see their healthcare costs go up, and no plans for people nationwide who rely on these protections for preexisting conditions that could be taken away.
