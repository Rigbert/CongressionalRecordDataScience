Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield just a moment, this is a common misunderstanding, because the administration and the Republican leadership made a great show of adding environmental protections to the original NAFTA agreement, because they saw in fact that we probably were going to beat the NAFTA fast track agreement on the floor.  But it was all cover. It was not in the agreement. It was not in the annexes. It was not in any part of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. It was in fact a nonbinding side agreement by administrative rule by the President. It was basically to do nothing except to provide cover to some of our weak-willed colleagues, who were torn between the opposition of people concerned about the environment and other things with this agreement and the pressure from some of the largest industries and some of the largest employers in their district, who were going to become smaller employers in their district real soon after this passed.  So this was all cooked up. In fact, there is no binding environmental agreement. We have seen the conditions along the border deteriorate dramatically. It is going to continue to accelerate and get worse. In fact, I do not want to bring in too many side issues, but there is the recent problem with the strawberries. This is a problem of lack of environmental safeguards in Mexico. Americans are threatened with hepatitis because of some strawberries snuck in here in violation of the standards which control our school lunch program, but in any case, labeled as an American product, sold to children, to schools, fed to children, infected with hepatitis because, again, there are no enforceable environmental laws in Mexico. Yet we are opening our border to these goods coming across. This is an incredible threat.
