 President, I echo the statement of my colleague, Senator Boxer, and only add to it that in a discussion with an editor of the Los Angeles Times on this matter yesterday, I think there is conflicting data as to whether there are certain guidelines or thresholds below which there is not prosecution. I believe this needs to be cleared up.  I thank the majority leader and Senator Domenici for their understanding in this matter. I think it is important that there be an investigation on what prosecutorial guidelines, thresholds, any other provisions for prosecution of across border crime there may be.  I thank the Chair.
