Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I would ask the author--I am a bit puzzled, and we have been unable to get an answer expeditiously from the Coast Guard--you are saying the Coast Guard will not recognize the no-wake zone, but the enforcement would fall to the local harbor patrol or the local authorities. So there is a no-wake zone that the local officials can fine or penalize people who violate it, can they not?
