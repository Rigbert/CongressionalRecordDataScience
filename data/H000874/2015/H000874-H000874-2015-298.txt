Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center as it celebrates its fiftieth anniversary this year.  Since 1965, SERC has been the nation's leading research center for understanding coastal zones and the environmental issues they face. With coastal zones home to more than 70% of the world's people, SERC has been at the forefront of monitoring and studying these zones' unique ecosystems and the different factors that affect their health.  While their main research focuses on the areas of climate change, invasive species, biodiversity, land use, and pollution, SERC personnel are also involved in preparing the next generation of environmental scientists. Over the years, SERC has provided learning opportunities for students from kindergarten all the way through the post-doctoral level, partnering with over 150 colleges and universities to conduct professional training and a variety of hands-on experiences in the field.  Headquartered on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland's Fifth District, SERC encompasses more than 2,650 acres of land and twelve miles of protected shoreline. The scientists at SERC use this shoreline as a natural laboratory and model for long-term ecological research to study the way terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric components interact in complex ecosystems.  In 2009, I was a proud cosponsor of legislation that authorized a $41 million expansion and renovation of SERC's Mathias Laboratory, the Smithsonian's first LEED-Platinum building. This sustainable research lab provides a larger space and more flexibility for scientists to explore cutting edge research in an environmentally responsible way. I had the privilege of attending the ribbon cutting ceremony for the lab's reopening last year.  I am proud to celebrate this anniversary and ask that my colleagues join me in commending the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center for its contributions to our understanding of coastal environments and climate change--and saluting those who continue to carry out its important mission.                            ____________________
