President. U.S. News and World Report, in speaking of the death of Marvin Stone, spoke of one man's ``superior contribution''.  Marvin Stone contributed more than should be expected of someone who had had a dozen life times and far more than anyone could have expected in a span of seventy-six years.  Marvin Stone, born in Burlington, VT, served in the Pacific in World War II and then went on to become one of the most respected journalists in America.  My wife, Marcelle, and I have been privileged to know Marvin and his wonderful wife, Terry. I think with fondness not only of times together with them, Marvin's sister, Marilyn Greenfield, and the many friends in Burlington, but also evenings with those far reaching conversations at their home in the Washington area.  Marvin took the time to call me when I was a brand new Senator, even though he probably was at first curious about the oddity of a Democrat from Vermont. We became close friends and throughout two decades I called upon him for advice and insight. I knew the advice would come, never tinged with partisanship but underlined with a great sense of history and his overwhelming integrity.  I can only imagine the void this leaves in the life of Terry, his wife of fifty years, of Jamie and Stacey and Torren and all his family. He also leaves a great void in our country.Marvin's legacy, though, is also one of example, and those, especially in the field of journalism, who follow that example, can also seek the respect and the honor that he earned.  I ask that the US News World Report article be printed in the Record as well as the obituary in the Washington Post.           [From the U.S. News & World Report, May 15, 2000]                  One Man's ``Superior Contribution''       Journalist Marvin L. Stone, who died of cancer last week at      76, played a transforming role a generation ago as the editor      of U.S. News & World Report.       In his decade of leadership, from 1976 to 1985, Stone was      responsible for U.S. New's editorial shift toward the center      from the more conservative views held by its founder, David      Lawrence. Stone expanded the magazine's coverage beyond its      traditional emphasis on politics and business to include      social, cultural, and educational issues. He introduced four-     color photography and changed the character of the editorial      staff by recruiting younger journalists, women, and minority      reporters. ``Ours is a magazine devoted to a singular ideal:      to report, clarify, interpret, and project the news--to put      people and events in perspective as objectively as humanly      possible,'' Stone once told a national convention of Sigma      Delta Chi, the journalism society, ``Put another way: to      provide information people can rely on, find useful, can act      upon.''       Born and raised in Vermont, Stone served in World War II as      an attack boat officer in the Pacific. He began his 40-year      journalism career as a police reporter for the Huntington      (W.Va.) Herald-Dispatch. As an International News Service      correspondent based in Tokyo, Vienna, Paris, and London, he      covered the Korean War and the French Indochina War and broke      the news that the Soviet Union had developed a hydrogen bomb.       To the moon. In 1961, a year after he joined U.S. News,      Stone covered the construction of the Berlin Wall. Later in      the 1960's, he reported on topics as varied as coal mining in      Kentucky and space shots to the moon. He authored the      Doubleday Science Series book Man in Space.       When Mortimer B. Zuckerman bought U.S. News in 1984, Stone      was holding two positions, editor of the magazine and      chairman of its parent company. After what we termed six      ``amicable'' months with Zuckerman, he resigned to become      deputy director of the United States Information Agency, a      position he held for four years. From 1989 to 1995, he was      the founding president and chairman of the International      Media Fund, an organization that encouraged a free press in      Eastern Europe and the Balkans.       Zuckerman, chairman and editor-in-chief of U.S. News, said,      ``Marvin Stone was one of the giants of post-World War II      journalism. His talent as a reporter and an editor brought      him one of the great positions of journalism as the editor of      U.S. News & World Report. He extended his career by      outstanding service in the public arena. He was a great      friend and a great colleague. He shall be missed by all who      benefited from his wisdom and insight.''       In 1985, Ronald Reagan hailed Stone's 25 years with U.S.      News as a ``superior contribution'' to American journalism.      Said the president: ``You helped make the world's events and      our challenges just a little more understandable.''                [From the Washington Post, May 3, 2000]              Marvin L. Stone Dies at 76; U.S. News Editor       Marvin L. Stone, 76, who covered definitive Cold War      moments such as the fall of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam and the      rise of the Berlin Wall before he took the top editing job at      U.S. News & World Report in 1976 and became deputy director      of the U.S. Information Agency in 1986, died of cancer May 1      at his home in Falls Church.       Mr. Stone joined the weekly news magazine in 1960 and      advanced to executive editor in 1973. He became the      equivalent of editor in chief in 1976, and over the next nine      years, he propelled the magazine away from some of its      conservative editorial positions and added cultural features      and colorful layouts. He resigned in 1985, shortly after      Mortimer B. Zuckerman purchased the publication.       Among the changes Mr. Stone oversaw during his years at the      magazine were the addition of full-color photographs and      service stories about medical, scientific and social trends.      Mr. Stone, who considered himself conservative, told The      Washington Post in 1982 that he viewed his impact less as a      ``revolution'' than an ``evolution.''       Mr. Stone was deputy director of the U.S. Information      Agency from 1985 to 1989, followed by six years as president      and chairman of the International Media Fund, a Washington-     based, government-funded organization encouraging a free      press in Eastern Europe. After the fund went defunct in 1995,      he spent the next year in Europe on a Knight Foundation      journalism fellowship before retiring.       Marvin Lawrence Stone was born in Burlington, Vt., and      served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. He      graduated from Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va., and      received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia      University.       He was a police reporter in Huntington before joining the      old International News Service wire agency in the 1950s,      where his assignments included the Korean War.       Mr. Stone was named to the Sigma Delta Chi journalism      society's Journalism Hall of Fame in 1990. He was a past      adjunct fellow at the Center for Strategic and International      Studies. His memberships included Temple Rodef Shalom in      Falls Church, the Cosmos Club and the Military Order of the      Caribao.       He was the author of ``Man in Space,'' a 1974 booklet that      was part of a Doubleday science series.       Survivors include his wife of 50 years, Sydell ``Terry''      Stone of Falls Church; two daughters, Jamie Faith Stone of      Falls Church and Stacey Hope Goodrich of West Melbourne,      Fla.; a son, Torren M. Stone of Falls Church; a sister; and      three grandchildren.                          ____________________
