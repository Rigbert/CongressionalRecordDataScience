I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, timely action on this bill will allow the Forest Service to implement an earlier congressional action intended to allow continued operation of certain commercial recreational services and facilities at Smith Gulch in the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness in Idaho.  Although Congress amended the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in 2004 to direct the Forest Service to allow established uses and occupancy at Smith Gulch Lodge, the Forest Service believes it needs additional authority to allow the lodge to use power equipment, such as gas generators, mowers, and other equipment needed for routine maintenance and for improvements, such as an in-stream hydroelectric water wheel for renewable energy. H.R. 4283 would authorize limited use of such equipment for the general upkeep of the lodge.  Congressman Simpson should be commended for his attention to this matter, and I urge adoption of this commonsense bill.  I reserve the balance of my time.
