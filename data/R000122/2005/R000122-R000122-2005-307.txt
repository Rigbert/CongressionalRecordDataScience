There are certain jurisdictions that have specific laws with respect to background checks on daycare centers. The gun industry is virtually unregulated, which is a very important point here. There is very little regulation deliberately on the manufactured weapons, the standards. As you point out so often with respect to product safety, toy guns are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, real guns are unregulated in terms of their safety. So there is no legal--very little legal statutory requirement. So it depends upon claims of negligence to get at this harm and to redress the harm caused, and this bill essentially wipes out that civil liability under our court system.
