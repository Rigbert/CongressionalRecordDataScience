Chairman, I noticed that when the President's budget came up on the floor of the House, it was overwhelmingly rejected, and only 10 of the 23 Democrats on the Committee on Science voted for the President's budget. The gentleman was one of them, I give him credit for consistency, but evidently the gentleman was less persuasive then than he is today.
