On Monday, May 14, 2007, Jim passed away at the age of 56 as the result of an automobile accident. Known for his commitment to his union and his community, Jim will surely be missed by his family, friends, and the people with whom he worked.  Always a champion of developing the minds of young people in the community, Jim served as School Board President for the School City of Hammond. As a member of the board, Jim was fully committed to establishing and continuing educational programs that would afford the children of Hammond with the best opportunity for a productive future. Jim was focused on providing students the tools necessary to be successful in their academic careers. Furthermore, Jim was a firm believer that in order for students to achieve success and reach their full potential, they need the best teachers to serve as their guides. For this reason, Jim was a strong advocate for these teachers when it came to their professional development, and he constantly sought opportunities that would help make them better and more efficient in their position to help shape their students' futures.  Not only was Jim focused on improving his community's school system, he also played a major role in the betterment of his union, Carpenters Local 1406. Though he retired in 2006, Jim was a true leader among the carpenters of Northwest Indiana. For 20 years, Jim served as a business agent for the union. During that time, he also served as a board member for regional organizations and the Northwest Indiana Joint Carpenters Apprentice Program, as well as President of the Northwest Indiana District Council of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America.  From his involvement in improving the school system in Hammond to his unwavering commitment to his fellow carpenters, Jim always has been a pillar of the Northwest Indiana community. Evidence of his devotion to his community was further demonstrated in his service as board chairman for the Millennium Project and his participation in several organizations, including: the Pirates, Lake Area United Way, Calumet Project for Industrial Jobs, Hammond Parks Foundation, and the Hammond Education Foundation.  Jim's commitment to the community and his colleagues is matched only by his devotion to his family. Jim leaves to cherish his memory his wife, State Senator Linda Lawson; parents, Paul and Theresa Hornak; sister, Paula (David) Barancyk; and daughters, Heather Hornak, Jennifer (Jeff) Bacino, and Laura Wozniak. Jim's adoring grandchildren, Jake Hornak, Maya Strong, and Genavive Bacino, also will treasure the memories of their grandpa, as will many other family members, colleagues, and friends whose lives he has touched.  Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Mr. James Hornak for his outstanding devotion to his community. His dedication to his family, friends, colleagues, and to all students in Hammond, Indiana, is worthy of the highest admiration. Jim's selflessness, his commitment to improving educational opportunities for children and improving the workplace for his fellow union members, as well as his devotion to his family are an inspiration to us all, and he will sorely be missed.                          ____________________
