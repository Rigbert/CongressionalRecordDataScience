 President, I would like to take a moment to honor a remarkable Iowan, Raymond Paul Pritchard, a native of Bondurant, IA. He is a distinguished World War II Air Force veteran and a civil servant of 29 years.  Following graduation from Bondurant High School in 1937, Mr. Pritchard went to work for Standard Oil Company. In 1941, Mr. Pritchard joined the Army Air Corp and served his country valiantly for the entirety of World War II. As an engineer and top turret gunner in the 384th Bomber Group, Mr. Pritchard was involved in numerous missions in the hostile skies of Europe, including several bombing runs over Germany and Czechoslovakia that were critical to the war effort.  Upon returning from World War II, Mr. Pritchard became a U.S. Postal Service worker. Mr. Pritchard retired in 1974, following 29 years of public service.  Mr. Pritchard and his wife Helen have three children, along with seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. He is a member of Christ United Methodist Church, American Legion Post 374, and a 50-year member of Pioneer Lodge No. 22.  Mr. Raymond Paul Pritchard is a truly remarkable Iowan and American, who exemplifies great military and civilian service to his country.                          ____________________
