 President, I rise today to discuss the military construction appropriation bill before us today. Senator Burns and Senator Murray are to be congratulated on crafting a measure that adequately meets our military needs while at the same time addressing the pressing concerns of our soldiers.  Mr. President, at a time when our services are having difficulty meeting their recruiting goals and retention is suffering, it is more important than ever that the military address quality of life issues. Unfortunately, the administration has chosen to ignore the reality and not budget the appropriate resources for this goal.  The budget for all military construction contained in the Senate bill totals just over $9 billion, almost $800,000 above what the administration requested. As anyone who has visited some of our installations can tell you, this money is desperately needed.  I salute the work of Senators Burns and Murray as well as their staffs. Their ability to prioritize within the declining budget is crucial to improving the everyday lives of our soldiers and their families. Mr. President, if we are going to continue to ask more from our military around the world, the very least we can do is to provide them with adequate housing and facilities. In addition, it should be pointed out that the committee worked with both the House and Senate authorizing committees and did not appropriate funds for any project that was not authorized.  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this excellent bill.
