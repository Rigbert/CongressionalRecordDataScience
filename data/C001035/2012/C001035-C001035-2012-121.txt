President, this is a very modest bipartisan amendment. It simply gives the EPA more time to get these regulations right, and our struggling manufacturers will get more time to comply with them. It is a false choice to say that this is the environment versus the economy. We can have both.  If this amendment is not adopted and the current regulations go into effect, the estimates are that they will cost manufacturers $14 billion to comply, and we will lose 200,000 manufacturing jobs at a time when we can least afford it. All we are asking is for more time to get these regulations right.  I urge support for the amendment, and I yield the floor.
