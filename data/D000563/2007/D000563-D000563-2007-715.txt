I have been told there is an implicit understanding, for example, with Guard members that they would serve 1 year, for example, and have 5 years before redeployment. In fact, that has not been the case in my home State of Illinois, where over 80 percent of the Illinois Guard units have been deployed into combat during the course of this war, and many have been deployed repeatedly. So, obviously, the promise that was supposed to be kept hasn't been kept, and I ask the Senator from Virginia, how do you protect Guard and Reserve when it comes to redeployment in terms of the time they have?
