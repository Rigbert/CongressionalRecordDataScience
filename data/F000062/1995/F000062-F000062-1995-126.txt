 President, I'd like to take a moment today to pay tribute to someone I consider to be one of my best friends in the world. She is a fireball of energy and someone who has truly touched the lives of many, many people.  Rosalind Wyman is an extraordinary friend.  ``Politics, arts, sports and my family are my life,'' Roz Wyman once said. Roz has indeed turned her passion into results.  A native and resident of Los Angeles, Wyman has been involved in the political world since before she can remember; her baby book includes a picture of 2-year-old Roz smiling happily at a portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Strongly influenced by her parents' belief that you should serve your community, she turned immediately to elective politics following her graduation from the University of Southern California.  At the age of 22, Roz became the youngest elected legislator in a major U.S. city when she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council.  From 1953 to 1965, Wyman served as a member of the non-partisan council, earning particular recognition for her successful drive to bring the Dodgers to Los Angeles.  The late owner of the Dodgers, Walter O'Malley, often said: ``The Dodgers would not be in Los Angeles if it had not been for Roz.'' She also played a major role in the move of the Lakers basketball team to Los Angeles.  In the years since she left the council, Wyman has applied her formidable organizational skills to a variety of local, national and international tasks. Among her many other accomplishments, Roz served by appointment of the President on the Independent Commission to Review the National Endowment for the Arts grantmaking procedures. Locally, she became President of the Los Angeles County Music and Performing Arts Commission in 1992.  She served as executive chairperson of the Producers Guild of America (1977-1981) and as executive vice chair of the Los Angeles Center Theatre Group, which operates the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson Theatre.  She helped direct State and national campaigns and chaired two Democratic Congressional Campaign Dinners, each of which set records by raising over $1 million.  Roz participated in the U.S. Delegation to the United National Economic and Social Council (UNESCO) and was part of the American delegation to the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (Madrid, 1980).  But, it was in 1983 that Roz Wyman--this legend from Los Angeles--walked into my life.  Roz became the first woman ever selected to be the convention chair and chief executive officer for a Democratic Convention. She had been selected to chair the 1984 convention in San Francisco. I was Mayor of San Francisco at the time. And I can tell you this: The first time Roz Wyman walked into my office with her list of items that needed to be provided by the city of San Francisco, I knew I had met someone with formidable determination and tenacity. And I knew I had made a friend for life.  The convention was a huge success. And every convention since then has been modeled on what Roz made happen in San Francisco.  Since then, I always knew that Roz was someone who could get the job--any job--done.  When I thought about running for the U.S. Senate in 1992, Roz was one of the first people I turned to and she was one of the first people to volunteer to be a campaign co-chair.  For the last 4 years of my life, Roz has been the truly inspirational force who, in spirit, has never left my side.  She has opened her home to a tired candidate and staff. She has been the unyielding cheerleader who was always upbeat even in the face of tough times. And she has always been faithful to her vision of what is right for our State and our country.  One of Roz's dreams, she told me, was to see a woman elected U.S. Senator from California. I am so honored, and indeed lucky, to be the recipient of Roz's focused attention.  Roz will soon celebrate her birthday with her three children, her 5\1/2\ year-old granddaughter, Samantha, and her many, many friends. I am so glad that her family has asked some of Roz's friends to pay tribute in some way to our Roz.  There are few people in the world as passionate, as loving, as strong, and as inspiring as Roz Wyman.  Many may know Roz because she was the youngest person ever elected to the Los Angeles City Council or because she almost singlehandedly brought the Dodgers from Brooklyn to Los Angeles.  But, in my own heart, I will always know Roz because she is that special, life-long friend who helped make my dreams come true.                          ____________________
