Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman.  Now, why would an Oregonian insert himself into the perpetual water wars in California? Well, first off, this bill has had no hearings. As you can see from the debate here on the floor, there is extraordinary disagreement over the potential impacts of this legislation. That is not just critical to Californians, it is critical to Oregonians.  I have a letter here from the Pacific Fishery Management Council. They believe that this could have a hugely detrimental impact on some audit species which compose about 80 percent of the California fishery and about 50 percent of the fishery in Oregon.  We went through this before about a decade ago where there were inadequate outflows. There were problems with the forge fish, the smelt, and the returning salmon, and we had a season that was closed for 2 years. It put many, many Oregonians out of work. There was impact beyond commercial fisheries and coastal communities on recreational fisheries. It cost us hundreds of millions of dollars. We got a couple of hundred million dollars in Federal relief.                              {time}  1445  The experts, the Pacific Fishery Management Council and their lawyers who have read this bill, believe it does change the management of the water in ways that are detrimental and would void the biological opinion and would probably put us back into another couple of ``no fishing'' years a few years down the road given the cycle of salmon, particularly, section 103(d)(2) and section 103(c).  I have heard here on the floor, despite the fact no hearing has been held--the bill just burbled up very recently--that on one side they are saying, ``No, don't worry, it will not have a detrimental environmental impact, and, if it does, well, we will stop doing it.''  But I just looked at that section of the bill and it doesn't quite say that definitively. In fact, it changes the standards, and then it says, ``If additional negative impacts might happen, then the Secretary could suspend some of the provisions of this bill.'' Not exactly certainty, and we need some certainty here for our fisheries.  We have been hurting for years. Last year, we had a good year, thankfully. We are still dealing with buybacks because of reducing the size of the fleets from past problems. Fishermen are burdened with the buyback year in, year out. I just got the terms of that adjusted in the NDAA. They had a payday loan from the Federal Government. Now we got them a reasonable loan from the Federal Government. The government didn't even pay for their buyback. Heck, in the Northeast, they paid for a couple of buybacks. No, we had to pay for our own with a payday loan. Now we are going to jeopardize the fleet 1, 2, or 3 years out because we won't have the returns with the endangered species.  So this is a bad idea to do in the waning days of a Congress, to bring forward a bill which is controversial, over which there is disagreement on the actual language in the provisions of the bill, and which my experts, the Pacific Fishery Management Council, say would be detrimental and would cause those problems.                           Pacific Fishery Management Council,                                   Portland, OR, December 6, 2014.     Hon. Jared Huffman,     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Huffman: Thank you for your letter of November 17      and follow-up on December 3 requesting Pacific Fishery      Management Council (Pacific Council) comment on     legislation related to operation of the State Water Project      and Central Valley Project in California (HR 5781) and its      potential impacts to fisheries. Although the timing of the      bill did not allow for full Council deliberation, we present      the following concerns, which are consistent with previous      comments the Council has made on similar legislation. Absent      changes in the legislation to address these concerns, the      Pacific Council does not support HR 5781 moving forward.       HR 5781 would override Endangered Species Act protections      for salmon, steelhead, and other species in the Bay-Delta in      order to allow increased pumping from the Delta in excess of      scientifically justified levels. These measures also protect      salmon stocks not currently listed under the ESA, which are a      primary source of healthy sport and commercial fisheries from      Central California to Northern Oregon. The bill introduces a      new standard for implementing the Endangered Species Act      concerning Central Valley salmon and Delta smelt, a keystone      species in the Bay-Delta ecosystem. (See Sec 101(3), and      102(b)(2)(a).) It is unclear how severe the negative effects      of this new standard might be, but it would certainly impact      current water management policy that protects ESA listed      salmon stocks from further decline and helps prevent      currently healthy stocks from becoming listed under the ESA.       The bill contains several provisions that override the      salmon and Delta smelt biological opinions (for example      Section 103(d)(2), Section 103(c), and others). Section 103      could result in dramatically higher pumping than is      authorized under the biological opinions, and would cause      significant harm to migrating salmon and steelhead and other      native species. The 1:1 inflow to export ratio for the San      Joaquin at Vernalis overrides the `reasonable and prudent      alternatives' to standard operations that were set out in the      2009 Central Valley biological opinion in order to protect      Sacramento River winter-run Chinook and other salmonid      species. Further degradation of salmon habitat is contrary to      the provisions of the Magnuson Stevens Act (Sec.      305(b)(1)(D)) and something the Pacific Council strongly      opposes.       Section 103(f)(2) provides exemptions for mitigation of      negative effects on listed fish species, which alleviates the      project from compensating fisheries for negative effects of      its operations; it is unclear if there is an exemption for      mitigation of negative effect on non-listed salmon stocks.      Exempting mitigation responsibility for harm to salmon      populations provides the exact opposite incentive to the kind      of salmon protection and enhancement advocated by the      Council, and essentially amounts to redistributing the value      of salmon fisheries to agricultural or municipal interests,      as well as increasing the risk to ESA listed fish stocks      threatened with extinction. Additionally, the Pacific Council      is concerned about whether Central Valley projects are      achieving their current mitigation responsibility, and      providing these exemptions could preclude seeking remedy. If      this bill moves forward, it should provide direct mitigation      for the proposed actions and risks to which it would subject      fish populations and fishing communities, not avoiding this      appropriate responsibility.       In 2008 and 2009. $158 million in Congressional aid was      provided to deal with the disaster of the closure of ocean      salmon fisheries off California and Oregon south of Cape      Falcon due to a collapse of the Sacramento River salmon      stocks. These fisheries are an important source of jobs for      coastal communities, which cannot be replaced simply through      disaster relief. Without adjustments to this bill, we fear      such a disaster could be repeated in the reasonably near      future.       Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on this      legislation; please don't hesitate to contact me or Ms.      Jennifer Gilden of the Pacific Council office if you have any      further questions.           Sincerely,                                              D.O. McIsaac, Ph.D.,                                               Executive Director.
