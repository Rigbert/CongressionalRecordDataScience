  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I know many people wonder what takes precedence here in Washington, DC. It is kind of puzzling when you watch the House in session. Is it the 13 unfinished appropriations bills, the bills that will fund every part of the Government for the next fiscal year, which are due on the first of October? Not a one has been passed? Can we avoid another Government shutdown? Is that a crisis we should be working on day and night?  No, that is not it.  How about repeal of the special $50 billion tax break snuck into the tax bill for the tobacco industry? Does that take precedence?  No.  There is one simple thing. The House is adjourning at 4 p.m. today, a day on which we usually work late into thenight, with all its business pending, for the thing that always drives this body and is driving the majority party. Campaign finance reform will not be heard, but they will be raising money in New York.  They are going to New York. They have got corporate jets coming to pick them up. They are going to New York to raise money. We are adjourning early today and the people's business will not be done so they can go to a $10,000 a plate fund raiser.                          ____________________
