  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there is one more amendment which we expect will be agreed to by voice vote. We have been working on it all day. It is about to miraculously appear from back in the Cloakroom. It is related to the Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute.  I say to my colleagues, we will be able to agree to that shortly, we believe on a voice vote.
