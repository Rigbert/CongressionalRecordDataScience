President, today I would like to pay tribute to a constituent from Illinois, John F. Garde. Mr. Garde will soon be retiring as the Executive Director of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, AANA, after 17 years of service. I am very pleased to honor the distinguished career of John F. Garde for his contributions to the practice of anesthesia from my state of Illinois.  The AANA is the professional association that represents over 27,000 practicing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Founded in 1931, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists is the professional association representing CRNAs nationwide. As you may know, CRNAs administer more than 65 percent of the anesthetics given to patients each year in the United States. CRNAs provide anesthetics for all types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia provider in two-thirds of all rural hospitals, affording these medical facilities obstetrical, surgical and trauma stablization capabilities. They work in every setting in which anesthesia is delivered including hospital surgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical centers, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, and plastic surgeons.  John received his anesthesia training in 1957 from St. Francis Hospital School of Anesthesia in LaCrosse, WI and began practicing at the U.S. Public Health Hospital in Detroit, Michigan the following year. Having been a provider of anesthesia for numerous years he became an Associate Professor and Chairman of the Department of Anesthesia at Wayne State University, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health in 1975. Using this experience, he then became the Education Director of the AANA in Park Ridge, IL in 1980 before taking his current role as Executive Director in 1983. He accolades range from propelling nurse anesthesia programs into a graduate framework resulting in 50 per cent of them moving into the College of Nursing, as well as establishing the International Federation of Nurse Anesthetists (IFNA) during his tenure with the AANA. John has served the AANA as a member, board member, past president, and now will be retiring as a very celebrated executive director among his peers.  Mr. Garde has many honors to follow his list of career accomplishments. John was inducted as a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing in 1994. In 1999 the Association of Chicagoland recognized him for his outstanding contributions to the Association community, presenting him with the John C. Thiel Distinguished Service Award.  I ask my colleagues to join me today in recognizing Mr. John F. Garde, CRNA, MS, FAAN, for his notable career and outstanding achievements.                          ____________________
