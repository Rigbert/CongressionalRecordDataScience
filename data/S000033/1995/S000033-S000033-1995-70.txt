 Chairman, I would just make the point that in the State of Vermont, in the last 3 years we have had four instances, four instances where contracts were made with companies in Vermont but the products were produced abroad. So the gentleman is beginning to touch upon an issue of enormous consequence.  I had an amendment which I am going to withdraw, but I would hope that we can work together to demand, wherever possible, and I think it is a lot more possible than people think, that if we are going to spend American taxpayers' money for defense equipment, for God's sakes, let us have this work done in America and put American workers to work to do that.                              {time}  1530
