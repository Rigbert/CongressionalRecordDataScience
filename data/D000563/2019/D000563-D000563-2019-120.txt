President, on September 29, Thomas Owens of Chicago passed away, leaving a legacy of faith, philanthropy, and friendship. He was an innovator and an advocate for helping people. Tom was dedicated to the biblical proverb, ``To whom much is given, much is expected.''  Tom used to joke that he entered philanthropic ventures because he spent too much time hovering around the kitchen with his wife, Mary. In truth, he just believed in helping those less fortunate. Tom and Mary founded the Owens Foundation in 1985, inspired by the work of Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta. Tom and Mary enjoyed a friendship with Mother Teresa and were instrumental in supporting Missionary of Charity projects in Chicago, Arizona, and Tijuana, Mexico, to alleviate poverty and provide hope to those in need.  In the early 1990s, Tom retired from a successful business and having spent 20 years as an IBM executive. Many people would have considered slowing down after that, but not Tom. That same year he retired, he founded Cara Chicago.  Tom started Cara out of the back of his car. He drove shelter to shelter, connecting women with business colleagues and contacts he had accumulated over the years. Nearly 30 years later, Cara is a world-class job training and placement program, helping more than 6,000 people into more than 10,000 jobs.  Cara is the Gaelic word for friend, and this program helps give people a professional friend when they need it most.  Tom earned numerous awards like being one of the Streetwise Foundation's 20 Most Inspirational Chicagoans. He also was Leo High School's Lifetime Achievement Award winner in 2018. Leo High School's motto is Facta non Verba, meaning Deeds not Words. Tom's work as one of the most caring people I have known speaks for itself.  Tom liked to say, ``Don't just make it a good day . . . make it a great day!'' Many people have great days because of his work.  Tom is survived by his wife, five children, 22 grandchildren, and the thousands of people who have better days because of Tom.                          ____________________
