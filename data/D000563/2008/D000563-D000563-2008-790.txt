BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could respond to my colleague through the Chair, again in my limited background--I have actually taught agricultural law and written a book on it. It is not very good. I doubt my colleague has read it. I would recommend this chapter of it for him if he wishes to read it.  In the provisions that were done at that time before either of us were in the Senate, what you were doing was taking business bankruptcy reorganizations and allowing for farm application because it was a different business type of setting that was taking place. It did introduce risks that are even still factored in today, because this is a provision that is allowed within it.  Now, as I mentioned earlier, over a period of time as markets get adjusted to these, they say: Well, OK, this factor is only going to happen in this series of cases. Or they looked at lower end income clients and they said this is a more likely situation where we are going to see this taking place. Therefore, we are not going to loan to this guy, or it only goes to a bank that is willing to get into a more aggressive loan position and is desirous to do it. So it does have those impacts.  But what you were doing with that chapter reorganization during the farm crisis was taking a business reorganization and allowing for the differences in agriculture which are substantial. Now you are getting into the basic housing market with this. This isn't a business reorganization; this is a housing market issue, and you are introducing the very factors I talk about--in a limited fashion; I appreciate that greatly. I think it is less harmful potentially than the original design of the Durbin amendment. I appreciate your heart on it. It is going to have an introduction of factors of uncertainty and will drive interest rates up, and it will drive lenders out in this situation. That is what will happen. I don't think we should go that route.
