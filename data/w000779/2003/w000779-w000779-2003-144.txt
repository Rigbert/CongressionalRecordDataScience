President, the Senator from New Hampshire is being very gracious. On the basis of his statement that he would work with me on it--what the Senator from New Hampshire and Senator Schumer have accomplished is very important. I reiterate how important it be done at this time. It is one thing when drugs are developed with private sector money. It is a free enterprise system. Fortunately, investors take risks. There are some gushers, some that are not profitable. It is a different story when the drugs get to market with taxpayer money. Here we have the largest selling cancer drug in history.  It is imperative over the next day or so we work in a bipartisan way. The National Institutes of Health does phenomenal work. I don't want to do anything to impede their mission in getting drugs to market quickly. That is their first and foremost obligation. But let us also make sure when they sit down and enter into these agreements, they also try to make sure the drugs are affordable. It is one thing to get the drugs on the shelf, and it is another to not have the patients able to afford them.  On the basis of the pledge of the Senator from New Hampshire to try to work this out with me in the next day or so in an agreeable fashion, I do not intend to object. I want to see the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from New York go forward. I will work with the Senator from New Hampshire when he completes this important amendment.  I yield the floor.
