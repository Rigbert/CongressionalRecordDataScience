 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his strong support. I think the essence of the problem that we have as serious legislators is that we are confronting a budget which in many ways prevents us from doing the things that we have to do, and that is not the chairman's fault and it is not the ranking member's fault. But I think when we talk about priorities in the United States, in this great country, in this wealthy country, how can we not address the reality that there are senior citizens who are going to the hospital and the administrators and doctors there are telling us they are malnourished? We are wasting huge sums of money spending dollars on hospital care that could have been prevented if we would provide adequate nutrition to our senior citizens.  The same thing is true with low-income pregnant women who are giving birth to low-weight babies.  So again, I would not argue about ag research. That is important. But I think what we are asking for is taking $13 million out of an increase of $50 million to use $10 million for the expansion of this commodities program.
