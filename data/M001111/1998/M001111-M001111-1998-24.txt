 President, I stand before the Senate today to fight for the men of our country. I am referring to the cancer that has been most frequently diagnosed, in the last decade, in American men--prostate cancer. This cancer kills 40,000 American men every year and I am shocked we are even hesitating to appropriate the necessary funding to enable the Department of Defense to win this battle and find a cure.  I realize that I often find myself in this same place, fighting for women's health. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have consistently fought to provide the necessary funding for breast cancer research. Just this year, I offered an amendment to the DoD authorization bill that appropriated $175 million for the Breast Cancer Research Program. However, this is a critical time to invest in medical research, all medical research, including prostate cancer.  Mr. President, we need to fight for the lives of our husbands, brothers, sons, fathers, and grandfathers of America, as well as their families. Death from cancer is tragic yet even more so knowing that we are on the verge of finding a cure. I have been very pleased with the results of breast cancer research and I know that if we gave the DoD adequate funding, it would produce equally impressive results saving thousands of men who would have otherwise not survived this ravaging disease. I believe we have the science and technology to put an end to unnecessary prostate cancer fatalities.  I am fully confident that our medical community can step up and find a cure for prostate cancer. However, it is the duty of my colleagues and I to provide medical researchers the resources they need to do so. Now is the time to have faith in our scientific community and stand behind the DoD. President Clinton got the ball rolling when he fundedthe first cycle of prostate cancer research grants. However, this is not enough. If the DoD is to maintain its program at its current level, it requires an appropriation in FY99 of $80 million. There is no question in my mind what we need to do.  It is a stark reality that one in every six American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime. Most victims of this disease are over the age of 65. Upon entering the Senate, I requested to be put on the Veterans Committee to ensure the veterans of Washington state were getting the recognition and benefits to which they are entitled. Many of the men suffering from prostate cancer are veterans. They fought for our country and our freedom. It is time we returned the favor and find the cure to a disease that threatens them all.  Now is the time to tackle prostate cancer with equal vigor as breast cancer. This is not about decreasing statistics, but is about preventing American families from having to deal with this fatal disease. We must act now. To postpone this essential decision is unacceptable. We must have faith in our medical community and allow them to find the cure.                          ____________________
