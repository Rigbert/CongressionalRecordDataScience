Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research & Information Act of 1999. This legislation will provide California's 6,000 avocado growers--who produce all of the Hass avocados in the United States--with a new self-help mechanism to enhance their national marketing efforts.  The Hass Avocado Promotion Act will allow avocado growers to fund and operate a coordinated marketing effort to expand domestic and foreign markets. The maintenance and expansion of existing markets, and the development of new markets, is critical to preserving and strengthening the economic viability of the domestic Hass avocado industry.  This legislation will not be funded by taxpayer dollars--the bill would simply create a mechanism for Hass avocado growers to assess themselves. In addition, importers of Hass avocados into the United States would be assessed. Thus, importers would pay their fair share in helping to expand the consumer market that they share with domestic growers. At present, the national marketing of avocados is paid entirely by California avocado growers through assessments collected by the California Avocado Commission. Therefore, this bill offers a win-win proposition for domestic growers and importers to work together to increase the market for avocados and avocado products.  The bill contains an up-front referendum, giving avocado growers a voting process to formally decide whether to implement this new national promotion program. In this referendum, growers and importers will determine whether or not they choose to assess themselves 2.5 cents per pound to fund a national promotion program. The funds generated will be administered by an 11-member Hass Avocado Board that would be comprised of domestic grower and importer representatives.  I am happy to offer this bipartisan legislation, with my colleague from the Agriculture Committee, Representative Condit, aimed at helping our Hass avocado producers and importers help themselves.  I ask my colleagues for their support in advancing this vital legislation for Hass avocado growers and California agriculture.                          ____________________
