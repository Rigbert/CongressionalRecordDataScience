Chairman, I thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran), for yielding me this time, and I want to thank him for his cooperative efforts and leadership on this bill, and also the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Taylor), who is an historian of the House as well, for their very gracious accommodation to so many of the needs of our Chamber and of this House.  I want to use this opportunity as a member of the committee to thank all the personnel, especially over the last several months when there has been additional pressure on our officers and all of the House staff, for the tremendous cooperation and the patriotism that they have demonstrated. We have the public coming back into our Chambers now, there is security beyond what we had before. We have to do this for the moment, but we want to thank all of them for their dedication to our country and the cause of liberty.  I also want to say that in this bill we have funds, obviously, for the Congressional Research Service and the Library of Congress, two of the most distinguished organizations in the world for the assembly of the documents, materials, and analysis that represent us as a free people. Without question, the Library of Congress is the finest library in the world, and we hope that we will make it even better with the appropriations in this bill.  In addition to that, we appreciate the openness of the head librarian, Dr. Billington, in looking at ethnic museums across our country and their respective archives and trying to bring those into some sort of coordinated affiliation with the Library of Congress where those types of affiliations are sought.  We also want to thank Ranking Member Moran and Chairman Taylor for including report language dealing with enhancing our capability as the chief legislative body for our country through expanded televideo conferencing, where we can conference withour colleagues in parliaments around the world. Would that not be a contributor to peace? Would it not be great if we could do that in many places in the Middle East right now? We hope that by expanding these facilities and getting recommendations through the report language that is in here that we will leave those who follow us here in better condition than we found the institution when we arrived.                              {time}  1445  Also regarding the renumbering of the offices in all of these buildings, so important to helping the general public find their way around, we want to see a report on that.  And the continuing efforts to bring the works of artists to represent the contributions of women to American life in this Capitol so that all of our society can see that they made a contribution. This has a real place in our bill.  I thank the Capitol Police. We do not have a provision here in the bill, but we met with them regarding alternative fuel vehicles. We thank them for their leadership in assuring that the new purchases of vehicles will help us move this branch, and indeed our whole country, to a noncarbon-based future, and hopefully moving us to a carbohydrate-based future.  In closing, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran) and the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Taylor) for their cooperation in helping us build an even better legislative branch for our country.
