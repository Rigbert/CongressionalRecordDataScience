President, following my remarks and the remarks of Senator McConnell, if he chooses to make any, the Senate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 3044, the Consumer-First Energy Act. As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today. Senators should be prepared to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 3044 tomorrow prior to the caucus luncheons.                          ____________________
