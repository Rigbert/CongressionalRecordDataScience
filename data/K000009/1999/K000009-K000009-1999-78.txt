Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I want to rise in strong support of the gentlewoman's amendment and her efforts to protect our consumers. Without question, food safety has to be a number one priority and responsibility of this committee. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association has been promoting this for a number of years. Why should not foreign meat imported into this country adhere to the same rigorous standards that our livestock producers here at home must meet?  Last year we know the Department, I think the gentlewoman referenced, allowed $3 billion, with a B, pounds of meat and poultry to be imported from 32 foreign countries on to our shores. This amendment simply requires USDA to enforce our food safety laws and protect our consumers.  I just want to make sure that the letter from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association is entered into the Record as part of this amendment, and I rise in strong support of the gentlewoman's amendment.                                              National Cattlemen's                                             Beef Association,                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 1999.     Hon. Carrie P. Meek,     House of Representatives, Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Rep. Meek: On behalf of the members of the National      Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), I wanted to inform you      that NCBA supports the language on inspection equivalency you      plan to offer to the FY 2000 House Agriculture Appropriations      measure. We appreciate your staff reviewing the proposed      amendment with us.       NCBA strongly supports measures that work, through sound      science, to ensure the safety and wholesomeness of the U.S.      food supply. In addition, we are constantly engaged in trade      discussions and disputes with other countries who use the      ``equivalency'' issue as a barrier to U.S. beef and other      livestock products. Your proposed amendment certainly would      reiterate the Secretary of Agriculture's important role in      making sure that any beef, other meat, or poultry products      imported into the United States adhere to the same rigorous      standards that America's cattlemen and women, and other      livestock producers meet.       Thank you for your leadership on this matter. We look      forward to its successful inclusion in the Agriculture      Appropriations package. Please let us know if we can be of      assistance in this effort.           Sincerely,                                                Dale W. Moore,                                               Executive Director,                                              Legislative Affairs.
