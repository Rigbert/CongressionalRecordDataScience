President, S. 2222 would privatize 12,000 acres of Tongass National Forest land in Berners Bay, a popular recreation area for residents of Juneau, Alaska. The two corporations--Sealaska and Cape Fox Corporations--that would receive title to the National Forest lands have a history of closing public access to their lands and heavily logging them. Most of the logs have been exported directly to Asia without any domestic processing. The provisions for old-growth reserves in the reported version of S. 2222 offer little protection. The vast majority of old-growth forest on the newly privatized National Forest lands could still be heavily logged and the logs shipped straight to Asia with no domestic manufacturing.  Trading land to two Native corporations is not the only reason proponents so desperately wanted this bill to move this year though. The bill will also make it much easier for a mining corporation to open a gold mine adjacent to the national forest land being traded. The proposed Kensington mine is currently permitted to store its mine tailings on its own land. But the mine wants to reduce its operating costs by instead dumping its mine tailings in a pristine lake that conveniently is within the 12,000 acres being traded. EPA and the State of Alaska have written opinions suggesting that dumping tailings in this lake is likely illegal under the Clean Water Act.  The potential environmental impact of the mine tailings dump and logging operation on the land will have long-term effects on an extremely rich salmon producing area. Berners Bay also contains abundant wildlife, such as wolves and brown and black bears that will be impacted by the increased activity in the area and water pollution generated by the mine and logging operations. By privatizing the land, the public will have little knowledge or say in how the mine and logging operations affect the recreational, hunting, fishing and ecological values of the bay.  The fishing and tourism industries, both key to Southeast Alaska, will be largely shut out of any oversight of the operations even though it will likely have a direct impact on their financial well-being.  The environmental and economic concerns about these land exchanges should raise enough red flags to demand much greater scrutiny from this body. On top of that, these bills also raise serious questions about the cost to taxpayers nationally of privatizing our public resources. In return for the 12,000 acres transferred to Cape Fox, taxpayers would get 3,000 acres of largely clearcut private lands and certain subsurface rights. There is no safeguard in the bill allowing the public to actually have a say in whether this is a good, or even fair, deal for taxpayers. The University of Alaska land exchange would turn over at least 250,000 acres of federal lands without a public process for approving or rejecting which lands actually get transferred. Instead, it is solely left to the Secretary of the Interior to decide.  Again, these two bills are troubling enough on their own because of their environmental and economic impacts. However, the idea of trading away public lands with little or no public inputand no economic or environmental analysis is even more troubling. Over the years, our federal agencies and this body have done an admirable job of protecting these lands for the public, not for private interests. We should not start reversing that record now.                          ____________________
