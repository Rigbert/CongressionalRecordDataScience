 President, last night we started debate on the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Last night, in addition to the economic factors involved in the approving of this bill, I spoke about the national security importance of this Central American Free Trade Agreement. I also talked--as, obviously, we do on most trade legislation--about the benefits of the agreement to the U.S. economy in general. This morning, I will focus on the benefits of this agreement for U.S. agriculture.  As a Senator from Iowa and as a person who lives on and has an interest in a family farm my son operates, I have major interest in the U.S. agricultural policies that benefit American farmers. Moreover, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I pay particularly close attention to trade issues as they affect agriculture.  I consulted frequently with the U.S. Trade Representative during negotiations on this agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement. I do that because that is the responsibility my committee has under trade promotion authority, which is a process by which Congress delegates the process of our carrying out our constitutional responsibility of control over international trade to the President to negotiate because it is quite impractical for 535 Members of Congress to negotiate with foreign countries.  U.S. negotiators went to great lengths to see that the Central American Free Trade Agreement would be a good agreement for American farmers. Their efforts were successful. The negotiations resulted in an agreement that is particularly strong for U.S. agriculture and the agribusiness community that affects so many nonfarm jobs throughout the United States.  I am fully convinced that implementation of this Central American Free Trade Agreement by the United States is in the best interests of U.S. agricultural producers. That is why I go to great lengths urging my colleagues to support it.  U.S. farmers and ranchers are well aware of the fact that the international playing field for agricultural exports is presently far from level. Average tariffs of other countries on imports of U.S. agricultural products in the case of most commodities is significantly higher than those imposed by the United States. That worldwide average would be 60-some percent of tariffs of U.S. agricultural products going into another country, whereas those same countries throughout the world bringing products into the United States face an average of only an 11-percent tariff.  It is common sense to negotiate other countries' tariffs against our agricultural products down some or a lot and hopefully down to a point where we are in a win-win situation for American agriculture and the nonfarm jobs involved in the processing and handling of agricultural products. That is our long-term goal. In fact, that is the goal we have right now in the Doha round World Trade Organization negotiations going on this year. That is for the entire 150 countries that are members of the World Trade Organization. We hope that Doha round is a major breakthrough for the reduction of high worldwide tariffs against agricultural products.  Now, as this unequal situation I just described has clearly demonstrated, and specifically in this trade relationship we have between the UnitedStates and these five countries of Central America, over 99 percent of agricultural products from Central American countries coming to the United States currently come in here not with an 11-percent average tariff I talked about worldwide, they come in with hardly any duty--except for an occasional product--and are duty free right now. That is unfair to American farmers.  When we send products down there, the average bound tariff of these five Central American countries is over 44 percent. The current trading relationship between the United States and the CAFTA countries is not only an unlevel playing field but also a one-way street. CAFTA farm products do not pay tolls to enter the U.S. market today. Yet U.S. agricultural products are charged hefty tolls to enter the markets of these five countries. This is all going to be changed by the Central American Free Trade Agreement. A downhill one-way street will become a level two-lane road.  Under the agreement, the CAFTA countries will eliminate tariffs on virtually all products. U.S. tariffs will remain largely unchanged. After all, the vast majority of agricultural products of the CAFTA countries already enters the United States duty free. For example, the treatment under the agreement of the four major U.S. commodities--pork, beef, corn, and soybeans--demonstrates how the Central American Free Trade Agreement will remove disadvantages faced by U.S. agricultural producers. These commodities are of importance not only to my State of Iowa but to most agricultural States in our country.  The Central American Free Trade Agreement countries currently apply tariffs of up to 47 percent on imports of U.S. pork. Their bound rates reach as high as 60 percent. Under the agreement, these tariffs of the Central American countries will be reduced to zero.  With beef, they apply tariffs of up to 30 percent on imports of U.S. beef. Their bound rates reach as high as 79 percent. Under CAFTA, these tariffs of the Central American countries will be reduced for our U.S. farmers to zero.  The CAFTA countries currently apply tariffs of up to 45 percent on imports of U.S. corn. Their bound rates reach as high as 75 percent. Under the agreement, tariffs of CAFTA countries on corn, the predominant product we export, will be reduced to zero, with the exception of the Dominican Republic, in which case duty-free access will be locked in.  Soybeans is another example. CAFTA countries currently apply tariffs up to 5 percent on imports of our soybeans and up to 20 percent on U.S. soybean oil. Their bound rates reach as high as 91 percent for soybeans, 60 percent for bean meal, and 232 percent for the soybean oil. Under the agreement, tariffs of the CAFTA countries on U.S. soybeans, bean meal, and soybean oil will be reduced to zero.  The leveling of the playing field with regard to CAFTA countries will result in real gains for U.S. agriculture. According to the Farm Bureau Federation, CAFTA would increase U.S. agricultural exports to those countries by $1.5 billion at the end of the full implementation. CAFTA will result in dollars in the pockets of U.S. farmers and ranchers.  Recognizing that CAFTA will profit their members, numerous agriculture and food organizations have expressed their support for this agreement. I have a letter from 73 such groups that back the agreement. These organizations represent diverse commodities produced in the area regions including among the 73 the Farm Bureau Federation, Soybean Association, Chicken Council, Corn Growers, Milk Producers, Pork Producers, Potato Council, Turkey Federation, Rice Federation.  Moreover, six former U.S. Secretaries of Agriculture, both Republican and Democrat, have announced their support for the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Let me read those: Ann Veneman, Republican; Dan Glickman, a Democrat; Mike Espy, Democrat; Clayton Yeutter, Republican; John Block, Republican; Bob Bergland, Democrat. They all noted in a recent letter to Congress that they back CAFTA ``because the benefits are very significant and the costs are minimal.''  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Letter From Former Secretaries of Agriculture to Members of the U.S.               House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate       Dear Member of Congress: As former secretaries of      agriculture, we understand the importance of negotiating      trade deals that minimize the costs and maximize the benefits      to U.S. farmers, ranchers, and food and agriculture      organizations. We support the Free Trade Agreement with      Central America and the Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR) because      the benefits are very significant and the costs are minimal.      We urge you to pass CAFTA-DR quickly and without amendment.       A vote for CAFTA-DR is a vote for fairness and for      reciprocal market access. Under CAFTA-DR all of our food and      farm products will receive duty free treatment when the      agreement is fully implemented.       A vote against CAFTA-DR is a vote for one-way trade.      Virtually all of what we import from the six CAFTA countries      now enters the U.S. duty free as a result of the Generalized      System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin      Initiative (CBI). Yet, our food and agricultural exports to      these six nations are restricted significantly because of      high tariffs. As a result of the current one-way trade deal,      we are running an agricultural trade deficit with these six      countries.       In addition, a formal trade agreement with the United      States will help ensure the economic stability and growth      that the region needs to avoid a return to the civil wars,      insurgencies, and dictatorships of the recent past. As      economic freedom and democracy take deeper root, incomes will      increase and demand for our food and agriculture products      will expand.       Failure to approve CAFTA-DR will have a devastating effect      on U.S. efforts to negotiate trade agreements on behalf of      U.S. agriculture. The World Trade Organization Doha      Development Round would be dealt a serious blow. Other      countries would be less willing to negotiate with the United      States knowing that CAFTA-DR, a trade agreement so clearly      beneficial to U.S. interests, could be rejected by the U.S.      Congress.       The future of American agriculture continues to lay in      expanding opportunities for our exports in the global      marketplace, where 96 percent of the world's population      lives. We must not forego these opportunities, especially      when the benefits to our nation are so unmistakable.     Ann M. Veneman.     Dan Glickman.     Mike Espy.     Clayton Yeutter.
