Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4417) to modify certain deadlines pertaining to machine-readable, tamper-resistant entry and exit documents.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4417       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEADLINES FOR MACHINE-                   READABLE, TAMPER-RESISTANT ENTRY AND EXIT                    DOCUMENTS.       Section 303 of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry      Reform Act of 2002 (8 U.S.C. 1732) is amended, in each of      subjections (b)(2)(A), (c)(1), and (c)(2), by striking      ``2004,'' and inserting ``2005,''.
