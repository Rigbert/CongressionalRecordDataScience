President, I appreciate the compliment of the Senator from Alabama. I have spent 31 years in the Senate. I take my role in the Senate very seriously. I believe we should be the conscience of the Nation. As I have said many times, only 18 people get to publicly ask questions of the Supreme Court nominees.
