Chairman, I too rise in strong support of this legislation and in praise of the leaders of the committee and the fine staff.  The educational needs of our youth indeed have changed since 1917, which was when the Federal Government first began to support vocational education. Today, still, vocational-technical education programs fill a very critical need.  As my colleague from Delaware indicated, the programs prepare 75 percent of American youths who do not complete a 4-year degree for jobs requiring advanced training and knowledge. The programs demand a strong background in math and science, as they should, and students have to be prepared for the technical and competitive jobs that exist today.  I know this because I have frequently visited with students and teachers and wonderful facilities throughout my district who use and support these programs, and they strongly support it. The bill before us today builds on that success. It encourages stronger academics, greater opportunities for use after high school and targets more dollars to the classroom. In fact, 90 percent of the Federal dollars will be sent to the local level under this bill, and that is how it should be.  Finally, I am also pleased that the bill preserves the strength of the very popular tech prep program. In southwest Michigan this program has quickly become an integral part of students' learning experience.  Our businesses today are rightly demanding a better prepared work force. This bill helps in a major way, and I urge all members to support H.R. 1853.
