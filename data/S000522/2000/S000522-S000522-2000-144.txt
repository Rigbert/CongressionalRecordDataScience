Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Act which will abolish the unfair marriage tax penalty by raising the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly so that it is equal to twice the standard deduction for single fliers. It also expands the lowest tax bracket at fifteen percent to twice that of single filers.  If you vote ``yes'' to eliminate the marriage tax penalty, fifty million married taxpayers will gain from doubling the standard deduction, and six million senior citizens will benefit from this provision. Another six million taxpayers will no longer have to itemize, which greatly simplifies the tax process, and taxpayers will save $66.2 billion over ten years.  On the other hand, if you vote ``no,'' you will be taking an average of $1,400 out of the pockets and bank accounts of our nation's hardworking families.  If you vote ``no,'' you will be rejecting legislation that benefits the middle class, particularly women. Not only do women early just 74% of what men earn, but under the marriage tax penalty, the second wage earner is taxed at a higher rate. This is the ultimate double-whammy.  If you vote ``no,'' you will singlehandedly take much needed tax relief away from more than 61,000 couples in my district and almost 1 million couples in my state who already pay more than their fair share of taxes--just because they are married.  And finally, if you vote ``no,'' you will send a clear message to our nation's children--that the sanctity of marriage is not to be respected--it instead is to be taxed by Uncle Sam.  Do not punish couples because they have found happiness, have made a lasting commitment to each other, and have gotten married. Cast your vote for the American family today and vote to help do away with the marriage tax penalty.
