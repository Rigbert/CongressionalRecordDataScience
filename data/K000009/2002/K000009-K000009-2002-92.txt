Speaker, it is with great sadness that I rise to recognize the passing from this life of Dr. Benjamin Reed, Physician Emeritus of Fulton County, Ohio. Dr. Reed joined our Creator on August 13, 2002 at the age of 80 years.  Born in West Virginia, Dr. Reed's grandfather was a country doctor, visiting his patients by horse and buggy. After receiving a teaching degree from Concord College in his hometown of Athens, Dr. Reed entered the United States Army. He served in the Pacific Theatre for three years, receiving both the Purple Heart Award and a bronze star. After his discharge he went to medical school, completing, his medical degree in 1950. He then decided to open his practice in Fulton County, serving as Delta's doctor for 46 years! He even managed a two year stint as the village's mayor. Moving to Wauseon in 1974, Dr. Reed served as the medical director of three Fulton County nursing homes while continuing his Delta family practice.  In addition to his medical service to the people of Fulton County, Dr. Reed was a community leader. He was past president of the Fulton County Health Center's medical staff, where he served on the Board of Directors for eighteen years. He was a past president of both the Fulton County and Northwest Ohio Heart Associations; a member of both the Delta and Wauseon Chambers of Commerce; president of the Fulton County Medical Society and member of the Toledo Lucas County Academy of Medicine, the Ohio State Medical Association, the American Medical Association, and the Peer Review Organization in addition to volunteering in several other health related programs. All the while, he served Fulton County as coroner for 38 years.  If the measure of a man is the goodwill of his community, then Dr. Reed was peerless. A physician in the purest sense of the word, he was also a humanitarian, civic-minded, and a man of faith. He was well known and beloved by everyone, and his life touched countless people through the years. Those whom he met were made better for having known him.  Our condolences turn now to his wife Penny and their children David, Tom, and Nancy, and grandchildren Peter and Molly. May their love for this truly great yet humble man sustain them in their loss while memories offer some small comfort. May it hearten those grieving Dr. Reed's passing to know that the legacy he carefully built over nearly half a century will go on.                          ____________________
