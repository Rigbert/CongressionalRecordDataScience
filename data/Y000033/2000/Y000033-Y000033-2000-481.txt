Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment which increases the funding levels in the bill from $10 million to $14 million for true administration expenses, but also assumes a transition period that reduces the number of program administrators from 120 to 100 over a period of 3 years, and then it adjusts upward thereafter based on the Consumer Price Index.  This amendment makes other technical changes to make sure the bill conforms with the Pittman-Robertson Dingell-Johnson Acts that we are not omitting at this time.  Mr. Chairman, I would suggest respectfully that this should answer the concerns of the gentleman from California about not having enough money. It raises the expenses, at least $5 million more. That is $19 million total. In 3 years, we drop the participation of the administrators from 120 to 100. Then if they need more after that, it will ratchet back up if necessary.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of the amendment.
