President. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question.  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Washington State for their terrific, truly extraordinary leadership on this entire bill.  As the Senator from New Hampshire knows, the issue of whether or not Straight A's authorizes Federal funds for private school vouchers was most important to me. I have worked with him and with the Senator from Washington. Indeed, I am the author of the provisions in the Gorton amendment which makes it crystal clear that Federal funds could not be used for vouchers under the Straight A's proposal.  Will the Senator from New Hampshire agree with me that while there is nothing in this legislation that prohibits a State from using also its own funds for some sort of voucher proposal, that the Gorton amendment now makes clear that Federal funds under the Straight A's proposal could not be used for private school vouchers?
