Speaker, today I am introducing H.R. 2019, with Representatives Barton, DeLay, Cox, Hinchey, Kingston, Furse, Pallone, Norton, Owens, Smith (NJ), Lipinski, Velazquez, Evans, Dellums, Deutsch, Frazer, and Hilliard, the Access to Medical Treatment Act. This legislation will allow greater freedom of choice in the realm of medical treatments by making alternative treatments more accessible to the public.  The Access to Medical Treatment Act represents a significant departure from the current paternalistic practice of medicine. It is based on two beliefs about our current health care system: First, the system limits patients' choices of medical treatments to conventional modalities; and second, the system effectively discourages the development of alternative therapies that could help treat illnesses that often are unresponsive to conventional medicine. This act opens up the health care system and market, under controlled conditions, to informed consumers.  There is a compelling need for this legislation. Health care reform requires more than just access to conventional treatments. Real reform examines the fundamental premise and framework of our current medical system. As we confront escalating medical costs and struggle to contain Medicare and Medicaid spending, alternative medicine provides some affordable, less invasive, and effective answers, especially in the areas of long term and chronic illnesses.  Canada, Germany, France, and other G-7 and EEC countries know the value of alternative medicine. In fact, many of these countries view alternatives as traditional and essential to their health care systems. The lessons learned abroad show that alternatives can be successfully incorporated into mainstream medicine. It's time that we shift our health care paradigm from a model of disease maintenance to one of wellness, prevention, and holistic care.  The New England Journal of Medicine reported in January 1993, that more than one-third of Americans used alternative, nonconventional medical treatments. Many Americans, suffering from chronic, debilitating, and life-threatening illnesses, are turning to alternative medical treatments.  Unfortunately, our current health care system effectively eliminates access to nonharmful alternative medical treatments that may help patients, complement conventional treatments, contain costs, and generate new approaches to treating illness. Thousands of individuals abroad have legal access to these treatments.  In an effort to protect the public, the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] has effectively restricted the proliferation of alternative therapies. Only large pharmaceutical companies can afford the time and expense--over $100 million--currently required to gain FDA approval of a treatment. The FDA's process effectively excludes potentially innovative contributions by individual practitioners, scientists and smaller companies. Many alternative treatments are combinations of natural products; thus, they are ineligible for patents. Without a patent, companies cannot recover the investment needed for the FDA approval process.  I have met many doctors who could better treat their patients with this legislation and many patients who desperately want more treatments available to them. Former Congressman Berkley Bedell knows firsthand the importance of this legislation and served as a catalyst for its development. Former Congressman Bedell used a treatment that was nothing more than the processed whey of cow's milk to treat his Lyme's disease when costly conventional methods failed. After 2 months of taking regular doses of this processed whey, his symptoms disappeared. He estimates that the total cost for this alternative treatment was no more than a few hundred dollars. He credits this inexpensive treatment for his recovery. Unfortunately, this and many other safe alternative treatments are not available to the public because they have not passed the FDA approval.  Mr. Speaker, there are Berkley Bedells all across our country who are desperate for cures that conventional medicine simply does not seem to effectively provide. The Access to Medical Treatment Act gives patients the right to obtain nonharmful alternative treatments that have not been approved by the FDA from state authorized medical providers. The intent of this bill is merely to extend freedom of choice to medical consumers under controlled situations and grant individuals access to alternative treatments that are currently offlimits. Practitioners who now use alternative, nonharmful treatments risk losing their licenses for trying to help their patients with unconventional treatments.  As with any effort to challenge the status quo there is skepticism about the implications of opening up the market to alternative treatments. We have worked hard to develop a bill that gives patients and their health care practitioners the freedom necessary to treat their illnesses while including the protections necessary to safeguard consumers from dangerous treatments and unqualified practitioners.  It is not my intention to dismantle the FDA or to weaken its authority to regulate the safety and efficacy of most drugs in this country. This legislation does not attack the FDA for the valuable role it plays in helping America maintain a topnotch, high-quality health care system. Unfortunately, the expensive and extensive FDA approval process does prevent low-cost, alternative treatments from gaining access to the market.  The FDA would remain solely responsible for protecting the health of the Nation from unsafe and impure drugs. Before a treatment receives the Government's stamp of approval and has a claim of efficacy attached, it must make it through the FDA approval process.  This bill requires full disclosure to patients of the contents and possible side effects of treatments. In addition, the strict claims section in this bill mandates that patients are notified that the drug has not been proven safe or efficacious by the Federal Government.  The medical treatments prescribed must have no evidence of causing an adverse impact on individuals' health. However, if any treatment is found to cause harm, the treatment must be immediately reported to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and then any practitioner who continues use of the treatment is not covered under this act.  Finally, the greatest concern expressed about this proposal is the issue of consumer protection. This is an essential part of this legislation and I, as much as anyone, want to protect sick and vulnerable individuals from negligent charlatans who would prey on their misfortunes and fears for personal gain. The Access to Medical Treatment Act is armed with these protections.  In order to protect consumers, this bill limits those qualified to administer treatments to State authorized medical providers who are working within their scope of practice. Most importantly, the bill strictly regulates the circumstances under which claims regarding the efficacy of a treatment can be made. It prohibits all advertising and labeling claims and any other claims by individuals for whom the underlying intent of promoting the treatment might be linked to personal financial gain.  There can be no marketing of any treatment administered under this bill. This eliminates the incentive for anyone to attempt to use this bill as a bypass to the process of obtaining FDA approval.  I want to protect consumer safety, but I also want to promote consumer freedom of choice. Individuals, especially those facing life threatening and debilitating illness, should have the option of trying alternative treatments so long as they are informed of possible side effects and there is no evidence that the treatment is harmful. Patients must be given the keys to steer the course of their health with the assistance of trained health care providers. Permitting the administration of and access to alternative medical treatment extends freedom of choice to the realm of medicine.  Opening the health care system to alternative treatment can help patients, complement conventional treatments, contain costs, and generate new ways to treating illness. This choice is one for the consumer, not the Federal Government.                          ____________________
