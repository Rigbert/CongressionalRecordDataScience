Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and as a Member of Congress who has two Weed and Seed sites in his district in Michigan, one in Benton Harbor and one in Kalamazoo, I know very well how valuable the Weed and Seed is to the people who live there.  I commend the chairman for recognizing the value of the Weed and Seed program and recognizing that the best solutions to crime problems are customized to neighborhood needs, which is at the very core of the Weed and Seed program.  The bill before us tonight provides $33.5 million for Weed and Seed, which is the amount that was appropriated in the fiscal year 2000 bill. However, in previous years, the Department of Justice was permitted to reprogram other funds to the Weed and Seed program, increasing the level of funds available to the program. For instance, in fiscal year 2000, the program received $40 million.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask if the gentleman from Kentucky might be able to give me an assurance that he will work to assure that the Weed and Seed program will receive at least as much funding in 2001 as we received in fiscal year 2000.
