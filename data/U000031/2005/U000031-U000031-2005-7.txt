Speaker, I rise too, along with all my colleagues, to congratulate our dear friend, John Dingell, on his 50 years of service as a Member of the United States House of Representatives. Today, we honor not only his work in this Congress but also his lifetime of service to his community and to his country.  Born July 8, 1926, John Dingell served as a page in this institution, served as a soldier in the United States Army, a forest ranger, and assistant Wayne County prosecutor before replacing his father as Representative from Michigan's 15th Congressional District on December 13, 1955, 50 years ago.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to insert into the Record at this point a Certificate of Proclamation from the Governor of our great State making this day Congressman John D. Dingell Day, as signed by the Governor:             State of Michigan Certificate of Proclamation       On behalf of the citizens of Michigan, I, Governor Jennifer      M. Granholm hereby proclaim December 13, 2005, as Congressman      John D. Dingell Day.       Whereas, For five decades, Congressman John D. Dingell has      worked tirelessly for the citizens of Michigan, working for      the things that matter most, including a strong manufacturing      economy, good paying jobs, a clean environment, and      healthcare for every citizen; and,       Whereas, In celebrating his 50th anniversary in Congress,      Congressman Dingell is now the third longest serving House      member in history; and,       Whereas, Over the course of his 50 years in Congress,      Congressman Dingell has cast more than 21,800 roll call      votes, served under 10 presidents, and led the House Energy      and Commerce Committee; and,       Whereas, Together, Congressman Dingell and his father have      represented the citizens of the Detroit area since the Great      Depression, a testament to the hard work and dedication the      Dingell family has in representing and advocating for the      working people of Southeast Michigan; and now therefore be      it,       Resolved, That I, Jennifer M. Granholm, Governor of      Michigan, do hereby proclaim December 13, 2005, as      Congressman John D. Dingell Day in Michigan. I thank      Congressman Dingell for being a man of integrity, a man of      the people; and most of all, I thank him for his      extraordinary commitment and service to the citizens of the      great State of Michigan.                                             Jennifer M. Granholm,                                                         Governor.  Mr. Dingell is not only a dear friend; he is an avid hunter and an outdoorsman. And maybe that is why he is such a straight shooter. In my 14 years serving on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have found that it is far better to have him on your side than having him as an adversary. But when he is, you have to beat him on the merits. Otherwise, you lose.  He has served as an expert on so many subjects that this Congress has dealt with, from telecommunications, to health care, to trade, to energy, and even little things called the Tucker Act. He may be the only Member that really knows the history of that act, which means a lot in the history of this Congress.  He shares with all of us the drive to go after fraud and abuse. In fact, I think it was my very first subcommittee meeting when he was chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, and we were grilling a guy by the name of President Kennedy. No, that is not John F. Kennedy, that was President Kennedy, the former President of Stanford, and the abuse that that university did with taxpayer money.  Mr. Speaker, the current chairman, Mr. Barton of the Energy and Commerce Committee, recently remarked at the wonderful tribute for John Dingell, that he thought that most historians would put this gentleman, Mr. Dingell, in the top ten of all the Members, Republicans and Democrats, that have ever served in this body. I would agree with Mr. Barton's assessment. It is a lot of Members, a lot of years, and we are fortunate to have someone of Mr. Dingell's caliber for the years I have served.  For some 50 years, the gentleman from Michigan can be proud, so proud knowing that he indeed made a difference for his country on the field of battle in the Army, but also in the Halls of Congress as a most distinguished and very respected Member.  He is also a Wolverine. That means he represents the University of Michigan, another proud institution, and he has always looked out for the interest of education as well in this body, whether he served on the Education Committee or not.                              {time}  2000  Mr. Speaker, I join with all of the House in recognizing a wonderful friend, a dear colleague, a great husband, and I know Debbie is here someplace watching; and I simply say, well done. Many of us look forward to serving with you for a long time yet to come, as you continue to make a difference for the people of southeast Michigan, and all of the people that live in this great country.                          ____________________
