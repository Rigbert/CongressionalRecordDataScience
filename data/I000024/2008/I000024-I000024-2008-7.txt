President, today I wish to recognize GEN Bruce Carlson, one of our most distinguished commanders who will retire from the U.S. Air Force on January 1, 2009, aftercompleting 37 years of distinguished service to our Nation.  General Carlson currently serves as the Commander of the Air Force Materiel Command--AFMC--in Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. As Commander of AFMC, General Carlson manages the command's 77,000 people in research, development, test, and evaluation while providing the acquisition management services and logistics support required to develop, procure, and sustain Air Force weapon systems. His workforce of active duty, civilian, and contractor personnel are the unsung heroes, managing an annual budget of over $56 billion, more than 40 percent of the total AF budget, and ensuring our warfighters are equipped with the best equipment in the world.  General Carlson was born in Hibbing, MN, and began his accomplished career in 1971 when he graduated as a ``Distinguished Graduate'' from the Air Force ROTC program at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. From the day he pinned on his butter bars through his four silver stars, Gen Bruce Carlson has been a leader and continues to lead and mentor airmen in the air and on the ground.  After graduating from the University of Minnesota, he went on to undergraduate pilot training at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma--a base I know well and the finest pilot training base in the U.S. His first assignment out of pilot training was in the F-4 Phantom II and then he transitioned into the OV-10 Bronco and A-10 Warthog. During his career he logged over 3,300 flying hours to include combat time in the OV-10. His work ethic and unparalleled skill resulted in his posting to positions of influence in the offices of the Secretary of the Air Force and Secretary of Defense. His skill as a pilot and a leader led to various flying assignments, including commanding the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman Air Force Base, NM, the Air Force's first stealth fighter wing.  As with every great officer, his star continued to rise as he met every promotion with dedication and integrity. Moving on to serve as the Director of Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment on the Joint Staff and finally, prior to assuming Command of AFMC, General Carlson served as the Commander, 8th Air Force, Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana and Joint Functional Component Commander for Space and Global Strike, U.S. Strategic Command, Offutt AFB, NE.  General Carlson has received several distinguished awards including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal with two oak leaf clusters, and the 2007 Order of the Sword, Air Force Materiel Command. He was also awarded master's degrees from Webster University in St. Louis, MO, and the Naval War College in Newport, RI.  In the Chief of Staff's recommendation for the Order of the Sword, General Schwarz wrote, ``General Carlson culminates a distinguished career of more than 37 years of Air Force service, with focused leadership, a selfless commitment to excellence and tireless dedication. His vision and leadership transformed Air Force Materiel Command into the preeminent provider of war-winning capabilities . . .'' I cannot agree more. In an era of persistent conflict and constrained budgets, General Carson's dedication to making sure the warfighter has what he needs to fight and win is inspiring.  I offer my sincere thanks and appreciation to Gen Bruce Carlson, his wife Vicki, and his three children, Bryan, Jani, and Scott. The strength of our airmen is in their families, and their support allowed him to dedicate 37 years of leadership and service to the men and women of the Air Force and our country. I wish him and his family well in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
