In my situation 4 or 5 years ago, I received a phone call from a collection agency in my home in Illinois saying: Durbin, we finally caught up with you. I do not know if you thought you could get by with this forever. We knew we would find you. You owe our company in Denver, CO, $2,000. I said: I have never been to your company's place in Denver, CO. I have never done business with you. It turned out to be someone using my name and my Social Security number, who had run up several thousand dollars in charges. It took several months to sort it out, but I was lucky. I sorted it out. There are some stories that have come to my office, and I am sure to the Senator's office as well, where it took years before they finally came to the bottom of it.  So I ask the Senator from Florida, for those people who were victims of identity theft, maybe a credit card where charges were run up out of sight, tell me exactly what the Senator's amendment will do to protect them in this new bankruptcy reform we are considering.
