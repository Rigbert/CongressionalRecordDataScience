 President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations on today's Executive Calendar, Calender No. 594. I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating to the nominations appear at the appropriate place in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
