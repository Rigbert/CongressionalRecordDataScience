Mr. Speaker, continuing my reservation of objection, I first heard of Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1955 when I was 15 years old growing up in rural Alabama. Three years later, in 1958, 40 years ago, I had an opportunity to meet Martin Luther King, Jr. It was the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship. He was my friend, my leader, my brother, my hero.  Martin Luther King, Jr., must be looked upon as one of the Founding Fathers of the new America. He used the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence to bring about a nonviolent revolution in America. Martin Luther King, Jr., with the use of nonviolence, had the power, the ability, and the capacity to bring the dirt and the filth from under the American rug, out of the cracks, out of the corners into the open light in order for us to deal with the problem of racism and segregation. We live in a better nation, in a better place. We are a better people because Martin Luther King, Jr., lived.  In my estimation, 30 years later, we must look upon Martin Luther King, Jr., as one of the founding fathers of the new America. He not only freed and liberated African Americans, but he freed and liberated all Americans. So it is fitting and appropriate that we pause tonight to commemorate the life and times of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
