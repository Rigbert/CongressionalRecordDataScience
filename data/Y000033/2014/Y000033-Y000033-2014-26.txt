Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Kilmer in his legislation. I am one of the few people on this floor who lived through that period of time. The reason I remembered it, I was 10 years old. My father happened to be from California--and I myself was born and raised in California--went to the local farm bureau and caused a great disturbance because they started putting Japanese into internment camps, and he actually stood up in that meeting and said, I don't see any Germans serving in internment camps.  It was an unjust thing. Not only were they interned, their property was seized. We have never had a black eye in our history of the United States such as we had during that period of time.  I just hope people in America realize it can happen again. We have to be very aware of what we actually have from people when they are under stress or when they are under, they think, attack by fellow Americans.  So, I compliment you on this legislation. I did have an individual--actually, three individuals--from Alaska that I know of that served on that island during that period of time. So again, I compliment you, Mr. Kilmer, for your work on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
