 Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see the government do regarding these concerns.  I am submitting these statements for the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.          Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives    on behalf of TOM CHICCARELLI, JOHANNES GAMBA and JAMES GREENOUGHRegarding INCREASED SPENDING FOR ARTS PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS--May 26, 2000       JAMES GREENOUGH: I would like to start off by saying my      partners and I are very happy to be here today to present our      topic. It is on art spending in schools. In experiment after      experiment educators reported of high school seniors who      follow instructions to perform a task, only about one-quarter      wrote instructions clear enough for someone else to follow      them successfully. In most instances, students left out      pertinent details or key information.       Students are currently lacking in arts education. Search      Institute and the asset approach giving children what they      need to succeed has identified building blocks of healthy      development that help young people grow up healthy, caring      and responsible. Out of 100,000 6th to 12th grade youth      surveyed, only 19 percent spend three or more hours per week      in lessons or practicing music, theater or other arts. This      is the lowest percentage of the 40 developmental assets      surveyed. It reveals the absence of arts in the nation's      schools and the need for improved fine arts programs.       With this in mind we recommend that the United States      Government institute a fine arts framework and curriculum.      The Federal Government should provide resources to schools to      encourage the development of effective fine arts programs.       The arts convey knowledge and meaning not learned through      the study of other subjects. They represent a form of      thinking and a way of knowing that is based in human      imagination and judgment. Recent statistics show of students      who have taken a fine art credit for four years score 59      points higher in verbal and 44 points higher on the math      sections of the SATs, significant increases.       Research also addresses examples of young people who are      considered classroom failures, perhaps acting out because      these students often become the high achievers in arts      learning settings. Success in the arts becomes a bridge to      learning and eventual success in other areas of learning.       The world of adult work has changed and the arts learning      experience has shown remarkable consistency with the evolving      workplace. Ideas are what matter and the ability to generate      ideas. To bring ideas to life and communicate them is what      matters to workplace success. Working in a classroom or a      studio as an artist, the young person is learning, practicing      future workplace behaviors. These quotes came from Arts Ed's      Webpage. ``Art in all its distinct forms defines in many ways      those qualities that are at the heart of education formed in      the 1990s: Creativity, perseverance, a sense of standards,      and above all striving for excellence,'' and the quote came      from Richard Reilly, U.S. Secretary of Education.                                  ____                                            Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives                 on behalf of REMEMBERANCE (REMY) HENRY               Regarding GRADUATED LICENSES--May 26, 2000       REMEMBERANCE HENRY: My name is Rememberance Henry. The      State of Vermont has passed graduated licenses for teenagers.      Last week I went to the Chelsea prom. Under this law my      girlfriend would not have been allowed to ride in a car with      me and I think this is discrimination against teenagers.      Although teens are 8 percent of the population, they account      for 15 percent of the motor vehicle accidents. This is a      disturbing statistic, but I do not think legislation that      will not allow your friends to ride in the car with me will      bring down this number. It is underage drinking and peer      pressure that cause the accidents.       We need to address this issue as a social, not a licensing      problem. We do not empower our teenagers as a society. Of      course some do go crazy and do stupid things when finally      given a license, but they are in the minority. What about the      majority of us that do not speed, do not get in accidents and      do not drink and drive?       I lost friends last winter because of peer pressure while      driving. The driver lost a dare to outrun a truck through a      traffic light. Two of my friends died because of that      accident, yet graduated licensing would not have prevented      it. The teenager had stolen the car from his parents, and      this number is reflected in the statistics. I think drunk      driving laws for all citizens of Vermont should be      restricted, not just teens.       Empower us as teens. We need more of a voice in our lives.      Making good decisions behind the wheel begins by allowing us      to make decisions within our communities. Teenagers should      sit on school boards, we should have a voice at town meetings      and should have the opportunity to practice citizenship      before we hit a magic arbitrary age.       I thank you, Representative Sanders, for empowering me for      these few minutes. I would like the legislative body of      Vermont to rethink graduated licenses.                                  ____                                            Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives              on behalf of CASEY HUIZENGA and LUCAS SMITH               Regarding SCHOOL DRESS CODE--May 26, 2000       LUCAS SMITH: Our topic is school dress codes and in our age      legality class that we have in high school we have kind of      talked about this topic quite a bit lately. We have been      talking about it quite a bit; discussing it and everything.      Casey and I both feel that we should not have dress codes      because we just think that it is better for children to wear      what they want to wear. It is kind of a statement for them to      wear their clothes. They chose them, they wear them, so I      think it is a good thing that we can chose our own clothes.       CASEY HUIZENGA: I agree with Lucas. It kind of tells us      about the person, what they wear, it expresses how they feel.      Like baggy pants, if they want to wear them, let them. And      hats and stuff.                                  ____                                            Hon. Bernard Sanders in the House of Representatives   on behalf of BRYCE JAMES, WILL W. GUSAKOV and JEREMIAH H. SPOFFORD             Regarding MARIJUANA LEGISLATION--May 26, 2000       JEREMIAH SPOFFORD: I will begin. Our group is in favor of      legalizing the cannabis plant in the United States, okay? We      have some extensive research to back it up, but pretty much      we have some main points.       Industrial hemp has an insane number of uses. It would be      very beneficial for the environment to use industrial hemp.      And marijuana as a drug is on an equal plane with alcohol, so      we do not see why it shouldn't be under the same jurisdiction      as alcohol.       WILL GUSAKOV: About industrial hemp, it is classified as      having less than point three percent THC while marijuana has      three to ten percent THC, so it is easily distinguishable. It      produces four times as much pulp per acre as trees and it has      longer fibers than cotton, so it is more easily recyclable.      Trees require decades to grow while hemp matures in about a      hundred days. And hemp helps the soil it is planted in,      instead of cotton which leaches it. There are a lot of      ecological values of hemp as an agricultural product.       BRYCE JAMES: To talk about marijuana as the drug, one of      the common myths that is presented about marijuana as a drug      is that marijuana is a gateway drug. People say that even if      marijuana itself causes minimal harm, it is a dangerous      substance because it leads to the use of harder drugs like      heroine or LSD, where the fact is that marijuana does not      cause people to use hard drugs. This is a spurious      correlation based upon the theory that presents marijuana as      being a causal explanation of statistical association with      these other drugs, that it comes about by an increase and      decrease in which drug is prevalent for the time.       Another myth brought about is that marijuana has no medical      value where it has been proved that marijuana has been shown      to be effective in reducing nausea in cancer chemotherapy,      and it also stimulates hunger in AIDS patients and reduces      interoccular pressure on people with glaucoma.       There is also evidence that marijuana reduces muscle      spasticity in patients with neurological disorders, and it      has been proven back in 1937 by the presidential      administration of the time that marijuana has no physical      addiction.                          ____________________
