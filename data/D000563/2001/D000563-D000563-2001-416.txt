President, I ask unanimous consent that the following tributes by current and former members of the Senate and House of Representatives at the memorial service for the late Senator Alan Cranston be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Memorial Tribute to Sen. Alan Cranston by Senator Max Cleland       On February 6, over 200 admirers gathered in Hart SOB 902      to pay tribute to our dear friend Alan Cranston, who left us      on the last day of the year 2000. Joining with me as sponsors      of this event were the Senators from West Virginia (Mr.      Rockefeller), California (Mrs. Feinstein and Mrs. Boxer), and      Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the former Senator from      Wyoming (Mr. Simpson). Ten members and former members spoke,      and a short film about Senator Cranston's recent activities      was shown. At the end of the program, Alan's son, Kim, spoke.      It was a memorable afternoon for all in attendance.       The Program Cover pictured Alan and his beautiful, now      seven-year old, granddaughter Evan. On the second page      appeared the following words of the Chinese poet and      philosopher Lao-Tzu, which Alan carried with him every day:     A leader is best     When people barely know     That he exists,     Less good when     They obey and acclaim him,     Worse when     They fear and despise him.     Fail to honor people     And they fail to honor you.     But of a good leader,     When his work is done,     His aim fulfilled,     They will all say,     ``We did this ourselves.''--Lao-Tzu       The program participants and sponsors were shown on the      third page as follows:       Musical Prelude: United States Army Strings.       Introductions and Closing: Judge Jonathan Steinberg.       Speakers: Senator Max Cleland, Senator Alan Simpson,      Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Diane Feinstein, Senator      Barbara Boxer, Representative G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery,      Representative John A. Anderson,     Representative George Miller, Senator John Kerrey, Senator      Maria Cantwell, and Kim Cranston.       Family in attendance: Kim Cranston, Colette Penne Cranston,      Evan Cranston, and Eleanor (R.E.) Cranston Cameron.       Event Sponsors: Senators Cleland, Simpson, Rockefeller,      Kennedy, Feinstein, and Boxer.       The back page of the program set forth Senator Cranston's      Committee assignments and the acknowledgments for the      Tribute, as follows:       Senator Cranston's 24 years of service in the United States      Senate exceeded that of any California Democratic Senator and      was the second longest tenure of any California Senator. He      was elected Democratic Whip seven times, and his service of      14 years in that position is unequaled. His Committee service      was:       1969-93: Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.       1971-73 and 1975-79: Chairman, Subcommittee on Production      and Stabilization.       1973-75: Chairman, Subcommittee on Small Businesses.       1979-85: Chairman or Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee      on Financial Institutions.       1985-87: Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on      Securities.       1987-93: Chairman, Subcommittee on Housing and Urban      Affairs.       1969-81: Committee on Labor and Public Welfare (Human      Resources).       1969-71: Chairman, Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs.       1971-73: Chairman, Subcommittee on Railroad Retirement.       1971-81: Chairman, Subcommittee on Child and Human      Development.       1981-93: Committee on Foreign Relations.       1981-85: Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Arms      Control, Oceans, International Operations, and Environment.       1985-93: Chairman or Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee      on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.       1977-92: Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Chairman or      Ranking Minority Member.       In addition, Senator Cranston served on the Committees on      the Budget (1975-79) and on Nutrition and Human Needs (1975-     77), and on the Select Committee on Intelligence (1987-93).       Event Planning and Arrangements: Bill Brew, Fran Butler,      Kelly Cordes, Chad Griffin, Bill Johnstone, Susanne Martinez,      Dan Perry, Ed Scott, Jon Steinberg, Lorraine Tong, Elinor      Tucker.       As I said at the Tribute, I would not be in this body were      it not for Alan Cranston. My colleague, the Senator from      Washington (Ms. Cantwell), expressed that same sentiment in      her remarks. Alan Cranston will always be an inspiration for      us. He will live in our memories and the memories of all      those who served with him and were touched by the causes he      championed and in the hearts and minds of those he so ably      represented in his beloved State of California. Following are      the transcript of the Tribute, and the document,      ``Legislative Legacy, Alan Cranston in the U.S. Senate, 1969-     1993,'' that was distributed at the Tribute.   A Legislative Legacy--Alan Cranston in the U.S. Senate, 1969-1993                              An Overview       As an eight-year-old boy, Alan Cranston lost his first      election to be bench monitor in his Los Altos grammar school.      As an adult, he became the state's most electable Democrat      and one of the most durable and successful California      politicians of the 20th Century. During decades of political      and social turbulence, when no other California Democrat was      elected more than once to the U.S. Senate, Alan Cranston won      four Senate terms in the Capitol, serving a total of 24      years. It is a California record unmatched except for the      legendary Hiram Johnson, a Republican who held his Senate      seat from 1917 to 1945.       In addition, Cranston was elected to seven consecutive      terms as the Senate Democratic Whip, the number two party      position in the Senate. That, too, is an all-time Senate      record for longevity in a leadership post. Alan Cranston is      credited with rebuilding the Democratic Party in California      through grass- roots activism and organization. In the mid-     1950s, he organized the then- powerful California Democratic      Council, a vast network of party volunteers that in 1958      helped sweep Republicans from most statewide offices. Edmund      G. ``Pat'' Brown was elected governor, Democrats seized the      California Legislature, and Cranston began two terms as State      Controller of California.       Senator Cranston sought the Democratic Party nomination for      President in 1984. His campaign, though ultimately      unsuccessful, raised to new heights public support for      international arms control and a superpower freeze on nuclear      weapons.       In terms of political style, Senator Cranston drew upon an      earlier Earl Warren tradition of bipartisanship, and was well      served by a diversified base of political support.      Representing the California mega-state in the Senate,      Cranston skillfully balanced a wide array of insistent and      sometimes conflicting state interests. He steered a delicate      course between the state's giant agribusiness interests and      those of consumers, family farmers and farm workers; he      weighed the claims of home builders and growing communities      with the need to preserve open space and wildlife habitats;      and he nurtured and led the California epicenter of the      national arms control and peace movements, while effectively      representing the home of the nation's defense and aerospace      industry.       The record of Congressional measures from 1969 to 1993 adds      up to a catalogue of literally tens of thousands of      legislative actions on which there is a Cranston imprint.      These include the large events of the past quarter century--     Vietnam, the Cold War, civil rights, the rise of      environmentalism, conflict in the Middle East, Watergate, the      energy crisis, and equal rights for women.       The Cranston mark is on thousands of bills and amendments      he personally authored affecting virtually every aspect of      national life. Without this legislative record, America would      be a different and poorer place in the quality of life and      environment for a majority of our people. Rivers would be      more polluted, the air less clean, food less safe. Fewer      opportunities would be open to all citizens, fewer advances      made in medicine and science; there would be less safe      conditions in workplaces.       Despite facile and careless cynicism about the work of      government, the achievements of the nation's Legislative      Branch from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s have made a      distinct and meaningful difference in the lives of millions      of Americans. Alan Cranston's particular contributions to      progressive legislation is notable. The difference a single      U.S. Senator can make is demonstrated by a study of all votes      cast in the Senate over two decades in which the outcome was      decided by less than five votes and often by a single vote.      Between 1969 to 1989 there were over 2,500 such votes in      which Alan Cranston's influence often was critical to the      outcome.       The figures do not include thousands of legislative      decisions reached by less narrow margins. Nor do they reflect      the additional influence of Senator Cranston as a behind-the-     scene strategist, nose-counter, marshaler of forces and      shrewd compromiser who always lived to fight another day. The      sum of thousands of ``small'', quiet, often little-noticed      and uncelebrated legislative actions over near a quarter-     century adds up to steady progress in nearly every area of      American life.       As for one man's place in such a record, former Vice      President Walter Mondale called Senator Cranston: ``The most      decent and gifted member of the United States Senate.''       Even with so diverse a legislative record, certain points      of emphasis and priority emerge. Although never an ideologue,      Senator Cranston was passionate in pursuit of world peace,      for extending opportunities for those left out of the      mainstream, and for protecting the natural environment. Asked      by a reporter what he ``goes to the mat for,'' Cranston      replied: ``Peace, arms control, human rights, civil rights,      civil liberties. If there's an issue between some very      powerful people and some people without much power, my      sympathies start with those who have less power.''       During the eight years that remained to him after he left      the Senate, Alan Cranston worked tirelessly on issues of war      and peace, speaking out for human rights, and for preserving      the environment of the planet for present and future      generations. In 1996, he became chairman of the Global      Security Institute, a San Francisco-based research      organization which he founded together with former Soviet      President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail S. Gorbachev      to promote world peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons.                             EARLY HISTORY       Few people in modern history have entered the U.S. Senate      as freshmen better prepared than Alan Cranston to combine      lifelong concerns over foreign and domestic policy with an      understanding of the inner procedural, political and human      workings of the institution. It was a preparation which made      it possible to gain and hold on to Senate power as Democratic      Whip for 14 of his 24 years in Congress.       In 1936, as a 22-year-old foreign correspondent he joined      the International News Service (later part of United Press      International), immediately after graduating from Stanford      University. He was sent on assignments to Germany, Italy,      Ethiopia and England in years leading up to the outbreak of      World War II. He personally watched and listened as Adolph      Hitler whipped his audiences into mass frenzy. He saw      Mussolini strut before tens of thousands in Rome. He covered      London in the fateful years ``while England slept,'' and he      watched as the world seemed helpless to act against the dark      march of fascism.       Three years later, following his return to the United      States, Cranston learned that an English-language version of      Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' was being distributed in the U.S. He      was alarmed to discover that, for propaganda purposes, parts      of the text had been purposefully omitted. These were      passages which would have made clear the nature and full      extent of Hitler's threat to the world. To warn Americans      against Hitler, he wrote a complete and accurate version of      the book, with explanatory notes making the Dictator's real      intentions clear. It was published in tabloid form and sold a      half-million copies before a copyright infringement suit      brought by agents of the Third Reich put a stop to its      further distribution.       Senator Cranston's strong commitment to human rights and      peace, and his alertness to the dangers of totalitarian one-     man rule, were clearly shaped by witnessing first hand the      rise of fascism in Europe and the deadly chain of events      leading to the Second World     War and its Cold War aftermath. His first work in Washington,      serving in 1940 and 1941 as a representative of the Common      Cause for American Unity, entailed lobbying Congress for      fairness in legislation affecting foreign born Americans.      This activity gave him an opportunity to learn at close      range the inner workings of the Senate.       With the outbreak of war, Cranston served as Chief of the      Foreign Language Division of the Office of War Information in      the Executive Offices of the President. When offered a draft      deferment in 1944, he declined it and enlisted in the Army as      a private, where he was first assigned to an infantry unit      training in the U.S. Because of his experience as a foreign      correspondent and journalist, he became editor of Army Talk.      His rank was sergeant by VJ Day.       While still in the Army, he began researching and writing a      book in hopes of influencing international decision-making in      the post-war world. It was an account of how, in the      aftermath of the first World War, a handful of willful men in      the U.S. Senate, opposed to President Wilson and the 14-point      peace plan, managed to prevent U.S. participation in the      League of Nations, ultimately undermining the peace and      setting the stage for a second World War.       In 1945, ``The Killing of the Peace'' by Alan Cranston was      published. The New York Times rated it one of the 10 best      books of the year. The book served to warn against the folly      of repeating the same isolationist mistakes that followed      World War I. The Cranston book also presented a meticulous      description of the byzantine inner workings of the U.S.      Senate during the debate over ratification of the League of      Nations treaty. At age 31, the future Senator revealed a full      appreciation of the critical role played by individual egos,      personalities and interpersonal relationships in the      legislative process, and showed how awareness to such human      factors could be critical in determining the outcome of a      vote.       The immediate post-war years in Washington and publication      of The Killing of the Peace marked the real beginning of      Cranston's determination to become a member of the Senate. He      wanted to enter that institution where he could promote world      peace and causes of social justice.       From 1949 to 1952 he served as national president of the      United World Federalists, dedicated to promoting peace      through world law. He was a principal founder of the      California Democratic Council, established to influence the      direction of the Democratic Party in the state, and was      elected as the first CDC President in 1953 and served until      1958.       He was elected California state controller in 1958, which      placed him among the top ranks of the party's statewide      elected officials. He was reelected in 1962 and served until      1966.                          SENATE ACHIEVEMENTS                            Foreign affairs       Elected to the Senate in l968, during the height of      fighting in Vietnam, Senator Cranston quickly allied with so-     called ``doves'' which were a distinct minority in Congress      at that time. Together with Senator Edward Brooke of      Massachusetts, Alan Cranston co-authored the first measure to      pass the Senate cutting off funds to continue the war in      Southeast Asia. The Brooke-Cranston Amendment paved the way      to the U.S. Congress ultimately asserting its prerogatives      over military spending and provided for the orderly      termination of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.       Senator Cranston played key roles in shaping the SALT and      START arms pacts, and in framing debate on virtually every      new weapon system, arms control issue and foreign treaty from      1969 to 1993. A recognized leader on the Foreign Relations      Committee, Alan Cranston was a highly respected voice on      behalf of arms control, nuclear non-proliferation, peaceful      settlement of international conflict, human rights around the      world, sensible and compassionate approaches to immigration      and refugee issues, foreign trade and long range solutions      to problems of famine, disease and oppression in the Third      World.       In addition to U.S.-Soviet relations, those specific areas      of foreign policy in which Senator Cranston made a      significant impact include the passage of the Panama Canal      Treaty, efforts to bar military aid to the Nicaraguan      contras, aid to Israel and efforts toward peace in the Middle      East, helping to bring a halt to U.S. involvement in a civil      war in Angola, and opposition to apartheid in South Africa.                       Environmental legislation       Among the legacy of Alan Cranston's years in the Senate is      a wealth of parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, wild      rivers, scenic areas and coastline protection measures. With      just two bills in which Alan Cranston and Rep. Phillip Burton      of San Francisco teamed--the Omnibus Parks Act of 1978 and      the Alaska Lands Act of 1980--as much acreage was placed      under federal protection as all the parks lands created      earlier in the 20th Century combined. Senator Cranston was      the Senate sponsor of legislation creating the Golden Gate      National Recreation Area, the Santa Monica Mountains National      Recreation Area, the Channel Islands National Park, a 48,000      acre addition to the Redwoods National Park, and the      inclusion of Mineral King into Sequoia National Park. He      sponsored 12 different wilderness bills which became law      between 1969 and 1982. He helped close Death Valley National      Monument to open pit mining and was an architect of the      Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.       He worked diligently throughout his Senate years for the      California Desert Protection Act, that called for setting      aside millions of acres of desert lands as wilderness and      park preserves, and creating better government conservation      efforts for a vast portion of the California desert      ecosystem. His efforts ultimately came to fruition when      Senator Dianne Feinstein, during the first Clinton term, was      able to enact into law the Cranston crusade for desert      preservation.       Even this long list does not tell the complete story of      Senator Cranston's environmental record, which includes clear      air and clean water legislation, control of toxic wastes,      liability for oil spills, restoration of fish and wildlife      resources, and support for new technologies for cleaner      fuels. No other period in American history has seen so much      been accomplished for environmental protection as the last      three decades of the 20th Century, and Senator Cranston was      an essential but largely unheralded architect of these      policies.                      Civil rights/Civil liberties       In his first term as a Senator, Alan Cranston wrote the      amendment that extended to federal workers the civil rights      protections earlier mandated to private employers. He also      played a key strategic role in ending a filibuster which      threatened the extension of the Voting Rights Act. He      authored the first Senate bill to redress grievances of      Japanese-Americans interned in relocation camps during the      Second World War. Cranston co-authored landmark legislation      protecting the civil rights of institutionalized persons. He      was the first U.S. Senator to employ an openly-gay person on      his staff, and he fought official discrimination against      homosexuals in immigration laws and access to legal services.       Aware from his days as a journalist of the importance of      protecting news sources, Senator Cranston fought the Nixon      Administration to preserve an unfettered and free press in      America. He successfully blocked legislation in 1975 that      would have created an Official Secrets Act threatening First      Amendment freedoms.                              Health care       Both on the Senate and Human Resources Subcommittee on      Health and Scientific Research, and as Chairman of the Senate      Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Cranston worked to secure      for all individuals access to health services necessary for      the prevention and treatment of disease and injury and for      the promotion of physical and mental well-being.       He authored the law, and extensions and refinements of it,      that provided for the development nationwide of comprehensive      medical services (EMS) systems and for the training of      emergency medical personnel. He steered the original      Emergency Medical Systems Act through Congress, then      persuaded a reluctant President Nixon to sign it into law. A      few years later, the Cranston measure was quite possibly      responsible for saving another President's life. It was at a      special trauma care unit at George Washington University      Medical Center in Washington, D.C., established in part by      the EMS law, where President Reagan's life was saved      following an assassination attempt in 1981.       Senator Cranston also wrote laws that have made a broad      range of family planning services available to individuals      who cannot otherwise afford or gain ready access to them. He      authored legislation that improved services to families of      sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and encouraged expanded      research efforts. Legislation to support community efforts to      control venereal diseases and tuberculosis were shaped by      Senator Cranston. He authored several provisions of law      substantially increasing funding for AIDS research,      education, and public health activities.       He wrote the law that expanded and coordinated federal      research in arthritis, and he helped create the National      Institute on Aging. Totally separate from his role as a      federal legislator, he helped establish the private, non-     profit Alliance for Aging Research to spur research      scientists to find answers for the chronic disabling      conditions of aging, including Alzheimer's Disease.       His commitment to healthy aging was also personal. A      lifelong physical fitness buff and accomplished runner, he      set a world record for his age group in 1969, running the      100-yard dash in 12.6 seconds. He broke his own record three      years later running in the University of Pennsylvania Relays      at age 59.                  Rights for persons with disabilities       When Alan Cranston came to the Senate, disabled persons had      virtually no legal protection against unjust discrimination      and there had been little progress toward removing physical      barriers that excluded them from public buildings and      facilities. He was acutely aware of these injustices due to      crippling disabilities suffered by members of his immediate      family. He often characterized people with disabilities as      ``the one civil rights constituency any of us can be thrust      into without a moment's warning.'' He led efforts to enact      legislation in 1973 for the first time outlawing      discrimination in federally-funded programs and requiring      that federally-funded buildings be made accessible to      disabled individuals, and promoting the employment and      advancement of persons with disabilities by the federal      government and federal contractors. The sloping sidewalk     curbs for wheelchairs on nearly every street in the nation      stem from Alan Cranston's early advocacy for disabled people.                         Children and families       Senator Cranston authored a rich body of legislative      reforms that humanized and vastly improved adoption      assistance, foster care, child custody and child care. He was      a leader in sponsoring child abuse and neglect prevention      laws and in investigating the abuse of children in      institutions.       He was responsible for extending the original authorization      of the Head Start pre-school education program. He authored      successful bills extending Medicaid coverage for prenatal      health care for low-income pregnant women. He co-wrote the      landmark L975 law designed to provide educational      opportunities for handicapped children, and he was a strong      supporter and developer of children's nutrition and feeding      programs throughout his time in the Senate.       Many private organizations honored Cranston for his work,      including the North American Conference on Adoptable      Children, which named him ``Child Advocate of the Year'' in      1979, the California Adoption Advocacy Network, the Child      Welfare League of America, the Day Care and Child Development      Council of America, the California Child Development      Administrators Association, and the JACKIE organization,      which cited ``his leadership in obtaining national adoption      and foster care reform.''                                Veterans       Though opposed to the Vietnam War, he was deeply      compassionate toward those who fought America's most      unpopular war. Able to separate the war from the warriors, he      was an early champion for the Vietnam veterans, especially      for improving health care in VA hospitals and clinics.       In his first year in the Senate, Alan Cranston was assigned      chairmanship of a Labor Committee subcommittee dealing with      veterans. He used that post to draw national attention to      inadequate and shocking conditions in VA hospitals, which      were overwhelmed by the returning wounded from the Vietnam      war. When a full Committee on Veterans Affairs was      established in the Senate, he chaired its subcommittee on      health and hospitals and later chaired the full committee for      a total of nine years.       Among a few highlights of this record: improvements in      compensation for service-connected disabled veterans,      education and training programs tailored to Vietnam-era      veterans, requirements for federal contractors to give      preference in hiring for Vietnam-era and disabled veterans,      and a long list of initiatives to improve health care in the      VA medical system.       Alan Cranston wrote the law that created a national network      of VA counseling facilities known as ``Vet Centers'' to aid      returning Vietnam veterans in coping with readjustment to      civilian society, and helping to identify and treat the      condition known as post-traumatic stress syndrome.       He was among the first to draw attention to the health      problems believed associated with exposure to Agent Orange      and he gave the VA specific authority to provide Vietnam      veterans with medical care for those conditions. He also      helped bring to light health problems of veterans who were      exposed to nuclear radiation as part of U.S. government      atomic testing in the 1940s and 50s, and he fought to allow      compensation for subsequent medical effects of the exposure.       For more than a decade he fought to allow veterans legal      rights to appeal VA decisions on claims for benefits and      ultimately succeeded in establishing the United States Court      of Veterans Appeals. His very last day in the Senate, Alan      Cranston was responsible for passage of three veterans bills:      Veterans Re-employment Rights, Veterans Health-Care Services,      and the Veterans Health Care Act.                                 Women       Another constant throughout the Cranston Senate career has      been his efforts aimed at eradicating sex discrimination and      providing equal opportunities for women.       He worked hard, both in the U.S. Congress and in the      California legislature, for passage and ratification of the      Equal Rights Amendment. He authored provisions of the Equal      Employment Opportunity Act precluding discrimination in      hiring and retaining women employees and those who are      pregnant. On the Banking Committee he pioneered laws      prohibiting discrimination against women in obtaining credit      and benefitting from insurance policies.       He consistently championed women's access to health care      and reproductive health services. He was the Senate author of      the Freedom of Choice Act to codify into federal law the Roe      v. Wade court decision.                                Addenda       Any summary of the Cranston record would be incomplete      without also noting the following:       Senator Cranston helped lead the opposition in the U.S.      Senate to G. Harrold Carswell and Clement Haynsworth, both      nominated by President Richard Nixon to the Supreme Court.      Both nominations were defeated.       When Robert Bork was nominated to the Court, it was a vote      count taken by Democratic Whip Alan Cranston that first      showed the nomination could be overturn. Senator Cranston      skillfully used this information to persuade swing vote      Senators to reject the Bork nomination.       During the Carter Presidency, when Cranston had the      patronage power to recommend federal judicial appointments,      he instead established a bipartisan committee with the      California Bar Association to assist in screening candidates      based on merit. Under this system four women, four African-     Americans, two Latinos and one Asian were appointed to the      U.S. District Court in California. In addition, one African-     American, one woman, and one Latino were appointed as U.S.      Attorneys.       He long championed federal support for mass transit,      including the Surface Transit Act, which for the first time      opened up the Federal Highway Act to allow mass transit to      compete for federal funds on an equal basis with highways.       As Housing Subcommittee Chairman on the Banking Committee,      he lead efforts to pass the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1987,      the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, and the Housing and      Community Development Act of 1987 and then succeeded in      gaining enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National      Affordable Housing Act in October 1990, a landmark law that      set a new course for federal housing assistance, stressing      production of affordable housing units, improved FHA      insurance, elderly and handicapped housing expansion, special      housing for people with AIDS, and reform of public housing.      Passage of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992      culminated Senator Cranston's 24 years of major legislative      achievements steadily aimed at making housing more available      and fostering community economic growth.       He helped strengthen the Resources Conservation and      Recovery Act, the basic law which allows the federal      government to regulate hazardous waste material to insure      that it is safely managed.       He headed efforts in the Senate to break the filibuster      mounted against Labor Law Reform.       Over more than two decades, he provided diligent oversight      and direction for all federal volunteer programs, including      the Peace Corps, VISTA, the ACTION Agency, Foster      Grandparents, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program.                           Post-Senate Career       From 1993 until his death just hours before the first day      of 2001, Alan Cranston pursued the opportunity afforded by      the end of the Cold War to abolish nuclear weapons. He worked      on the issue as Chairman of the Gorbachev Foundation, and      then as President of the Global Security Institute in San      Francisco, which he helped establish. An important      accomplishment of the Institute was to put together, with a      coalition of groups called Project Abolition, the Responsible      Security Appeal, which calls for action leading to the      elimination of all nuclear weapons. At Cranston's urging,      this document was signed by such notable people as Paul      Nitze, General Charles Horner, and former President Jimmy      Carter. Project Abolition, founded by Cranston, promises to      be the foundation for a wider nuclear abolition campaign in      the years ahead.       During the decade of the 1990s, he traveled to the Indian      Subcontinent, in Central Asia and elsewhere, working with      national leaders to accommodate peaceful change in the world,      especially the development of pluralistic, free societies in      the former Soviet Union. In the very last years of his life,      he was more often at home, in the sprawling Spanish Colonial      style residence in Los Altos Hills, where he was surrounded      by three generations of his family. He assembled a      magnificent library encompassing a wide range of California,      American and International history and politics, in thousands      of books, artworks, memorabilia and photographs. To this      library would come many friends, political allies old and      new, former staff and an occasional journalist intent on an      interview. Former Senator Cranston made this assessment of      his priorities in one interview, just months before his      death:       ``I am an abolitionist on two fronts. I believe we have to      abolish nuclear weapons before they abolish us, and I think      we have to eliminate the incredibly important and significant      role of money in politics before we're going to have our      democracy working as it should work. If we blow ourselves up      in a nuclear war, no other issue, no matter how important it      may seem to be, is going to matter. And until we get money      out of politics, money is going to affect every issue that      comes along, often adversely to the interest of the public.      So let's abolish both.''       Years earlier, while preparing to retire from the United      States Senate, he expressed gratitude for the opportunities      to make a difference on behalf of California and people      throughout the world:       ``It has been a privilege I have cherished and for which I      can never adequately thank the people of California. It is my      hope that many of the accomplishments achieved over these      past 24 years in the areas of world peace, the environment,      and in the effort to secure a better quality of life for      millions of Americans will survive and serve as the basis of      continued progress by others in behalf of future      generations.''                                  ____  February 6, 2001, 2:00 pm, Memorial Tribute to Alan Cranston, U.S. Senator 1969--1993, Hart Senate Office Building, Room 902, Washington,                                   D.C.       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. On behalf of the sponsors,      Senators Cleland, Simpson, Rockefeller, Kennedy, Feinstein,      and Boxer, welcome to this Memorial Tribute to Senator Alan      Cranston. At the outset, I want to express our appreciation      to the U.S. Army     Strings for their Prelude musical offerings today. Also,      thanks to C-Span for covering this event. This turnout today      is itself a wonderful testimonial to the work of this man of      the Senate, Alan Cranston, and we are absolutely delighted      that his family has journeyed here from California to share      in this Tribute--his son, Kim, and daughter-in-law Colette,      and their child and Alan's granddaughter, Evan, who graces      the program cover with Alan, and we are so happy that Alan's      wonderful, 91-year-old sister, R.E., who wrote a biography      about Alan, is with us as well.       During his 24 years as a Senator, Alan Cranston did much to      better the lives of the people of his state and the people of      this country and all countries. You will hear much about      those efforts and achievements today. In my role, I am a      proxy for the scores of staff who worked for Alan Cranston      over his Senate career. I began in March 1969, almost at the      beginning, and stayed 21 and a half years. I've always      thought that one could tell a great deal about the kind of      person someone was by how those who worked most closely with      him felt about him. I think it speaks volumes about Alan      Cranston--and Alan is the way he asked his staff always to      refer to him--that so many worked with him for so long. In      fact, five worked for him for his full 24 years; two others      worked more than 20 years; five others for 15 years or more,      and three or four for 10 or more years. I doubt that any      Senator has surpassed that record for staff loyalty and staff      satisfaction.       Alan was wonderful to work for and with. He was not a      saint, of course, but he was a gentlemen, through and      through. He gave respect to get respect. To me he was a      mentor, a teacher, an inspiration, and a friend. I loved him.      I will always remember him. And when I do, I will think back      to our last meeting--at dinner on November 13. He was strong      and vibrant and full of passionate commitment to the cause of      the elimination of nuclear weapons. I remember our hugging      goodbye. It was a great hug, but I wish I had held on a      littler longer.       A few announcements before we get to our speakers: First of      all, I want to remind each of you to please sign one of the      guest books in the lobby before you leave. I hope you've each      gotten a program. If not, you can pick one up on the way out.      And also on the way out, there is a paper on Senator      Cranston's legislative legacy in the Senate.       Before I introduce our first speaker, I want to note the      presence here--now or expected--in addition to those who will      speak, of many distinguished members of the Senate and House:      Senator Rockefeller, who is one of our sponsors; Senator      Lugar, Senator Leahy, Senator Dodd, Senator Bingaman, Senator      Sarbanes, Senator Dorgan, former Senator DeConcini, and      Representatives Waxman, Filner, Roybal, Capps, and Harmon.      Also with us is former Senator Harris Wofford, who spoke so      eloquently at the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco on January      16, and Mark Schneider, former Director of the Peace Corps,      which Harris Wofford was instrumental in starting, in which      Senator Dodd served as a volunteer in Central America, and in      which Alan Cranston believed so deeply. We are also honored      to have the presence of three Cabinet members, all from      California--Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta,      Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, and Secretary of      Veterans Affairs Tony Principi.       Our first speaker has timed it impeccably. (Laughter.) Our      first speaker is, fittingly, the lead sponsor of today's      tribute. Simply put, Alan Cranston loved Max Cleland--as do      I. They first met in 1969, and I'm sure Senator Cleland will      talk about that. Alan was truly overjoyed at Max's election      to the Senate in 1996. I want to express my gratitude to Max      personally and to his staff, Bill Johnstone, Farrar Johnston,      and Andy VanLandingham, for all of their help with the      arrangements for this event.       And now our first speaker, Senator Max Cleland of Georgia.      (Applause.)       Senator Max Cleland. Thank you all very much and thank you      Jon Steinberg for being uncharacteristically brief.      (Laughter.)       I see so many of my colleagues here. Really my first real      exposure to the United States Senate came about because Alan      Cranston cared. He was an unusual individual. I visited the      Dirksen Building here for the first time in December of 1969.      I was still basically a patient in the VA hospital system      when I was asked to appear before something called the Senate      Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs about how the VA was      handling returning Vietnam war veterans. That meeting was      chaired by a tall, lean freshman California senator named      Alan Cranston. I really didn't know him then, but it became      the start of a three-decade friendship.       In 1974, I ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor in      Georgia, and, other than my own priority for my own race, my      second priority in the whole world in terms of politics was      to make sure Alan Cranston got reelected in 1974. Actually,      Alan was very kind to me, and brought me out to California,      and I got a chance to campaign for him and kind of clear out      some of the cobwebs that I had in my own mind about politics      and about life. We campaigned together and I found him just      as inspiring and invigorating in that campaign as when I had      met him in '69.       It's amazing how life works. Little did I know that, as      someone from Georgia, someone from California would be      critical in my continued service in public life. I did lose      my race for lieutenant governor in 1974 and, therefore, was      unemployed. Christmas Eve, 1974, I called my friend Jonathan      Steinberg, and said ``I just wanted to wish you the happiest      of holidays'' and said ``by the way, if you're looking for      anybody who wants to work, I'm available.'' He said, ``are      you serious?'' And I said ``I am deadly serious.'' Well, it      was Alan Cranston that made it possible for me to get a      $12,500-a-year job on the staff of the Senate Veterans'      Affairs Committee in the spring of 1975. That was more money      than I'd ever made in my whole entire life.       I was there a couple of years and, in the summer of 1976,      when a young man from Georgia named Jimmy Carter seemed like      he was destined to win the Democratic primary, Alan Cranston      talked to me and said ``I think you ought to be the new head      of the Veterans' Administration.'' That scared me to death. I      said, ``well, if you really think I can do it, let's go for      it.'' He talked to Senator Nunn and talked to Senator      Talmadge. By the August convention of the American Legion, a      convention in Seattle, Senator Cranston pulled Jimmy Carter      aside and said ``I have two requests.'' I don't know what the      other one was, but he said ``the second one is to make Max      Cleland head of the VA.'' And Jimmy Carter replied, ``I love      Max Cleland.''       So President Carter wound up in January 1977 as President      of the United States, and Alan Cranston wound up as Chairman      of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I only had two      friends in Washington; one was President, and the other was      Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. (Laughter.) So I      was nominated in March of 1977, as the youngest head of the      Veterans' Administration, and, thanks to Alan Cranston, I was      confirmed in record time, and took over that agency, with      really the support of Jon Steinberg and Alan. They were my      constant guides, and sometimes spurs, and encouraged me all      the way.       One of the things I'm proudest of that we were able to do,      is put together something called the Vet Center Program. Alan      Cranston, since 1971, had been introducing in the Senate      something called psychological readjustment counseling for      Vietnam veterans and their families. It would usually pass      the Senate, die in the House, and had no Presidential      support; but I was able to talk to President Carter, we were      able to put the administration behind this legislation. It      passed, and we were able to sign it into law, and I put      together one of the very first Vet Centers in 1980 in Van      Nuys, California. Now, there are some 200 scattered around      the country. Some three-and-a-half million veterans and their      families have received counseling through this program, and      Alan Cranston was basically responsible.       Let me just say that, in 1973, he helped to pass      legislation that helped the disabled in this country, that      required that federally-funded buildings be made accessible,      that promoted the hiring and advancement of people with      disabilities by the Federal government. He established      something called the Architectural and Transportation      Barriers Compliance Board, which has the responsibility for      setting standards for accessibility and for assisting and      forcing compliance with accessibility laws. I was named to      that Board by President Carter in 1979.       Throughout the remainder of the 70s, Alan worked to revamp      federally-assisted state voc-rehab programs, sponsoring laws      that gave priority to the most seriously disabled. In 1980,      he sponsored legislation to make some improvements in that      program at the VA, and in 1990 he was a leading cosponsor of      the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has been a pioneer      piece of legislation, as we all know.       I just want you to know that I wouldn't be in the United      States Senate, I wouldn't have ever been head of the      Veterans' Administration, without the mild-mannered      distinguished gentleman from the great state of California. I      mourn his passing, and we will miss him. God bless you.      (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you very much, Max.      Speaking of the ADA, I see Senator Harkin here. We welcome      you.       Alan referred to our next speaker as his best friend on the      Republican side. They served together as their respective      party leaders on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and as      Assistant Floor Leaders, or Whips, as they were also called.      Another tall, lanky, hairline-challenged Alan, former Senator      Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming.       Senator Alan K. Simpson. Jonathan and former colleagues and      friends and family, Kim, Colette, Evan, and Eleanor, and      Cabinet members, including one Norm Mineta, who I met at the      age of 12 in the war relocation center at Hart Mountain. He      was behind wire, I wasn't, and I should have been and he      shouldn't have. (Laughter.) But, anyway, it's a long,      wonderful friendship, with a guy I love, and I'm so damn      proud of you, pal, even when you did that when you were in      Boy Scouts, I'll never forget. (Laughter.)       Well, it's a great honor and privilege to honor my old      friend. To be asked is very, very moving to me, and I want to      share just a few memories and thoughts about a very special      friend. I came to the Senate in '79. Al was Chairman of the      Veterans' Affairs Committee, and that's when I first met Max.      I said, ``Max, you have a wonderful job there, Secretary of      Veterans Affairs; veterans never pick on each other--ha, ha,      ha.'' Well, anyway, it was an interesting time, Max, wasn't      it? Well, enough of that. Butch is here and he would correct      anything that I said. But it fell to my pleasant luck to soon      become the ranking member in 1980, the Reagan Administration.      Well, I knew who Al was, I knew of     his journalistic prowess, of his warning to his countrymen      about Adolf Hitler, and the two versions of ``Mein Kampf'',      one for domestic consumption and one for the naive and the      unwary, and Alan was sending out the alert. I knew of his      athletic achievements and his stamina, and I very soon      learned of his powerful loyalty to America's veterans.       He was so cordial to me, and his staff, so very helpful to      this new, pea-green freshman. And what a staff it was: Jon      Steinberg, Ed Scott, Bill Brew, Babette Polzer. Well, I      sought their counsel, and plumbed their expertise. Al would      occasionally check up on me, ``how are you? Can we be of more      help?'' I said, ``I need a lot more help.'' But then I built      my own staff. And, oh, to all of you who will be deprived of      staff one day. Staff deprivation is a serious issue      (laughter); it is the most shocking of the transitions      (laughter), and my wife, a beautiful woman of 46 years, she      said ``Alan, your staff is gone, you have no staff, they are      not here, and I am not one of your staff.'' (Laughter.) But,      there was Biblical precedent for this, you look it up in the      Good Book, it says, ``Jacob died leaning on his staff''.      (Laughter.) Now, so along came Ken Bergquist and one Tony      Principi, in those early years. Tony seems to have moved      along nicely in life, a wonderful human being with rare      gifts, who has been bestowed again on the veterans and the      people of this country. He will be serving very wisely and      very well as Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and I'm damn      proud of you, too, pal.       Tom Harvey then came on. But Tony and Jon Steinberg became      a very dynamic duo, they worked with Tom Harvey in those      early years. And, as I say then, in '80, I became in the      majority, and the first call I received after the election      was from Al Cranston. Of course, who else? In that cheery      voice, he said ``congratulations, Mr. Chairman.'' Well, I      thought, the power, I felt the surge . . . (laughter) . . .      and I thought how like him to do that. Well, we cranked out      some good legislation together. With Sonny here, another dear      friend on the other side of the aisle, and John Paul      Hammerschmidt, then Bob Stump, those were men of my faith, my      political faith. And Sonny used to sit next to me and say:      ``Don't do it pal. I know what you're going to do. Just shut      up, won't you?'' (Laughter.) I know we're not going to let      that get away now, Sonny.       Anyway, the changing of the guard went well. The only hitch      was that all of the veterans organizations had selected      National Commanders and Officers from California. Well, you      know how that goes. And now their guy was gone, and the      cowboy from Wyoming was in the saddle. Well that was very      much fun to watch, I loved it. It was painful for Jonathan,      but I loved it. And we were able to, when I took over, we      were able to get Steinberg's statutory language down to one      paragraph in one page. We never let him go two pages with one      paragraph. And he had a tendency to do that.       Then, in 1984, I was honored to become the Assistant      Majority Leader, and who was the Assistant Minority Leader?      Al Cranston. We worked closely together. We enjoyed each      other, we trusted each other. We gave good support and      counsel to Bob Dole and George Mitchell, and we thought it      was a silly idea, but that we oughta make things work. And      even when Al was running for President, imagine me, being the      ranking member of a committee with Kennedy and Hart and      Cranston, all three of them running for President. I went      to them and I said ``you cannot use these chores of mine      for your great cycle, and I won't ever use the committee      to embarrass you'' That's the kind of friendship I had      with Ted, with Al, with Gary, it was very special, and it      can be that way again. I urge it upon you all. Anyway, he      ran for President, he gave it his all, as he did in every      phase of his life, but the brass ring eluded, eluded his      grip, and he came back to his Senate home, his pride      intact. The only time I really, really flustered him, I      was flush with power. Now a member of the majority, the      fever of the majority burned in my bosom like a hot      Gospel. I ambled over to his offices, his spacious      offices, great view, two fireplaces, couches, cozy chairs,      comfort, oh, and I said ``Al, yes I think this will do      very nicely [(laughter)] for my new Whip office.'' And the      blood drained from his face. And I said: ``No, no, just      kidding, Al. You represent millions, I represent      thousands. But when the wind shifts around here, and you      Dems have the horses, don't let `em come around my office      with a tape measure and some greedy looking guy with a      clipboard.'' And he said, ``it's a deal.'' And we had a      handshake. Then the time came, and no one ever darkened my      door, no unworthies with tape measures ever came to see      me.       So, we legislated together, we argued, we collaborated, we      joshed and laughed with each other, we took pleasure in      confusing people. Same first name, same hairstyle; ``hairing      impaired'' is what we called it in political correctness.      Same gaunt, emaciated frame. Same gait, same grin. And,      people would come up to me and say, ``I just think the world      of you and you ran for President, and your views on the      environment and nuclear freeze thrill me to death.''      (Laughter.) And I'd say, ``No, no; I'm Al Simpson,'' and      they'd say ``Not you!'' (Laughter.) And Al said he got that      in reverse about, you know, twice a month, too, so we would      compare that, and our constituents were often not in      alignment, you might imagine. But the best one, though, and      then I'm going to stop: Cheney, Gulf War, Secretary of      Defense, he called and he said, ``we're going over to a game      in Baltimore; bring Ann'', and we went over to the game, and      53,000 Oriole fans, ``Hey Cheney, we love ya! Great stuff!''      You know, I said ``Boy, this is getting bad in here.'' We      left in the seventh inning and went back down through the      bowels, where all the guys, the beer drinkers and the cigar      smokers, were, and they went ``Hey, Cheney, baby, you're all      right--we love ya!'' And I turned to him and I said, ``You      know, they never treated you like this in Casper.'' And a guy      from the audience said ``Hey, I know the big guy, too; that's      Al Cranston!'' (Laughter.) So, I can assure you he loved that      story (laughter), when I told him that.       Well, he handled life well. Stuck to his guns, worked      through pain, met life full in the face, as if in a track      meet, headed for the tape, and he loved that thrill. Many      would have buckled; not Al. The pain of loss of the      Presidency, the pain of loss of family members, the pain of      loss of Norma to Parkinson's Disease that withered her, that      withered their union. The pain of cancer, the pain of      accusation and assault by the media, the pain from his peers      at that time; we talked about that, oh yes we did, of that      sense of being singled out, very painful.       And he left the Senate and went on to vital other things,      and meaningful things in his life, undaunted, head high,      smile on his face, fire in the belly, finishing the course      laid out. And we knew on one unknown day he would be taken      from us. And we shall miss him. But not mourn him. For he was      a man of vigor and joy and vision. And my life is much richer      for having shared a significant piece of it with Alan      Cranston. A race well run, my old friend. God rest his soul.      (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Senator Simpson, we greatly      appreciate your having rearranged your schedule to come down      here from New York and we know you have to leave to go back      there.       We're going to show a very short film now, it's only two or      three minutes, but we thought we ought to have Alan with us.                                  Film       Narrator. Moscow, Winter, 1998.       Voice. Alan, you don't wear a coat in the Russian winter?       Alan Cranston. I don't believe in them.       Voice. He doesn't believe in them. It's like John Kennedy,      it's . . .       Narrator. That was Alan in retirement. For most people, a      time to slow down. But at 84, as he approached the Russian      Duma, Alan Cranston was a man on a lifelong mission.       Alan Cranston. I got into all this way back shortly after      Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I met Albert Einstein. He told me, as      he told others, that the whole human race could be wiped out      by nuclear weapons. I've been working on it ever since.       Narrator. And forty years later, after trillions had been      spent on weapons of mass destruction, Alan emerged with a      collection of allies that astonished even him.       Alan Cranston. One very dramatic moment, when Lee Butler,      who had command of all of our nuclear weapons, gave his first      public address at the State of the World Forum, in San      Francisco, revealing the concerns he had developed about the      whole deterrence policy and the ongoing dangers from reliance      on nuclear weapons. And, as he spoke, presiding right next to      him was Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of the country that we      would have destroyed. At the very end of this remarkable      speech, Gorbachev and Butler stood up and embraced each      other. That was a very dramatic moment.       Two weeks ago, General Butler and I made public a statement      by 48 past and present heads of state and some 75 other      national leaders from 48 nations, advocating specific steps      towards abolition. Despite these and other favorable      developments, there is significant doubt, skepticism,      cynicism, and outright opposition to much of this. So,      plainly, there is much to do, and we have a lot of hard      thinking to do about what is in order. But let me say in      closing that I do not believe that we need to wait, and I do      not believe that we can afford to wait, until the end of the      next century, to fulfill the obligation of our generation to      all generations that preceded us and all generations that      hopefully will follow us, to deal with the threat to all life      that exists and is implicit in nuclear weapons. Thank you.       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. That film that was pulled      together from a larger documentary by George Crile, a former      CBS producer, who has developed documentaries on nuclear arms      for ``60 Minutes'' and CNN. We are indebted to him and the      Global Security Institute, of which Alan Cranston was      President, for making that film available to us.       And now we will go a little bit out of order, and hear from      one of this event's sponsors, the Senior Senator from      California, whose work with Alan Cranston goes back many,      many years and who, among many other achievements, carried on      successfully with some very important environmental      initiatives that Senator Cranston began.       Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. (Applause.)       Senator Dianne Feinstein. Thank you very much. Thank you.      It's really a great honor and a privilege to be here. I just      want to recognize two members of the California House      delegation that came in. First is Lois Capps, from the Santa      Barbara area, and Jane Harmon, from the southern Los Angeles      area. And I'm not sure whether Paul Wellstone and Jeff      Bingaman were introduced earlier, but I want everybody to      know that they're here, too.       Alan Simpson is a hard act to follow, there's no question      about that. I look at life this way: That we're here but for      an instant in an eternity. No one really knows when that      instant is over, and the only thing that really matters is      what we do with that instant. Because, when it's over,      there's nothing we can take with us other than the legacy,      leave behind. Alan Cranston first came into my life in 1962,      and that's when I first met his sister, R.E., and it was in      his campaign for State Controller; believe it or not, it was      the first campaign for which I ever volunteered, and so I've      always kind of taken a special interest in a lot of his      achievements. From that point on, I found this former long      distance runner really to be a tireless workhorse for all      Californians, and, as a matter of fact, for all Americans.      This was a man who really loved the intricacies of the      legislative process. He was the consummate vote counter. He      possessed the uncanny ability to assess competing camps, to      quickly find where votes would fall and determine whether the      best course of action was to fight or compromise.      Unfortunately, neither my friend Barbara Boxer nor I really      had an opportunity to work with him in his nearly quarter of      a century here in the Senate, but I think these traits are      legendary, I think they're known by all.       Alan Cranston yielded a whole array of wonderful      accomplishments, but I want to just concentrate today on a      few things in the environment. And, in the true sprit of the      legendary Californian conservationist John Muir, Alan      Cranston became a very passionate architect of measures to      preserve our God-given natural treasures. Alan Cranston      was the original author of something called the Desert      Protection Act. Shortly after I won in 1993, and knew I      was coming to Washington, the phone rang, and Alan said,      ``Would you be willing to take over the effort to pass a      Desert Protection Act?'' And I said, ``Of course.'' And we      came back and we revised the language, rewrote the bill      somewhat, changed some of the concepts, and moved it      ahead. But, the basic originator of this, let there be no      doubt, was Alan Cranston. The bill was filibustered, but      we were lucky in the Senate, we got it through, and it      became a reality in 1994. And the legislation created the      largest park and wilderness designation in our nation.      Over six million acres, two new National Parks, Death      Valley and Joshua Tree, and one National Preserve, the      East Mojave. And so because of that, we have actually      protected, well I said six, but it's actually closer to      seven million acres of pristine California desert      wilderness for all time. Thank you, Alan Cranston.       He was also the lead sponsor of legislation which      established the Golden Gate and the Santa Monica National      Recreation Area, the Channel Islands National Park, a 48,000      acre addition to the Redwoods National Park, and the      inclusion of Mineral King into the Sequoia National Park. He      also sponsored twelve different wilderness bills that became      law between 1969 and 1982. He helped close Death Valley      National Monument to open-pit mining. He helped craft the      Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and      with just two bills, on which he teamed with the late and      wondrous Phillip Burton of San Francisco, the Omnibus Parks      Act of 1978, and the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, as much      acreage was placed under federal protection as all the park      lands created earlier in the twentieth century combined.       So, I can truthfully say, without his service, America      would have been a different, and certainly a poorer place, in      terms of our environment and the quality of life for many of      our citizens. Alan Cranston leaves a legacy of preservation      that will be remembered and enjoyed and certainly by his      beautiful seven-year granddaughter Evan, who is here today.      And I think, for my granddaughter, for Barbara's grandson,      and for all of us, who really look at this land and want to      do what we can to protect it.       This was a very special Californian. And life wasn't always      easy for Alan, either. But I think his ability to keep his      eye on the goal, to establish what he established, whether it      was from the translation of Mein Kampf, to his work against      nuclear devastation, to his environmental record, Alan      Cranston truly lived that instant in eternity, and he has      truly left us a good legacy. Thank you very much. (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. I'm sure there are others that I      failed to mention. I thank Senator Feinstein. I know that      Senator Reid is also here, and again I apologize if I missed      anyone.       No Senator has worked on more causes closer to Alan      Cranston's heart and soul than has Senator Edward M. Kennedy.      I am particularly grateful to him, because it was through his      chief counsel, Jim Flug, who is also here today, that I was      introduced to and came to work for Alan in 1969. Senator      Cranston and Senator Kennedy served together for 12 years on      the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which Senator      Kennedy chaired from 1987 to 1995 and again for 17 days this      year.       Our next speaker, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts.      (Applause.)       Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Thank you, Jonathan. To Kim, and      Colette, and Evan, and R.E.--let me begin by saying that I      loved Alan Cranston too. I will never forget the 24 years of      friendship and leadership and achievement with which he      graced the Senate and the nation. And so it's a special      privilege and honor for me to be part of this tribute today.      Alan is profoundly missed by his family and friends, his      colleagues in the Congress, and by all those around the world      who pursue the great goals of hope and progress and peace.       I must say--I grew up thinking Cranston was a city in Rhode      Island. But Alan taught each of us that Cranston stands for      something else as well--the very best in public service.       Alan loved to lead behind the scenes--for 14 of those 24      Senate years with us, he was our Democratic whip, and he      wrote the book about the job. In those great years, we used      to tease Alan about the position, because so few people      outside Congress knew what it involved. Since Alan was from      California, a lot of people thought the Minority Whip was      the name of a Leather Bar in Malibu. (Laughter.)       But seriously, Alan was a giant of his day on many issues,      and his concern for social justice made him a leader on them      all. We served together for many years on the Labor Committee      and especially the Health Subcommittee, and his insights were      indispensable. I always felt that if we'd had another Alan      Cranston or two in those years, we'd have actually passed our      Health Security Act, and made health care the basic right for      all that it ought to be, instead of just an expensive      privilege for the few.       Perhaps the greatest legacy that Alan left us was his able      and tireless work for democracy and world peace. Every      village in the world is closer to that goal today because of      Alan. No one in the Senate fought harder or more effectively      for our nuclear weapons freeze in the 1980's, or for nuclear      arms control. His hope for a nuclear-free future still      represents the highest aspiration of millions--even      billions--throughout the world.       I also recall Alan's pioneering efforts to press for Senate      action to end the war in Vietnam, and his equally able      leadership for civil rights at home and human rights around      the world. We know how deeply he felt about injustice to      anyone anywhere. And his leadership in the battle against      apartheid in South Africa was indispensable.       Throughout his brilliant career, the causes of civil rights      and human rights were central to Alan's being and his      mission--and America and the world are better off today      because Alan Cranston passed this way.       A key part of all his achievements was his unique ability      to translate his ideals into practical legislation. Few if      any Senators have been as skilled as Alan in the art of      constructive legislative compromise that fairly leads to      progress for the nation.       He was a vigorous supporter of the Peace Corps, a strong      overseer of its performance, and a brilliant advocate for all      the Peace Corps Volunteers. He was a champion for health      coverage for returning Volunteers, and one of the first to      understand that good health coverage had to include mental      health services as well.       In many ways, his first love was the Peace Corps, and I      know that President Kennedy would have been very proud of      him. Even before he came to the Senate, he had his first      contact with the Corps, as a consultant to Sargent Shriver.      As Alan often said, he became involved because he was so      inspired by my brother's vision of a world where Americans of      all ages could work side-by-side with peoples throughout the      world to put an end to poverty.       Because of Alan, the Peace Corps today is thriving as never      before--free of the partisan tensions that divide us on other      issues--spreading international understanding of Alan's and      America's best ideals--educating new generations of young      Americans about our common heritage as travelers on spaceship      earth--teaching us about the beauty, the richness, and the      diversity of other peoples, other languages, other cultures      and about the enduring importance of the greatest pursuit of      all--the pursuit of peace.       Near the end of John Bunyan's ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' there      is a passage that tells of the death of Valiant:       ``Then, he said, I am going to my Father's. And though with      great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not regret me      of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My      sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage,      and my courage and skill to him that can get it. My marks and      scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me, that I have      fought his battle who now will be my rewarder.       ``When the day that he must go hence was come, many      accompanied him to the riverside, into which as he went, he      said, `Death, where is thy sting?' and as he went down      deeper, he said, `Grave, where is thy victory?' So he passed      over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other      side.''       We loved you, Alan. We miss you. And we always will.      (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you, Senator.       Our next speaker was elected to the Senate seat that Alan      occupied when he retired in 1993. She and Senator Cranston      collaborated on many matters while she served in the House of      Representatives, and she authored with Senator Feinstein a      lovely resolution of tribute to Senator Cranston that was      adopted by the Senate on January 22. On behalf of Alan's      family and his extended family and all his friends, we      express our gratitude for this most gracious action.       Senator Barbara Boxer of California. (Applause.)       Senator Barbara Boxer. Thank you. To Alan's family,      beautiful family, and to my dear colleagues who are here, it      certainly has been my honor for the past eight years to serve      in the seat that was held by Alan Cranston for 24 years.       Alan was a deeply caring human being and he cared even for      those whose distant cries were not always heard in      Washington.       From civil rights to arms control, from cleaning up the      environment to improving the lives of our nation's veterans--     Alan's work knew no geographic boundaries. But, sometimes      Alan's legacy on women's rights gets overlooked and that is      what I'm going to speak about today.       From his earliest days in the Senate, Alan made improving      the lives of women a priority. In 1969, he supported the      Equal Rights Amendment. Remember the ERA. It failed. But, in      1972 he became a proud cosponsor again of the ERA, and it      passed. But he didn't stop there--he wrote letters and he got      on the phone to California legislators considering the      measure, urging their support, and his work paid off and      California ratified it that same year. Unfortunately, not all      the states followed suit. But Alan did not stop his advocacy.      He continued over the next decade to push for the Amendment's      ratification and when time ran out, he cosponsored another      ERA in 1983 and another one in 1985, even before he knew he      was going to have a granddaughter. Alan would not give up.       He worked to eliminate gender discrimination in the      workplace. He was the principal author of the Equal      Employment Opportunity Act Amendments of 1972, which extended      protections against gender discrimination to federal      employees in the workplace. And he was the very first member      of Congress to introduce legislation aimed at eliminating      wage discrimination in the federal workplace.       Alan understood the challenges faced by working mothers. He      worked to provide child care for this nation's working      families, introducing some of the first ever legislation to      provide care both before and after school. He knew that many      kids were without adult supervision, and I was so proud when      under the Clinton Administration, we saw after-school funding      increase from $1 million in 1997 to $845 million in 2001.      Alan, you laid the ground work for that.       He also worked tirelessly to protect a women's right to      choose, authoring the Freedom of Choice Act to codify Roe v.      Wade. I proudly carry that bill now. He pushed for increased      access to family planning services for low-income women and      teenagers, and fought to provide medical care to low-income      pregnant women, who otherwise would have been left without it      and would not have had healthy babies.       And he didn't stop there. He sought to level the financial      playing field for women, pushing for laws prohibiting      discrimination against women trying to obtain credit. And we      forget today when we open our mailboxes and we keep getting      all these applications for credit cards, there was a time      when a woman could not get any credit. We thank you, Alan,      although we have to restrain ourselves now and then. We      appreciate the work you did.       Alan was responsible for the first appointment of a woman      to the federal court bench in California. I've personally,      and I know Dianne, we've recommended many women; five of      those that I recommended to President Clinton were nominated      and confirmed. Alan laid that ground work too.       An advocate for equal education for young women, he fought      hard for Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and      you know what that is, equal opportunity for our children,      for our girls in athletics.       And the list goes on and I will stop there with it, because      it could go on and on. But I stand before you today, as a      Senator who is carrying on the progressive work of Alan      Cranston. His belief that women are equal has borne fruit.       If you look around today in the Senate, there are 13 women      Senators from both parties. That's just in this building.      Next door--and we have a couple here--there are 61 women in      the House. We are doing better now, but as my friend Barbara      Mikulski often says, it takes the ``Sir Galahads,'' to get us      there, and Alan was definitely a Sir Galahad.       I'm just going to tell you one quick personal story, and      then I'll end. Alan decided to retire, I ran for the seat and      won the seat, and about a year later, he made an appointment      to come to see me. Now, I know this, the family must know      this, but unlike the Whip's office, which someone else must      have decorated, Alan's personal office here in the Hart      building was not the most beautiful place, because this was      not important to Alan. It was dark; it was dark leather and      dark walls and the blinds were drawn, and that was it. Alan      just saw it as a place to work--files all over the floor. So      when I got into the office, I said: ``Let's brighten it up.      Let's bring California.'' And I ordered all of these green      plants, and we opened up all the shades and we painted the      walls peach and we got peach and green fabrics, and I mean,      it was different. So I thought, you know, Alan was coming to      see me about arms control, but I was excited that he was      going to see what had happened to his office. And he came in      and he sat down, and he sat there and his first thing is,      ``You've got to be more aggressive on arms control.'' Now      that's the first time anyone ever told me to be more      aggressive on anything. (Laughter.) But he started to lecture      me and, you know, time went on, it was an hour, he still      hadn't said a thing about the room. So, finally, I got up my      courage, and I said, ``So Alan, what do you think of the      office?'' And he looked around, and he looked around, and he      said, ``You moved my desk.'' (Laughter.) That was it.       Alan said about his role as Senator, and I quote him, when      he retired: ``It has been a privilege I have cherished and      for which I can never adequately thank the people of      California.'' Let me take this moment on behalf of the people      of California to say to Alan Cranston thank you and your work      lives on. (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you very much, Senator      Boxer, and thank you for being with us so long. I couldn't      help but note when you talked about women and forging the way      for women, that the U.S. Army Strings that played at the      beginning of our ceremony today was composed of four women      from the U.S. Army. And no men.       I want also to acknowledge the presence here of Senator      Daniel Akaka, of the Democratic Leader, Senator Tom Daschle,      and of Senator Hollings of South Carolina. We appreciate      their presence with us very much.       Known to all veterans' advocates as ``Mr. Chairman'', our      next speaker was the counterpart in the House to Senator      Cranston and Senator Simpson as the Chairman of the Committee      on Veterans' Affairs in the other body, as it is      affectionately called. He and Alan had to resolve many sticky      and tricky issues over the 14 years that he led the House      Committee, and they were always able to do so with      congeniality and mutual respect.       He has been a great friend to me personally, as has been      his Committee staff. I now introduce Former Representative      Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi, ``Mr. Chairman''.      (Applause.)       Representative G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery. Thanks very much,      Jon.       To the family of Senator Cranston, my colleagues on this      panel, cabinet members, other distinguished guests, ladies      and gentlemen.       I'd like to thank you, Judge Steinberg and others for      letting me participate in the remarks of this Memorial      Tribute to Senator Alan Cranston.       Alan and I became friends because he was Chairman of the      Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and I was Chairman of the      House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and we both enjoyed      working for veterans and their families. Alan was a veteran      of World War II and had really a good feel for veterans      issues.       You know, at first, I was a little uncomfortable working      with the great Senator from California. I am kinda the hand-     shaking, pat-on-the-back congressman whereas Alan was in      great physical shape, and he would look down on me and say      ``I am sure we can work together'' and we did.       He had a couple of veterans functions out in California and      asked me to come out.       Going from one veterans meeting to another in different      towns in California, we stopped at this restaurant, and he      said they made the best vegetable soup in California. People      recognized him when he walked in, but Alan wanted the soup      and didn't work the crowd, so to speak.       I said to Steinberg, ``explain to me'', and he did, in      California you had millions of people and you just don't work      the crowds. (Laughter.) So, I found out about that.       Alan did many good things for veterans, and I will mention      a few.       He was the architect of the Veterans Readjustment      Counseling Act that Max Cleland mentioned. There are 206      centers to help Vietnam veterans to readjust and Alan did      pass this legislation in 1979.       He had a strong interest in veterans health care and he      passed legislation that gave thousands of veterans more      access to health care. He pushed for more outpatient clinics,      and more veterans use outpatient clinic facilities now and      the VA, I'm happy to say, has been able to cut back on the      number of hospital beds in our 172 hospitals, because of Alan      Cranston and our outpatient clinics.       He was part of our team that established the U.S. Court of      Appeals for Veterans Claims and worked very hard for the      upgrade of the VA to a Cabinet department.       Some member of Congress, and what a mistake he made,      introduced legislation to tax veterans disability      compensation. Senator Cranston went berserk, he killed this      tax legislation before it even saw the light of day, and he      was right.       Alan was very helpful in establishing educational benefits      for veterans who completed their military obligation, and, he      saw to it that the educational benefits go to the actives as      well as the National Guard and Reserve.       As big as California is and the many government programs      that the state has, I believe he really enjoyed working for      veterans and their families more than other issues in      government.       He was a friend of the veteran and veterans organizations      knew they could count on Alan, and he came through for them.       We all miss him and know even in Heaven Alan has an      exercise program going. (Laughter and applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you very much, Mr.      Chairman.       I want to note Senator Jeffords who has just joined us. We      appreciate your being here.       Next, we will hear from a former colleague of Alan's who      knew him long before he became a United States Senator or      held any public office. He very graciously called last      Thursday to offer to say a few words in tribute to Alan. I      now introduce former Representative and Independent      Presidential candidate, John B. Anderson of Illinois.      (Applause.)       Representative John B. Anderson. Thank you very much, Judge      Steinberg, and my distinguished former colleagues in both the     House and the Senate, distinguished members of the cabinet,      and Alan's family. I count it an honor indeed to be included      in the group that is privileged this afternoon to say just a      few words about the career of this very remarkable man. You      have already heard a great deal about his commitment to the      cause of civil rights, women's rights, conservation, the      environment, veterans' affairs. I will not attempt to repeat      the comments or the praise that could continue to be heaped      upon him for the efforts that he exerted in all of those      fields. But, as a member of the ``other body'' for 12 of the      24 years that Alan Cranston served in the Senate, I was well      aware of the distinguished record that he had compiled in      that body. And I would simply again state what has already      been remarked that earlier than most he saw the folly of our      entanglement in Southeast Asia, and I remember his very clear      and clairvoyant voice calling for an end to the struggle      there. He called for more than that, for an end to the arms      race.       And it's really to that vision that he had in this      particular realm of international affairs that I wanted to      direct my very brief remarks this afternoon. Because, as a      very young man he was gifted with a passion for achieving      peace in our time that was shaped as someone said about a      former President, I forget who it was, he had a vision that      enabled him to peer around a corner of history, to see what      lay beyond. In short, he was, indeed, a globalist long      before globalization had become a term used in common      parlance.       And it was just two years after the founding of the United      World Federalists in Asheville, North Carolina, that young      Alan Cranston at the age of 35 became the President of that      organization and served until 1951. One of his mentors was      the late, distinguished Grenville Clark, who, along with      Lewis B. Sonn, wrote that very magisterial work on world      peace through world law. And that indeed was the vision that      Alan Cranston had. He had a vision of a democratic world      federation that would emerge from what was then, when he was      president of the United World Federalists, still a very      nascent United Nations. He maintained that interest and      served on the Board of Advisors of the World Federalists      Association until his recent death.       Upon his retirement from the Senate in 1994, and this is      the point, I think, that I wanted the opportunity to      emphasize here this afternoon, he did not regard his career      as ended. I read the account of the marvelous memorial      service conducted in San Francisco just three weeks ago, in      Grace Cathedral, where his son was quoted as saying that he      had said that ``when the end comes, I want to be able somehow      to still struggle across the finish line with my head up.''      And he added to that that when the end came, he was still      sprinting; he was not merely struggling, he was sprinting in      pursuit of the goals that he sought. And he became a leading      and a very strong voice in civil society in the area that, at      the end of his life, I am convinced, lay closest to his      heart. It was the interest in disarmament, an end to the      threat of nuclear war and the achievement of world peace      through world law. And he believed that that could be      achieved only through the application and the use of the same      federalist principles that had inspired the Framers of our      Constitution to write a Constitution that would bring about      peace and domestic tranquillity among the then 13 independent      sovereignties who had found that under the Articles of      Confederation their bonds of unity had become frayed. And it      was Alan's belief, building on that historical fact, that      only with a restructured and an empowered United Nations, one      capable of maintaining peace with justice, that we would      recognize the goal that he sought, of world peace through      world law.       It's been mentioned, I think, already, that he served as      President of the Global Security Institute, a non-profit      organization dedicated to disarmament and world peace. He saw      security not simply as an issue confined within the narrow      boundaries of nationalism but as an issue that required the      forging of new bonds of global cooperation.       And one of the last and most vivid memories that I      personally have of Alan Cranston was less than three years      ago, when the Hague Appeal for Peace drew thousands of peace      activists from around the world to the Hague, to celebrate,      to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the first      Hague peace conference. Alan was there as one of the leading      spokespersons from the United States. And again, one of the      memorable experiences of that international meeting was to      attend one of its sessions and to hear him describe how he      was even then busy working on a book, a book on sovereignty,      a book that would seek to explain that, in this new      millennium, the old Westphalian theory of state sovereignty      was simply not sufficient unto the needs of our present age,      and we had to reconceptualize that term in a way that would      allow the formation of democratic global institutions that      would carry out the goals of disarmament and build a world in      which peace could be achieved through reliance on the rule of      law.       Those are the memories that I will certainly carry with me,      as inspiration for the remainder of my life, and I thank you,      Alan Cranston, for the things that you did, both in the      Senate, and then in those very important years when you      carried forth your ideas and lived for your ideals as a      strong member of American civil society. (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. I think that gave us all an      important glimpse of the formation of Alan Cranston's      philosophy and thinking and I know that there are a number of      people from those early days in the United World Federalists      who are here today, including Neil Potter and Ted Waller, who      worked with Alan so many years ago at the founding of that      organization.       Our next speaker has served for 26 years in the House of      Representatives. He worked very closely with Alan on many      initiatives of significance to their California constituents      and particularly to the children of their state and the      children of the entire country. We are very grateful that he      has taken time to be with us throughout this entire ceremony      this afternoon.       Representative George Miller of California. (Applause.)       Representative George Miller. Well thank you, and to all of      you, to family and friends, and colleagues. I am very, very      pleased to be able to participate in this memorial to an      extraordinary life, to clearly one of the leading California      statesmen of the 20th century.       My familiarity with Alan Cranston goes back long before my      politics, when as a young boy, I sat in the living room of      our home and listened to Alan Cranston and my father and many      other California politicians plot campaigns and create and      organize the California Democratic Council, which changed the      politics of California, changed the Democratic Party in      California, launched their careers, and later the careers of      so many other progressive politicians in the State of      California. It was a profound organization, in terms of its      influence in California. In the post-war, in the conservative      years, it was an organization, that led by Alan, would speak      out on nuclear arms control, on civil rights, on the rights      of labor--these issues that became the cornerstone for so      many of us who later sought to run for political life in the      State of California.       I think it's rather fitting that we remember Alan at this      time. Because we can remember when a conservative      administration came to this town twenty years ago and sought      to launch an attack on programs for the poor, on women and      the ill, on foster care and adoption, on child health, on      handicapped education, and so many other programs that were      targeted for elimination. Alan and his colleagues not only      led that fight, but participated in it, stood their ground,      and fought against those efforts, and today, when we see a      new administration arriving in town, we're no longer talking      about the elimination of these programs, we're talking about      making them work better. We recognize the beneficiaries of      these programs, and the benefits to our society. We now see      that, in fact, because of the fight that was made a long time      ago, we now have a legacy of understanding the role and the      importance that government plays in so many American's lives,      and the necessity of it. We've heard it with respect to      veterans, we've heard it with respect to the environment, to      women, and to so many others in American society.       Many of us would think that if you look at the last quarter      of the 20th century in American politics, you would think of      extreme ideological behavior, you'd think of political chaos,      and you would suggest that not a lot got done. But, as      already had been mentioned here, if you look at the legacy      and the workload and the work product of Alan Cranston, you      would recognize that, in fact, it was a golden age of      legislation for people like Alan Cranston. He was able to put      his signature and his work into so many efforts that became      the law of the land. I recall two of those, working with him      as a colleague in the House. One was in the 70s; in the late      70s, after five years of working together, of holding      hearings, site visits, talking with families and children, we      put together legislation to deal with the problems of foster      care, to children who were trapped in a system from which      they could not escape, families who could not get their      children back from that system, and the impact that it had on      these children. That law was later signed by President      Carter, and it was Alan's tenacity that allowed us to get it      through.       The other one of course, that's been mentioned here, is the      California Desert. Alan started pioneering that effort so      many years ago, so many years before we actually considered      it on the floor of the House or the Senate. Where he walked      over those areas, he hiked over them, he spent time with the      constituents who were interested in them, with the      organizations that were trying to preserve them. Kim has      spent much time in that area. And, after Alan left the      Senate, I managed the bill on the floor of the House. The      opponents were numerous; we used to have to have security and      armed guards to go into the hearings on the California Desert      Bill. They held the controversial ones in Beverly Hills, so      that people would have trouble getting there, it was a grand      ploy. And it worked. But, in any case, the opposition in the      House was incredible. We spent many, many, many, many days      debating this legislation, on again, off again, part of the      day, into the night. They filed numerous amendments, all of      which had unlimited debate time. They had a coterie of people      who would speak on every amendment for the maximum time      allowed, so that they could delay this bill and not see it      enacted. I called Alan and I said, ``Alan, we've got to      accept some amendments to speed this along. The members of      the House are starting to call me Moses, they've said they've      been in the desert for so long on this legislation.'' I said,     ``Some of these amendments, what can we accept to narrow this      down'', and he said, ``None''. And I said, ``Alan, this is      the House, it will never stop'', and he said, ``None''. He      said ``We can't accept them''. I talked to him about a couple      of amendments to move the boundaries, he said, ``No, I've      been there; I've been there and if you go to the bottom of      that canyon, you're going to find a little spring down      there--most people don't know it exists. You can't put that      outside the park, that's going to have to be in.'' Well, it's      turned out he was right. Dianne managed the bill on the      Senate floor, and Bill Clinton signed it into law, and now      it's one of our leading attractions in the nation and      certainly in the State of California. Those who opposed it      are now seeking authorizations and appropriations for      visitors centers and various support systems for the park.      (Laughter.) The Chambers of Commerce now think that this is a      cash register and they'd like to have it expanded, they'd      like to have the boundaries expanded, they'd like to have the      protections upgraded, so that more visitors would come and      bless their economy. It was Alan Cranston's foresight that      brought that about.       You know, the political mentor to so many of us, Phil      Burton, used to say to us that when you came to the House or      you came to the Senate, that it was a privilege and it was an      honor, and you had to pay the rent, you had to pay the rent      all the time to stay there. And I think that Alan fully      understood that while this clearly was the world's most      exclusive club, he still had to pay the rent, and he did over      and over and over again, on behalf of so many Americans, on      behalf of our environment, on behalf of world peace, on      behalf of human rights. He paid the rent constantly to earn      his right to stay here and to work and to work and to work on      behalf of all of us. And I think we should thank him, for all      of the fights that he made, and all of the ground that he      stood, on behalf of America, and all of its people. Thank you      very much, Alan. (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you, Representative Miller.       Next, we will hear from a Senator who served on two      Committees with Alan--Banking and Foreign Relations--where      they shared many common interests. Senator Kerry was a highly      decorated veteran of Vietnam and a co-founder of the Vietnam      Veterans of America, an organization which was to play an      important role in the enactment of much legislation that he      and Senator Cranston championed, particularly the Veterans'      Judicial Review Act that created the Court on which I am      honored to serve along with another former Member of Congress      who is also with us today, Chief Judge Ken Kramer.       Senator Kerry succeeded to the Democratic leadership of the      Banking Committee's Housing Subcommittee, which Senator      Cranston had chaired from 1987 to 1993. Also, I know that      Senator Kerry shares the passion that Senator Cranston lived      and breathed for ending the threat of nuclear annihilation.       Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. (Applause.)       Senator John Kerry. Thank you, Jonathan. Kim, Colette,      Evan, and R.E., it's a very special privilege to join with      all of you today in remembering the remarkable life and      achievements of our friend, Alan Cranston.       As we've heard today, and as we all know, Alan was a      sprinter, a record-holding sprinter, who, in his sixties, was      only two seconds slower than he was in his twenties when he      set the records. And I think it's safe to say that those who      knew him well would agree that he really sprinted through      life; he sprinted through the United States Senate, always      with a yellow pad in his hand and a felt-tip pen, covered      with ink, with more things on that pad to do in one day than      most of us would venture to accomplish in a week or a month,      and he got them done. And always with this incredible,      mischievous twinkle in his eye. He had fun advocating and      challenging the system.       One of the most enduring images of Alan would be at the      Iowa caucuses in 1984 at the Holiday Inn in Keokuk, Iowa,      where he was seen sprinting barefooted down 40-meter      hallways, then he'd walk back, and he'd repeat the exercise      for about 40 minutes. And I think that understanding that, we      can understand why it was no coincidence that Alan's favorite      hotel was the Chicago O'Hare Hilton, where they had 250-meter      hallways. (Laughter.)       Three weeks ago in California, we had a tender goodbye to      our friend, this sprinter, at a memorial service--calling to      mind the many ways in which he enriched our lives and this      country.       There in the Grace Cathedral, we heard Colette Cranston say      that in death Alan Cranston ``has become my Jiminy Cricket--     that little voice in [her] conscience that says, `Colette,      think before you leap.''' It would not be an exaggeration to      say that that warning was a characteristic of Alan--think      before you leap, and, most of all, he wanted us to think, he      wanted us to look, and, by God, he wanted us to leap. He      implored us to put a public face on policy. He wanted us to      think not in terms of statistics and numbers and programs,      but in terms of people; and the people he spoke of most      often, as all of my colleagues who served with him will      remember, were senior citizens, children, those without      decent housing, immigrants, those in need of a helping hand      regardless of race or religion. He was a moral voice, a voice      of conscience, someone who understood that even as he      remained vigilant in defending the needs and wishes of his      home state of California, he was also a global citizen and he      knew and felt the responsibilities of this institution,      towards the rest of the world.       Through four terms as a United States Senator, he also      remained a man of enormous humility--on his answering machine      he was simply ``Alan''--as he was to so many who worked with      him and knew him. And this personal sense of place and of      restraint made it easy to underestimate the contributions      that he made to the Senate, and to our country. Certainly      he never paused long enough to personally remind us of the      impact of his service, of the history that he was a part      of and the lives that he touched.       I first met Alan in 1971 when I had returned from Vietnam      and many of our veterans were part of an effort to end what      we thought was a failed policy in that country. In Alan      Cranston we found one of the few Senators willing not just to      join in public opposition to the war in Vietnam, but to      become a voice of healing for veterans of the war--a      statesman whose leadership enabled others, over time, to      separate their feelings about the war from their feelings for      the veterans of the war. At a time when too many wanted      literally to disown this country's own veterans, Alan      Cranston offered them a warm embrace. He was eager to do      something all too rare in Washington: To listen--and he      listened to veterans who had much to say, much of it ignored      for too long. He honored their pride and their pain with his      sensitivity and his understanding.       That's when I first came to see the great energy and the      commitment that he brought to issues affecting veterans,      especially those of the Vietnam era. He was deeply involved      on veterans' health care issues, among the first to fight for      the recognition of post-Vietnam stress syndrome, a leader in      insisting, together with Sonny Montgomery, on the extension      of coverage under the VA, under the GI Bill. And when the      Agent Orange issue came to the fore, Alan insisted on getting      answers from a government that was unresponsive. He made sure      that veterans and their families got the care that they      needed. Under his leadership, together with his partner in      the House, they increased GI Bill benefits for Vietnam      veterans--and I tell you that that was a time when veterans      too often had to fight for what was their simple due, whether      it was a memorial here in Washington, or simply to have the      government recognize that it was a war, and not simply a      conflict. Alan's leadership made all the difference. It's a      sad truth in our history that a weary nation indeed seemed      eager to turn its back on the entire war by also turning its      back on so many veterans. It should forever be a source of      pride to the Cranston family that Alan was chief among those      who insisted that America honor that service and keep faith      with sons who left pieces of themselves and years of their      lives on the battlefield in Vietnam.       This was a man who fought with extraordinary passion for      everything. And he fought at the most difficult of times. Not      just for veterans, but as we've heard from others today, he      fought against all that war represents--remembering that war,      and the killing that follows it, is the ultimate failure of      diplomacy.       Alan Cranston was above all else a man of peace. And he was      a man of peace not as a matter of public policy, but as a      matter of personal passion. Remember: This was a man who, in      1934, found himself in the same room as Adolf Hitler. Five      years later, he wrote a critical English translation of Adolf      Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' in an effort to reveal the German      leader's true plans. And he wore Hitler's ensuing lawsuit as      a badge of honor, proud that he had stood up to try and warn      the English-speaking world about the evils of Nazism.       Throughout the rest of his service he used public office to      force Americans to listen to other prescient warnings--about      nuclear war, about the arms race, about hopes for peace that      he refused to give up even as others chose to beat the drums      of war.       Senator Cranston came to his famous commitment, as we      learned from the film, after meeting with Albert Einstein in      1946. And he left that meeting convinced that he had found      his mission and he would indeed spend the balance of his life      arguing that conviction before the world.       As a member of the Senate leadership and a senior voice on      the Democratic side of the Foreign Relations Committee, he      worked tirelessly to reduce the nuclear threat. Obviously,      there were many of those efforts, but one of the most      unpublicized was his effort through the 1970s and 80's, when      he convened a unique group known as the ``SALT Study Group''.      A senators-only gathering monthly in his office, off the      record, face-to-face to define the confines of the debate. He      knew the impact that quiet diplomacy could have on the      issues, but on this issue above all that he cared about the      most.       He loved the Peace Corps, and he fought for it. He fought      to attach human rights conditions on aid to El Salvador. He      was a leading national advocate for the mutual verifiable      freeze. He was always an idealist whose increase in political      power, gratefully, was always met by progress for the issues      that he cared about so deeply. It was not just the work of a      career, but the work of a lifetime--and after he left the      Senate, we all know the remarkable commitment that he     continued with Mikhail Gorbachev and ultimately in his      founding of the Global Security Institute.       He did that because he sensed that the end of the Cold War,      with all of the opportunity that it afforded, which he      understood, still left us a world that was more dangerous,      and he was haunted by the threat of nuclear terrorism. We      missed his voice in the debate on the test ban treaty, and we      miss him even more today.       When he left the Senate, Alan reflected on his service and      he said of his own legacy, simply: ``Most of all, I have      dedicated myself to the cause of peace.''       That dedication was real, it was lasting, and the legacy of      peace for a good and peaceful man who gave living embodiment      to Culbertson's simple, stubborn faith that ``God and the      politicians willing, the United States can declare peace upon      the world, and win it.'' That belief was Alan Cranston--and      it's a belief still worth fighting for. (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Our concluding speaker from this      body is also one of its newest members. She traveled to      California three weeks ago, as did Senator Kerry, as he told      us, to attend the ceremony attended by over a thousand      persons at the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. For reasons      that I know she will share with us, she will be--along with      Max Cleland--a living legacy of Alan Cranston in the United      States Senate.       Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington. (Applause.)       Senator Maria Cantwell. Thank you. To Kim and Colette and      Evan and R.E., thank you for allowing me to share this      occasion to remember Alan and to have been there a few weeks      ago and to see so many of the friends and faces that Alan      touched.       People today have talked about Alan's legislative career--     the many pieces of legislation that will live with us for a      long time. But I'd like to share with you today maybe a      different Alan Cranston that I knew as I worked on his      Presidential campaign in 1983 and 1984. Some people might      think running for President is a glorious task, but it is a      very difficult one that I think Alan knew would help aid the      cause and message that he wanted to fight for. In fact, I'm      not from Washington state originally; it was Alan Cranston      that dropped me off there in 1983. In fact, the first time I      ever visited, I was a part of his presidential campaign      staff, in which he left me at SEA-TAC Airport in Seattle and      went on about his business to campaign. But people who knew      Alan knew that he jumped into that race to deliver a message      for the right reason. I was fortunate enough to have read      R.E.'s book about Alan, and knew all the things that Alan had      fought through in his life, some of the things that have been      mentioned today. About being sued by Adolf Hitler for      translating in next to no time a version of ``Mein Kampf''.      Being a pre-World War II journalist and being smart enough to      understand what was going to be advocated and running back to      the United States and having that published. And all of the      other wonderful things that Alan did in helping women, and on      the environment; one thing I haven't heard mentioned today is      his work with Native Americans, which is something that I      recognize.       But what was amazing about Alan from a personal      perspective, and you definitely get to know someone from a      personal perspective when you travel with him on a      presidential campaign, is that Alan was very self      disciplined. John Kerry talked about his running, and that      was something that was very important to Alan on a daily      basis. And, yes, I can attest to the fact that he did sprint      in the hotel corridors when you didn't schedule time for him      to run outside. But, when Alan, challenged with the fact that      maybe some of the other hotel guests found it shocking to      find somebody so tall and long running down the halls at 7:30      in the morning, the Senator replied, ``well maybe I should      start at 6:30 instead.'' (Laughter.)       But Alan never complained about that task. And for me, in      Washington state, there were lots of World Federalists, a lot      of people part of the nuclear freeze movement, a lot of      people very appreciative of his efforts on the environment.      But Alan was also a very self-deprecating person when it came      to making a moment light. And I'll never forget the time in      Vancouver, Washington, where hundreds of people had showed up      at eight-thirty on a Sunday morning, I think it was the      Fourth of July, to hear his message about the nuclear freeze.      And when he mistakenly called the host of the event, whose      name was ``June'', ``Jane'', and he heard a gasp from the      audience, he quickly looked down at his program and saw that      he had mistakenly called her the wrong name, and all of a      sudden started pounding on his chest, saying, ``Me Tarzan!      You Jane!'' (Laughter.) Which put everybody at ease, and Alan      went on to give his very important remarks to a community      that I don't think has seen since the likes of Alan Cranston.       And yet, when you run a Presidential campaign, you also are      a spokesperson for your issues. But I never saw Alan take      advantage of that situation, where he was trying to make more      than the situation called for. In fact, he was very reserved      in his comments. I remember being with him on August 31, in      1983, when the Korean Airline flight 007 was shot down. We      happened to be in Anchorage, Alaska, at that time, and many      of you probably know the various controversies that arose out      of that; 269 people were killed. And I remember waking up      that morning to a press event where probably 200 different      people were there, including the national press, all wanting      Alan to make a statement right away; because he was a      Presidential candidate, because his remarks would be all over      the news. And yet Alan had the self discipline not just to      say something immediately that morning, but to say, in a      calming way, ``let's find out the facts, first.'' And when I      think about that as a human being, particularly in my new      post and job, in which the world moves so fast and in which      people go about promoting their idea and concepts, the very      human side of Alan Cranston remains with me, and I hope it      does with each of you.       I talked to him in October of this year, in which I was out      campaigning in Bellingham, Washington, one of the last places      I had to campaign with him, and I said to him, ``Senator, you      dropped me off here almost seventeen years ago, and you never      picked me up.'' And Alan reminded me that is was time to work      together. So I guess I say to Kim, and Colette, and R.E., and      to those of you who are going to carry on the Cranston      legacy, that he left in each one of us a piece of that flame      that he carried for so long. You saw it on the film. It      started when Albert Einstein said to him, ``nuclear arms      could wipe out a whole race of people.'' I think Alan started      saying that from that moment on, and reminded people about it      until his last days. And so I hope that each and every one of      you, as I will, carries part of that torch and flame that      Alan had of self-discipline, knowing that he was not the      message, but the messenger, in helping this fight. Thank you.      (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. And now we'll hear from Alan      Cranston's son Kim, who I know is committed to seeing that      Alan's lifelong commitment to securing world peace is carried      on as his most important bequest to his granddaughter Evan      and all the children of our planet.       Kim. (Applause.)       Kim Cranston. Thank you, all. Those of you who were      familiar with the legal pads that Alan carried around and the      black pens will be happy to know that Evan is over here busy      making a ``to do'' list. (Laughter.) I'm not sure what it all      includes.       Jonathan, thank you very much for helping to organize this,      and everybody else who was involved in this, the Senate      sponsors, and each of the other speakers; I deeply appreciate      your kind and touching words about Alan and his work here.      It's good to see all of you, so many old friends. It's sad      under the circumstances that we come together, but it's      wonderful to see you all again. I know how much Alan      cherished your friendship and collaboration over the years.       I was really truly blessed, I feel, to have, through the      genetic lottery, ended up as Alan's son, and had the      opportunity to get to know him as my father, as my dearest      and oldest friend, and as a wonderful collaborator, mentor,      teacher, and leader. And I know his loss as a leader is a      loss we all share.       I've been reflecting over the last month on many of the      things that I've learned from Alan and our work together,      living with him, and a few things stand out that I wanted to      share today. One thing that stood out for me was the      remarkable style of leadership he had. Inside the program is      the poem that he carried, the Lao-Tzu quote, for most of his      life, that really informed the style of leadership that he      practiced. It concludes with:     But of a good leader,     When his work is done,     His aim fulfilled,     They will all say,     ``We did this ourselves.''       And so today, we're here, recognizing what we accomplished      together with Alan. And so it's an opportunity not only to      mourn his loss, but to celebrate what we accomplished      together, and I think, beyond that, to recommit, and commit      to the ongoing causes that we engaged in with him.       Another lesson that has stood out in the last month for me      was something that I really remember when I first began      hearing it from him. I was told the central purpose of life      was to make the world a better place, or, as one of Alan's      heros, Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ``life's most      persistent and urgent question is `what are you doing to      serve others?' '' And it was certainly in that spirit that      Alan conducted his life and committed most of his public      life.       And, finally, one other thing that stands out very strongly      for me, both in terms of the work that he did here in      Washington, and to the work that he continued to do after he      left Washington, was his recognition of the extraordinary      moment in history in which we all live. In that regard, I      just note that a friend commented after Alan had left the      Senate, that they had seen him, and they said, ``Kim, you      know, he doesn't seem to be slowing down, he seems to be      speeding up.'' And I think that was true, because he said      to me that he'd felt since he left the Senate that he      could really focus in on the things that he was most      concerned about, to devote 100% of his energy to those      causes that were of greatest concern to him. And I think      the cornerstone of that was an understanding that we have      entered a new age during our lifetime, when we're facing      global challenges that can be addressed only at the global      level, and that we need to come up with effective new      approaches for dealing with those challenges.       After he left the Senate, the cause did continue, most      recently in the form of the Global Security Institute, which      is continuing,     and it has a great board, and a wonderful director, Jonathan      Granoff, our CEO, who is here today. And I would really urge      those of you who are here today who shared in those causes      with Alan to look forward to opportunities to collaborate      with us, because the work goes on, and Alan was just the      messenger.       In closing, I'd just like to say something I know Alan      closed most of his speeches with, which was, ``I thank you      for all you are doing, and urge you onward.'' Thank you.      (Applause.)       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you, Kim. I know your      father would be proud of your personal actions to pick up the      torch and deeply moved by your words.       I want to close with some expressions of thanks to many      people. Again, I want to note how grateful all of us are to      the sponsoring Senators and to all who spoke so eloquently      and movingly about the man who will live forever in my heart      as ``Alan,'' as the most important influence on the lives of      so many of us in this room today.       The presence here throughout this entire ceremony of three      Cabinet officials in this new Administration should remind us      all of Alan's abiding belief that it was possible to form an      alliance with every Senator on one issue or another, and of      his commitment to do just that. Common ground and common      sense was much more important to him than party affiliation      or political philosophy. We thank the three Secretaries who      joined us today and helped remind us of how important those      sentiments are for the welfare of our country.       There are an enormous number of people who volunteered      their time and did just incredible work to make this tribute      as successful and meaningful as we hope that it has been. If      I leave anyone out, I apologize--as I do, and as I did      before, if I left out any former officeholder, who I should      have recognized earlier. So, I offer special thanks, on      behalf of the family and myself, alphabetically, to Zack      Allen, Bill Brew, Fran Butler, Monique Ceruti, Kelly Cordes,      Chad Griffin, Bill Johnstone, Susanne Martinez, Katie      O'Neill, Dan Perry, Valerie Rheinstein, Alexandra Sardegna,      Ed Scott, Martha Stanley, Loraine Tong, Joel Wood, and one      most special person, Elinor Tucker, without whose highly      efficient logistical support we would never have made it to      this point. I thank Senator Rockefeller for allowing her to      put in so much time and effort and to do so in such an      effective way. Finally, an even more personal thanks to my      wife, Shellie, for helping to keep me on an relatively even      keel over the past month as this event was pulled together.       And, finally, thanks to all of you who joined us in tribute      today to Senator Alan McGregor Cranston, a great American who      lived his life by the philosophy of a Chinese poet Lao-Tzu,      whose words on leadership, printed in today's program, Alan      carried with him every day.       That concludes this Tribute. Please remember to sign the      guest book, and thanks again for coming. And we'll go out to      the theme song from Alan's Presidential campaign, ``Chariots      of Fire''. (Applause.)                          ____________________
