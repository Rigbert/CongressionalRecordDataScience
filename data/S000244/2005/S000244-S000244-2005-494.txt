Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment makes technical changes to the section of the bill that sets forth the information plaintiffs must provide in order for a judge to determine whether the lawsuit is banned by the bill or allowed to go forward under one of the bill's exceptions.  These minor changes are meant to provide a judge with a clear understanding of the type of information the judge is to consider in deciding a motion to dismiss under H.R. 554.  The pleading provision in H.R. 554 is meant to apply to any action claiming obesity-related damages, and this amendment makes clear that the pleading requirements will apply to all cases seeking obesity-related damages.  Also adding the phrase ``for each defendant and cause of action'' clarifies that a judge must apply H.R. 554's pleading requirements to each specific claim. This prevents a plaintiff from improperly using a claim that is not barred by H.R. 554 as a means of pursuing obesity-related claims that are barred by the bill against the same or other defendants. This change would prevent entire industries from being ensnared in lawsuits where the relevant facts relate to only one company.  Finally, other technical changes would simply ensure consistency by using the same terms in the pleading sections as are used elsewhere in the bill.  I would ask all of my colleagues to support these common sense, technical amendments.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
