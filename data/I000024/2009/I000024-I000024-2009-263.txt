Let me mention one other point of equal significance, and it is somewhat controversial.  I just got back a couple days ago from Guantanamo Bay. I have been down there several times. As a matter of fact, I was one of the first Members--I think the first Member of Congress, of either House, to be there after 9/11. I have watched it as the years have gone by, the criticism of things happening at Guantanamo Bay that have never happened at Guantanamo Bay. People are talking about torturing and all these things. This is not the truth.  What really bothers me is, all you have to do, if you want to know the truth about it, is pull up on your computer the Red Cross Web site.
