It is deeply concerning to me that every year we are compelled to gather in this chamber to remind the world of the devastating events that led to the division of Cyprus, and to remember those who were killed, injured, or displaced when Turkey invaded the island in 1974. It remains very clear to me, and to most of my colleagues, as well as the vast majority of the international community, that Cyprus must be made whole again and Turkey must be held accountable for its reprehensible actions in dividing the island.  Just fourteen years after gaining its independence from Great Britain, Cyprus was illegally invaded by 6,000 Turkish troops and 40 tanks. These troops swept over the northern section of Cyprus, occupying nearly 40 percent of the island, and forcing hundreds of thousands from their homes. To date, more than 1,600 people remain unaccounted for, including five American citizens.  Thirty-six years after the invasion, we gather to honor and remember those who died. The world does not forget that Cyprus remains a nation divided and that over three thousand Turkish troops still illegally occupy almost half of the island in violation of international law.  As Cyprus is a member of the European Union (EU), a strong ally of the United States, and a stable democracy in the Mediterranean, we need to continue to send a clear message to Turkey that the illegal and immoral occupation of Cyprus will not be tolerated.  In an effort to move forward, Cyprus has extended the benefits of EU citizenship to both Greek and Turkish Cypriots on both sides of the divide, and there have been subtle exchanges and partnerships between the two communities since 2003. Residents now have the ability to travel freely between Cyprus and the occupied North.  Even with these positive developments, some aspects of the division remain intractable. The number of Turkish troops in the North is the same as thirty-six years ago. Greek religious sights in the North continue to suffer from neglect. Communities may be free to travel, but the island is still divided into ethnic enclaves.  I am optimistic that President Obama has identified bringing the Greek and Turkish communities together in a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation as a priority, along with the EU. Most importantly, this is also the goal of the Cypriot people. On the thirty-sixth anniversary of the division of Cyprus, I encourage Cypriot President Demetrius Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat to strengthen their efforts to remove Turkish troops, free movement between the Greek and Turkish communities, and end the division of Cyprus. It is time for us in Congress, with President Obama's commitment, to move Cyprus to a future of peace and prosperity.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to join with my colleagues in standing against Turkish oppression in Cyprus. Thirty-six years is a long time to wait, but it is my sincerest hope that our actions will persuade Turkey to end its unlawful occupation of Cyprus.                          ____________________
