President, if you will look at the funds to invest in forindividuals, virtually all of them suggest there is going to be an administrative cost in that instance. Most of them require a minimum investment of $2,000 because, frankly, the administrative costs can be so overwhelming. You tend to ignore that when you talk about the creation of personal accounts.  The British, in their experience in the United Kingdom, found that the administrative costs got out of hand to the point where they had to step in after several years. They also will step in because fraud was taking place. People were deluding future retirees into believing they were going to win in the market if they invested. That is a case in point where they tried to take the retirement savings in the United Kingdom using your model, and it didn't work. The administrative costs were far greater than they anticipated. Also, there was a fraud involved.  Taking money and putting it in the stock market is an option every American should have. But to use the Social Security funds of an individual for that purpose raises a risk that is too great for some people.  If the Senator from Pennsylvania suggests in the Thrift Savings Plan, the Federal retirees--he did not say that is part of our retirement; that is our savings account, over and above our retirement. I support what Al Gore supported, as do most Democrats, Social Security Plus. That allows people to invest in the Social Security over and above their Social Security. That would give them a chance to take advantage of a good market and not be eaten alive by administrative costs or defrauded out of the basic needs to survive.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The next question is from the Democrats.
