 President, since 2010 I have sponsored a State of the Union essay contest for Vermont students. The contest, now in its fifth year, is an opportunity for Vermont students to articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United States. A panel of Vermont teachers reviewed all of the essays submitted and selected the top twenty. I am proud to say that more than 400 students wrote essays for this year's State of the Union contest.  I would like to congratulate each and every finalist, and to specifically acknowledge Leo Lehrer-Small as this year's winner of the contest. I would also like to recognize Ryan Taggard for placing second and Craig Pelsor and Hadley Menk for placing third. I ask to have printed in the Record the winning essays.  The essays follow.      LEO LEHRER-SMALL, MOUNT MANSFIELD UNION HIGH SCHOOL (WINNER)       As we enter the year of 2015, there is one issue in      particular that our government, in conjunction with global      policy makers, need to address with attention and urgency.      This issue, quite simply, is the safety of our planet: global      climate change is already affecting the environment through      droughts, increasingly frequent heat waves, and rising sea      levels. It is a scientific fact that climate change is man-     made, even though some politicians still deny the part that      humans play in the issue.       As the most powerful country in the world, the US must be a      driving force in halting global climate change. The question      is: how do we go about doing this? In order to fix our      growing crisis, we must first understand the roots of the      problem. Last year's report released by the Intergovernmental      Panel on Climate Change showed that the recent rise of      temperature is due to an excess of greenhouse gases that      humans have released into our atmosphere. And to quote the      Environmental Protection Agency, ``The largest source of      greenhouse gas emissions from human activities in the United      States is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat,      and transportation.'' So it is clear; the root of our problem      is our overuse of fossil fuels.       We must take drastic measures to reduce our fossil fuel      consumption. Congress must make and pass bills that finance      green energy projects. Government subsidies which are      currently being given to the oil and gas industries should be      given to the renewable energy industry. This boost would      allow renewable and clean energy sources such as wind and      solar to provide more of the nation's energy, and in return      lower our usage of fossil fuels. The growth of clean energy      usage in the US would not only play a role in climate change      reversal, but also provide millions of safe jobs for American      workers.       Furthermore, our government should heavily tax the large      greenhouse gas producers; companies that burn cheap fossil      fuels to make massive amounts of money. These are the main      contributors to climate change. These are the corporations      that we must limit through a tax on carbon dioxide. Such a      tax would not only discourage the burning of fossil fuels,      but the money may also be invested in the redevelopment of      clean energy.       And as one of the leaders in our global economy, the rest      of the world will look to us to initiate the transition      towards clean energy usage. We have the opportunity to     globally legitimize renewable energy, which is a vital step      towards ending climate change. The action that our country      takes on this problem will be a model for the rest of the      world, which makes it the most important issue that should be      addressed by the United States. Not taking care of the planet      is not taking care of the people.       RYAN TAGGARD, BRATTLEBORO UNION HIGH SCHOOL (SECOND PLACE)       The state of our country has seen marked improvement over      the last year. Unemployment is at its lowest level since      before the recession, the stock market is setting record      highs, and a manufacturing sector that has added jobs for the      first time in nearly two decades. But we're working to regain      lost ground, while neglecting the importance of innovating,      creating, and aspiring--the very aspects that once made our      country great.       Throughout the 60's and 70's, America was the planet's      premier superpower. Despite the threat of an aggressive      U.S.S.R. looming on the horizon, campus unrest, the conflict      in Vietnam, and the civil rights movement playing out in      confrontations on the street, we found time to dream about      tomorrow. The engine of this growth was the relentless      advancement of science and technology. Our crowned jewel,      NASA, was among the most powerful agencies the world had ever      seen, and promised us a future full of plenty. We didn't      outsource jobs, because no other nation could do what America      could. We spawned entire industries built around new      inventions. And most importantly, we gained a technological      edge, strengthening our military, infrastructure, and      economy.       MRIs, GPS receivers, cochlear implants, Lasik surgery,      catalytic converters, the first fuel cells, cordless tools,      cell phones, and the microprocessors that enable our lives      are all direct results of our first forays into the abyss of      space. Due to our curiosity, hundreds of thousands of lives      were saved. Patients who were born deaf were given the      ability to hear. The blind could see. The environment was      restored in numerous and invaluable ways, and communication      became constant and universal. Curiosity enabled our nation      to perform miracles.       Unfortunately for our nation, NASA was formed in the midst      of a panic induced by the launch of the Soviet's Sputnik.      Once the American government saw that the U.S.S.R. wasn't      ready to go to the moon, they ceded their push to move      forwards. Today NASA's spending represents 0.49% of our      federal budget. This half a penny off the tax dollar pays for      all of NASA's operations: the International Space Station,      Hubble telescope, Curiosity rover, all the astronauts, and      more. With only a slight increase in funding, we could go      back to the moon, send men to Mars, and journey on to explore      asteroids and alien worlds.       The incentives for raising NASA's budget are diverse,      powerful, and irrespective of party. As well as providing an      opportunity for our government to assume a leadership      position, the economic stimulus that accompanies a revived      space industry would create new jobs, the technologies      developed would improve our lives, and the cultural shift      that occurred in the 60's and 70's would once again become      the norm. Students would aspire to become scientists,      engineers, mathematicians, and technologists. We as a nation      would reclaim our former spot at the very forefront of      innovation. And America would reap the benefits of an      educated, industrial, and forward thinking workforce.     HADLEY MENK, CHAMPLAIN VALLEY UNION HIGH SCHOOL (THIRD PLACE)       The future of our great nation is being threatened at this      very moment, and the foe may not be what you suspect. The      current states of our agricultural practices are harming our      country's future in catastrophic ways. Before a country can      focus on issues like health care, gun control, abortion, or      even the functioning of its own government, it must make sure      the people's basic needs are met. And nothing is more basic      or essential than food.       The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization      estimates that the world's population will reach 9 billion      people within the next 40 years. To meet this need, global      agricultural production must increase by 70%. Elected      officials of the United States must take this seriously.      Fortunately, agriculture is a subject in which Vermont is      well versed. It is time for Vermont to lead the way in      advocating for more efficient, effective, and sustainable      agriculture. Investing in agriculture is one of the simplest      but most effective ways for the United States to protect its      future as a nation and as a world leader.       There are several interconnected issues currently facing      our agriculture industry, the most important of which are      affordability, water, and land management. Food prices tend      to fluctuate depending on the price of oil, as petroleum      products are widely used in almost all aspects of food      production. From trucks and equipment to synthetic      fertilizers and pesticides, petroleum plays too large a role      in our food. Emphasis must be placed on finding more natural      alternatives to petroleum. Water and land management are also      major issues. As is evidenced by the crisis in California,      more needs to be done in terms of finding ways to better      conserve water for agriculture. According to the Index Mundi,      in North America in 1961, the amount of arable land per      person was 1.1 hectares. In 2009, that number had decreased      to .61 per person, due to land misuse. Legislators on a      local, state, and national level need to work with scientists      to solve these potentially catastrophic problems.       Without agriculture, it is impossible for any country to      survive. Widespread food shortages can cause not only      starvation but also corruption in the government. Investing      in food production benefits everyone, regardless of race,      gender, socioeconomic status, or political party, and yet      agriculture is not treated with as much attention as issues      like gun control and immigration in the media.       In order to preserve the future of the United States, we as      Vermonters must lead the way in urging legislators to endorse      measures that will improve agricultural methods and help      farmers be more sustainable. In a letter to George Washington      dated August 14, 1787, Thomas Jefferson stated that      ``Agriculture . . . is our wisest pursuit, because it will in      the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals and      happiness.''             CRAIG PELSOR, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL (THIRD PLACE)       The United States of America is without a doubt in a better      position now than it was ten years ago. The economy has      rebounded and the few lingering effects of the ``Great      Recession'' are being mended. The national unemployment rate      stands at 5.9% as of September, the lowest it's been since      2008. The United States is producing more oil, natural gas      and energy from renewable resources than ever before, which      seeks to further the eventual dream of an energy independent      America. In addition, rates for violent and property crimes      continue to decline and our national GDP continues to outpace      every other nations.       Even with the future seeming so bright, there remains still      pressing issues to which we must give our full attention.       As the economy has recovered and grown, so has the gap      between the rich and the poor, and even the rich and the      super-rich. We hear of the wealthiest one percent's still      growing fortunes while those in the 30th or 10th percentile      are still waiting for the wealth to trickle down. That has      not worked, and we must do something to stem the tide of this      growing inequality. To do this we must raise the minimum wage      until it is a livable wage in all fifty states, as well as      reorganizing our tax structure so that those with the most      wealth are contributing more than those without. There is      also the issue of massive student loan debts which dampen the      potential success of graduates. With the average student loan      debt growing, there are a number of steps we could take to      make paying for higher education less of a financial burden.      Expand the federal student loan program to grant more money      to those who need it, while at the same time ensuring public      colleges and universities do not raise their tuitions. The      system of federally subsidized Universities used in Canada      and some Europeans nations could easily be adopted in the      United States in order to keep the working costs of our      colleges and universities at a level where they will not need      to raise their tuition costs every year.       On a global front, there continues the troubles in the      Middle East and abroad, for which America has a duty to      respond with both humanitarian aid and military force to      ensure a lasting peace in the region. The arming of so called      ``moderate'' rebels in conflicts in Syria have proven of      little aid to America or its interests as well as the weapons      and intelligence we provide ending up in unintended hands.      Also, the billions of dollars of military aid to countries      such as Israel which has become a massively unnecessary      expenditure. In light of this, America should adopt a renewed      focus on bettering education opportunities and the general      standards of living in the Middle East and avoid joining any      new conflicts. The containment and destruction of ISIS should      remain a top priority, although the commitment of ground      troops to the area should be withheld unless the situation      gets far worse.       A chasm of trust has grown between American citizens and      those put in charge of their protection, law enforcement, due      to a lack of transparency and discretion. To that end, the      United States government must provide the states with      incentive to equip local law enforcement with things such as      body cameras instead of armored vehicles and assault rifles,      as well as further training in dealing with the mentally ill      and minorities where it is most needed. Until the people feel      like police officers are being held accountable for their      actions, we cannot expect to further improve the nation.       Another small change which may help stem the continuing      rise in prescription drug abuse would be the outlawing of      television, radio and internet advertising for all      prescription drugs. With this people will be less likely to      believe that they need all of the drugs that they see on      television and that they are all safe because they are being      publicly advertised.       There is no one solution to all the nation's problems, but      through many small steps and congressional efforts like the      ones that I have mentioned can make the United States of      America a much stronger and prosperous nation.                          ____________________
