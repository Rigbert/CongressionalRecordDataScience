I would like to let the Senator from Massachusetts know that I have withheld the entire day from coming to the floor and speaking about the DREAM Act, which we will be voting on first thing in the morning, although it is very important to me. I wished to give every Senator the opportunity on both sides of the aisle to discuss the New START treaty. I would like to say to the Senator from Massachusetts that when his debate on this matter ends today, as late as it may be, I will come to the floor and speak on the DREAM Act, but I don't want to interrupt what he is doing at this moment in his efforts to give everyone a chance to speak about this national security measure. So that this is in the form of a question, doesn't that sound reasonable?
