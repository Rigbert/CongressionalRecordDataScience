Obviously, you could finish the term that you are in; the Constitution would require that. But if, at the end of that term, you fit the number, whether it is two in the Senate and whatever it might be in the House, you would have to leave. That would be true term limits.  I say this because I have heard a number of Members of the House who have been here for 20 years who say they are for term limits, and we have at least one senior Member of this body who has been for term limits literally before I was born but is still here.  Would the Senator from Missouri support my amendment to make term limits effective immediately, that is, at the end of whatever term you are in? If you fit the bill you are out?
