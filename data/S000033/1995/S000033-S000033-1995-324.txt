 They are often part-time jobs. They are jobs without any health care or any other benefits. And it seems to me that if anyone is going to talk about welfare reform or anything else, we must make sure that in this country that those people who are working for a living have the right to live in dignity, have the right after 40 hours of work to keep their heads above poverty.  I think you and I are going to go forward as vigorously as we can to demand hearings here in the House and in the Senate and pass the minimum wage. The President's bill does not go as far as I would like to see it go, but it is a step forward which would impact not only on those workers making $4.25, but obviously those workers making $4.50, $5 or $5.20 an hour as well.
