 President, we live in a time of diverse and challenging global threats. It is a time when we see ISIL consolidating its gains in both Iraq and Syria. It is a time when we see the forces of Assad marching alongside Iranian soldiers and Hezbollah militias. It is a time when we see Russian aircraft flying above them in support, and it is a time when commanders tell us that additional resources are required to ensure the safety and preparedness of our troops. I think it is time to finally support the men and women who volunteer to protect us. The last excuse not to do so--the setting of a top-line budget number--has been cleared away. We fixed that. There is no reason that our colleagues shouldn't join us in moving forward now.  These brave men and women aren't poker chips in some Washington political game. They are the sisters, fathers, daughters, and neighbors who voluntarily and selflessly put themselves in harm's way so that we might live free. These are the men and women we will salute this month on Veterans Day. It is not enough just to support those who defend us then; we need to support them right now.                          ____________________
