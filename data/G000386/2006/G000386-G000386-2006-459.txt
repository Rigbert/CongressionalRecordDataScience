 President, I would like to inform the Senator from New Jersey that his motion would increase taxes on people in New Jersey through dividends of $838,000 and capital gains of $270,000.  If we don't do something about AMT, 600,000 people from New Jersey suffer; if we don't have the college tuition tax deduction, 121,000; and teacher deduction, 127,000.  I don't know how anybody would want to increase taxes on people in their States by that amount of money. If you take the approach of the Senator from New Jersey and have to offset all of these things, there are not enough offsets to go around to take care of the 100 ideas we have of where taxes ought to be reduced.  We now have taxes of 18 percent coming into the country into the Gross National Product for a 60-year high.  How high do taxes have to be to satisfy the Senator from New Jersey that taxes are high enough?
