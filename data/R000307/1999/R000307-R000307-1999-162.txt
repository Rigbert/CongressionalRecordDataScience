There is no question about that.  I am not sure I could still support or still support--I never did support--the use of ground troops, unless I know what their specific mission is: What do we expect them to do. And then, if you ``win,'' if we could ever define ``winning,'' what is it that we have won.  So from the standpoint of tactics, I say again to the chairman, I am very hopeful, once this war is over, we hope and pray that all of this talk that has been rather critical will be secondary, and, if Milosevic would agree to some of the negotiating principles that have been offered, we shall see. I see where one NATO general indicated it is going to take another 2 months. I hope that is not the case.  I hope the Senate Armed Services Committee--and I ask the chairman, would it be his intent to take a hard look. I have a subcommittee that looks at low-intensity conflicts--this became a high-intensity conflict--and military tactics and strategy. I hope we can take a look at this, especially with the asymmetrical threat that Mr. Milosevic has used so well against us. He basically took one look at our tactics and acted accordingly and played rope-a-dope. He has achieved most of his objectives. That seems to me to be a real problem here. I hope we have those hearings.  Again, I go back to the genesis of this whole business, and that is a Strategic Concept that puts us in far different pastures. I know there will be some of my colleagues who say this is not a treaty. The fact that we are having this debate today, I think, is encouraging. We had a debate on ratification of NATO expansion last year. To my knowledge, we have not had any debate, or very little discussion, of this Strategic Concept and what it means.  So the Senator's cosponsorship of this amendment is much appreciated. If, in fact it is not a treaty, it has the effect of a treaty.
