President, a bipartisan group of legislators, Congressmen from this region, came up with an idea that is a very good one. It is an effort to try to promote higher education among the residents of the District of Columbia.  Washington, DC, does not have a major public university. The young people in D.C. are disadvantaged. People living in the State of Texas, young people living in the State of Illinois can consider a number of public universities and colleges and qualify for in-State resident tuition, which is usually much lower than those out of State.  That same benefit is not available for the young people in the District of Columbia by and large, and this scholarship idea, which was promoted by the Clinton administration, as well as local Congressmen and many others in this area, has come forward. It is one that I wholeheartedly support. I think this tuition assistance program is an excellent idea. The estimated cost is about $17 million a year. That sum is appropriated in this bill.  Having said that, though, I have taken exception to a fact of life in the District of Columbia. I mentioned at the outset that the District of Columbia is going through major reform, major revitalization. We have changed the Federal contribution to help the District in some regards. For example, we are paying more Medicaid in the District of Columbia than in my home State of Illinois. We are paying for certain benefits, like a $5,000 tax credit for those first-time homebuyers in the District, things to encourage the District of Columbia to stand on its own feet.  They have made progress. I give credit to Mayor Williams and the city council for a lot of positive things that have occurred in a very short period of time.  Having said that, though, there is an action by the D.C. City Council which I consider to be the height of irresponsibility. That was a decision by this city council this year to give $59 million in tax cuts to D.C. residents.  Mark my words, any politician would like to stand up and say: I am going to give you a tax cut. Everyone applauds. That is a natural applause line. But when you take a look at the District of Columbia and the situation that it faces, it is almost incredible that they would decide at this moment in history that they have $59 million they can't figure out how to spend; $59 million they want to return in tax cuts, some of them in the neighborhood of $100 or $150 a year, $2 a week, $3 a week, for a total of $59 million. This is a tax cut in a city that has serious infrastructure problems and serious problems when it comes to the very basic things.  Let me give you an example. Here we are at the Capitol Building. A lot of my staff members live nearby. One of my staffers said to me the other evening: I am going home.  I said: Do you need a ride?  He said: I just live five blocks away. He paused and said: But come to think of it, a woman was stabbed and murdered in my neighborhood last week. I will take a ride, if you don't mind.  I said: Do you know what you need in your neighborhood, where murders are occurring? You need a tax cut.  Well, I think we know better. The people in the District of Columbia, more than anything else, need police protection. They need protection because we have the highest murder rate in the Nation right here in the District of Columbia, more than twice the next city in any State in this entire country.  I had some time to look over what has happened with the D.C. Police Department. The D.C. City Council can't seem to see any need there beyond the current budget. In fact, they want to give away $59 million.  Let me tell you a little bit about the D.C. Police Department. I think it has a good chief. Chief Ramsey comes from Chicago. I think he is making changes. But they wanted to have 3,800 policemen in the District of Columbia, and they can't find them. They found about 3,500, so they are short of the mark of even having the force in the city that they hope to have.  When the new chief took over a year ago, he looked around the District of Columbia Police Department and learned that 75 percent of the telephones in the D.C. Police Department were rotary phones. This is like traveling in Eastern Europe after the wall came down and discovering what is left of the Soviet empire. You travel around the D.C. city government and wonder how in the world did it get so bad.  This D.C. City Council can look beyond that. They can look beyond thefact that the policemen in the District of Columbia were not receiving firearms training a year ago. They can look beyond the fact that the D.C. policemen were not even trained for conducting sobriety tests. Can you imagine that? They didn't pull over speeders who were drunk because only 200 of the policemen, out of 3,800, had been trained in giving a basic sobriety test. In most cities in the Nation, 100 percent of the force receives that training.  The deficiencies, one after another, stack up until the people in this poor city worry more about getting hit in the head than whether they are going to get a tax cut. This is really, in my mind, quite a tragedy. If it were a family situation and you were trying to draw an analogy, the D.C. City Council decided to go out and buy a big screen TV although it couldn't afford to buy a lock for the front door of the house. That is what the tax cut is all about.  Give away $59 million in a city with these problems? That is not it alone. As I mentioned earlier, the D.C. public schools really need help. They have brought on some new people in an effort to try to deal with that. I hope it works. But the belief by the D.C. City Council that putting money into summer programs, early childhood development, afterschool programs is unnecessary, really strikes me as insensitive to the reality of the need for improving public education in the District of Columbia.  When the Mayor came and spoke to us, incidentally, he told us something which was troubling--I have a chart that demonstrates it--on children in the District of Columbia. The Casey Foundation took a look at kids in the District of Columbia, kids in Washington, DC. With one exception--and they looked at all the different criteria for children, and that was the high school dropout rate--the District of Columbia ranked worst in the Nation in every category involving children.  D.C. City Council, are you listening? The children you represent in these wards out here are the worst in the Nation in every single category. You can't figure out where to put $59 million, so you want to declare a dividend and give it away.  Why don't you consider, for a moment, the percent of low-birth-weight babies in the District of Columbia, the worst in the Nation, worse than any other State; the infant death rate in the District of Columbia is the worst in the Nation, twice the national average; the child death rate; the rate of teen deaths by accident and homicide; the teen birth rate; the percent of teens not attending school and not working; the percent of children living with parents who do not have full-time, year-round employment is last place in the District of Columbia; the percent of children in poverty; the percent of families headed by a single parent is the worst in the Nation.  The D.C. City Council has blinders on when it comes to the kids in the District of Columbia. They are more intent on the theory of a tax cut; they want to give $100. What is $100 worth when you are holding a premature baby who has to stay in the hospital for week after week and month after month in the hope that when it is all said and done, that child will have enough strength and intelligence to lead a normal life? Wouldn't you, as a member of the D.C. City Council, stop and say: Maybe we ought to dedicate a few dollars to the kids; maybe we ought to dedicate a few dollars to the police department?  I can't tell you, in my experience here in Washington, DC, how many times I have heard about the incidence of crime and how close it has come. I was a student here; I went to college and law school here. I have lived a big part of my life in Washington, DC. I have seen a lot of it. There is crime in other cities, make no mistake; but the rate of crime in this town is just incredible. The rate of auto theft is the worst in the Nation. A year ago, there was 1 police officer out of 3,500 who was assigned this responsibility of auto theft. These sorts of things, I suggest, the D.C. City Council ought to be taking into consideration--things that, frankly, cry out for a response.  The D.C. City Council says: No, we are not going to spend the money on the kids, we are not going to spend the money on the crime.  Pick up the Washington Post any morning of any day of any week, and you will find another story that is scandalous about what is happening in the District of Columbia. We have quotes here about homicides. Just in the last few months, a girl, 15, died in gang crossfire; an anticrime activist--he worked in one of the neighborhoods near Capitol Hill--was killed; a victim feared for family safety; four were arrested after a woman was killed by a stray bullet.  Last week, a grandmother--an innocent person--was killed by a stray bullet in a drive-by shooting. Little babies are being killed by guns. The D.C. City Council, when it reads headlines in the morning, must say that crime is so bad in the District that we need a tax cut.  That is what it is all about. If there is a belief that a tax cut is going to bring people back to the District to live, it is such a naive belief. People will live in the District of Columbia when it is safe to live in this District, when the schools are good schools, when the city meets its most basic needs. This idea, this perfidy that we can somehow answer the needs of the District with a tax cut, I find troubling.  That is why I raised the concern about this college tuition program. To think that we would take $17 million from the Federal Treasury and give it to the District of Columbia for this college assistance program at a time when the District of Columbia is giving away $59 million, I found to be particularly offensive--not that the program for college tuition isn't a good one, but the District of Columbia, apparently, has money to burn, money to give away, money to award in tax cuts, in a city that is in shambles, when you look at the basics.  I don't want to get into graphic details here. This mayor said he is going to do everything in his power to eradicate rats in this city. It is estimated that the rat population is larger than the human population in Washington, DC, and that doesn't include politicians in Congress. It is estimated that these problems cause public health hazards that, frankly, are rampant across Washington, DC. D.C. City Council says: We are not going to spend any of that $59 million on rat eradication; we are going to give a tax cut.  I think if they want to bring people to the District and businesses to the District, tax cuts can be part of the answer--after you have met the basics. If you can't afford a roof on your home, you won't go out and buy a swimming pool. If you can't afford the basics of food in the cupboard, you don't rent a caterer for a patio party. The D.C. City Council just doesn't get it; they are going to give away this $59 million.  I have been prepared to offer an amendment that would have said the money that was going to be allocated in this bill for this program would be stricken, $14 million. For the sake of the Record at this point, I want to offer the amendment.                           Amendment No. 1224   (Purpose: To strike Federal funding for the District of Columbia                    resident tuition support program)
