Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate Porter-Starke Services, located in Porter County, Indiana, as it celebrates its 25th anniversary this Friday, September 22, 2000. Porter-Starke Services will commemorate its 25 years of dedicated service to the community of Northwest Indiana in a gala celebration entitled ``A Silver Lining,'' to be held at the Porter County Expo Center in Valparaiso, Indiana. The celebration will serve as an opportunity for Porter-Starke to reaffirm its commitment to excellence in mental health services for individuals inValparaiso, Portage, and the surrounding communities.  Porter-Starke Services grew from a grassroots effort initiated by citizens located within ten miles of a large state mental hospital. Concerned with the quality of care provided by the state hospital, the volunteers sought to provide improved care alternatives for those whose lives are affected by mental illness. To that end, Porter-Starke Services was incorporated in 1967 as LaPorte-Porter-Starke Services, and those volunteers served as its first board of directors. The name of the center reflected the three counties involved in the original effort. By 1968, LaPorte County had withdrawn from the group to form its own center, the Swanson Center for Mental Health. Thus, in 1968, the charter was altered, and Porter-Starke Services was born.  From 1967 through 1973, Porter-Starke Services' volunteer board of directors worked tirelessly to raise the capital to build an adequate facility, find a location suitable for the main center, and organize a comprehensive and effective program. Ultimately, land was donated by the Urschel family, and state and local funding was secured for financing construction of a facility in Valparaiso, Indiana. During the past two decades, Porter-Starke has continued to grow and change, reflecting the needs of the communities while remaining committed to the highest caliber of mental health care.  Over its 25 years of development, Porter-Starke has been fortunate enough to receive support and assistance from numerous community leaders and good Samaritans in Northwest Indiana. This year, Porter-Starke Services and the Mental Health Association of Porter County are recognizing several of these individuals for their dedication and commitment to the mental health field at a special dinner, prior to the gala celebration at the Expo Center. Larry Sheets and Lee E. Grogg will receive the Aled P. Davies Award for Public Policy on Health, the Gale C. Corley President's Award will be presented to Charles Walker, and the Patient Care and Advocacy Award will be given to John Wilhelm. Marilyn Lindner will receive the Porter-Starke Award for Community Mental Health, while Karen Conover will receive the Robert Anderson Community Education and Service Award. The Mental Health Association of Porter County will present Randy Zromkoski the Distinguished Service Award, Julane Corneil the United Way Agency Volunteer of the Year Award, and the Cooks Corners Elementary School, Kenya Jenkins, and Velma Strawhun will all receive the Friends of the Mental Health Association Award.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the administrators, health care professionals, and countless individuals who, over the years, have contributed to Porter-Starke's success in achieving its standard of excellence. Their hard work has improved the quality of life for everyone in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
