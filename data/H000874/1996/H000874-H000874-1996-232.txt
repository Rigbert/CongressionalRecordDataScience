Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, there is no Member on the floor for whom I have greater affection or more respect than the gentlewoman from Oregon. She does an outstanding job for her State, for her constituents, and she does an outstanding job for this country. However, on this issue I disagree with her and would urge my colleagues to support the committee's judgment in this instance.  The reason for that is I have had the opportunity, as many Members have had, to visit housing overseas, in Germany and in other countries; and I know the condition of that housing. As I call him, the chairman in exile mentioned the fact that this was built in 1940. I was not 10 at that point in time, but I was around, albeit briefly. I understand that we need to make sure, as the gentleman from Colorado said, that when these troops return from Bosnia to their permanent duty station that they have housing which will in fact be quality-of-life housing.  Mr. Chairman, this committee in particular, as well as the authorizing committee, has worked very, very hard on quality-of-life issues. As a matter of fact, as I think the gentleman from Mississippi mentioned, in fact the Congress has been at the forefront. Not the administration, neither this one nor previous administrations, has been in the forefront of ensuring quality of life for our troops. So I want to commend the committee for including this sum, notwithstanding the fact that it may not have been on the list.  Mr. Chairman, I am not one who believes simply because an administration, whether it has been the Reagan or Bush or Clinton administration, failed to include something that it thereby is not something that is a priority item. So I commend the committee, urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and support this expenditure for this very necessary housing for our troops.
