 President, I support the nomination of Ms. Caryn Wagner to be Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and urge my colleagues to confirm her. The Intelligence Committee unanimously approved the nomination by voice vote on December 10, 2009.  The Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis leads the Office of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, which is among the youngest elements of the U.S. intelligence community. The main responsibilities of the Office are to ensure that information related to homeland security threats is (1) collected, analyzed, and disseminated to homeland security customers in the Department, at the State, local, and tribal levels; (2) shared as appropriate with private sector entities; and (3) provided to other intelligence community agencies. The Under Secretary of the Office leads these efforts, provides homeland security intelligence and advice to the Secretary and other senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security, and serves as the Department's senior interagency intelligence representative.  The cases of Najibullah Zazi in New York and David Headley in Chicago, both U.S. persons allegedly involved in plotting terrorist acts and having ties to noted terrorist groups overseas, show the threat of violent Islamist radicalization occurring in this country is real. The Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 tofocus on the threat of terrorist activity in the United States, a mission that is vitally dependent on good, accurate, actionable intelligence.  Nonetheless, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis has experienced numerous problems in its short tenure and members of the Intelligence Committee and the Homeland Security Committee have frequently raised concerns. Of particular note have been the Office's ill-defined planning, programming and budget processes; a gross overreliance on contractors to the point that 63 percent of the workforce was contractor personnel as of this summer; and a lack of a strategic plan. On a number of occasions the Office has produced and disseminated finished intelligence that has been based on noncredible open source materials or focused intelligence resources on the first amendment protected activities of American citizens.  Clearly, the Office is in need of strong leadership from an Under Secretary with an extensive background in management and intelligence.  The Intelligence Committee is confident that Ms. Wagner is such a person and is up to the challenge of setting the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis on a proper course. If confirmed, among her first tasks will be to review a draft plan to restructure and refine the Office's mission, which will be a good first indication of how Ms. Wagner will manage the organization.  Ms. Wagner's distinguished career in public and private service prepares her well for this position. Ms. Wagner is currently an instructor in intelligence resource management for the Intelligence and Security Academy, LLC.  She retired from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on October 1, 2008, where she served as budget director and cybersecurity coordinator. Prior to that, Ms. Wagner served in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence as an Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Management and the first chief financial officer for the National Intelligence Program. She assumed this position after serving as the executive director for Intelligence Community Affairs.  Ms. Wagner has also previously served as the senior Defense Intelligence Agency Representative to the U.S. European Command and North Atlantic Treaty Organization as well as the Deputy Director for Analysis and Production at DIA. She was also formerly the staff director of the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a signals intelligence and electronic warfare officer in the U.S. Army.  President Obama nominated Ms. Wagner on October 23, 2009. After completing the prehearing procedures, the Intelligence Committee held a confirmation hearing on the nomination on December 1, 2009. As part of the confirmation process, Ms. Wagner was asked to complete a committee questionnaire, prehearing questions, and posthearing questions for the record. The answers she provided have all been posted to the Intelligence Committee's Web site. The Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee also held a hearing on Ms. Wagner's nomination on December 3, 2009.  In sum, I am confident that Caryn Wagner will be an asset to the Department of Homeland Security and to the intelligence community. I look forward to working with her and I urge the Senate to approve Ms. Wagner's nomination.                    Nomination of Andre Birotte, Jr.  Mr. President, nominations in this Chamber are moving at a snail's pace.  Last week, it took us three votes--spanning 3 days--to move only two nominations.  Last Thursday, we had a cloture vote on Martha Johnson, the nominee to lead the General Services Administration. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee reported her to the floor unanimously last June, but since then her nomination has been blocked on the floor for 7 months. Seven months of a hold. And then once cloture was invoked, 94 Members of this body voted to confirm her.  Unfortunately, the minority's blocking of noncontroversial nominees is becoming the rule rather than the exception.  Last Tuesday, I spoke about two nominees for posts in the intelligence community--Caryn Wagner to be the Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, and of Ambassador Phil Goldberg to be the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research at the Department of State.  Neither nomination is controversial. Both were reported out of the Senate Intelligence Committee by voice vote. And both of these posts are critical to efforts to protect the security of our Nation.  Yet both nominations are still blocked on the floor.  Today, I rise to speak on yet another noncontroversial nomination that members of the minority are blocking.  Andre Birotte, Jr., is the nominee to be the U.S. attorney for the Central District of Los Angeles. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote.  He is highly qualified, and he is not controversial.  Mr. Birotte is a former Federal prosecutor in the office who currently serves as the inspector general for the Los Angeles Police Commission. In this role, he has the often unenviable job of determining whether disciplinary action is necessary against law enforcement officials who have been accused of official misconduct. His position requires him to review the facts and follow where they lead--even in highly sensitive situations.  In this tough role, Mr. Birotte has stood out for integrity and evenhandedness. He has earned the overwhelming respect and support of both law enforcement officers and the civil rights community.  Mr. Birotte is tough. He is independent. He has management experience. He has prosecution experience. And I believe he will make an excellent U.S. attorney.  He will also be the first African-American U.S. attorney in the central district. It is my hope that his historic appointment as the lead Federal law enforcement official in Los Angeles will be one more step forward for a city that has known both great progress and, at times, acute disappointment in race relations.  For all of these reasons, I would like to see him confirmed as soon as possible.  This nomination is not just important to me because of the strength of the nominee, however. I also believe it is essential that we get this Office's leader into place.  The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central Distric of California is the second largest in the country. Only the Office in the District of Columbia is larger, and that is because it has unusual responsibility for both local and Federal crimes.  The central district office employs more than 250 Federal prosecutors. They bear responsibility for prosecuting violations of Federal law across seven counties--Los Angeles County, Orange County, Riverside County, San Bernardino County, San Luis Obispo County, Santa Barbara County, and Ventura County--that span more than 40,000 square miles. The district includes Los Angeles and 34 other cities, with a combined population of more than 18 million.  It is a huge operation.  As in all of the U.S. attorneys' offices, the prosecutors in the Central District of California are busy.  In the past year alone, the U.S. Attorney's Office has brought in over $150 million in judgments, won significant convictions against leaders of gangs and fraudulent enterprises, and placed people behind bars for crimes committed around the world.  Let me give you a few examples, all from 2009 and 2010:  Central District prosecutors secured a $46 million restitution order in a case against a former real estate appraiser who committed massive mortgage fraud.  They put the leader of a $64 million Ponzi scheme behind bars for 300 months and won a $44 million restitution order against him.  They indicted 88 members and associates of a street gang called the Avenues on various charges, including the 2008 murder of a Los Angeles deputy sheriff; they indicted 24 people on gang-related drug trafficking in an investigation known as Operation Knockout; they took down an international sex trafficking ring that was forcing Guatemalan girls into prostitution inLos Angeles; they put a foreign national behind bars for 78 months for participating in the transport of over 9,000 illegal aliens to and from Los Angeles; and they obtained a conviction and 16-year prison sentence against the founder of a domestic terrorist group that was planning attacks on U.S. military operations.  All of those prosecutions have occurred in the last 13 months alone.  Andre Birotte is a highly qualified individual who has been nominated not to lead an office embroiled in the politics of Washington, but instead that bears responsibility for investigating, prosecuting, deterring, and preventing Federal crimes against Americans and their families.  I do not believe the leadership of this office should get caught up in an unrelated dispute. If someone objects to Mr. Birotte, I hope they will come forward. Otherwise, I hope that we can move forward quickly to confirm this nominee.                          ____________________
