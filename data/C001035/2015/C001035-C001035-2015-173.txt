President, I am joined by my colleague Senator Ron Wyden in introducing the Trade Adjustment Assistance, TAA, Enhancement Act of 2015. This legislation would reauthorize trade adjustment assistance programs to help American workers who lose their jobs as a result of foreign competition. These programs are an investment in the American worker and are essential to helping those who are negatively affected by international trade to get the skills and training to prepare for jobs in other industries.  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 would cover affected workers in the manufacturing, service, and agricultural sectors. In addition to covering workers whose jobs shift to countries with which the United States has a Free Trade Agreement, the bill would also extend to job losses from non-FTA countries, such as China or India. It would make eligible for assistance those who have been laid off due to unfair foreign subsidies or dumping practices, as long as the layoff occurs within 1 year of an affirmative injury determination by the International Trade Commission.  Our bill would also authorize an investment of up to $575 million per year to train workers in new, in-demand skills, thereby providing them with the opportunity to find lasting employment that will ensure greater economic stability in years to come. It would also provide extended unemployment insurance for those enrolled in an approved training program. For older workers seeking quick reemployment, our bill would provide wage insurance to cover up to 50 percent of the wage differential between the old job and the new job. It would also provide assistance to those who must commute a greater distance or relocate altogether to find new employment.  Under our bill, farmers, fishermen, and aquaculture producers would also be eligible for targeted training and assistance programs designed to help increase their competitiveness. The bill would further clarify that fishermen and aquaculture producers may receive TAA benefits whether they are competing against farmed or wild-caught fish or seafood imports.  Small, rural communities in my home State of Maine have been hit hard by closures or partial shutdowns of mills, manufacturing plants, or other businesses that, in many cases, represent a large portion of jobs in the surrounding communities. In the past year, the communities of Lincoln, Millinocket, and Bucksport have experienced such devastating job losses. Moreover, the second and third-order economic effects on other businesses is significant. When these jobs are abruptly lost on such a massive scale, entire communities and the surrounding area are devastated. In times of such great upheaval, the laid off employees, who lost their good jobs through no fault of their own, need the time, support, and resources to learn new skills and seek viable employment opportunities.  TAA programs have made a tremendous difference in the lives of those working in trade-affected industries in Maine, such as the pulp and paper manufacturing, lobster, and blueberry industries. In fiscal year 2013, more than 700 Mainers benefitted from these programs, which led to an employment retention rate of more than 90 percent. In the last year alone, the Department of Labor approved TAA benefits for the hundreds of workers who lost their jobs with the closures of the Verso Paper mill in Bucksport, the Lincoln Paper and Tissue mill in Lincoln, the Great Northern Paper mill in East Millinocket, and the UTC Fire and Security plant in Pittsfield. Previously, TAA benefited former employees of the Great Northern Paper mill in Millinocket when it closed, in addition to lobstermen and wild blueberry producers who needed help increasing the competitiveness of their unique commodities. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Eastern Maine Community College and tour its Fine Woodworking and Cabinet Making Shop. I met with a group of students formerly employed at the Bucksport Verso Paper mill, who now have the opportunity to learn a new skill because of the funds available through TAA.  TAA has been vitally important in helping Maine workers, and those across the Nation, who have been harmed by trade get the skills and training they need to prepare for jobs in other industries. Reauthorization of trade adjustment assistance programs must be a part of the national trade policy debate, and I am pleased that the Senate recognized the importance of TAA by approving the bipartisan amendment that I authored to the Budget Resolution related to reauthorizing TAA. I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan Trade Adjustment Assistance Enhancement Act of 2015 to continue crucial investments in the American worker and protect them from unfair trade practices and increased imports.                          ____________________
