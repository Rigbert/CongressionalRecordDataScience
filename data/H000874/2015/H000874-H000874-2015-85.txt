Leader, there are 5 days--full days--left to go. You are right; we have been discussing this for some period of time, but with all due respect to any strategy that we have, you only brought six bills to the floor and passed six bills through this House, and that is only half of the appropriation bills.  The MilCon bill got 255 votes; the Energy and Water, 240; the Legislative Branch, 357; the Commerce, Justice, Science, 242; T-HUD, which we didn't like and, apparently, a lot of your Members didn't like either, 216 votes; and the Defense bill, 278 votes.  There was nothing on our side that stopped the appropriations process from going forward. You chose not to bring six of those bills to the floor. I don't take any blame on our side of the aisle, whatever our strategy might be.  Our strategy has been consistent with, very frankly, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee strategy, and that is to have funding levels on both the defense and nondefense side of the ledger which were rational and reasonable.  I repeat ad nauseam, as you know--and you are tired of hearing me repeat it, I am sure--Mr. Rogers' comments that the sequester levels given to the Appropriations Committee to meet their responsibilities were ill-conceived and unrealistic. That is Mr. Rogers' quote, not mine, not our strategy.  That was what the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on your side of the aisle characterizes the funding levels that you have provided the committee for--I don't mean you individually--the House has provided the chairman with to write his bills up.  As a result of being unable to do that, every time you brought a bill to the floor, it has gotten a majority of the votes. Forget about us. We can't control. We have 188 Members. You can pass anything you want.  The appropriations bill process came to a dead halt for two reasons. Number one, it is because there are no negotiations for a well-conceived and realistic alternative to sequester. That is what Hal Rogers says--not me--your chairman.  I continue to be extraordinarily disappointed that we have not undertaken any discussions--I mentioned Mrs. Lowey on the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Van Hollen on the Budget Committee, Leader Pelosi's office, my office--any discussions which have allowed us to come to some agreement so that we might in a bipartisan way move forward.  Now, I understand there are a lot of members on your side of the aisle who won't vote for anything if it funds Planned Parenthood. I get that. They don't come close to making the majority of this House.                              {time}  1300  Until such time as we start acting with the majority's will prevailing as opposed to a faction's prevailing, I think we are going to be in this gridlock that is undermining the confidence of our country, of our government, and of our international partners.  I would hope that, in the next, perhaps, few days, Mr. Leader--and I am prepared to spend time today, this weekend, Monday, and Tuesday--I know we are not coming back until Wednesday--to try to work with you and with the relevant committees, with the Speaker, and with the leader of my party to try to get us to a point where we can do exactly what you want to do and what we want to do, and that is not have this government by crisis that we have now. This is the third time on an unrelated issue where there has been a problem with funding government as is our responsibility at whatever levels we agree upon. I would hope that we could pursue those discussions. I have been urging that for months now, and we haven't done that.  You also did not mention something that I have discussed with you and discussed with the Speaker that I bring up all the time. As a result of our failure to fund the Export-Import Bank and to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, we are losing jobs, and we have lost a substantial number of jobs already. Speaker Boehner indicated in a quote not too long ago that, in fact, there are thousands of jobs on the line that would disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to disappear.  Essentially, in terms of new loans and new products that could be sold abroad, the Ex-Im Bank has disappeared as of July. I have had discussions with the Speaker, and I think he has been quoted publicly as saying he thought the Ex-Im Bank was, in fact, in some form, going to be considered on the floor this month.  I ask my friend, the majority leader, as it is not on the schedule, but, again, it is not as if we have months to go--we have 5 days to go--before the end of the fiscal year and that funding for the Ex-Im Bank expires. Can the gentleman tell me whether there is any possibility of that being considered within the next 5 or 8--if you want to count 8--legislative days we have left in this month?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.  I would not feel these colloquies were complete if I did not get this question. I admire the gentleman's consistency in asking it, but my answer remains just as consistent. There is no action scheduled in the House on Ex-Im.
