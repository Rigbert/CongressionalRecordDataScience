 President, I will address two issues. I commend, in particular, the senior Senator from Oklahoma for the extraordinary work he has done to produce a transportation bill that has significant reforms in it. He has been tenacious and effective. He has tugged on our sleeves and pointed out to us repeatedly the importance of getting this job done. I congratulate him for an extraordinary accomplishment.  With regard to the bill, the highway conference report contains significant reforms to the surface transportation program. Projects will now be completed in a more timely manner because, for the first time, there are hard deadlines on agencies to complete environmental reviews.  Also, States are given maximum flexibility to use their transportation dollars the way they choose, rather than how Washington dictates. This bill is fully paid for with a package of offsets mostly included in the Senate-passed highway bill.
