 President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Biden, in cosponsoring a resolution to designate the week of February 10-16, 2008, as National Drug Prevention and Education Month. Although recent survey data compiled by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration shows illegal drug use among youth has declined by 24 percent since 2001, the number of teens abusing prescription and over-the-counter medicines has rapidly increased. Kids are turning to these dangerous drugs because they are easily accessible and widely used. Many of us do not realize that our left-over prescriptions and cold medicines are just as addictive and dangerous as meth or heroin when not properly used. This is why we must continue our efforts to inform the public about the dangers of these and other drugs. We must continue to do all we can to prevent our kids from falling into a vicious cycle of drug abuse and dependence.  Research has shown that if you can keep a child drug free until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try or become addicted to drugs. This is why it is essential to maintain a coherent antidrug message that begins early in adolescence and continues throughout the growing years. Such an effort must engage professionals, parents, communities, and young people. While the Federal Government has a role to play in supporting these activities, local, community-based initiatives are better able to target specific concerns and respond to them flexibly.  Local community antidrug coalitions are our first line of defense against the scourge of drug abuse. Each community is different from the other, and each community antidrug coalition is tailored to meet the specific antidrug needs of its community. For example, I formed the Face It Together, FIT, Coalition in an effort to combat drug use in Iowa. My goal with FIT is to bring to the same table parents, educators, businesses, religious leaders, law enforcement officials, health care providers, youth groups, and members of the media to promote new ways of thinking about how to reach and educate Iowans about the dangers of drug abuse. With everyone working together, we will make a difference in our communities. Moreover, together we can build healthy children, healthy families, healthy communities, and a healthy future for society at large.  Community antidrug coalitions would not be able to succeed in fighting drug abuse without the support of the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, CADCA. CADCA works to strengthen the ability of new and existing community coalitions to build safe, healthy, and drug-free communities and helps provide vital funding to local coalitions through the Drug Free Communities grant program.  Since the inception of the Drug Free Communities grant program over 1,300 community coalitions have received grants nationwide. There have been 43 coalitions in my State of Iowa that have received grants to provide crucial assistance to combat the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. These coalitions have been successful in tracking the use of illegal drugs in their communities, starting afterschool and summer programs for kids, holding community events and townhall meetings, and uniting all sectors of the community to fight drug abuse.  I believe that we have a moral obligation to ensure that our young people have a chance to grow up without being accosted by drug dealers at every turn, whether on TV, in the movies, or on the way to school. We need, as a country, to create a strong moral context to help our kids know how to make the right choices. They need to know how to say ``no.'' They need to know that saying ``no'' is OK. They need to know that saying ``no'' to drugs is the right thing to do, not just the safe thing or the healthier thingbut the right thing. I urge my colleagues to join us in passing this resolution to show our ongoing support for community antidrug coalitions that work to eliminate drug abuse throughout the Nation.                          ____________________
