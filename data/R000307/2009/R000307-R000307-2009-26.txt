I said straw man, and that is pretty harsh, but I intend it to be. We have seen how, if the language is examined, the amendment, at a minimum, is a red herring. You can fairly say the amendment, rather, has no other purpose than to facilitate a strong argument.  On Tuesday, when Senator Crapo laid down his amendment, the majority didn't show us this side-by-side amendment until shortly before we thought--and they thought--we were going to vote. So that very limited notice makes you think it may be more likely to distract from or muddy the clear question the Senator from Idaho brought; that is, the motion to commit before the Senate. The motion was designed to be to be straightforward, and the Senator did that.  A vote for the motion is a vote to send the Reid amendment and underlying bill back to the Finance Committee. Under the motion, the Finance Committee would report back a bill that eliminates the tax increases on middle-income taxpayers. One could not say it anymore simply. That is what the motion does. The other bill is a straw man.  After the remarks by the distinguished leader, I would say this may be a seminal event. I think that is one of the key votes where the other side could start to realize this and start to finalize this without all the rhetoric and ideology and philosophical support for this bill, and they could start the road back, if you will, of doing it in a step-by-step, thoughtful way--doing it, meaning real health care reform.  I commend the Senator. Again, this side-by-side is a straw man. The Senator is clear in what he wants to do. Under the Senator's motion, the Finance Committee would report back a bill that eliminates the tax increases for middle-income taxpayers. We can restart the debate in a bipartisan way, where we can agree on many common goals. I thank the Senator.
