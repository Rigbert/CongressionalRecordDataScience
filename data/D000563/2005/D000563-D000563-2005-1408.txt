What I was going to remind him was when these trucks are coming in with ethanol into New York and getting stalled in traffic and burning up their fuel, if they have ethanol in their tanks, there is less pollution in his beautiful New York City. So we have another added benefit here--not just more income for farmers and less in payments by taxpayers for farm programs but cleaner air and less dependence on foreign oil.  I hope Senator Harkin and I can take this on as a class project, to try to work on Senator Schumer from New York. He is a very delightful man and does a great job for his State, but he needs some very fundamental education on corn and ethanol and what it means for America.
