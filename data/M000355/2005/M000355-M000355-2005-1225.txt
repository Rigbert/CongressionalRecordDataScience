 President, tomorrow, the Senate will resume consideration of the nomination of John Bolton to be U.S. ambassador to the U.N. As a reminder, cloture was just filed a moment ago on the nomination. The cloture vote on Bolton will occur at 6 p.m. tomorrow night. If cloture is invoked, we will immediately proceed to a confirmation vote. Therefore, I encourage all Members who wish to speak on the nomination to contact the managers as soon as possible.                          ____________________[Page S5940]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
