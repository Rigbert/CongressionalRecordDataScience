President, I ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee be discharged from further consideration of PN 877 and 878; that the nominations be confirmed; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's actions and the Senate then resume legislative session.
