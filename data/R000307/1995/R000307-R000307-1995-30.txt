Chairman, the Secretary of Agriculture has indicated that they will give every consideration to the small business community, whether it be small meat locker plants or a small meat packing house.  I would like to point out that 98 percent of all food-borne illnesses come from handling and preparation. If everybody would simply do what their grandmother and their home economics instructor and their 4-H instructor and common sense and the Department of Agriculture recommends, wash their hands and thoroughly cook their meat, we would not have this problem.  And so I can assure the gentleman that Secretary Glickman has in effect assured me and the rest of the Members of the House Committee on Agriculture that the concerns of the small business community will be addressed. I thank the gentleman for raising this issue.
