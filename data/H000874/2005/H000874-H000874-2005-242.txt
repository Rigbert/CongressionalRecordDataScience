Speaker, if the gentleman could tell us, because we have discussed with our Members from California, from Washington State, Oregon, and others, if they take a 7:40 a.m. plane, they do not get here much before 4 or a little after 4. Therefore, if those votes are started at 2 p.m., that requires some of our Members to leave the night before.  Some of our Members, as you know, because of their religious observance, cannot leave until after sundown, requiring them to take the red-eye. I discussed this with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) last week, and I am wondering whether or not, because I am sure Members on your side, well, I guess they do not, now that I think about it, have similar problems. But the fact of the matter is that it causes some difficulty for our Members traveling. I wonder if there is a possibility of starting at 10, continuing debate, but rolling votes until after 5 rather than after 2.
