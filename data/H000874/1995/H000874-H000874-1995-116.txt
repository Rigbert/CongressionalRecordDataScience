Speaker, I know my chairman likes this chart, so I put it back up. I am the ranking member on one of these subcommittees, the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government. What we are about is laying off employees, furloughing employees today. On this Treasury-Postal bill, we cover 192,000 Federal employees. Of that, approximately 95,000 of them were at 11 o'clock today told to go home.  I do not question the work ethic; I question the work smartness. This bill, as my chairman so well knows, should have passed 60 days ago. But because, very frankly, 100 of our most zealotry Members, what an awful word that is, want to pass an amendment that cannot pass the Senate, forget about the President, cannot pass the Senate, the Istook-Ehrlich amendment, which was rejected by the U.S. Senate on the continuing resolution, because they cannot pass that, this bill sits here for that reason alone.  As of September 13, it was ready to be passed through this House and be signed by the President of the United States. So, because of that extreme commitment to one unrelated appropriation issue, this bill stands mired in a political morass, and 95,000 people were sent home.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my reasonable colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle and on the Democrat side of the aisle, let us join together and do what we know makes sense, and that is provide for the operations of these departments, which everybody wants to do. Let us do the reasonable thing and provide for the operation of government, and then, as the public expects us to do, argue, contend, on the issues of difference between us and follow the regular process.  This is not the right thing to do. This is not the smart thing to do. This is not in the best interests of America or the American public.
