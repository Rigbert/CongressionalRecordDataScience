President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be recognized as soon as I make my remarks and then Senator Bingaman at the conclusion of Senator McCain and then Senator Cardin, and that if there is a Republican seeking recognition between Senator Bingaman and Senator Cardin, that Senator be recognized at that time.
