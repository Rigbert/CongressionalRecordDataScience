 President, 6 years ago I stood on this floor and called upon the Senate to join the fight against terrorism in the wake of the horrific bombing in Oklahoma City. Back then some argued terrorism was something that usually happened far away, in distant lands, over distant conflicts. Well, that's all changed.  Terrorism has come to America.  We have to be a little proactive now. Back then, I proposed a series of precise anti-terrorism tools to help law enforcement catch terrorists before they commit their deadly act, not ever imagining the events of September 11.  In particular, I said that it simply did not make sense that many of our law enforcement tools were not available for terrorism cases.  For example, the FBI could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia, but they could not get one to investigate terrorists. To put it bluntly, that was crazy! What's good for the mob should be good for terrorists.  Anyway, some of my proposals were enacted into law in 1996, a number were not.  There were those who decided that the threat to Americans was apparently not serious enough to give the President all the changes in law be requested.  Today, 5 years later, I again call on my colleagues to provide law enforcement with a number of the tools which they declined to pass back then. The anti-terrorism bill we consider today is measured and prudent. It has been strengthened considerably since the Administration originally proposed it in mid-September. It takes a number of important steps in waging an effective war on terrorism.  It allows law enforcement to keep up with the modern technology these terrorists are using. The bill contains several provisions which are identical or nearly identical to those I previously proposed.  For example: it allows the FBI to get wiretaps to investigate terrorists, just like they do for the Mafia or for drug kingpins; it allows the FBI to get a roving wiretap to investigate terrorists--so they can follow a particular suspect, regardless of how many different forms of communication that person uses; and it allows terrorists to be charged with Federal ``racketeering offenses,'' serious criminal charges available against organizations which engage in criminal conduct as a group, for their crimes.  I am pleased that the final version of the bill we are considering today contains three provisions that I fought for.  First, section 613 incorporates a bill that Senator Hatch and I introduced earlier this year, S. 899. Named in honor of Delaware State trooper Francis Collender, who was tragically killed while on a traffic stop in Odessa, DE this past February, S. 899 and section 613 of this bill will raise the one-time death benefit paid to the families of slain or permanently disabled law enforcement officers. For too long, this benefit has stood at $100,000. It was indexed for inflation and currently stands at $151,000, but even this is far too low for the families of these heroes to make ends meet. The bill we consider today raises this benefit to $250,000, continues to index it for inflation, and makes it applicable to the family of any law enforcement or fire personnel who lost their life on or after January 1, 2001. It's the least we can do for the Collender family, the least we can do for the hundreds of families who tragically lost a loved one on September 11, and I'm grateful my colleagues have agreed we need to include my bill in this larger anti-terrorism bill today.  Second, section 817 is based on legislation I introduced in the 106th Congress, S. 3202. It may shock my colleagues that under current law, anyone, including convicted felons, fugitives, and aliens from terrorist-sponsoring states, can possess anthrax or other biological agents. And under current law, the FBI has no tool at its disposal to charge someone with possession of anthrax. Possession of anthrax, or any other dangerous biological agent, is legal, unless the FBI can make a case that the suspect intended to use the agent as a weapon. This far too high a hurdle for our investigators to overcome in many cases, and indeed the FBI has informed me it has hindered several of their past bioweapons investigations. Section 817 closes this loophole. It prohibits certain classes of individuals, felons, illegal aliens, fugitives and others, from ever possessing these dangerous biological agents. And for everyone else, my provision says you need to be able to show you possessed this stuff with a peaceful orbona fide research reason. If not, you're going to be charged with a felony and you face up to ten years in Federal prison.  Finally, section 1005 of this bill incorporates my First Responders Assistance Act. I have spoken with too many local police officers, chiefs, firemen and women, and others who feel left out of our fight against terrorism. I commend FBI Director Mueller for recently pledging to do a better job sharing information with our State and local law enforcement people, but clearly more needs to be done. Who responds first to a terrorist incident? On September 11 it was the New York City and Arlington County, VA police and fire departments. That's always going to be the case, local law enforcement is our first line of defense against terrorists, and we need to give them the tools they need to get that job done well.  My provision will, for the first time, give State and local enforcement and fire personnel the opportunity to apply directly to the Justice Department to receive terrorism prevention assistance. Specifically, departments will now be able to get help purchasing gas masks, hazardous material suits, intelligence-gathering equipment, twenty-first century communications devices and other tools to help them respond to terrorist threats. This section also creates a new anti-terrorism training grant program that will fund seminars and other training sessions to help local police departments better analyze intelligence information they come across, help local fire departments acquire the knowledge they need to respond to critical incidents, and assist those agencies who may be called upon to stabilize a community after a terrorist incident. It is my intent that these funds go to professional law enforcement organizations who are in some instances already delivering this type of training. The Department of Justice's Office for Domestic Preparedness does some of this, but their program is a block grant sent to the Governor. I want to involve local police and fire departments directly in the fight against terrorism, and this section is an important step towards meeting that goal. The funds authorized, $100 million over the next four years, may not be enough to get the job done, but it's a good start. I thank the Police Executives Research Forum for working with me to craft this proposal, and I look forward to seeing significant dollars allocated to it in future spending bills.  So this bill contains many provisions critical to law enforcement. Some may say it doesn't go far enough.  I have to say, I was disappointed that the Administration dropped some proposals from an early draft of its bill, measures which I called for five years ago. Those measures are not in the bill we consider today, but I continue to believe that they're common-sense tools we ought to be giving to our men and women of law enforcement.  We should be extending 48-hour emergency wiretaps and pen-registers, caller-ID-type devices that track incoming and outgoing phone calls from suspects, to terrorism crimes. This would allow police, in an emergency situation, to immediately obtain a surveillance order against a terrorist, provided the police go to a judge within 48 hours and show that they had the right to get the wiretap and that emergency circumstances prevented them from going to the judge in the first place. Now, this emergency tool is available only for organized crime cases and the bill we consider today does not expand this power to terrorist investigations.  We should be extending the Supreme Court's ``good faith'' exception to wiretaps. This well-accepted doctrine prevents criminals in other types of offenses from going free when the police make an honest mistake in seizing evidence or statements from a suspect. We should apply this good faith exception to terrorist crimes as well, to prevent terrorists from getting away when the police make an honest mistake in obtaining a wiretap.  I'm pleased Chairman Leahy and the Administration were able to reach consensus on the two areas which gave me some pause in the Administration's original proposal: those provisions dealing with mandatory detention of illegal aliens and with greater information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities.  The agreement reached has satisfied me that these provisions will not upset the balance between strong law enforcement and protection of our valued civil liberties.  This bill is not perfect. No one here claims it embodies all the answers to the question of how best to fight terrorism. But I am confident that by updating our surveillance laws, by taking terrorism as seriously as we do organized crime, and by recognizing the important role state and local law enforcement has to play in this campaign, that we are taking a step in the right direction by passing this bill today.
