 President, I am pleased to join Senator Leahy today as an original cosponsor of the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act. Senator Leahy is truly a leader on this issue, and I've had the pleasure of working on encryption policy with him over the past 3 years. I'm excited to once again join him in this effort to make sense out of our national export control policies, and to promote export opportunities for American software and hardware producers.  As many of my colleagues know, with help from Congresswoman Cantwell in the 103d Congress, I was able to persuade the administration to study the extent to which U.S. companies are stymied by our country's current encryption and export control policies.  The Department of Commerce released that report last month. And letme just say that there are some findings in this report that we should be aware of, and concerned about. For instance, the report acknowledges there are tremendous international growth opportunities for software exporters in the next 5 to 10 years. Unfortunately, the report also finds that most U.S. companies don't pursue international sales because our export control laws are too cost prohibitive.  Mr. President, there are legitimate national security concerns underpinning the Export Administration Act. However, these outdated laws are no longer relevant to the post-cold-war world we now lived in. Today's national security controls should target those items that really need to be controlled in order to maintain national security. Simply, they should make better sense; it doesn't make sense to tell a U.S. software producer they can't export a product that is already widely available on the world market.  Senator Leahy's bill seeks a balanced approach to implementing viable, safe, and secure encryption technology on both domestically sold products and exported products. It protects our privacy concerns, and it lays out the appropriate procedures law enforcement officials should use when obtaining encrypted materials. And, most important, it protects industry ingenuity and prohibits mandatory key escrow.  Mr. President, I introduced the Commercial Export Administration Act in the 103d Congress. I am pleased Senator Leahy is incorporating my language into his bill. My language reduces regulatory redtape and makes it easier to export generally available mass-marketed commercial software. Washington State is home to some of the most innovative software producers in the world, and they are eager to export their goods. Unfortunately, our export controls keep Washington State's companies from penetrating the world market. Senator Leahy's bill, however will fix this problem.  We are hearing a lot on the Presidential campaign trail about the damage that comes from trade--how trade hurts our economy and our workers. That's nonsense. My Washington State friends and neighbors know full-well that trade is essential to our State's success. One out of every five jobs in Washington State is trade related; and these are highly skilled, family wage jobs that pay 15 percent higher than the national average. Moreover, Washington State's small- and mid-sized high-technology companies provided over 98,000 jobs in 1995.  Mr. President, I mention this because our bill will increase exports and enable our high-technology companies to grow further. Higher growth means more jobs--plain and simple. A recent study revealed that in 1995 U.S. exporters lost $60 billion in international sales, and it estimates the industry will lose 200,000 potential jobs by the year 2000. Given the increase in international competition, we can no longer afford to persist in holding U.S. companies back from potential world sales.  This legislation makes good sense. First and foremost, it ensures every American's right to use any appropriate encryption available on the market. It also sets out necessary guidelines that should accompany any policy regarding the use of key escrow. And finally, it paves the way for new, streamlined export policies.  Mr. President, this legislation is badly needed, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Leahy and me in supporting it.                                 ______      By
