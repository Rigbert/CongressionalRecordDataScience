Grant, a Hall of Fame golfer, a commended veteran, and a woman some have called ``the type of American our country needs to look up to.''  Born March 12, 1921, her family moved to Cushing, OK, where Pat won the Oklahoma State High School Golf Championship as a 13-year old freshman, repeating the win three times before her high school graduation. While attending Oklahoma Baptist University, where she received a scholarship in exchange for teaching golf to fellow students, Pat won the Women's Oklahoma Golf Association State Amateur Championship four times and was the first female to be inducted into the OBU Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1946, she became the only person in history to win the contest 5 years in a row, and even went on to a sixth win in 1949. Ultimately, Pat won golf tournaments all over the world and was inducted into the Women's Oklahoma Golf Hall of Fame in April 2010.  When World War II broke out, Pat enlisted in the U.S. Army, alongside her sister Mary Margaret. Pat held many assignments across the globe, including that of assisting the chief legal counsel during the Nuremberg Trials. She received 23 letters of commendation while in the Army, and retired after 22 years of active duty with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, one of only 60 women to attain the rank at the time.  Not quite ready for retirement, Pat earned her law degree in 1966 and practiced family law in Texas for 30 years. She was named Woman of the Year by the Texas Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs in 1972 as a result of her service.  After retiring for good in 1995, Pat remained active, playing golf into her 70s, learning how to belly dance, and piloting an ultralight aircraft every Saturday morning. She passed away November 26, 2013, greatly loved by friends and family.  Mr. President, I ask that you join me today in celebrating the life of Pat Grant.                          ____________________
