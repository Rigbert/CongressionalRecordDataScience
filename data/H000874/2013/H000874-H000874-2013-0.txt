Speaker, I thank the gentleman.  First of all, let me say that America is advantaged by having two people who work on the Budget Committee who have great intellect, great integrity, and care about America: Mr. Ryan from Wisconsin and Mr. Van Hollen from Maryland. The American public sometimes is not sure that it has that kind of quality. If only they were here sitting in the Budget Committee or on the floor and listening to these two gentlemen who have disagreements and represent their positions well.  Mr. Speaker, I voted for every budget compromise that has been passed over the past 3 years without fail. The result, however, invariably, has been an unremitting undermining of our efforts to reach a balanced fiscal policy and to invest in that which will secure our future: the economy, education, infrastructure, national security, and innovation.  While each of those bills was preferable to default on our debt or the shutting down of our government, they have been simply stopgap measures that have not prevented continuing lurches from congressionally created and all too frequent fiscal crises and shutdowns.  The headlines regarding this agreement put it in perspective. An op-ed in The New York Times says, ``Congress Avoids Reality, Again.'' The Wall Street Journal says, ``A Least Bad Budget Deal,'' while a USA Today headline says, ``Minimalist Budget Deal Beats Another Shutdown.'' The editorial concludes with this, however:  Unless we come to grips with the fiscal issue, we will be inflicting a huge financial burden on our children.  I agree.  The deal before us today does not deal with the fundamental issue of long-term fiscal stability. My friend Mr. Ryan says he wants to do that. My friend Mr. Van Hollen says he wants to do that. I think Senator Murray wants to do that. We have not done that. We have not dealt with the underlying issues that prevent us from being on a fiscally sustainable path.  It does not replace the full sequester, which Chairman Hal Rogers, who I know has spoken in favor of this agreement, has correctly described as ill-advised and unrealistic. I said on this floor when we considered the gentleman's budget that, if there were no Democrats in the House of Representatives, they could not implement that budget. I believe that.                              {time}  1730  I believe that. I believe it because the figures were not related to priorities or vision or that which we needed to accomplish as a country, but on a number, 967. That is an opinion shared by all of the Republican appropriations subcommittee chairmen who wrote a letter to that effect.  Nor, critically, does this agreement deal with the issue of the debt limit, which will confront us shortly, and which has, historically, over the last 3 years, been an inflection point to further reduce not only discretionary spending on both sides, mainly on the nondefense side, but also to reach, once again, into the pockets of Federal employees.  Now, I am someone who represents 62,000 Federal employees, and I recommended zero COLAs the first 2 years we did zero COLAs. Why?  The economy was in trouble and it was necessary for Federal employees, like everybody else, to participate.
