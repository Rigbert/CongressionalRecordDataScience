  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, there is a flood of money corroding the foundation of our democracy. Now, the Republicans would have us believe that it is only the foundations on this side of the aisle or downtown at the White House that are endangered by this flood of money, but that is not quite true, because we remember Simon Fireman. Simon Fireman was the vice-chair of Bob Dole's fund-raising. He pled guilty to 64 counts of money laundering, paid $6 million in fines and 6 months in jail.  This is a bipartisan problem. Both sides suffer from this problem, and it does not serve either side to stonewall reform. There are many of us on this side of the aisle calling sincerely for just a debate, an open rule. Let us see what happens. Let us vote on campaign finance reform before we go home.  Even on the Senate side now they have relented, and they say they are going to take up campaign finance reform. Let us take it up here in the House of Representatives, or do many Members think, as the Speaker does, that there is not enough money spent on campaigns yet corroding our democracy.                          ____________________
