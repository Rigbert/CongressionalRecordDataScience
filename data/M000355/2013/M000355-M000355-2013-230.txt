 President, this week, the Senate is debating a bill that would authorize States to require retailers to collect taxes on remote sales. I recognize there are a range of views on this bill, and these views don't break along partisan lines nor do they follow, really, along traditional ideological lines. Speaking for myself, however, I intend to oppose the bill, and here is why.  For me, the issue boils down to the fact the legislation we are considering would create an enormous compliance burden for a lot of small businesses out there, making them tax collectors for thousands of far-away jurisdictions. Just as importantly, this legislation would increase the tax burden on Kentuckians. As I have said before, I don't think the people of Kentucky sent me here to help them pay higher taxes.  Brick-and-mortar companies complain about the inequity that exists in current law, where their customers have to pay taxes that online shoppers do not. Frankly, that is a legitimate concern; but by imposing this new Internet tax, States would suddenly be empowered to force online retailers to simultaneously comply with all the different tax codes of all the States in which their customers reside. And that is no small feat.  From what I am told, there are nearly 10,000 State, local, and municipal tax codes nationwide. While complying with so many codes might not be a big deal for large online retailers, it is actually a huge burden for the little guys. So small business owners are worried, and justifiably so.  I know they are in Kentucky because so many keep writing to share their concerns with me. One small business owner lamented that ``small online business owner[s] ha[d] been silenced and pushed to the side'' in this debate as larger companies ``[press] for the changes to take effect as quickly as possible.
