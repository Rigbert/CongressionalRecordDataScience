Speaker, I rise today in honor of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater's Warhawks, who won the Division III Basketball National Championship on March 22, 2014. The Warhawks, led by point guard KJ Evans and Head Coach Pat Miller, displayed a tremendous amount of grit, determination, skill, and athleticism throughout their season. In a hard-fought battle, Whitewater beat Williams College 75-73. The victory marked the fourth national title for the Warhawks. They now have the second-most basketball championships of all time in Division III.  The success of UW-Whitewater basketball has made the residents of Wisconsin proud and I salute the entire team: Alex Merg, Patrick Souter, Brian Roedl, Quardell Young, Cody Odegaard, Sean Klemp, KJ Evans, Reggie Hearn, Eric Bryson, Terrence Bradley, Drew Bryson, Miles Chamberlain, Ryan McBride, Dylan Graf, Steve Egan, Alex LeGault, Clay Stevens, and Cole Van Schyndel.  Winning a national championship is never easy. On behalf of my congressional office and my constituents in Wisconsin's fifth district, I commend the coaches and players at UW-Whitewater for their hard work and dedication, and wish them continued success in the future.                          ____________________
