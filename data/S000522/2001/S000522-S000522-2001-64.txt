Mr. Speaker, let me tell my colleagues about the company that informed us that they have the technology to clone human beings. This is the same company that conducted research in which they introduced human cells into cow eggs, they have created human embryos specifically for scientific experimentation. In other words--use newly created human beings--steal their stem cells, then kill them. And now they have cloned human beings that lived for a few hours as embryos and then died. The drill here is to clone then kill the newly created human.  Their president, Michael West, has made clear that he has no problems with cloned births once so-called ``safety issues'' are resolved. Glen McGee, the former chair of their ethics advisory board, current professor of bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania and editor in chief of the American Journal of Bioethics, resignedfrom this company's ethics advisory board last fall because they were using it as a front.  But that should come as no surprise, Mr. Speaker, when you consider what is going on in their labs. These are not the people we want to defend. These are not the people we want to hold up as scientific trailblazers, nor do we want to empower or enable them.  Their actions are more like, Mr. Speaker, the Third Reich, where scientists routinely played God, than the work of visionaries like Copernicus, Galileo, Madame Curie or Jonas Salk.  The Senate must pass the House-passed bill to proscribe cloning.                          ____________________
