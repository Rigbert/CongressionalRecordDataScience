Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to commend two of northwest Indiana's outstanding citizens, Seymour and Lotte Meyerson. The Meyersons, who have lived in the Miller section of Gary for the last 45 years of their 54-year marriage, will be moving from northwest Indiana later this month. As they leave the region, the many accomplishments they have made in advocating individual human rights and liberties will be fondly remembered.  The Meyersons' long-time commitment to the ideals of dignity and rights for all human beings has brought positive change to the communities of northwest Indiana. Lotte Meyerson, a dedicated citizen activist, has made a campaign out of her devotion to human rights. Perhaps her most noteworthy contribution to the community was her leadership in forming the northwest Indiana Open Housing Center, of which she was president for 10 years. During her tenure with this organization, great strides were made in eliminating the institutional discrimination that prevents minorities from integrating into predominantly white neighborhoods. Lotte has further served her community by participating in activities with the Calumet Chapter of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, the Gary League of Women Voters, and the Northwest Indiana Welfare Reform Coalition. Currently, she is serving as coordinator of the Northwest Indiana Coalition to Abolish Control Unit Prisons. This year, the coalition was successful in convincing the Indiana General Assembly to agree to study the advisability of limiting solitary confinement to 2 months or less and banning the practice for mentally ill prisoners.  A chemist specializing in mass spectrometry, Seymour Meyerson has made numerous professional contributions while maintaining his respect for nature and all of humanity. An Amoco employee for 37 years, Seymour advanced to the top of his field and , throughout his career, shared his technical findings in international science circles. Just recently, Seymour unselfishly donated his collection of mass spectrometry journals, which are worth $26,000, to Valparaiso University's chemistry department. Seymour shares his wife's deep-rooted convictions regarding the need to protect civil liberties.  The Meyersons will be moving to Asheville, N.C., where they will be living in a co-housing development community, which was founded on principles in keeping with their own. This unique living situation combines private homes with community living, and is modeled after a housing concept common in Denmark. Residents of the development, who are diverse in every respect, share a common house, where they can dine and share hobbies together, and common gardens, which are designed to foster a sense of community and belonging. Lotte and Seymour will be joining the family of their younger daughter, Elana Kohnle, as well as 24 other families in this community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Seymour and Lotte Meyerson on the hard work and dedication they have put forth in achieving a better life for everyone in northwest Indiana. May their new life bring them much happiness and fulfillment.                          ____________________
