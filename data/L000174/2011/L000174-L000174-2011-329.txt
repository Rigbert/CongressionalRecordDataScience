President, last week Senator Cochran, Senator Grassley, Senator Shelby, and I travelled to Flanders Field, the American Cemetery and Memorial in Belgium. We visited the cemetery on the eve of Memorial Day to take part in a ceremony honoring Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.  The U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Howard W. Gutman, shared an extraordinary poem he had written at the commemoration. ``Never to Forget'' is a tribute to those who gave their lives for our country and also a reminder that we must heed the lessons of our past to create a better future for our children.  I would like to share Ambassador Gutman's poem with my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that a copy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Never to Forget                           Memorial Day 2011     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget.     Never to forget who they were.     Men and women of many titles.     To some they were sergeant or colonel or general;     To others they were mom or dad,     Uncle or aunt . . .     Son or daughter.     To us, they are all heroes.     We honor them all.     And we honor their parents who lost children.     We honor their children who lost parents.     As a head of one of our American Battlefield cemeteries once            told me:     For those buried in his cemetery     They remain each day on active duty. . .     And on each day that we fail to remember them . . . that we            fail to honor them . . . they have served a day without            a mission.     Every soldier is entitled to his mission.     Here at Ardennes American Cemetary/Henri-Chappelle--we--           Belgians and Americans, parents and children--we are            that mission.     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget.     Never to forget what they did.     Every one of them understood when they joined that the road            would be rough.     They knew that this was not about television commercials            boasting pressed uniforms and glistening shoes or            steeds clashing on chessboards.     They knew this was not about training exercises amidst sunny            days in North Carolina,     They knew instead that this was about life and death.     They knew that for every moment of thrill, there could be            months of fear.     But they knew that the rest of us needed them. They knew our            fellow world citizens had been victims of murder or            terror.     Perhaps they knew in 1915 that the poppies and the hearts of            Belgians had been trampled on the way to 9 million            deaths in WWI.     Or perhaps they knew in 1944 that Max Gutman was hiding in            the woods in Poland after every other Jew in his small            town of Biyala Rafka had been slaughtered. Maybe they            knew that his dream one day to come to America, to            raise a future U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, had nearly            been extinguished along with the future for so many            Poles and Catholics and Jews.     Maybe they knew in 2001 that our citizens had been the            victims of terror and remained under threat.     Whenever they served, wherever they served, they knew we            needed someone to help, to respond, to free, to save,            to protect.     And they said, ``I will.''     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget the face of evil.     We welcome all into the brotherhood of man. We will meet you            far more than half way. We and our allies will send our            diplomats, help feed your poor, and treat you with            respect. But threaten none, harm even fewer,     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget.     Never to forget what they died for.     Can you hear them each and every one of the 5323 buried here            and the tens of thousands buried elsewhere . . .     Can you hear them?     If not, it is because you are listening with your ears.     But on Memorial Day, we listen not with our ears, but instead            with our hearts.     And with our hearts we can hear them loudly and clearly.     They tell us that they lived in a country that believed in            freedom and understood right from wrong.     And they tell us that they believed in service, in duty, in            the mission of creating a better world.     They tell us never to forget, but certainly to move forward            and build bridges where pools of hatred previously            existed.     They fought and they died to move us a step closer towards            the brotherhood of man. We must never use their memory            as an excuse not to get there.     Thus while we can never forget, while we will never forget,            we will forgive those who have followed. Where we faced            each other to the death, we will walk together to            rebuild a better life.     And that may be the most enduring lesson--lessons for            Belgium, for Europe, for the Middle East, or for all            places where tensions rooted in the mistakes or ill            deeds of the past threaten the progress of the future.     The lessons are that we need not carry the blame nor clear            the name of our parents and grandparents looking back.     Rather that we build a better name for our children and our            grandchildren going forward. That we must use the            lessons of the past to carve a better future.     We are so used to the expression ``Forgive but don't            forget.'' And of course Memorial Day proclaims that we            shall never forget.     But in making sure we don't forget, sometimes we don't truly            forgive.     We commemorate Memorial Day never to forget precisely so that            we can forgive.     --Ambassador Howard Gutman                          ____________________
