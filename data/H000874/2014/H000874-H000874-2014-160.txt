Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I look forward to working with him. I would observe, as he well knows, and I have discussed with the Speaker, the pay-fors that were included in the temporary patch were as elusory as any other pay-for we could find.  We simply accelerated dollars. We didn't have due dollars. We didn't really pay for it. We just simply put the debt off a month or so and collected the money early and pretended that that was going to pay for it.  Whether that is any more real than doing any of the other options that have been suggested, I think, is questionable, but I look forward to working with the gentleman.  Because I mention it every time, but I want to mention it in a slightly different context, I will bring up comprehensive immigration reform again. The majority leader says it is a broken system. We all agree on that, and we ought to move forward.  We are going to be considering the budget. The budget, we don't think is paid for. We will have a discussion about that as we go down. We think it increases the deficits; it is not balanced in 10 years.  But that aside, comprehensive immigration reform, the CBO released its score on our bill H.R. 15, which we think is a bipartisan bill, found it would reduce the deficit by $900 billion over the next 2 decades, including $200 billion over the first 10 years.  Therefore, comprehensive immigration reform, in our opinion, is not only the right thing to do, it is economically the smart thing to do. That is in the context of a bill that was brought to the floor this week that increases the deficit by nearly $74 billion, dealing with the ACA.  It is a bit ironic that, during the time of enormous deficits, that we have been unwilling to bring to the floor a bill that is scored by CBO as close to a trillion dollars positive reduction of our deficit in the coming 20 years. I would hope that we could look at that.  As I say, it is not only the right thing to do, but it is supported across the board, the bill that the Senate passed by a 68-32 margin, supported by the Chamber of Commerce, supported by the AFL-CIO, supported by growers, farmers, ag interests, as well as farm workers, supported by the faith community across the board, and supported by 70-plus percent of the American people.  You would think, in the context of that broad base of support, that we could bring a bill which has such positive affects for human beings, for individuals, and for our country, as well as a positive economic affect.  I would hope, very sincerely, that once we get past the budget and come back after the Easter break, that we address comprehensive immigration reform.  I yield to my friend if he has any comments.
