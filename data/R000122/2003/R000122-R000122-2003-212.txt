Senator Santorum has taken out elements of the legislation that do not apply to the tax rules. And we discussed, and I think reached an understanding, that those charitable choice items that would pose significant issues with respect to church and state have been eliminated from the underlying bill.  The bill we will consider is from the Finance Committee with simple tax provisions. And I know that Senator Santorum has indicated he would use his efforts, and your efforts presumably, in the conference to prevent the addition of those elements to which we have objected.  And I would assume that despite your best efforts, if such elements were included within the bill when it came back in the form of a conference report, this Senate would not take up such a conference report. Is that a fair understanding?
