 President, I send to the desk to be printed in the Record an editorial from the Sacramento Bee entitled ``Highway Robbery,'' which essentially characterizes what this does to the highway trust fund, how it hurts the country, how energy experts show that producing ethanol from corn requires more energy than the fuel produces, and that the ethanol mandate would make the country more fossil fuel dependent, not less.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sacramento Bee, Apr. 8, 2002]          Highway Robbery--Corn Is for Eating, Not for Driving       Here's another piece of the ethanol idiocy in Washington:      Not only will Californians soon have to pay more for gasoline      laced with corn liquor, but as a result, we'll have less      money to alleviate congestion on our roads.       Blame this nonsense on Senator Majority Leader Tom Daschle,      D-S.D., and President Bush. They are pushing a provision for      the Senate energy bill that would require gasoline producers      to use rising amounts of ethanol. Ethanol is mostly made from      corn in states that Bush would dearly like to win in the next      election.       The measure would eliminate the current requirement in the      Clear Air Act that smoggy areas use gasoline containing an      oxygen additive--either ethanol or MTBE. But then it goes      ahead to require that refineries triple their purchases of      ethanol for gasoline by 2012.       The mandate hurts consumers in obvious ways: It will drive      up the cost of driving, taking dollars out of the pockets of      motorists and putting them into the coffers of Archer Daniels      Midland, the Enron of the Corn Belt, which dominates the      ethanol market. (Why is it that the politicians who are eager      to give back their Enron donations seem to have no trouble      taking money from--and giving billions in benefits to--a      company that was convicted of price fixing a few years ago?)       The mandate will also hurt the country. Although ethanol is      touted as a renewable fuel, a recent study by Cornell      University scientist David Pimentel shows that producing      ethanol from corn actually requires more energy than the fuel      produces. The ethanol mandate would thus make the country      more fossil-fuel dependent, not less.       But the mandate will also hit in a less obvious way: It      will take dollars away from transportation investment. That's      because ethanol already gets another federal subsidy--the      federal fuel tax at the pump is a nickel less on fuel      containing ethanol. If the Daschle-Bush ethanol mandate is      passed, federal revenues for transportation repair, operation      and construction will plummet by nearly $3 billion a year,      transportation experts estimate.       So this is what Californians get from the proposed Daschle-     Bush ethanol bailout--higher prices at the pump and more      crowded roads. It gives the term ``highway robbery'' a whole      new dimension.
