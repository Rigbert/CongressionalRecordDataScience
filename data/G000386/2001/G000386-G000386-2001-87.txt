 President, I rise to speak on the tax relief for working families that the Senate passed a few weeks ago and was signed into law by President Bush.  This is the second in a series of speeches I am giving to highlight the details of this bipartisan tax cut that provided significant relief to millions of Americans.  In today's speech I want to focus on the many provisions in the bipartisan bill that provide tax relief for working families and particularly families with children.  First, I wish to discuss the efforts to address the marriage penalty that existed throughout the structure of the income tax. For far too many years, the Tax Code penalized working families where both the husband and wife work. It is simply wrong that we had a Tax Code that penalized marriage.
