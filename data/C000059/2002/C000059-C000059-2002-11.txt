Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the spiritual well-being of Southern California, the nation and the world is exceptional. Southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Greg Laurie is one of these individuals. The week of November 24th will mark 30 years of dedicated service and Greg's work will be celebrated by his family, friends, colleagues, church members, and all those whose lives he has touched through his work.  Greg Laurie is a native of Southern California, born in Long Beach on December 10, 1952. His interest in the ministry began with a girl he followed into Bible study. At 19 he committed his life to Jesus Christ and grew a Bible study of 30 people into a church of more than 15,000 people. Greg is senior pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California, the eighth largest church in America. As a pastor, Greg has sought to meet the challenges and opportunities of religion in the 21st century. In his 30 years of faithful service to the Harvest Christian Fellowship he has provided unwavering spiritual support and guidance.  In addition to his work in the church, Greg sought out a way to present the gospel of Jesus Christ to Southern Californians in a non-traditional, non-church environment. With the help of a fellow colleague, Greg began the Harvest Crusades, a multi-night event of upbeat music, genuine worship, and a clear presentation of biblical messages. The first Harvest Crusades saw more than 90,000 people attend. Since that time, crowds totaling over 2.8 million people have attended Harvest Crusades in California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Hawaii, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina. In May of 2000, Harvest Crusades ventured outside the U.S. for the first time to present Harvest 2000 in Wollongong, Australia. Tens of thousands more people have participated in the Harvest Crusades via the Internet.  Besides conducting evangelistic crusades, Harvest Ministries sponsors A New Beginning, an international daily radio program with messages by Greg Laurie, as well as a weekly television program, Harvest: Greg Laurie. Greg also serves as a board member of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Samaritan's Purse. At the Billy Graham Atlanta Crusade in 1994, Dr. Graham stated ``The media have been writing Greg Laurie up as the man who is going to be the evangelist of the future-and he is.''  In recognition of Greg's exemplary work as a minister and evangelist, his 30th anniversary as pastor will be a week long celebration of programs, activities and ceremonies. Greg's tireless work has contributed unmeasurably to the spiritual well-being and betterment Southern California and the world. His outstanding involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend.                          ____________________
