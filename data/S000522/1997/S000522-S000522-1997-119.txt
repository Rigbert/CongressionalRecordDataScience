Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds just briefly to respond.  First of all, we are saying in my amendment, ``Divest yourself of abortion and you get family planning funds.'' The gentleman from Connecticut in 1984-85, when I first offered this amendment, said none of the nongovernmental organizations would accept those conditions. Well, over the course of the years in the 1980's, early 1990's, virtually every family planning provider except for the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London and Planned Parenthood Federation of America accepted those conditions. They separated themselves from the killing of babies through abortion and took the money and did family planning. We want to erect that wall again in my amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Jones].
