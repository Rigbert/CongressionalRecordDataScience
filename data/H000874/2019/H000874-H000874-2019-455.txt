Speaker. The fact of the matter is the Senate sent us a bill to keep the government open. They passed it unanimously, under Republican leadership. The President said he would sign it. He changed his mind, and this House folded. And the Republicans who were in charge at the time wouldn't even put the Senate bill on the floor.  We are not prepared to be bludgeoned by taking hostage 800,000 people who work for the Federal Government and who are not now being paid, some of whom are working.                              {time}  1300  And, ironically, they are working to protect the border and to make sure our planes are flying, to make sure people who fly on planes are not in danger.  We want the President of the United States to open up this government. We want the Republicans to help us open up this government. We just passed four bills that are the Senate bills. Senator McConnell is not going to take ``yes'' for an answer because the President tells him: I am not going to sign those bills.  Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker. I have been a Member of this body for some period of time, and I served with George Bush. He was President of the United States, and we had a Democratic House, and we didn't have a shutdown. He signed appropriations bills. We worked together. We respected one another.  I would hope, Mr. Speaker, in closing, that the whip would, in fact, help us open up the government, and then we are prepared to sit down--he knows me--and talk about how we make our borders secure and protect our people and, yes, give humanitarian services to those who are seeking asylum, running from violence and mayhem and murder. We are prepared to do that. We want to do that.  I would hope the whip, I would hope Senator McConnell, who was quoted just a few years ago as saying, ``shutdown is a failed policy''--shutdowns ought not to occur. Adults who are responsible ought not to allow that to happen, realizing full well that in order to preclude that from happening, compromise is absolutely essential on both sides.  President Trump is the President of the United States. We have to work with him to compromise, to come to agreement. But there are an awful lot of Republicans--I quoted Will Hurd; I quoted Ron Johnson; I quoted some other Republicans--an awful lot of Republicans who think the President has the wrong idea. And, frankly, as Mr. Mulvaney said during the course of the campaign, it wasn't a very realistic idea.  But, that aside, it is time for us to open up the government, and then we will have an extensive discussion, as we must, as we should, in the best interests of the American people, to keep our borders secure and keep them safe.
