President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1259       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Trafficking Victims Enhanced      Protection Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) There are as many as 300,000 child soldiers in use by      state-run armies, paramilitaries, and guerilla groups in      roughly 21 countries around the world and in almost every      region of the world.       (2) The 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report defines a child      soldier as any person under 18 years of age who directly      takes part in hostilities, has been compulsorily or      voluntarily recruited as a member of a government's armed      forces, or has been recruited or used in hostilities by armed      forces distinct from the armed forces of a state.       (3) Children are used as soldiers, combatants, spies,      scouts, decoys, guards, cooks, human mine detectors, and even      sex slaves, robbing them of their childhood. Children are      forced to join such groups physically, economically, or      socially, or lured with promises of food, money, or security.       (4) Exploitation of these children leaves them stigmatized      and traumatized. Children also suffer higher mortality,      disease, and injury rates in combat situations than adults,      putting their health and lives at risk.       (5) The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection      Reauthorization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-457) prohibits      the provision of International Military Education and      Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Funds (FMF) assistance      to countries found to use child soldiers.       (6) The first report required under WTVPRA, published in      2010, identified 6 countries found to use child soldiers:      Burma, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),      Sudan, Yemen, and Chad.       (7) On October 25, 2010, President Barack Obama exercised      his waiver authority for 4 of the 6 countries to include the      Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan, Yemen, and Chad,      which allowed the United States Government to provide both      IMET and FMF funding to these countries.       (8) United States peacekeeping funds that were not      restricted in the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims      Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 have been provided to      Somalia, despite the use of child soldiers in that country      and United States efforts to halt such practices.     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PROVISION OF PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS                    ASSISTANCE TO CERTAIN GOVERNMENTS.
