Mr. Speaker, it is with deep sorrow that I inform the House that our dear friend and colleague, Don Payne, has passed. He had colon cancer.  In a few moments a privileged resolution will be offered on the floor that recognizes and honors this extraordinary man who dedicated his entire life to public service, a man who made a significant difference in the lives of many in his district, in our State, in the Nation, and in the world.  Elected in 1988, after first serving as a Newark city councilman and Essex County freeholder, this high school teacher and coach-turned-politician went on to be the first African American ever to serve in Congress from the State of New Jersey.  Don fought tenaciously to combat the HIV AIDS pandemic and mitigate the loss of life and morbidity from TB and malaria on the subcontinent of Africa. He coauthored the Sudan Peace Act and worked tirelessly to end the genocide in both South Sudan and Darfur. As a matter of fact, he even risked his life in Somalia--was shot at--in the pursuit of peace.  I know firsthand, Mr. Speaker, how much he truly cared and how hard he worked for peace and reconciliation in war-ravaged nations. I served as the ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee when he chaired it, and he served as the ranking member when I chaired it.  Finally, let me just say that Don Payne also served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, and until his untimely death today, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. He was predeceased by his wife, Hazel. Don is also the proud father of three, grandfather of four, and great grandfather of one.  Donald Payne, Mr. Speaker, will be missed.  I yield to my good friend and colleague, Mr. Pallone.
