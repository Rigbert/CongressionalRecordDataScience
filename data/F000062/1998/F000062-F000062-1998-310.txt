 I also would like to begin by thanking the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for what was, by and large, a rapid and prompt processing of Carlos Moreno. I submitted the name of Carlos Moreno to the President for appointment to the District Court from the Central District of California. In a sense, Madam President, I believe he is prototypical of really what a good Federal judge should bring to that office. I would like to just quickly go over what is an amazing success story.  Judge Moreno was born in East L.A., just 2 miles from the Federal courthouse where he will be serving. He has earned the respect and admiration of both the legal and the law community, and he has had 13 years of service on the State courts. He has strong bipartisan support, including the endorsements of the former Governor George Deukmejian and Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block.  As the chairman of the committee pointed out, he obtained his bachelor's degree from Yale in 1970 and his J.D. from Stanford in 1975. He began his legal career in the City Attorney's Office of Los Angeles where he worked for 4 years, from 1975 to 1979.  He prosecuted numerous jury trials, misdemeanor prosecutions, and criminal and civil consumer protection cases. He worked as a litigation attorney for 7 years, handling commercial litigation in State and Federal courts. So he has experience in both the civil as well as the criminal law. His caseload there included bankruptcy, wrongful termination, banking, real estate, and antitrust.  In 1986 the Governor of California, George Deukmejian, appointed him to the municipal court. He served there for 7 years, handling 40 civil jury trials in addition to a regular criminal trial workload.  In 1993, Governor Wilson elevated him to the California Superior Court where he served for the past 4 years. He averaged approximately 2 dozen jury trials a year, at least a third of which have been homicides. The remainder have consisted of a broad range of felonies and he has presided over about a dozen bench trials per year.  So, 13 years as a municipal and superior court judge. This year he was selected as the superior court judge of the year by the criminal law section of the Los Angeles County Bar Association and was described as one who earns praise from both prosecutors and defense attorneys for his fair, even-tempered handling of a high-volume calendar of criminal cases. The large number of court trials he handles in which both sides, both sides, waive the jury and try the case before him is an indicator, I believe, of the trust he has received from opposing counsels.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of support by GeorgeDeukmejian, former Governor; a letter from the District Attorney of Los Angeles County; and a letter from the Sheriff of Los Angeles County.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Los Angeles, CA,                                                  October 6, 1997.     Re Judge Carlos R. Moreno.     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington,          DC.       Dear Senator Hatch: It has come to my attention that Judge      Carlos Moreno has been nominated for an appointment to the      U.S. District Court, Central District of California.       In 1986, it was my pleasure to appoint him to the Compton      Municipal Court and in 1993 he was appointed by Governor Pete      Wilson to the Los Angeles Superior Court.       It is my understanding that he has performed in an      exemplary manner as a Municipal and Superior Court Judge and      has a clear perception of the importance of maintaining a      judicial system that insures fairness and social order.       Judge Moreno is well suited for this position. I am      confident that he has the appropriate judicial skills and in      light of his qualifications, I hope you will give him every      consideration for appointment to the U.S. District Court.           Most cordially,                                                George Deukmejian,     35th Governor of California.                                  ____                                                Los Angeles County                                            District Attorney,                                     Los Angeles, CA, May 2, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senator, San Francisco, CA.       Dear Dianne: Superior Court Judge Carlos R. Moreno has      informed me that he is seeking an appointment to the U.S.      District Court for the Central District of California, and I      am writing to strongly recommend his nomination and      confirmation.       Although Judge Moreno is not a personal acquaintance of      mine, I have had the opportunity to personally interview him      and to speak with several of my colleagues who have appeared      before him on many occasions. All of the persons I contacted      were effusive in their praise of the professional attributes      that Judge Moreno brings to the bench as a Superior Court      trial judge: he is fair, bright, willing to read with care      the lawyers' written motions, control his courtroom, and give      both sides fair hearings in his court. In addition, he      apparently relishes legal research and thoroughly      familiarizes himself with the issues of a case before he      gives a decision--a quality which would serve him well on the      Federal bench.       I do not make recommendations on behalf of those seeking      appointments lightly, and in fact, I turn down most requests.      However, the level of support and enthusiasm expressed by my      colleagues on behalf of Judge Moreno prompted me to agree to      interview him, and I found him during the interview to have      the personal attributes that I had been told he displays on a      daily basis in his court. I am confident Carlos Moreno would      serve as a District Court judge with distinction, and I      believe his appointment would be beneficial to the citizens      of California.           Very truly yours,                                                 Gil Garcetti,     District Attorney.                                  ____                                            County of Los Angeles,                                Monterey Park, CA, April 23, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Dianne: It has come to my attention that Los Angeles      County Superior Court Judge Carlos R. Moreno has indicated      his desire to be appointed a United States District Court      Judge for the Central District of California. I am pleased      and honored to give him my personal endorsement.       Judge Moreno has an extensive criminal justice background.      He has been a Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles      County since November of 1993. Prior to that, Judge Moreno      was a City Attorney with the City of Los Angeles from 1975 to      1979 where he handled criminal and civil consumer protection      prosecutions and legislative and politically sensitive      matters. He was a member of the law firm of Kelley, Drye &      Warren from 1979 to 1986, and in October 1986 Judge Moreno      was elected Judge of the Municipal Court. He held that seat      until his appointment to the Superior Court in 1993.      Throughout his tenure on the bench, he has continually      demonstrated the prerequisite abilities necessary to be a      fair, impartial, and knowledgeable jurist.       Judge Moreno is an extremely hard working individual of      impeccable character and integrity. His list of credits, both      professionally and within the community, is extensive.       I would like to recommend that you favorably consider his      appointment. I have no doubt that he would be a distinguished      addition to the United States District Court.           Sincerely,                                                    Sherman Block,                                                          Sheriff.
