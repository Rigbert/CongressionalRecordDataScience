 President, I understand I have 1 minute to discussthe amendment before the Senate. This amendment is on behalf of Senator Bingaman and myself. It essentially deals with an issue that emerged in the consideration of the class action bill.  I am a supporter of the class action bill. However, there is a loophole. That loophole is with class action consumer-related cases.
