 President, I listened with interest in the Cloakroom to my friend from North Carolina and what he had to say in response to the Senator from Maryland. The Senator from Maryland can surely take care of himself and respond in any way he thinks is appropriate, but at one point we all say things that we sort of slip and say and do not mean.  He made reference to our nominee to China, former Senator Sasser as ``needing a job.'' I inform the Senator that not only does Senator Sasser not need a job, he is doing financially much better now than he did when he was here. He needs no job. This is a public service to which he has agreed to return, and I am sure the Senator did not mean to imply anything by what he said, but I want the Record to make it clear. Senator Sasser does not need a job--it is for those of us, including the President, who think we need Senator Sasser to come back to public service. I yield the floor.
