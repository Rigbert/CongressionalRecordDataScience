 1999, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act, which strikes language known as the ``noninterference clause'' included in the recently passed conference report accompanying the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003.  I believe that language preventing the Secretary from leveraging the enormous purchasing power of the Federal Government will mean our seniors may pay more for their drugs than they could be if that language was modified to allow the Secretary negotiating ability. America's seniors already pay the highest drug prices in the world, even though American taxpayers subsidize the research that produces many of those drugs.  So this legislation gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, authority to negotiate contracts with manufacturers of covered Medicare Part D prescription drugs in order to ensure that enrollees in Medicare prescription drug plans, PDPs, pay the lowest possible price. The authority given to the HHS Secretary is similar to that given to other Federal entities that purchase prescription drugs in bulk.  I voted for the Medicare prescription drug conference report because it delivered voluntary prescription drug coverage to this Nation's 41 million Medicare beneficiaries. Too many Americans today face the terrible choice of paying for rent or groceries or paying for their prescription drugs. In fact, some of my constituents have resorted to skipping doses in an attempt to manage prescription drug prices.  One of the strongest features of the Medicare bill is the assistance it provides for low-income Medicare recipients through the elimination or reduction of premiums, deductibles and copays. For those low-income Medicare recipients whose prescription drug spending exceeds the catastrophic limit, or $5,100 in total drug spending, Medicare will pay all of their drug costs. For seniors who do not qualify for the low-income assistance, they will pay no more than 5 percent of their prescription drug costs above the catastrophic limit.  The Medicare prescription drug bill includes essential increases in funding for California's health care providers. California's hospitals are facing financial crises across the State. In fact, over the past 7 years, more than 62 hospitals have been forced to close.  The bill will help hospitals meet the needs of California's communities by providing $882 million in additional Medicare and Medicaid payments over the next 10 years. Physicians will now receive an increase of 1.5 percent per year in Medicare payments in 2004 and 2005, rather than the 4.5 percent payment cut they were expected to incur.  However, one of the most troubling aspects of the bill was language intended to promote competition among prescription drug plans in order to lower prescription drug prices. Section 1860D-11(i) says:       The Secretary may not interfere with the negotiations      between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and Prescription      Drug sponsors.  I believe that this language actually takes away one of the best tools the Medicare program could use to bring down prescription drug prices by denying the Government the ability to negotiate price discounts on behalf of Medicare recipients.  The Veterans' Affairs, VA, system negotiates prescription drug prices. This negotiating authority has been a terrific success in bringing down the cost of drugs purchased by the VA. Why would we prevent the Secretary of HHS from doing the same on behalf of our 41 million Medicare recipients?  Some argue that this noninterference language will spur competing prescription drug plans to drive down the cost of prescription drugs in an effort to secure contracts with the Federal Government. However, since the Secretary may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for covered Part D drugs, seniors may be unprotected from escalating drug costs in regions without plan competition.  Here is the most recent picture of health care spending in the United States: Health care spending in the United States increased 9.3 percent to $1.55 trillion in 2002, the largest increase in 11 years. It now accounts for 15 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product. Prescription drug spending rose 15.3 percent to $162.4 billion in 2002, accounting for 16 percent of the overall health care spending increase.  Spending on prescription drugs is often cited as a key contributor to rising health care costs. Unfortunately, the Medicare bill missed a significant opportunity to reign in the escalating cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.  I believe the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act will bring real prescription drug cost relief to seniors in California and across the country.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.                          ____________________
