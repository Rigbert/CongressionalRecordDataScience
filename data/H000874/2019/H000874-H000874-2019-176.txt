Speaker, I have the sad task of announcing what probably most of you already know. We have lost a great American, a decent American, a wonderful Member of this body, Elijah Cummings, who died early this morning of illnesses he had been suffering from for a significant period of time.  Members of the House, the people of Maryland, and the people of the United States of America woke up to this sad and shocking news that we had lost this dear friend, a devoted public servant, and a dedicated patriot, who reflected courtesy and respect for all.  At a time of confrontation, disagreement, anger, and, yes, sometimes hate, he was a beacon of civility, of fairness, and of justice. He was chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee. He passed away too early at 68 years of age.  All of us who served with him knew his passion for justice; his sharp intellect, having graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University, where he was president of the student government association; his wit; and his devotion to the cause of making government work for the people.  It will be surely said of Elijah that he worked hard until the very end. He was on a telephone call with all of us on Sunday talking about how we ought to proceed with the heavy duties that confronted him, his committee, and the Congress.  He never wavered in his dedication to the causes he made the hallmarks of his career, even in recent days when, as I said, his health was waning.  Those causes were equality and opportunity for all, the son of a sharecropper who rose to be a great leader in this country. He was concerned about voting rights, civil rights, alleviating poverty, establishing justice, and ensuring that those entrusted with high office are held accountable and carry out their responsibilities lawfully and ethically.  Elijah Cummings was, of course, a true son of Baltimore, a city of grit and hope, a city of dreams and hard work. He was loved in the city of Baltimore. At a time of great distress in the city of Baltimore, it was Elijah Cummings in the streets bringing calm and peace to that city.  His life will forever be an example to all of us of striving to better one's community and one's country, a passion and service to one's fellow man and woman, and a perseverance in the face of adversity while in pursuit of making this country and the world a better place.  Whenever he believed we were falling short of the vision of our Founders--and many of you will hear this resonate in your ears--he would say to all of us in a loving way, as he said throughout our State at a time of trouble and difference: ``We are better than this.''  As we see conflict, as we see people disparaging one another, we want to think to ourselves, ``we are better than this,'' and think of Elijah Cummings, a man of great faith, of great humility, of great humanity, and of great service.  We will miss Elijah Cummings. We are a lesser place for losing him. Like the prophet for whom he was named, he was taken from us too young, too soon, too suddenly. We can say, with Shakespeare: He should have died hereafter. Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.  Elijah will not have those tomorrows, and we will not have them with him. We will miss him dearly.  My thoughts are with his wife, Maya, and his three children.  I offer my condolences to the people of Maryland's Seventh Congressional District, who loved their Congressman. They had confidence in their Congressman, and they knew that he was, in fact, better, and they were better for his service.  May God bless Elijah Cummings, his family, all of us, and this great country.                          ____________________
