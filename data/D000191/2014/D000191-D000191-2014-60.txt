Chairman, I have an article from Oil Daily in 2008, and it is on the subject of a 1-day increase of $17.51 in the price of a barrel of oil, and they go on to say nothing in the world happened, that traders were astonished and horrified with the volatility, and this should really settle the argument whether this is speculation or fundamentals at work. There is massive speculation in this market.  Even the chairman of ExxonMobil says that a good deal of the price being paid at the pump has to do with speculation. We can whistle past the graveyard and continue to bow to Wall Street and defer to them, but this is the reality. I wish that we would do something about it, but I fear we won't because they are very generous in even-numbered years.  I yield back the balance of my time.
