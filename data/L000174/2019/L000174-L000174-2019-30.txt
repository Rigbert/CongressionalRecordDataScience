The Vermont families and businesses that keep this sector vibrant and viable are also an essential part of the fabric of our State. I am proud to recognize one of those businesses today. Nestled along the western slopes of Vermont's highest peak, Mount Mansfield, Runamok Maple is one of the roughly 1500 sugar producers in Vermont that produce nearly half of the Nation's maple syrup. Owned and operated by Laura and Eric Sorkin, Runamok Maple exemplifies the innovation and entrepreneurship that is revitalizing communities across Vermont.  Maple sugaring is a tradition carried forward and refined by each new generation of Vermonters. The Sorkins themselves benefited from the mentorship of nearby sugar producers before launching their own business a decade ago. In 2016, recognizing an opportunity, they pumped money and energy into a diversification effort that included a retail line of flavor-infused and barrel-aged syrups, all packaged and branded for the direct sales market. Two years later, I was proud to support funding for the Northern Border Regional Commission that in turn allowed Fairfax, VT, to expand wastewater infrastructure to Runamok's new manufacturing home, an old facility that once manufactured Scrabble game tiles. The improvements enabled Runamok's expansion from 45 to 100 employees and revitalized a part of the historic town.  Through their products, writings, and creativity, the Sorkins and their outstanding staff are not only producing world-class value-added products, they are changing how people think about maple syrup. Long gone are the days when it was considered a mere condiment for pancakes. I was not surprised, then, to see Runamok Maple featured in a recent Washington Post article about the many possibilities of Vermont's sweetest export.  In recognition of the families across our State who continue to keep this bedrock Vermont sector thriving, I askunanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 2, 2019]Before You Pour All That Maple Syrup on Your Pancakes, Here's What You                           Should Know About It                           (By Becky Krystal)       It's fall, so you can take your pumpkin spice and . . .      enjoy it in your deodorant, candles, lattes and, well,      seemingly everything. Me? When I think of fall flavors, I      think about maple syrup. It is actually a bit odd when you      consider that spring is the season when producers collect and      cook down the sap from the maple trees. Still, I'm going to      stick with my convictions, because maple syrup to me evokes      New England and flannel and colorful foliage, all of which      are the essence of fall.       And no, it's not just sweet. ``Maple syrup is a lot more      complex than sugar,'' says Laura Sorkin, who owns Vermont-     based Runamok Maple with her husband, Eric. ``There's a lot      more nuance than what you would get with granulated sugar.''      The flavor can vary depending on the time of year, but Sorkin      says toffee, caramel, honey and apple are among the notes she      can pick out. There's also a balance of sweetness and      acidity.       We've all poured maple syrup over our pancakes and waffles.      Maybe even a little too much--that stuff is $$$! Here's what      you need to know about how to better understand, appreciate      and use that liquid gold. (Sorry, Mimi.)       The grades. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture      updated its maple grades to come into line with standards      already adopted by several states and Canada. One of the      goals with the new grades was to give consumers better      descriptors of flavor and color, as well as allow some of the      very dark syrup previously classified as B grade to be folded      into the A grade, providing easier access for home cooks.      Sorkin says it's worth keeping in mind that the strength of      flavor does not always occur in a smooth progression along      with color, as you can get a lighter-colored syrup with an      intense taste and a darker that's milder.       Still, here is the rundown of how the government describes      the grades aimed at individual buyers (there is a processing      grade that can be used by manufacturers making other      products), ordered from least to most intense, as well as      early to late season:       Grade A, golden color/delicate flavor: ``Mild maple      taste,'' according to the USDA. You might know this from its      previous grade, Fancy. The Vermont Maple Sugar Makers'      Association suggests serving this grade with the expected      breakfast fare or rich dairy, such as ice cream or yogurt.       Grade A, amber color/rich flavor: ``A full-bodied maple      taste of medium intensity,'' the USDA says. If you choose      only one grade, Sorkin says, it should be this one. It's      great on waffles and pancakes, but the Vermont association      also recommends it for salad dressings, cocktails and      barbecue sauce.       Grade A, dark color/robust flavor: The USDA is less helpful      on the last two grades, explaining that this grade has a      stronger taste than the lighter colors. You don't say.      Anyway, our friends from Vermont like to take advantage of      its hearty flavor by pouring it over baked fruit and      vegetables and using it as a glaze for meat and vegetables.      It can also shine in baking.       Grade A, very dark/strong flavor: You guessed it--``a maple      taste that is stronger than robust.'' Okay then! What say      you, Vermont? ``When you need a strong maple flavor in a      bread or cookie, ice cream, or barbecue sauce, this is the      grade of choice.''       Storage. Keep unopened maple syrup in a cool, dry spot, out      of direct light. The Vermont Maple Sugar Makers' Association      recommends storing opened maple syrup in the refrigerator. Or      to keep it in very good shape, you can freeze it, going      through as many freezing and thawing cycles as you want, the      group says, as long as you let it thaw completely and stir in      any condensation that forms on the top of the syrup.       Even when properly stored, maple syrup can crystallize. In      ``The Clever Cook's Kitchen Handbook: 5,037 Ingenious Hints,      Secrets, Shortcuts, and Solutions,'' author David Joachim      suggests heating the jar of syrup in a pan of hot water over      low heat until the crystals dissolve. (Move the syrup to a      glass jar or heatproof bowl if it's in plastic.) Or, try      microwaving it for 10 to 15 seconds on medium power. Of      course, you can consider it candy and just eat the crystals,      too. Joachim says you can salvage moldy maple syrup by      scraping or straining out the mold and bringing the syrup to      a full boil and returning it to a clean jar or bottle.       Substituting. ``Maple syrup is about as sweet as sugar, so      you can replace it using an equal amount of syrup,''      according to the Vermont-based experts at King Arthur Flour.      ``Decrease the liquid by 3 to 4 tablespoons per 1 cup      substitution.'' If you're adding maple syrup to a recipe that      doesn't call for liquid, you need to increase the flour by 1      tablespoon for every \1/4\ cup maple syrup used. KAF      emphasizes using room temperature maple syrup, because if      it's cold, it can cause other ingredients, including butter,      to clump. If you use a darker grade, expect a ``delightfully      caramelly'' flavor.       Flavoring your own. Runamok's eclectic infused syrups      include such flavors as hibiscus, makrut lime-leaf, smoked      chile pepper and ginger. (Here's a link to a coffee syrup in      our archives.) If you're interested in creating your own      infusions, especially with whole spices, Sorkin suggests      gently heating the syrup and letting the ingredients steep      for a few hours. Taste every so often to see whether you've      achieved the right level of flavor. Keep in mind that it's      better to be conservative than add too much or steep too      long.       Uses. ``I would just love it if people would start thinking      beyond pancakes,'' Sorkin says. She notes that honey has      really come into its own as an ingredient to be appreciated      and used in a variety of ways and hopes the time will come      soon for maple syrup. Maple syrup on a cheese board? Go for      it! In Vermont, people have been putting maple syrup in their      coffee for a long time, and Sorkin says it works in tea, too,      particularly a black variety (try it in chai). She is, as you      would expect, a proponent of maple syrup in cocktails.       Sorkin says maple syrup can be lost in flour-heavy baked      goods, so she prefers to save it for situations when it can      really shine, such as in frostings (buttercream or cream      cheese), glazes and a simple syrup applied to a cake. It can      be used in a wide variety of savory applications, too, adding      just the right balance when played against other flavors.      Sorkin, who trained at the French Culinary Institute in New      York (now the International Culinary Center), likes to add a      drizzle on top of a sweet potato and tahini dip. Her other      recipes include maple vinaigrettes, roasted cabbage and      crispy tofu. Always worth considering: Maple butter.       Need some more ideas? Here are a few contenders from our      archives:       Frozen Maple Mousse. This is very much like a no-chum ice      cream, which you can drizzle with a bit more maple syrup,      naturally.       Maple Olive Oil Pecan Granola. Here's another way to      incorporate maple syrup into your breakfast that does not      involve pancakes or waffles.       Maple Spiced Glazed Nuts. These are definitely worth adding      to your party food repertoire--they make an ideal game-day      snack.       Grilled Maple-Marinated Portobello Mushrooms. Maple syrup      is paired with soy sauce and earthy mushrooms for an umami-     rich meatless main.       Maple-Chipotle Basting Sauce. Consider using a darker grade      for this sauce, which is right at home on pork or any other      grilled meat.                          ____________________
