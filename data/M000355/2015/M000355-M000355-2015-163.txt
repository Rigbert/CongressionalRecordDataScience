 President, I wish to recognize a good friend of mine and the Kentucky Senate president, Robert Stivers, for the honor he recently received of being named one of the country's top nine public officials of the year by Governing magazine. Senator Stivers certainly deserves this recognition, as he has led the Kentucky Senate admirably since his elevation to the president's post in 2013.  Senator Stivers has served in the Kentucky Senate since 1997. He represents the 25th District in eastern Kentucky, which includes parts of Clay, Knox, Lee, Owsley, Whitley, and Wolfe Counties. Like myself, Robert is a proud graduate of both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. Before becoming senate president in 2013, he served as the senate's majority floor leader from 2009 to 2012.  Senator Stivers is perfectly suited for his leadership role, as he is a man who naturally knows how to build consensus and coalitions. He remains a practicing attorney in his hometown of Manchester and is finely tuned in to the needs of his constituents. The Clay County Chamber of Commerce honored Senator Stivers with its Man of the Year award in 2000. In 2002 he received both the AARP Appreciation Award and the Kentucky River Lincoln Club Outstanding Service Award.  Senator Stivers was recognized as one of the top public officials in the country because he has led the Kentucky Senate to pass some very important measures, including a bill to address the growing scourge of heroin and prescription pain pill abuse in our State. That is an issue I have followed closely over the years, and I can attest firsthand that Senator Stivers has been a real champion in working to find a solution.  Senator Stivers also led the senate to pass a measure providing funding for a new cancer research center at the University of Kentucky. This new facility will prove to be of immeasurable benefit to the people of Kentucky and also helps establish the University of Kentucky as one of the region's top research universities, which will attract more talent and funding to the Commonwealth.  I would ask all of my colleagues to join me in congratulating Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers on this honor, and I thank him for his service to the people of our State. Those of us in Kentucky who have watched him at work have known for a long time that he is a talented and energetic legislator. And he is a great public servant on behalf of the people of Kentucky.  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article detailing Senator Stivers' recognition by Governing magazine. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Nov. 17, 2015] Magazine Names Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers a Top Public                            Official in Nation                           (By Jack Brammer)       Frankfort--Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers has      been named one of the country's nine public officials of the      year by Governing magazine.       Stivers, R-Manchester, was nominated for the award by the      magazine's editors. The magazine has honored individual state      and local government officials for their accomplishments      every year since 1994.       The publication commends Stivers for his bipartisan work      since assuming the role of Senate president in 2013.       Landmark legislation that has passed during Stivers'      presidency include bills to address abuse of prescription      drugs and heroin, and providing funding for a new cancer      research center at the University of Kentucky.       ``It is an honor to receive this award on behalf of our      work in the legislature,'' Stivers said in a statement. ``We      are fortunate to have so many dedicated servants in the      Kentucky General Assembly who were willing to put aside      politics and do what was best for the Commonwealth of      Kentucky. While there is still plenty of work to be done, I      am very thankful to my colleagues and staff for their work on      significant pieces of legislation. It has been a great      year.''       Stivers was appointed this year as the incoming chairman of      the Southern Legislative Conference, which is to hold its      annual meeting in Lexington in 2016. Stivers also will be      chairman of the Council on State Governments in 2018.       Stivers will travel to Washington, D.C., next month to      receive the award. He represents the 25th District, which      encompasses Clay, Knox, Lee, Owsley, Whitley and Wolfe      counties.                            ____________________
