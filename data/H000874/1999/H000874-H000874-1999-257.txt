Speaker, this past weekend in Hershey, many of us implicitly pledged to rise above our party labels and work as one when issues of right and fairness demanded it. Today, just 2 days later, after Hershey, we face the first test of that premise. If we pass the test, I have no doubt that the 106th Congress will take a step in reducing the air of animus and acrimony.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the motion to recommit that I will offer at the conclusion of this debate. Without altering the funding totals in House Resolution 101, my motion provides for a fair, one-third/two-thirds division of total committee resources between the majority and minority, and the complete discretion over the use of these resources.  I offer the motion, Mr. Speaker, because House Resolution 101 does not treat 212 Members of this body fairly, and, therefore, contravenes all that Hershey symbolizes. I might say, Mr. Speaker, that this minority is the largest minority in this century.  It was not that long ago that I could have counted on the current majority to support my motion to recommit. In a March 30, 1993 letter, signed by 31 Republican leaders, 17 of whom still serve in this body, they wrote then and I quote: ``If congressional reform means anything, it means fairness to the minority in allocation and control of resources.''  I ask my majority colleagues to consider that language of 31 of their leaders. They went on to say that ``reform without fairness is merely shuffling the cards in a marked deck.''  Their letter went on to say further, and I quote, ``A ratio of one-third/two-thirds for all committee staff, investigative as well as statutory, is a sine qua non, an absolutely essential component of, the effort for bridging the institutional animosities that now poison our policy debates.''  It was that criteria of fairness, that Pat Roberts and Jennifer Dunn included in their amendments, and in their motions to recommit on the floor, for which every Republican, save one, Don Young of Alaska, voted in 1993 and 1994, of those Republicans who still serve in this body.                              {time}  1830  Now let me make it very clear to my colleagues on my side of the aisle. To his credit, the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) has fully adopted the one-third/two-thirds principle for the Committee on House Administration. I have thanked him for that, and I admire him for that. Since 1995 he has given our side one-third of the total funds, one-third of the staff, and control over our share of the resources.  Unfortunately, no other committee chairman has fully followed his lead. Frequently the chairman will speak of 30 percent as though it is the same as one-third. It is not. One-third equals 33.3 percent, not 30 percent, not 29.8, not 31. The 3.3 percent difference can add up to thousands of dollars in lost resources for the minority.  Again, I call my colleagues' attention to the definition of ``fairness'' incorporated in this statement, a definition that was then adopted by every Republican, save one, who was a Member of this body in 1993 and 1994, and is a Member today. However, when the chairmen talk about ``fairness,'' they fail to explain why the minority does not control one-third of the nonsalary budget. That means whenever the minority staff needs to purchase a computer or a copy machine or a box of paper clips, it must ask the chairman for the money to make the purchase, a situation of which the then minority in 1993 and 1994 bitterly complained.  Often chairmen will claim that the minority receives one-third of the committee staff slots. That may in some instances be true, but if the minority does not also receive one-third of the total committed funding, the staff slots may be irrelevant. And if a chairman arbitrarily exempts any portion of a committee staff as nonpartisan administrative personnel even though these employees work full-time in the majority office, then the claim has been inflated.  Another refrain we hear to justify a less than perfect implementation of the one-third principle is that Democrats on some committees did not respect it when they were in the majority, and therefore it has taken time to ``grow'' their budgets to the full one-third. That argument may have worked in the 104th, and perhaps in the 105th, but very frankly it is time to do, Mr. Speaker, what they said on the minority side was fairness. That is the criteria that they set; that is the motionto recommit that I will offer. It is exactly like that offered by Pat Roberts in 1993 and the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Dunn) in 1994.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
