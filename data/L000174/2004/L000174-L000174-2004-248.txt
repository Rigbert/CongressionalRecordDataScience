President, today we are asked to consider the nomination of Walter Kelley, Jr. to the Eastern District of Virginia. Mr. Kelley is currently a partner with the Norfolk office of the Troutman Sanders law firm. He has significant civil litigation experience. The ABA unanimously found Mr. Kelley to be well-qualified to be a district court judge. He also has the support of both of his home-State Senators.  It should be noted that Mr. Kelley has been very active in Republican politics over the past several decades. Mr. Kelley recently served as the Chairman of the Republican Party of Norfolk forfour years. He is currently involved in a Republican political action committee and serves as Director of the Downtown Republican Club. A few years ago, upon being elected Rector of the Old Dominion University Board of Visitors, Mr. Kelley was asked about the political nature of the position and politics in general, when he answered, ``[i]f you really believe strongly in how it is you think Government should act with the citizenry . . . you can't sit on the sidelines and not be in the game. You're either in there trying to make happen that which you believe in, or you're ceding the whole debate to the other side.''  I trust that Mr. Kelley will not believe that he can continue this advocacy as a judge. By taking his oath of office he will be expected to assume a position of impartiality and discard his previous partisan advocacy. Certainly, we can all agree that the Federal bench is not the place to advocate any agenda other than fairness.  I congratulate Mr. Kelley and his family on his confirmation today.  Mr. President, again, he had the highest ABA rating and is strongly supported by the two Senators from Virginia. I hope everybody on this side of the aisle will vote for him.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
