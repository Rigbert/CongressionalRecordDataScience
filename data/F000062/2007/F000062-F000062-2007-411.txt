 Vice Judge Terry Hatter, who at one point was the chief judge, a very good chief judge, has retired. Mr. Gutierrez is one of two judicial emergencies we need to fill. His nomination went through the special commission that we have, which is Republicans and Democrats who screen these judicial nominations. He has served on the Los Angeles County Superior Court. He also served on the municipal court. He is a Los Angeles native. He graduated from Notre Dame and UCLA Law School. I strongly support his nomination.  Madam President, I yield the floor.
