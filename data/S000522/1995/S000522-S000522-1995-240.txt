Mr. Speaker, this week marked the third anniversary of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At this time, in 1992, Serb militants in the hills surrounding Sarajevo began their shelling of the people of the cosmopolitan and culturally rich Bosnian capital.  On the one hand, it seems like this war--with the constant, almost daily reports of the senseless slaughter of innocent people--has been going on forever. On the other hand, when the war began, no one would have imagined that it would get as bad as it subsequently did, or that we would allow it to continue that way for so long.  This week, the Helsinki Commission, of which I am chairman, held two hearings to note Bosnia's 3-year agony. At the first hearing, we heard witnesses explain that this may not even be classified as a war. Yes, there are opposing sides, but, instead of direct, military engagements, most of the violence can be characterized as a heavily armed group of Serb thugs committing genocide against those in Bosnia, and particularly the Moslem population.  Yes, Mr. Speaker, genocide. Our hearing on Tuesday focused on the extent to which ethnic cleansing, the destruction of cultural sites, and associated war crimes and crimes against humanity constitute genocide in Bosnia and other parts of former Yugoslavia. Our witnesses included Cherif Bassiouni, a law professor at DePaul University who chaired the U.N. War Crimes Commission, who discussed the ethnic cleansing that has taken place in the former Yugoslavia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular. Andras Riedlmayer, a bibliographer at Harvard University, followed with a fascinating slide presentation of how the reminders of Bosnian Moslem culture--mosques, libraries, and historic sites--have been targeted for destruction in an attempt to deny the earlier existence of those who were [[Page E867]] ethnically cleansed. Roy Gutman of Newsday and author David Reiff presented us with first-hand accounts of what happened in Bosnia beginning in 1992.  We learned at the hearing that the atrocities appear to follow such a similar pattern, from region to region, that one simply has to conclude that they were carried out systematically. These crimes, as they were being committed, were at least known to, and perhaps ordered by, the Bosnian Serbs and maybe even Serbia's political and military leadership.  A prime example--the eastern Bosnian town of Foca, with its slight Moslem majority, was seized by Serb paramilitaries early in the conflict under the direction of three of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic's close associated, Velibor Ostojic, Vojislav Maksimovic, and Petar Cancar. The sports hall, located right next to the police station, was a rape camp for about 2 months soon thereafter. About 50 women were subjected to multiple and gang rape night after night. An isolated incident, out of the view of Bosnian Serb authorities? Do not count on it.  There is, however, no real smoking gun--like the files left by the Nazis documenting the Holocaust--what has happened. The Bosnian Serb leadership, and their leaders in Belgrade, made sure there was what Professor Bassiouni called ``plausible deniability.'' But, what has happened in Bosnia is genocide, without a doubt. The systematic way the Bosnian genocide has been carried out, and the openness with which concentration and rape camps have operated, leave no question of its orchestrated nature. We also learned that the genocide extended into Croatia. Each victim has a dramatic and tragic account to relate, but the dry statistics--200,000 killed, 800 prison camps with at least 500,000 prisoners, over 50,000 torture victims, 151 mass graves, and over 20,000 rape victims--where sobering in themselves.  As a result of the hearing, the Helsinki Commission will help ensure that all evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity held by the United States Government are made available to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague. We will also seek to increase U.S. financial support for the tribunal and the prosecutor's office, so that justice is not forfeited due to a lack of resources.  Genocide is directed toward people in a collective sense, but the gruesome acts are committed against individuals, moms, dads, sons, and daughters, friends and colleagues. I have tried to imagine daily life for Bosnians, being forced out of their homes, being publicly and repeatedly raped, being tortured in a camp, facing execution in the next second, or--perhaps worst of all--watching these things happen to loved ones. It is hard for us to imagine what has been the reality for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina for these last 3 years. One year before that, people in Croatia faced the same thing.  There is also the question of who is guilty of these crimes, and who is innocent. A recently released CIA report confirmed that Serb militants have been responsible for nearly 90 percent of the atrocities committed during Yugoslavia's violent breakup. There crimes also were most likely to have been orchestrated, in order to carry out a policy directed from above.  This does not translate into the popular notion that the Serbs are an evil people. Indeed, in previous decades, others were infected by the same evil intentions, and innocent Serbs were at times the victims. Similarly, deeds of Serbian political and military leaders, as carried out by their militant minions, do not make Serbs collectively guilty. I made this point at the hearing for two reasons. First, should we engage in the now popular Serb-bashing, we ignore the vulnerability of all peoples in this world to fall into the trap of racist ideology that has ensnared so many Serbs today. Second, Serbs in the former Yugoslavia and around the world, including in the United States, can do no more to defend their national heritage than to face squarely what their militant brethren have done, to condemn them for actions which cannot be justified by history or anything else, and to seek a reconciliation between Serbs and their neighbors in the former Yugoslavia. They should place the guilt squarely on the Serbian leadership, not share the guilt with those leaders.  Indeed, the hearing noted examples of Serbs of conscience. Professor Bassiouni relayed a story of a Bosnian Serb commander who, upon taking a new position, released several women being held captive. As his men approached the women, hoping to have their last chance to rape them, the commander stood in front of the door, with machine gun in hand, and warned his own soldiers he would shoot any who dared touch these women again. Roy Gutman quoted a recent article in Nasa Borba, a Belgrade-based Serbian opposition paper, calling the war a senseless and ``unoriginal product of the unbridled Serb view of things,'' and bemoaned that Serbs ``are obviously still far away from realizing that they have to take certain moral responsibility for evil deeds committed by their compatriots in this war.'' Andras Riedlmayer informed the Commission of a Serbian architect and former Belgrade mayor who condemned the destruction of beautiful cities like Osijek, Vukovar, and Dubrovnik simply because that they were not Serbian.  Mr. Speaker, this hearing on genocide was of critical importance. We on the outside have become fatigued by the daily developments there, and the endless discussion of policy options. It is perhaps human nature that explains why, in the end, we look at Bosnia in terms of percentage of territory lost and casualty figures. Similarly, our desire is to bring those fighting together--at the negotiating table--to work out a mutually acceptable compromise. In the meantime, we work to get a humanitarian aid convoy to this town or that town, or to deploy U.N. peacekeepers here or there, with this or that mandate.  As admirable as these efforts may be, they miss the central fact that what we are confronting here is something inherently evil, a racist force so irrational that it cannot be satisfied by a positive gesture. Genocide must be condemned, confronted and stopped, not tolerated and appeased. Until then, we will continue to see more fighting, more death, and more destruction in the Balkans.  That brings me to the second hearing, which focused on policy questions regarding the former Yugoslavia, and specifically issues surrounding the international presence there. U.N. peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Macedonia, and NATO assistance to U.N. efforts are of utmost importance, but efforts of other organizations merit attention as well.  Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke appeared before the Commission to present the current views of the Clinton administration on these missions and the realistic prospects for a just peace. I told the Ambassador that one thing the Helsinki Commission has learned at its 16 hearings on the former Yugoslavia, since the conflict began there in 1991, is that the conflict could have been stopped. Witness after witness, with experience on the ground, has told the Helsinki Commission that credible military threats continually caused the Serb militants to back off and be more cooperative. Had they faced international resolve, during the Bush or the early Clinton administration, we would not have needed these hearings this week. Opportunities were lost, one after another, as our ultimatums were revealed only as political bluffs.  The Commission does not say this only after the fact, as the Monday morning quarterback. From the beginning, we called for strong action to get humanitarian aid convoys through the lines, no matter what, to stop the bombardment of large, vulnerable civilian centers--to stop the war. We always met opposition. And now, our Government and those of Europe, seem to suggest that damage perpetrated against Bosnia has been so great that the reestablishment of a unified, multiethnic state is, at best, a dream. Even a 51/49 split, as proposed by the contact group, is out of reach. Military options are now riskier. What concerns me is the fact that the same officials who now find it too late to act, had other excuses when it was not too late. One can conclude that at least some of them simply never had the courage to act in the first place, or the foresight to see how American interests were affected by all of this.  To be clear, Mr. Speaker, I do not oppose finding solutions to problems at a negotiating table, but the parties involved should be given no choice but to find solutions at the table, and not from the hills surrounding defenseless Bosnian towns and cities. No parameters for acceptable behavior were established and upheld, and negotiations continue to be a dismal failure.  And what frustrates me most is that governments, and European governments in particular, are unwilling to acknowledge their incredible error, and to change course.  It was with some regret that I had to express these views before Ambassador Holbrooke, who, since becoming Assistant Secretary last August, has shown a personal interest in getting something done in the Balkans. I highlighted, in particular, the seriousness with which he has pursued the development of the Bosnian Federation, which perhaps, along with the Sarajevo ultimatum of February 1994, is the most innovative and positive effort undertaken by the Clinton administration in Bosnia. While I question the viability of the federation absent a real response to Serb aggression, I see no choice but to move forward with the federation as best we can.  Ambassador Holbrooke reported that international efforts leading to a new peacekeeping mandate in Croatia ``have helped prevent, at least for the moment, the wider war we all [[Page E868]] feared.'' He expressed disappointment, however, that diplomacy has been unable to prevent the likely resumption of the tragic conflict in Bosnia. ``I bring you no optimism on Bosnia.'' Following Holbrooke, two expert witnesses--John Lampe of the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, and Steve Walker of the Action Council for Peace in the Balkans--presented views on various policy options. While they disagreed on what to do, they both expressed dismay that a full and fair settlement remains so elusive.                          ____________________
