Professor Jones has been awarded the honor of Commander of the British Empire by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth for services in the promotion of British art in the United States. King George V created the Commander of the British Empire honor in 1917 to reward services to the World War effort by civilians at home and service personnel in support positions. The orders are now awarded in both military and civil divisions for public service or other distinctions.  Originally from Wales, Tony Jones is an internationally-known arts administrator, broadcaster, writer and historian of art design. Professor Jones studied at the University of London and the Newport College of Art, and came to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar. He earned his graduate degree from Tulane University in New Orleans, LA.  Before coming to Chicago, Tony Jones had been Director of the Glasgow School of Art. He created the ``Welsh Chapels'' exhibition of the National Museum of Wales, and is the author of ``Chapel Architecture in the Merthyr Valley'' and ``Welsh Chapels.'' In 1999, his research on the architectural parallels of Glasgow and Chicago was examined in the BBC documentary ``A Tale of Two Cities: Glasgow and Chicago.'' Professor Jones is a recognized authority on the development of art, design and architecture in the Modern Age, especially the work of the architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Celtic Revival movement designer Archibald Knox.  Professor Jones's accomplishments have earned him international recognition. In addition to his positions as Senior Fellow of the Royal College of Arts in London, where he also served as Director, and as Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, he was appointed Honorary Director of Japan's Osaka University of the Arts in 2001 and was conferred the Austrian Cross of Honor for Science and the Arts in 2002. Here in the United States, Professor Jones was elected Honorary Member of the American Institute of Architects and has won the National Council of Arts Administrators Award for Distinguished Service in the Arts. He currently serves as the president of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and as president of the Alliance of Independent Colleges of Art and Design.  Professor Jones was granted the honor of Commander of the British Empire in recognition of his long years of distinguished service to the arts and culture, international education, and the promotion of British arts in the United States. The honor will be awarded by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace later in the Spring.  It is my privilege to congratulate Professor Jones on the occasion of this prestigious award and to acknowledge his extensive contributions to the arts. He is an asset to the arts and education communities in Illinois and across the globe.                          ____________________
