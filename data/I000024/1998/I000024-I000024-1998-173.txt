President, we are going to have to do something and do that something pretty quick. Unfortunately, as the chairman of the Readiness Committee, I recognize the fact that we are going to have to come up with some money right away, in this coming fiscal year budget, in the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill. We are finding that the Defense Department has engaged in policies that have caused us to foolishly use money that should have been used for readiness. So I am standing here saying we are going to have to do--the money can only come from one place. If we are going to try to keep our retention rate or get it back up, if we are going to stop the divorce rate going up, we are going to have to put some money in quality-of-life and force strength, and the only place that can come from is modernization.  As a strong supporter of the F-22, I can only stand on the floor of the Senate and say we are going to have to delay that program unless we are able to come up with some money to put into our budget for the coming fiscal year.  People who are very wise say, well, that is what we depend upon for future readiness, the F-22. Yes, we do, but we have to make a tradeoff for current readiness or future readiness. It has to be current readiness, with the threat that faces us.  I am here to tell you that we are facing a greater threat today than at any time since World War II. We have a reduced force, and we cannot meet that threat. It has to be changed.  I yield back the remainder of my time.                               Exhibit 1                  [From the U.S. News, Jan. 19, 1998]                       Can Peacekeepers Make War?                         (By Richard J. Newman)       In January 1991, eight Apache helicopters from the Army's      101st Air Assault Division were assigned to fire the first      shots of the Persian Gulf war. Flying with their lights out,      50 feet off the desert floor, the Apaches sneaked deep into      western Iraq and destroyed two key radar sites. The dangerous      mission, which largely blinded Saddam Hussein to the      subsequent deluge of attack aircraft, was a complete success.       Seven years later, the 101st is not performing so      gloriously. During a November mock battle at the Army's      National Training Center at Fort Irwin, Calif., the      division's gunners failed to destroy any of the antiaircraft      missiles of the ``opposition force.'' As a result, the OpFor      shot down all the 101st's Apaches when they tried to mount a      deep-strike mission. The OpFor put away half of its      antiaircraft missiles, and the 101st tried again. Once more,      all its helicopters were shot down. Then the OpFor put all      its missiles away--and still shot down six Apaches with tanks      and other guns, losing only four tanks in the process. While      the OpFor was probably a tougher foe than the Iraqi military,      officials familiar with the NTC say the 101st's performance      reflects a general deterioration in the last five years in      the capabilities of units training at Fort Irwin. It's a      ``very sad situation here,'' said one NTC official.       Throughout America's armed forces, there is mounting      evidence that conventional combat skills--and the warrior      ethic that goes with them--are being eroded by a combination      of downsizing, budget cuts, and widespread commitments to      noncombat operations in Bosnia, the Middle East, and      elsewhere. A December report by a Senate Budget Committee      analyst cited ``extremely serious Army-wide personnel and      training (i.e., readiness) problems,'' such as units half      staffed in key positions like infantry and mechanics. With      troop levels being cut to free more money for high-tech      weapons systems, the report predicted, those problems will      get worse.       Soldiers seem to agree: In a 1997 ``leadership      assessment,'' Army officers in 36 percent of a series of      focus groups said their units don't know how to fight; nearly      half of those groups expressed concern about the Army's      growing ``hollow,'' a provocative allusion to the inept, so-     called hollow force of the 1970s.       In the Air Force, ``mission capable'' rates for some      fighter jets, which measure how many planes can be ready for      war on short notice, are more than 15 percentage points lower      than they were in 1989. ``We've got some severe stresses,''      says Gen. Richard Hawley, head of the Air Force's Air      Combat Command. ``There's not enough resilience in the      force.'' Even the Navy and the Marine Corps, which are      better structured to endure long deployments, are      struggling. Downsizing and budget cutting have left some      ships short of parts and crew members and have forced      commanders to increase their estimates of how long it      would take to be ready to fulfill wartime tasks. Last fall      Rear Adm. Daniel Murphy, the Navy's head of surface      warfare, said it may be necessary to pay bonuses to      sailors in the surface fleet--like those paid to aviators      and submariners--to keep experienced sailors in the Navy.       Do gaps in the force matter? The U.S. military can      obviously afford to relax the hair-trigger posture that      became the norm over 40 years in the cold war. U.S. defense      funding is roughly equal to that of the next six spenders      combined. The once-feared Soviet military has dwindled from 4      million troops in 1990 to a Russian force of 1.2 million--     with such problems that it could not defeat a ragtag rebel      force in the tiny province of Chechnya in 1995. Analysts      think it will be at least 15 years before a ``peer      competitor'' such as China or a resurgent Russia could      challenge the United States militarily. No country now poses      a serious threat to American territory.       More with less. But in many ways the American military has      a uniquely demanding job today. Instead of preparing largely      for territorial defense, U.S. troops must safeguard vaguely      defined American and global ``interests'' in an increasing      number of far-flung places. Since 1990, U.S. armed forces      have been utilized in 36 foreign missions, compared with just      22 between 1980 and 1989, according to analysis by the      Congressional Research Service. And there have been fewer      troops and dollars to carry out those missions. Since 1989,      administrations of both parties have cut the armed forces by      one third, and the defense budget by 30 percent, after      inflation. The changes were inevitable, with the demise of      the Soviet threat, but they still affect the military's      ability to meet increasing demands.       The busy pace that results appears to be driving out more      experienced service members than ever. In the Marine Corps,      23 of the 175 captains chosen last year to attend the      prestigious Amphibious Warfare School in Quantico, Va.,      decided instead to leave the Marines; statistics weren't kept      before 1995, but officials say it used to be rare for more      than three or four to drop out. The Army recruited only 70      percent of the infantrymen it needed in the year ending last      September, though Army officials expect that to improve. A      1997 report released by Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the      House National Security Committee, cited Army statistics      showing that 125 infantry squads--equivalent to about five      500-man battalions--are unmanned, keeping units from training      at the appropriate combat strength. And increasingly, Army      and Air Force units put off combat training because they are      too busy with ``low intensity'' missions or need the money      elsewhere.       In the past, military leaders have used readiness      ``scares'' to plead for more money for favored weapons or      other programs. These days, most Pentagon officials      understand that total defense budgets will not rise--and so a      gain for one branch comes out of another's share. But they      also complain that frequent ``low intensity'' missions--such      as peacekeeping, counterdrug operations, humanitarian      efforts, and even joint exercises with new Eastern European      allies--are diluting the war-fighting capability of U.S.      troops by disrupting combat training and breaking down unit      cohesion. Ultimately, that is producing an identity crisis:      Is the American military's purpose still ``fighting and      winning our nation's wars,'' as the Pentagon's national      military strategy states? Or are America's enemies so few      and feeble that U.S. troops can focus less on war and more      on other problems throughout the world?       By its own benchmarks, U.S. military manpower and readiness      are falling short. Since 1993 the government's national      security strategy has called for U.S. troops to be prepared      to fight two regional wars, presumably in Korea and Iraq,      less than 45 days apart. (Before that, the Pentagon planned      for one very large war with the Soviet Union and lesser      conflicts elsewhere, but didn't quantify them.) The      Pentagon's quadrennial defense review, released last May,      said U.S. forces also must be prepared for greater      involvement in ``smaller-scale contingencies,''     such as peacekeeping in Bosnia and the ongoing enforcement of      the Iraqi no-fly zones--even though at the same time the      Pentagon cut the military by 62,000 troops.       That reduction was part of a deliberate trade-off to pay      for new weapons, such as the joint strike fighter and the F-     22 aircraft, a new carrier, and tank upgrades. Many analysts      agree on the need to modernize some fighting platforms that      are 15 to 20 years old. Yet to some officials, the Pentagon's      reliance on the offerings of defense contractors borders on a      dysfunctional dependency. ``We can beat the Chinese or the      Russians, but we can't beat Lockheed Martin or Ingalls      Shipbuilding,'' says Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters, an      intelligence analyst who has written widely on strategic      planning. ``We're spending so much money on aircraft and      ships that we'll paralyze the future force.'' Bases that are      no longer needed to support a smaller force also suck up      cash. The Pentagon wants to close some of them but has met      resistance from Congress.       Such trade-offs make it harder to meet demands on the      military today. A classified Pentagon memo written after a      Joint Staff war game last spring said the game ``made it      obvious that we cannot sustain current levels of overseas      presence,'' citing negative effects on ``maintenance,      personnel, and training readiness.'' Frederick Kagan, a      history professor at West Point, says downsizing alone would      make it difficult for the United States to fight even one      regional war today. The Army, he says, has only six heavy      divisions--too few to field the six division equivalents that      fought in the Persian Gulf war while still leaving one      division in South Korea to deter an invasion from the north.      John Correll, editor of Air Force magazine, points out that      the Pentagon said it would take 24 fighter wings to win two      wars when it first scripted that scenario in 1993. The Air      Force has since been cut to 20 fighter wings, but the      Pentagon says this is still enough.       Perhaps most significant is that the declining emphasis on      war fighting is not being managed--it is just happening      haphazardly as units cut whatever corners on training time      and war-fighting preparations they can in order to fulfill      assigned missions or meet their budgets. In the Persian Gulf      region, for instance, there are usually anywhere from 100 to      300 aircraft enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq.      Pilots of F-15, F-16, and A-10 jets typically fly four-hour      patrols that consist mainly of ``left-hand turns.'' The      flights are so routine and uneventful that pilots pass the      time asking each other movie-trivia questions over their      radios. During 45- to 90-day tours in the desert, pilots      spend so little time practicing combat maneuvers that when      they return home, it takes two to three months of training      before they are considered fully ready for war again. A 1997      Rand study even suggests that repetitive air patrols may      amount to ``negative training,'' desensitizing crews to      dangers and degrading their situational awareness.       Synergy. Those problems on their own may be manageable. But      shortfalls in training, readiness, and manpower often feed on      one another, multiplying the impact of each. For the 69th      Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia--which      soon will leave for a 60-day rotation enforcing the Iraqi no-     fly zone--a shortage of spare parts means ground crews must      regularly ``cannibalize'' jets, taking parts from one to make      another fly. That is not a new practice. But the wing's      recent cannibalization rate, which measures parts taken from      jets versus missions flown, has topped 25 percent, three      times higher than its 8 percent goal. Overall, the wing's      goal is a mission-capable rate of 80 to 84 percent; but rates      have been below 70 percent for over a year. The mission-     capable rate for all F-16s belonging to Air Combat Command is      77 percent, down from 90 percent in 1989; for F-15 air-to-air      fighters the rate has fallen from 85 percent to 77 percent.       With a smaller military, troops are being sent more      frequently on drawn-out missions such as those in Bosnia--     which President Clinton last month declared to be an open-     ended commitment--and the Persian Gulf, where the U.S.      commitment is 7 years old and growing. Increasingly long      deployments away from home and aggressive hiring by growing      commercial airlines are driving many pilots out of the Air      Force once they have fulfilled their seven-year commitment.      In the A-10 squadron at Moody, six out of the nine pilots      eligible to leave this year decided to do so--despite      increased bonuses of up to $22,000 for staying in. Throughout      the Air Force, retention rates for pilots fell to an      estimated 75 percent in 1997, down 12 points from 1995      levels. The Air Force has had other pilot crunches--in the      early 1980s, for example, when airlines were aggressively      luring away fliers--but the problem then was not exacerbated      by budget cuts and increased missions, as it is now.       The Air Force is compensating by running more people      through flight school--but with junior pilots replacing      senior ones, there could soon be a sharp drop in overall      experience levels. Mechanics and other key personnel are also      affected. One C-130 pilot says: ``We're getting a lot of      [mechanics] with no C-130 experience. They ask, `How do you      turn this thing on?' If he's asking how to turn it on and      it's his job to fix the system, there's obviously a      problem.'' Many pilots fear that such shortages could lead to      more accidents.       The Army faces similar strains. After one infantry unit      returned from a peacekeeping mission in Macedonia in 1994--     where it went without its Bradley fighting vehicles--it      received the lowest score in its division on tests of its      ability to shoot and operate its Bradleys. A Rand study to be      released within the next month found that Army troops sent      frequently on peace operations, such as military police and      certain transportation units, are underprepared for their      wartime tasks.       As the service most dependent on people, the Army is      particularly vulnerable to ripple effects that begin with      personnel shortfalls. A lack of infantrymen, mechanics, and      mid-grade officers forces the Army to stitch units together      in order to field the appropriate force for missions in      places such as Bosnia. That in turn breaks up units,      undermining the cohesion needed for infantry, tanks,      artillery, and aviation to fight as ``combined arms''--a      level of performance critical to success in modern combat.       The 1st Armored Division in Germany epitomizes the problem.      It has two staffs--one in Germany, one in Bosnia--and troops      in at least three different regions. ``The logic of      maintaining readiness is thrown astray by this piecemeal      discombobulation,'' says an Army general. The Joint Chiefs of      Staff have begun to study what would happen if units doing      peace operations were suddenly needed in a war--or two wars.      Early findings: Moving troops out of one place and into a war      zone would ``put a strain on an already fragile      transportation system,'' according to one classified Pentagon      document. Another cites ``many more risks''--including the      potential loss of equipment in a hasty withdrawal and the two      to six months it would take to retrain units for war.       Above all, some fear that soldiers are not learning the      basic lessons needed to succeed in war. Units going through      the National Training Center or the Joint Readiness Training      Center in Louisiana are barely more than half staffed, says      retired Marine Corps Gen. John Sheehan. That, the Senate      Budget Committee report noted, violates the Army's doctrine      to ``train just as you go to war.''       ``We're raising a generation of young leaders who are not      learning to run large organizations,'' says Sheehan. ``They      won't know how to command their troops even if they get them      all in a war.'' More important may be the messages sent by      top commanders. ``We have no leaders talking to us about how      important it is to prepare your soldiers for battle so they      don't die in combat,'' says an Army major. ``It's      disheartening to many of us.'' That may also be causing      deeper problems not easily fixed by more funding, higher-tech      weapons, or better training. ``The brass are refusing to      stand up for the warrior spirit,'' says John Hillen, a      Persian Gulf war veteran and fellow at the Council on Foreign      Relations. Recent imbroglios over the proper role of women in      the military have added to the distractions.       Hanging touch. Top Pentagon leaders insist the military is      not going soft. In an interview last week, Gen. Henry      Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dismissed      comparisons between the demoralized force of the 1970s and      today's. ``There is a world of difference between where we      were then and where we are now,'' he said. ``We have a      tremendously talented bunch of young men and women.'' Nor      does Shelton believe that anecdotal reports of problems, on      their own, indicate a readiness shortfall. He and others say      that the Pentagon's carefully monitored readiness statistics      do not indicate serious degradations in the force.       But those figures--which measure how long it would take a      unit to be ready for war--are somewhat subjective, based on      commanders' own estimates of how well their troops are      trained. Some doubt their validity. ``The readiness rates are      false,'' one Army colonel flatly states. ``There is a lot of      pressure from higher-ups to inflate them. It's like all the      students are getting A's, then flunking the final exam.''      Shelton does acknowledge some readiness ``issues,''      particularly problems with highly skilled troops leaving the      service. Some senior and retired leaders who served during      the 1970s think those are ominous signs. They say that      readiness tends to slip gradually at first--but at a point      begins to drop precipitously, and then becomes very hard to      reverse.       The Pentagon has protected some of its key units from      cutbacks and other distractions. The 2nd Infantry Division in      South Korea, for example, which could absorb the brunt of a      North Korean invasion with less than three days' notice, is      staffed at over 100 percent, including some      ``augmentees'' from the South Korean Army. Commanders are      so focused on war they are almost scornful of any other      type of mission. ``We don't face the same problems      stateside units do,'' says Lt. Col. Robert Sweeney, former      commander of the 4th Squadron, 7th Cavalry Regiment. ``My      focus is clear. I'm not going to be doing humanitarian      operations.'' Even though assignments to Korea are      considered a ``hardship tour''--an entire year's      deployment, with no family allowed for most troops--     commanders say a clear focus, and a ready enemy, make it      easy to sustain morale.       JSTARS, where are you? But even there the tip of the spear      may be getting duller, U.S. military planners in South Korea      say budget constraints and competing demands elsewhere keep      them from getting enough access to ``special mission'' assets      such as Joint STARS surveillance aircraft, F-117 stealth      fighters, and F-15E strike jets. ``We're being told to be      more efficient,'' says an intelligence staffer in Seoul.      ``But efficiency doesn't cut it in war. Redundancy does.''      Some analysts think new technology may greatly reduce the      numbers of ground troops and conventional platforms needed in     a war. But relying on new systems before they are battle      tested leaves troops feeling they have less margin for error.       Shortfalls appear to be more serious in the Persian Gulf,      where a rematch with Iraq would probably come with more      advance warning--but still be bloody. A radar operator who      has worked at an airfield in Kuwait says there are no longer      any backups for the facility's radar, the only ground-based      system available for tracking nearby aircraft, including      enemy planes. ``We're a forward operating unit and we still      don't get what we need,'' he says. ``When that baby goes down      and you realize there's no backup, you start saying, `Where      is the priority?' ''       Troops' morale, an intangible but essential ingredient of      success in combat, can weather temporary problems. But      persistent shortages and seemingly never-ending commitments      take a toll. ``Troops don't understand why, if what they do      is so important, they don't give us the tools to do it,''      says Lt. Col. Michael Snodgrass, commander of the 69th      Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base. Enthusiasm suffers      first. Before Desert Storm, says Col. Billy Diehl, acting      commander of Moody's 347th Wing, the Air Force's annual Red      Flag aerial combat exercise ``was the highlight of the      year.'' But in 1996, when he arrived at Moody, ``everybody      was thrilled that it was canceled.''       A more important casualty is confidence. A C-130 pilot says      that due to training cutbacks, ``My own skills are nowhere      near where they were. Some of the new guys, I'm deathly      afraid to go to war with them. They just don't have the      training.'' John Stillion, a former Air Force navigator and      Rand analyst, says that on a recent visit to an Air Force      base, morale was ``far worse than I've ever seen it. I'm      amazed at how bitter they sounded.''       Surprisingly, few in the military--which studies show is      overwhelmingly conservative today--feel the solution is to      withdraw from its peacekeeping missions in the world's      trouble spots. One typical Army colonel strongly objects to      the political gamesmanship of setting unrealistic deadlines      for troop adjustments in places such as Bosnia. But      nonetheless, he believes U.S. troops should be there: ``It is      appropriate use of the military, mainly because nobody else      can do it.''       Some practical steps could help strike a better balance      between preparing for war and preserving peace. Many in the      Army would like to see the National Guard shoulder more of      the burden for peacekeeping, Rand researchers and others      argue that a more modular structure would make the Army much      more flexible. Ideas include self-supporting combat groups of      about 5,000 troops--one third the size of a division--or      discrete support units that can each carry out a variety of      functions, instead of specializing in transportation or      engineering. Some in the Air Force are pushing a ``cop on the      beat'' approach, enforcing no-fly zones with random patrols,      augmented by sensors that detect air and ground movements.       But what America's troops crave most is a clear message      from their leaders stating the purpose of U.S. forces. Are      they warriors, whose main job is to fight and win wars? Or      police assigned to prop up struggling nations and keep the      world safe for American commerce? If U.S. forces must fulfill      both roles, how can they do each well? Many members of the      military believe that before those questions can be answered,      there needs to be greater awareness of what U.S. troops      accomplish by being everywhere they are--and what risks are      involved in spreading them ever thinner. ``We need a better      understanding among the American public that we have      interests outside the United States,'' says Lt. Gen. Joseph      Hurd, commander of the 7th Air Force in South Korea. Once      those interests are sorted out, it wouldn't hurt to inform      the troops in the ranks, either.
