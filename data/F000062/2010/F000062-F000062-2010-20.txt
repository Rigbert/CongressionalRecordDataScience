 President, I rise to introduce a bill to raise the cap on rail liability in cases of gross negligence. This bill was originally introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Elton Gallegly of the 24th District of California, and I thank him for all of his hard work on it.  When Congress passed the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act in 1997, it included a small provision imposing a strict cap on liability in railroad crashes. The cap is now contained in 49 U.S.C. Sec.  28103 and states that the ``aggregate allowable awards to all rail passengers, against all defendants, for all claims, including claims for punitive damages, arising from a single accident or incident, shall not exceed $200,000,000.''  What this means is that regardless of the circumstances no matter how many people are killed or injured in a train crash, and no matter what caused the crash total liability for all of the passengers hurt or killed in the crash cannot exceed $200 million.  The problem is that when a real catastrophe occurs, this number is just not sufficient and there is no way around it.  Let me tell you what happened 2 years ago in California.  On September 12, 2008, a commuter train in Chatsworth, California carrying more than 200 people crashed head-on into a freight train.  The carnage from this crash was unspeakable. Twenty-five people were killed. Their bodies, many torn to pieces, had to be extracted from heaps of steel and wreckage.  Another 101 people were injured. Volunteers and rescue crews worked that day to help pull them from the wreckage. Emergency response agencies transported over 100 people to hospitals. Their injuries ranged from blood in the brain and collapsed lungs to bone fractures, gashes, and scratches.  For some people, the crash was a horrible, harrowing experience, but they have been able to return to the lives they had before.  For others, the families of the 25 people who died and for those who suffered the most serious of injuries, life will never be the same.  According to the final report of the National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, no unexpected equipment malfunction or weather problem was responsible for this crash.  The National Transportation Safety Board report states: ``the probable cause of the September 12, 2008, collision was the failure of the Metrolink engineer to observe and appropriately respond to the red signal because he was engaged in text messaging that distracted him from his duties.''  The NTSB found, in other words, that the engineer wasn't paying attention, and he sailed through a red signal, crashing head-on into the freight train. In fact, the report finds that he was so busy texting that he never even hit the brakes.  According to the report, on the day of the crash, the engineer sent 21 text messages, received 20 text messages, and made four outgoing telephone calls while he was driving the train.  NTSB wrote,       the investigation further revealed that this amount of      activity was not unusual for this engineer. Wireless records      for the 7 days preceding the accident showed that on each      workday, the engineer had sent or received text messages or      made voice calls during the time he was responsible for      operating a train. Two days before the accident, he sent or      received about 125 messages during the time he was      responsible for operating a train. He had also made phone      calls during these periods.  Astoundingly, the NTSB found that ``the content of all of the engineer's text messages over the previous 7 days, including those during and outside the times the engineer was responsible for operating a train, indicated that the engineer and, a teenage boy, had been coordinating to allow, the teenage boy, to operate, Metrolink, train 111 on the evening of the accident.''  Although texting while driving the train was clearly prohibited under the operating rules of Veolia Transportation, who employed and oversaw the engineer under contract with Metrolink, this engineer had been violating these ruled habitually and had not been stopped.  The conductor who worked with the engineer on Metrolink train 111 observed him using his cell phone while driving the train a month before the accident. According to NTSB, ``He said he spoke to the engineer about it and he later brought the incident to the attention of a supervisor.'' But the behavior obviously continued.  Bottom line: The report says the engineer wasn't paying attention to the passengers' safety, he was sending text messages on his cell phone, and no one else took action to stop this dangerous behavior. As a result, 25 people died.  This is unbelievable. And it is unacceptable.  Since the Chatsworth Crash, I have worked to improve rail safety. In October 2008, Congress passed and the President signed the ``Rail Safety Improvement Act,'' which included a key provision that I strongly pushed requiringmandatory collision-avoidance systems on America's major passenger, commuter, and freight lines.  But this $200 million liability cap remains in place.  That means that under current law, the train operator, Metrolink, and the company that hired and oversaw the engineer, Veolia, believe they only have to pay $200 million total to all of the victims of the Chatsworth crash and their families.  It doesn't matter how tragic the families' losses were. Or how high the survivors' medical bills are. Or how much has been lost in their ability to work and care for their families. The cap is $200 million total, regardless of the circumstances.  This is terrible public policy, should never have been adopted, and needs to be changed.  In a large crash involving hundreds of people and very serious injuries, a court needs to be able to award the damages that it finds are necessary to care for the victims and their families--to pay their medical bills and to compensate for wages they will never again be able to earn.  The bill I am introducing is straightforward. It would raise the liability cap in any case where a court finds gross negligence or willful misconduct to $500 million. And it would do so retroactively to ensure that those who were injured or whose family members were killed are not unfairly deprived of the benefits of what was really the right policy in the first place.  I understand that the rail industry believes that the cap on damages keeps their insurance costs and risk exposure down, and I appreciate all the feedback that has been provided by California's passenger rail systems.  I look forward to working with them to make sure this legislation will not have any unintended consequences. I do not expect this bill to be considered and enacted this week. Facing that reality, I will work with the interested parties, including California High Speed Rail Authority and CalTrain, to further refine this legislation. There will be an opportunity to introduce an improved product as a ``first day bill'' in the next Congress.  But I believe we must do everything we can first to improve safety on our rail lines and second to ensure that when the very worst occurs and people are injured or lose their lives in these accidents, they and their families are fairly compensated.  I urge my colleagues to work with me to amend this law and raise the cap in cases of gross negligence.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3982       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
