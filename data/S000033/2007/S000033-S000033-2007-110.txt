 If we are a nation of equal justice under the law, then low-income people must have legal representation. Legal aid does a phenomenally good job. In Vermont, the wage scale for legal aid workers is embarrassingly low. Any young person who graduates law school with the kind of debt we are talking about would find it almost impossible to work at a legal aid salary. We should be supportive of legal aid. I strongly support the Senator's amendment, and I thank him for offering it.
