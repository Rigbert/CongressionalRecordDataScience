Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to particularly thank a number of Members. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton). Without his dedicated effort, we would not have this bill through the fast track that we have it today, and his support means quite a bit. I also want to thank my friends on the other side of the aisle. I look at the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), my ranking member on the subcommittee; the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) who is on the floor, the ranking member of the full committee. This is a bipartisan effort.  I would remind my colleagues that last year this legislation passed 391-22. Out of our committee this last week, it passed 46-2. That is true bipartisan spirit and we are delighted that it is up on the floor as early as it is. A little bit more than a year ago, I introduced similar legislation that had all five FCC commissioners, Republican and Democrat, on board. Each of them had lamented in a very public way that the current level of fines was way too low, and with that we moved the legislation that we introduced a couple of weeks ago. We passed it, as I said, 391-22. The Senate passed similar legislation last year, 99-1. I would note that that one that voted against it wanted the bill to be tougher. In essence, unanimous support.  Currently, fines for indecency often go uncollected because the cost for the Department of Justice to collect the fines is often greater than the fines themselves. This is no longer going to be the case under H.R. 310. The current cap for fines is $32,500. To put that into perspective, a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl just a couple of weeks ago cost $80,000 a second, $2.4 million for 30 seconds.  What we are talking about today is about the public airwaves which are, of course, owned by the U.S. taxpayer. Using the public airwaves comes with the responsibility to follow the FCC decency standards that apply to programming that airs during the family hours from 6 in the morning until 10 at night, the likeliest time that kids might be tuned in.  When broadcasters sign on the dotted line to receive their licenses, they agree to follow those decency standards, and I would note that the courts, including the highest in the land, ruled in support of that standard. There has to be a level of expectation when a parent turns on the TV or the radio between those family hours that the content will be suitable for children. A parent should not have to think twice about the content on public airwaves. Unfortunately, the situation is far from reality.  I would note very strongly that we do not change the standard in this legislation. We raise the fines. I have asked for the FCC to look for the transcripts of what they have fined. I am not going to put this in the Record under unanimous consent or any other, but I will tell any Member that is here or watching on the floor, if you want to see what the FCC has fined, I have got the transcript here and it is awful, it is vulgar, it has no place on the public airwaves, and I would defy anyone to come over and look at the reading of these transcripts and say that should not be banned. It should be. And broadcasters who violate the standard ought to be fined and it ought to be more than a slap on the wrist, and that is exactly what this legislation does.  By significantly increasing the fines for indecency, the fines will be at a level where they no longer are going to be ignored and parents across the country can rest easy. With the passage of this legislation I am confident that broadcasters will think twice and, by the way, the talent themselves as well, the disk jockeys or anybody else, will think twice about pushing that envelope because they are going to be liable as well, and ultimately our kids are going to be better off for it.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 310, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005. At the outset, I want to thank Chairman Barton, Ranking Member Dingell, and Mr. Markey for their tremendous bipartisan cooperation on this bill. I also want to thank those Members of the House who have cosponsored the bill.  I would tell my colleagues that H.R. 310 mirrors the bill which, last year, the House passed by a vote of 391-22.  For the record, we introduced this bill last year weeks before the infamous Super Bowl halftime show featuring Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake. I was motivated to introduce this bill in large part because I read the transcripts of those broadcasts which the FCC found to contain indecent content. When I read some of those transcripts, I was absolutely sickened and shocked by the filth which had passed over the public's airwaves. Today, I have with me every broadcast indecency Notice of Apparent Liability and Forfeiture Order issued by the FCC since 2000. Each order contains a transcript of the offending content. If any Member is uncertain about the merit of what we are doing here today, I would urge them to read these transcripts. I am confident that you will be as sickened as I am.  This legislation would significantly enhance the Federal Communications Commission's broadcast decency enforcement authority. As stewards of the public's airwaves, radio and television broadcasters have an obligation to abide by the decency laws which have been on the books for decades and have been upheld in the courts. Most of our local broadcasters act responsibly, but there are still too many who continue to push the envelope of indecency during the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., when children are most likely to be in the audience. I would note that some broadcasters have taken to heart the seriousness of this debate and, on their own, have adopted internal policies to better control what goes over the public's airwaves over which they have stewardship. Clear Channel's ``zero tolerance'' policy as part of its ``Responsible Broadcast Initiative'' is one such example of this good corporate citizenship.  But for those broadcasters who continue to act irresponsibly, the FCC needs adequate authority to enforce the law, and this bill would deliver that.  Currently, the maximum fine which the FCC can impose for violations of the decency laws is $32,500 per violation, which, to some broadcasters, is merely the ``cost of doing business'' and, as such, is hardly a deterrent. H.R. 310 would increase the maximum fine to $500,000 per violation.  In addition, under current law, the FCC may hold a license revocation hearing for any broadcaster who is found liable for an indecency violation. However, the FCC has never held such a license revocation hearing. H.R. 310, among other things, would require the FCC to hold a license revocation hearing for any broadcaster who has been found liable for three indecency violations; this is the so-called ``three strikes'' provision. Importantly, in order for a ``strike'' to count toward the three strikes triggering a license revocation hearing under the bill, each finding of liability must have gone through an exhaustive legal process--all the way to final judgment. This is an important element to protect broadcasters' legitimate due process rights. Also, it is important to note that this provision does not require the FCC to revoke the license of a broadcaster after the third strike, it merely requires a hearing to consider the matter with no prejudice toward the outcome of such hearing. Of course, under current law, the FCC can hold a license revocation hearing after the first strike, second strike, or third strike, so all this provision does is require, at a minimum, that such a hearing is held after the third strike.  Other provisions in the bill would:  Ensure that the FCC, when setting penalties, takes into consideration the degree of culpability of the violator, whether the violator is a company or individual, and if it is a company, the size of the company and market served.  Permit the FCC to fine an individual on the first indecency offense.  Require the FCC to complete action on indecency complaints within 180 days.  Force the FCC to take indecency violations into account during license application, renewal and modifications, and  Compel the FCC to report to Congress annually regarding the agency's broadcast decency enforcement activities.  This bill significantly strengthens the FCC's enforcement authority, but does not change the underlying broadcast indecency standard which has withstood judicial scrutiny throughout the decades. Later in this debate, I, along with my colleague Ed Markey, will be offering a bipartisan manager's amendment, which makes some non-controversial changes to the bill, in large part clarifying our intent in a number of areas. But for now, I will simply close by urging my colleagues to support the bill and the manager's amendment which will be offered to it.  Mr. Speaker, I include for printing in the Congressional Record the statement of administration policy from the administration in support of this legislation.         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2005.                   Statement of Administration Policy  h.r. 310--broadcast decency enforcement act of 2005 (rep. upton (r)                       michigan and 56 cosponsors)       The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.      310. This will make broadcast television and radio more      suitable for family viewing by giving the Federal      Communications Commission (FCC) the authority to impose      stiffer penalties on broadcasters that air obscene or      indecent material over the public airwaves. In particular,      the Administration applauds the inclusion in the bill of its      proposal to require that the FCC consider whether      inappropriate material has been aired during children's      television programming in determining the fine to be imposed      for violations of the law. The Administration looks forward      to continuing to work with the Congress to make appropriate      adjustments to the language of the bill as it moves through      the legislative process.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
