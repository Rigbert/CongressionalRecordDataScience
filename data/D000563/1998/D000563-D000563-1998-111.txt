President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for making this unanimous consent request. I would like to ask him a question.  Many people who are watching this debate are not quite sure it is on the square. Is it possible that incumbent Senators now standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate really want to change the system that brought them to this body? I think there is a healthy degree of skepticism by people who are watching this debate wondering how they could want to change the system that brought them to their political position in life, brought them to the U.S. Senate.  Can the Senator from South Dakota tell us how close we are to enacting meaningful reform, whether it is the legislation by Senator Feingold, by Senator McCain, or by the Shays-Meehan bill from the House? How close are we to that moment where we could call a vote and actually produce a bill that would change the system dramatically? Is this a pipe dream? Is this a theory? Is this a political stunt, or is this a reality, a real possibility on the legislative side?
