Chairman, while there may be instances in which greater coordination would be helpful in ensuring our ocean and coastal resources are available to future generations, any such coordination must be done carefully to protect against Federal overreach.                              {time}  2030  As we have seen recently with the proposed rule to redefine waters of the United States, strong congressional oversight is needed to ensure that we protect private property rights.  Unfortunately, the way the administration developed its National OceanPolicy, it increases the opportunities for overreach. The implementation plan is so broad and so sweeping, that it may allow the Federal Government to effect agricultural practices, mining, energy producers, fishermen, and anyone else whose actions may have an impact on the oceans.  The fact is the administration did not work with Congress to develop this plan and has even refused to provide relevant information to Congress, so we can't be sure how sweeping it actually will be. That is why I support the language in the underlying bill and, therefore, oppose the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
