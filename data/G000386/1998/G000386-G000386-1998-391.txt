 President, I rise today to submit a concurrent resolution to open the European market to U.S. beef exports. Last month, the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization affirmed the earlier findings of the WTO that Europe's ban on U.S. beef violates commitments made under the Uruguay Round Agreement. The decision should clear the way for U.S. beef producers to sell their product to Europe.  This concurrent resolution requests the European Union to open its market immediately, in light of the WTO's decision, and directs the U.S. Trade Representative to take action if the EU fails to do so.  This dispute goes back to 1989 when the EU banned all imports of meat from animals treated with growth hormones. About 90% of U.S. cattle is treated with hormones. They have been found to be safe by every country that has studied them. In fact, twice the EU commissioned its own scientists to study the hormones and found them to be safe.  Mr. President, to put these growth hormones in perspective: A person would have to eat 169 pounds of beef from an animal treated with a growth hormone in order to consume the equal amount of that hormone present in one, single egg. They are completely safe for human consumption.  Yet, nine years ago, the EU decided to ban this meat from coming into its market. At that time, there was little we could do to counter the ban. We negotiated with the EU and even imposed sanctions, but nothing has worked.  Then came the Uruguay Round Agreement. For the first time, members of the GATT agreed to eliminate trade barriers not founded on a sound, scientific basis. In other words, trade decisions would be made on sound science, not political science. Clearly, the beef ban was not based on sound science.  In 1996, the U.S. requested a WTO panel  to  determine  whether  the  EU had breached the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement of the Uruguay Round. In August of last year, the panel found in favor of the U.S. position and the decision was affirmed in January. So the WTO has decided that the European's ban on U.S. beef violates the S/PS Agreement and must be removed immediately.  Mr. President, you would think that would be the final word on this issue. But the trade press is reporting that the Europeans are looking for ways around the decision. They want to study the issue a little longer. Even though the ban has already been in place for nine years.  It seems to me that they have had enough time. Our farmers have suffered the effects of this ban for too long. When the ban was put in place in 1989, we were sending $100 million of beef annually to Europe. If the ban was lifted, it is estimated that beef exports would total about $250 million per year. American beef producers literally have lost hundreds of millions of dollars due to this unjustified ban.  This concurrent resolution says to the Europeans, open your markets. You would had your day in court, now it is time to abide by the judge's decision.  If the WTO is to have long-standing legitimacy as an objective arbiter of international trade disputes, its decisions must be respected and complied with. We expect the Europeans to respect this decision, just as the United States has complied with the decision in the Kodak-Fuji case that went against us. We do not have to like the decision. But we have to respect the dispute resolution process.  The concurrent resolution also states if the Europeans do not immediately comply with the decision and open its markets, the U.S. Trade Representative should take action. I leave it up to the able USTR to decide what action is appropriate. But we cannot stand by and allow this decision to be ignored.  Mr. President, enough is enough. The private sector and several government agencies have spent significant time and money attempting to resolve this dispute. And they have been proven to be correct. The European beef ban is simply a trade barrier, disguised as a health concern. No scientific evidence exists to justify it. And the WTO has said so. Now is the time for the EU to end the ban and allow American farmers and ranchers a fair chance to compete in the European market.                          ____________________
