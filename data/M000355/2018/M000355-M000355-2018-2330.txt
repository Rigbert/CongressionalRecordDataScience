 President, yesterday a very distinguished Senator announced his intention to retire at the end of this Congress. For more than 40 years, Senator Orrin Hatch has served the people of Utah in this body. He is not only our President pro tempore, but, as we celebrated last year, Senator Hatch is also the longest serving Republican Senator in the history of the United States.  During this historic tenure, Senator Hatch has chaired three key committees. He has amassed deep expertise across all manner of policy issues, and he has built a truly remarkable resume of accomplishments on behalf of the American people.  Senator Hatch has defended our national security and our religious freedom. He has fought to protect Americans with disabilities and to shepherd fine judges onto our courts. Just last month, as Senate Finance Committee chairman, he played an integral role in passing the most significant tax reform law in more than 30 years.  Senator Hatch's colleagues here will be sorry to see him retire. I will miss his friendship, but I know his wife Elaine and his beloved family will be glad to welcome him home.  Fortunately, it is not yet time to say farewell. This institution and the American people will benefit greatly from the Senator's wisdom and famous work ethic for one more year before his retirement.                          ____________________
