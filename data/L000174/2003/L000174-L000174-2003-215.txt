Lawyers tend to be paid by the hour. They are well paid. But lawyers usually hope they get a portion of the proceedings to take on either the governmental or culprit defendants. They have to do so on a case-by-case individual basis. Sometimes that is what cheaters count on. That is how the cheaters get by on their schemes. If you cheat thousands of people just a little bit, you still cheat; if you only cheat them by $3 or $4, nobody will sue them. But if you are cheating a million people of $3 or $4 each, it adds up.  Class actions allow the little guys to band together and get a competent lawyer and address wrongdoing. The best class action made it possible for individual tobacco victims to take on the powerful tobacco conglomerates in ways individuals could not. It allows stockholders and small investors to join together and go after investment scams.  Another example of a class action litigation serving the public interest is the Firestone tire debacle. The national tire recall was started in part by the disclosure of internal corporate documents on consumer complaints of tire defects and design errors that were discovered in the litigation against Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. Then the plaintiff's attorneys turned this information over to the National Highway Safety Administration. That started a Government investigation.  Months later, because some people had banded together, Bridgestone/Firestone finally did what they should have done right from the beginning: They recalled 6.5 million tires--but not until after there were 101 fatalities, 400 injuries, and 2,026 consumer complaints.  As reported by Time magazine at the time, it is doubtful that the internal corporate consumer complaint information would have ever seen the light of day absent the civil rights justice discovery process.  The bill before the Senate creates unique risks and obstacles to plaintiffs that are not in the current system. A particularly troubling aspect of S. 1751 is it allows the removal of a case at any time. Anybody who has ever practiced law, anybody who has ever litigated cases--and I, as many other Senators, have--knows the possibilities for abusing this provision are obvious.  As more than 100 legal experts, law professors, noted in a letter to the distinguished Republican leader and the distinguished Democratic leader, Senators Frist and Daschle, they said:       This would give a defendant the power to yank a case away      from a state-court judge who has properly issued pretrial      rulings the defendant does not like, and would encourage a      level of forum-shopping never before seen in this country.      Moreover, this provision would allow an unscrupulous      defendant, anxious to put off the day of judgment so that      more assets could be hidden, to remove a case on the eve of a      state-court trial, resulting in automatic delay of months or      even years before the case would be tried in Federal courts.  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of the 100 law professors be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     June 3, 2003.     Hon. William Frist,     Majority Leader, Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Tom Daschle,     Minority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Frist and Daschle: We are professors of      constitutional law, civil procedure, and other subjects, at      law schools across the nation. We are writing this letter      because of grave concerns over the so-called ``Class Action      Fairness Act'' (S. 274) and its House counterpart (H.R.      1115), specifically the effect these bills would have on the      administration of justice in the United States and on the      ability of American consumers, small businesses, and others      to obtain relief for injuries done to them. We also have      serious questions about the constitutionality of the Act. We      urge the Senate to reject this legislation.             practical effect of enacting the bill into law       As approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, S. 274 would      result in transferring to the federal courts jurisdiction      over most class actions filed in state courts, under state      law. The Federal courts do not have the resources to      administer justice to both their present dockets and the      large number of complex state-court cases that would be added      if S. 274 or its House counterpart were to become law.      Passage of the bill would lead to significant delays in all      the business of the federal courts, harming the ability of      the federal courts to decide cases that only they can decide,      or in which there is a strong federal interest. enactment of the bill would harm the ability of plaintiffs to obtain                                 justice       We believe that several specific provisions in the bill      would be very unwise. The federal courts have responded to      claims of abuse in class-action procedures by studying the      claims, inviting comments from bar associations, attorneys      and others, carefully considering the comments, proposing      draft rules, receiving comments on the drafts, and fine-     tuning their proposals. If a reform is inadequate to meet the      need, they can propose refinements. A substantial set of      changes to Rule 23, the class action rule, are expected to go      into effect on December 1, 2003, in the event that Congress      does not direct otherwise. All of these changes were made      pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, the process Congress      created to try to keep politics out of the process of setting      rules for the judiciary. Sec. 3 of S. 274 would override some      of these changes, and elminate the ability of the Advisory      Committee on the Civil Rules to deal with others. If it is      enacted in its present form, the rulemaking process would      become politicized, and lobbyists' demands would replace      the careful consideration now given to these matters. In      the event that Congress deems it necessary to legislate as      to areas traditionally covered by court rules, we urge      that the legislation be as limited as possible, that this      part of the legislation be in the form of rules rather      than freestanding statutes, and that the legislation      expressly preserve the ability of the Advisory Committee      on the Federal Rules, the U.S. Judicial Conference, and      the Supreme Court to amend the new rules or procedures to      the extent necessary to accomplish their purposes more      effectively or to cure any unanticipated problems.      Congress would, as always, have the final say under the      Rules Enabling Act.       The administration of justice would also be harmed by      removing much of the ability of state courts to construe      their own laws. Many important questions are most likely to      arise when the stakes make it worthwhile to litigate them,      i.e., in class actions or other large cases. When the case is      removed to federal court, the federal court cannot give a      definitive interpretation of state law, but can only predict      what the state supreme court would find state law to be, if      the state supreme court had the same case. If there are other      cases from other parts of the country against the same      defendant, even without any overlapping classes, the Judicial      Panel on Multidistrict Litigation may assign the case--and      the task of interpreting state law--to a federal court      thousands of miles away. Not every state has adopted      procedures allowing a federal court to certify state-law      questions so there may be no practical means by which a      federal court in Topeka, for example, may be able to obtain      guidance as to the law of California.       A further unwarranted provision in S. 274 would allow a      defendant to remove state-law cases filed against it in the      courts of its own home state, where it chose to be      incorporated or chose to have its principal place of      business. This type of removal has long been considered an      abuse, and is forbidden by current law.       Equally troubling is a provision in S. 274 that allows      removal of a case at any time. This would give a defendant      the power to yank a case away from a state-court judge who      has properly issued pretrial rulings the defendant does not      like, and would encourage a level of forum-shopping never      before seen in this country. Moreover, this provision would      allow an unscrupulous defendant, anxious to put off the day      of judgment so that more assets can be hidden, to remove a      case on the eve of a state-court trial, resulting in an      automatic delay of months or even years before the case can      be tried in federal courts. The House bill creates an even      further opportunity for delay, by overruling Rule 23(f)'s      provision for obtaining permission from a court of appeals to      appeal a class certification ruling, and providing for a      right to trigger an automatic appeal and for an automatic      stay of discovery while the appeal is pending, even if there      is no legal basis for an appeal.            Lack of Justification for a Remedy This Sweeping       We understand that the supporters of the bill base its      justification on assertions that the courts in one or two      counties in the United States have too freely granted class      certifications in some cases. The bill is not limited to      curing claimed abuses in one or two counties, but applies      equally to the 3,066 counties in which there is not even a      claimed problem. In general, courts have been very responsive      to complaints of abuses, and have instituted corrective      measures, such as allowing petitions for interlocutory appeal      from orders granting or denying class certification. The      Federal courts have adopted Rule 23(f) of the Federal Rules      of Civil Procedure, and many State courts have followed suit.       The need for a state court to interpret the law of a      different state has never been seen as an adequate      justification for removal. Article III of the Constitution      does not recognize this as a basis for federal-court      jurisdiction and the Full Faith and Credit clause already      requires state courts to accord respect to the laws of their      sister states. As a practical matter, state courts frequently      have to interpret the law of different states even in      individual cases properly brought in state courts. This is      part of the normal business of the state courts, not a reason      for federal jurisdiction.                         Constitutional Issues       There is substantial cause to doubt the constitutionality      of a massive transfer of state-court cases to federal courts.      This transfer would effectively substitute federal-court Rule      23 class certification standards for the class certification      standards set forth in the statutes, court rules, and case      law of the various states. Unbelievably, such a substitution      would provide for dismissal of cases that do not meet the      federal standards even though they may meet the standards of      the states, and even though the standards of the states may      meet every requirement of due process. The Supreme Court has      not devoted nearly as much attention to construing the Tenth      Amendment to the Constitution as it has devoted to the      Eleventh Amendment, but passage of S. 274 or its House      counterpart may change that comparative lack of attention.       Similarly, the ``minimal diversity'' trigger for removal      under S. 274 and its House counterpart creates an untested      and unprecedented expansion of diversity jurisdiction under      Article III of the Constitution. Congress certainly has the      power to expand diversity jurisdiction to reach cases in      which one party on one side of a case is diverse from any      adverse party, see 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1335(a)(1) (the      interpleader statute). There is, however, substantial cause      to doubt the constitutionality of these bills' approach, in      which diversity is based on the citizenship of any potential      class members. We say ``potential'' because the bill allows      removal of a case before the state court has even decided      that the case should go forward as a class action, or what      the scope of the class should be. While class members are to      be protected by the court, and while their rights may be      determined by the class action, they are not full parties to      the action. Prior to the determination of liability and a      proceeding on class members' individual remedies, unless      they intervene and become parties, they do not      individually have the right to take discovery from the      defendants, to file motions in court, to question      witnesses, to introduce evidence, or even to take an      appeal from an adverse ruling. Yet, under this legislation      they would be allowed to remove a complex state law class      action into federal court.       At the very least, litigation over the constitutionality of      the bill is likely to embroil the courts for years and is yet      a further reason to oppose the enactment of this misguided      legislation. We urge you to consider our concerns about the      unwarranted changes this legislation mandates as well as the      very troubling aspects of the legislation that undermine fair      administration of justice in the federal and state judicial      systems in the United States.       Respectfully submitted.
