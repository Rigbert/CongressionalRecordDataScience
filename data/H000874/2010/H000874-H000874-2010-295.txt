In the March 31st championship game, Maryland defeated Northwestern University, a lacrosse dynasty in its own right, by a score of 13-11.  Congratulations are especially due to Coach Cathy Reese, who was rewarded with success after returning to coach at her alma mater; to senior Caitlyn McFadden, who starred in her last collegiate game with two goals and an assist, and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player; and to the Maryland fans,who turned out to support their Terrapins in record numbers. This championship is the product of outstanding athletes and coaches, untold hours of hard work, and the passionate support of the University of Maryland community. The University of Maryland demonstrates excellence in both academics and athletics, and I'm proud of this team for contributing to that legacy.                          ____________________
