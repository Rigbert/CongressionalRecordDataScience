President, right now the pending business is the Bayh amendment. I stress again that both Senator Jeffords and I are inviting anyone to come down with amendments they have. Senator Bayh has graciously agreed to set his aside for the consideration of any other amendments, and then we would go back to his amendment. So I would not want any Members who are watching the proceedings to believe they cannot get their amendment in. We do encourage them to bring their amendments down. I would hate to have all of these stacked up at the last minute. Now is the time to get consideration for amendments.  I yield the floor.
