President, last night, as snow fell in Washington, DC, the Senate freeze on confirming judges began to thaw a bit. I thank the leaders for clearing 4 of the 38 judicial nominations awaiting final action by the Senate. These nominations will fill a few of the historically high number of Federal judicial vacancies around the country, including in the Eastern District of California, one of the districts with the highest workloads in the country. All the nominations confirmed last night were reported by the Judiciary Committee without objection way back in May and early June. I hope this is an indication that the other 34 judicial nominees pending in the Senate will receive consideration and a vote by the Senate before the Senate adjourns.  Senate consideration of the four nominations we confirmed last night was long overdue. In fact, these are the first judicial confirmations the Senate has considered since September 13, more than 3 months ago. For months, these nominations and many others have languished before the Senate, without explanation and for no reason. As a result of these needless delays, of the 80 judicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, only 45 have been considered by the Senate. Even with yesterday's confirmations, that remains a historically low number and percentage. Meanwhile, 34 judicial nominees with well-established qualifications and the support of their home State Senators from both parties are still waiting for Senate consideration. Some were sent to the Senate for final action as long ago as last January after being reported unanimously by all Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.  Last night, we unanimously confirmed Catherine Eagles to the Middle District of North Carolina, Kimberly Mueller to the Eastern District of California, John Gibney to the Eastern District of Virginia, and James Bredar to the District of Maryland. Judge Eagles and Judge Mueller were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee on May 6; Mr. Gibney's nomination was reported unanimously on May 27; and Judge Bredar's nomination was reported unanimously on June 10. Judge Mueller's confirmation is particularly welcome news for the Eastern District of California, which maintains the highest weighted caseload among all Federal judicial districts across the country. There is no reason and still no explanation for these delays.  Since last year, I have been urging all Senators, Democrats and Republicans, to join together to take action to end the crisis of skyrocketing judicial vacancies. That has not happened. I have asked that we return to the longstanding practices that the Senate used to follow when considering nominations from Presidents of both parties. This has not happened. As a result, 34 judicial nominations that have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee continue to be stalled on the Senate's Executive Calendar awaiting final consideration and their confirmation.  I hope that our action yesterday in considering a handful of nominationssignals a new effort to address the vacancies that have doubled over the last 2 years. Vacancies are now at the historically high level of 108. Fifty of these vacancies are deemed judicial emergency vacancies by the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Senate has received letters from courts around the country calling for help to address their crushing caseloads, including letters from the Chief Judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. District Courts in California, Colorado, Illinois and the District of Columbia. They have pleaded with us to end the blockade and confirm judges to fill vacancies in their courts.  The Senate should vote on all of the judicial nominations awaiting final action by the Senate. We should do as we did during President Bush's first 2 years in office, and consider every judicial nomination favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. During those 2 years, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported 100 judicial nominations and the Senate confirmed every one of them, including controversial circuit court nominations reported during the lame duck session in 2002. In contrast, during this first Congress of President Obama's administration, the Senate has considered just 45 of the 80 nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee.  I hope we can build on the belated progress made last night. Agreements to debate and consider nominations have been sought repeatedly. Of the 34 judicial nominations currently stalled on the Executive Calendar, 25 of them were reported unanimously by the 19 Republican and Democratic members of the committee. Another three were reported with strong bipartisan support and only a small number of no votes. Of these 28 bipartisan, consensus nominees, 15 of them were nominated to fill judicial emergency vacancies. They all should have been confirmed within days of being reported. It will be a travesty if they are not all confirmed before the 111th Congress adjourns.  These consensus nominees yet to be considered include six unanimously reported circuit court nominees, and another circuit court nominee supported by 17 of the 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee. The nomination of a respected and experienced jurist, Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina, for a judicial emergency vacancy on the Fourth Circuit has been stalled for 11 months, since last January, despite the support of both his home state Senators, a Democrat and a Republican. Four of the other consensus circuit court nominations would also fill judicial emergency vacancies, and three of them came through the committee with the strong support of two home State Republican Senators. All seven circuit court nominees are superbly qualified and I predict if considered would be confirmed with strong bipartisan support.  Last night we confirmed four district court nominations, but 26 are still being blocked from consideration. Some were reported as long ago as February. Senate inaction on these nominations is a dramatic departure from the traditional practice of considering them expeditiously and with deference to the home State Senators. These 26 district court nominations include 19 nominations reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. Thirteen of these nominations are for seats designated as judicial emergencies. All 26 nominees have well-established qualifications and are at the top of the legal community in their home States. All have put their lives and practices on hold in an attempt to serve their country and their community. There is no cause for continuing to block the Senate from considering their nominations and no precedent for extending these delays further.  For the last 17 years, Catherine Eagles has served North Carolina as a superior court judge. Before that, she spent nearly a decade as an attorney in private practice. Her nomination has had the support of both of her home State Senators, Senator Burr, a Republican, and Senator Hagan, a Democrat--as does the nomination of Alberto Diaz to the Fourth Circuit from North Carolina that remains stalled without final action. The American Bar Association, ABA, Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Eagles well-qualified--its highest possible rating--to serve as a District Court Judge. With her confirmation, Judge Eagles will become the first woman to serve on the Middle District of North Carolina, and only the second in the State.  The nomination of Kimberly Jo Mueller to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Eastern District of California, one of the busiest courts in the country, was held on the Executive Calendar for more than 7 months. Judge Mueller has served the Eastern District as a Magistrate Judge since 2003. Prior to becoming an attorney, she was a 6-year term as a Sacramento city councilmember before earning her J.D. from Stanford Law School. Her nomination has the strong support of both of her home State Senators and she was unanimously rated well qualified by the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, its highest possible rating. Judge Mueller will be the only female judge in the Eastern District of California.  John A. Gibney, Jr. was nominated more than eight months ago to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. That Mr. Gibney has the strong support of both Virginia Senators is no surprise since he has a long and distinguished career, practicing law in Richmond, VA, for more than 30 years. Mr. Gibney has represented a wide variety of clients, from business to local governments to private individuals. Currently, he is a partner and a civil litigator in the Richmond, VA, firm ThompsonMcMullan. Mr. Gibney earned his B.A., Phi Beta Kappa, from the College of William & Mary and his J.D. from the University of Virginia. After graduation, he clerked for Justice Harry L. Carrico of the Supreme Court of Virginia.  Judge James Bredar has served for 12 years as a Federal Magistrate Judge on the District Court to which he is now nominated. As a lawyer, Judge Bredar saw the justice system from both sides, first as a Federal prosecutor in Colorado and then as a Federal public defender in Maryland. Judge Bredar will be the first Federal defender to serve as a Federal judge in Maryland. His nomination has the support of both of his home State Senators and received the highest possible rating from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.  The 34 judicial nominations remaining on the calendar should be accorded the same up-or-down vote as the four considered last night. They should have the same up-or-down vote given to all 100 of President Bush's judicial nominations reported by the committee in his first 2 years. Even if Republican Senators will not follow our example and treat President Obama's nominees as we treated President Bush's, they should at least listen to their own statements from just a few years ago. They said that every judicial nomination reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee was entitled to an up-or-down vote. They spoke then about the constitutional duty of the Senate to consider every judicial nomination. The Constitution has not changed; it has not been amended. The change from the days in which they made those statements is that the American people elected a new President and he is making the nominations.  The Senate should also debate and a vote on those few nominees that Republican Senators opposed in committee. These nominees include Benita Pearson of Ohio, William Martinez of Colorado, Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Edward Chen of California, John McConnell of Rhode Island, and Goodwin Liu of California. As I have said before, I have reviewed their records and considered their character, background and qualifications. I have heard the criticisms of the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee as they have voted against this handful of nominees. I disagree, and believe the Senate would vote on their confirmation. Each of these nominees have been reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, several of them two or three times, and each deserves an up-or-down vote. That they will not be conservative activist judges should not disqualify them from consideration by the Senate or serving on the bench.  President Obama has reached out and worked with Senators from both sides of the aisle in selecting well-qualified judicial nominees. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have made sure that we have not proceeded on any judicial nominees without the support ofboth home State Senators. There has been consultation and a thorough and fair process for evaluating nominations. There has been more than enough time for Senators to decide how they want to vote. Now it is time to return to the Senate's longstanding traditions and reject the obstruction that has blocked us month after month from considering judicial nominations. Now is the time to act to address the needs of the Federal courts and the American people who depend on them for justice.                          ____________________
