 I was concerned at the beginning because there are so many deserving schools in Oregon and Pennsylvaniaand elsewhere that don't get this special treatment, and obviously you have heard my colleagues express their concern, and I think it transcends somebody's politics.  So my question now would be--the perfecting amendment has not yet been filed. Would my colleague be willing to take his provision out of the perfecting amendment and offer it as a separate amendment so we can actually have an up-or-down vote? And perhaps by that time, we will know how many colleges, if any other than this one, benefit.
