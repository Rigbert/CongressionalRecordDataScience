Chairman, for the new Members here on both sides of the aisle:  I can remember scores of times, scores of times, that amendments were accepted on this side offered by the now-distinguished chairman of the Committee on Rules, as one example, scores of times, and we accepted amendments, but they wanted to get votes on those amendments. They wanted to get votes on those amendments so they could score us so they could take it to the interest groups and say, ``See how they voted?''  Not one voice was raised in opposition to amendments on a voice vote, but they asked for rollcalls. That is the facet of this democracy. They wanted to have rollcall votes in committees. They wanted to have quorums present in committees. They wanted to make sure that everybody was present, no proxy voting.  Mr. Chairman, we understand that. Very frankly I think on proxy voting they probably were correct. But the fact of the matter is on our side of the aisle understand we think it to be somewhat ironic that a party that time after time after time asked for rollcall votes when there was not a dispute, when committee chairs were willing to take it, is not now really in a position to criticize those on this side of the aisle who seek to have rollcall votes so Americans can know whether we are voting with senior citizens, whether we are voting with children, whether we are voting with the environment, whether we are voting against hazardous waste in communities.  Mr. Chairman, we think those are legitimate votes, and they did as well, apparently until just recently.
