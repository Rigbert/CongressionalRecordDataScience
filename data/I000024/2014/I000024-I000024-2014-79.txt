Billings. Randy died December 17, 2013, of injuries he sustained when his helicopter crashed in Zabul Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Randy was born September 1, 1979, in Poteau, OK, and later moved to Heavener, OK. After graduating Heavener High School in 1997, he joined the military and served our country for 16 years.  While attending flight school to Rucker, AL, Randy met his wife Ashley. Bonding through a mutual enjoyment of the outdoors, they were married in 2008.  In September 2009, Randy transferred to the 3rd Assault Helicopter Battalion, 1st Aviation Regiment, 1st Combat Aviation Brigade, and 1st Infantry Division in Fort Riley, KS.  The couple made a home in Manhattan, KS, but they planned to move south after he retired from the military and start a family.  Ashley and her family are suffering their second loss to war. Ashley Billings' brother died in a 2004 helicopter crash in Iraq. ``It's much harder because we've been through this before,'' she said. However, they were comforted by the knowledge that Randy ``loved what he did and was going to do it right.''  On December 17, 2013, Randy tragically died of injuries he sustained when his Black Hawk U-60 helicopter crashed in southern Afghanistan. Five other soldiers on board were killed alongside of Randy.  His uncle Hurschel Billings said, ``He really loved it. Every time he came back, he couldn't wait to go back.'' He served two tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan. ``He died loving what he does. Serving the country.''  ``He was just one of the nicest people you could possibly be around . . . He was the definition of what a hero is. He served his country well,'' said Amanda Morrison, Billings' cousin.  A memorial service was held January 4, 2014, at Cornerstone Baptist Church in Inverness, FL, and he was buried at Florida National Cemetery. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin ordered flags on State property to fly at half-staff from 3-6 January, 2014.  ``He's pushed me to be a better person for myself every single day of my life,'' his wife Ashley said. ``That's the kind of person he was.''  Chief Warrant Officer Billings' wife Ashley Billings resides in Manhattan, KS; mother Eva Cooper in Poteau, OK; and father Robert Billings in Heavener, OK.  Today we remember Army CW2 Randy L. Billings, a young man who loved his family and country and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
