  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority has a new plan. Instead of taking on the extension of the $5.95 trillion debt ceiling, they are a little embarrassed to be increasing the debt of the United States when last year they predicted surpluses as far as the eye could see and paying the debt off within a few years. They are especially embarrassed that they are going to break open the Social Security lockbox, something they had us vote on seven times. They do not talk much about the lockbox anymore.  But now the most disturbing proposal. They are not going to raise the debt ceiling; they are going to disappear the Social Security trust fund. Yes, that is right. They decided yesterday that they are going to say that these special depository instruments, the debt of the Federal Government of the United States, which is held by the Social Security trust fund, over $1 trillion, does not exist. Suddenly, they are wiping a couple of trillion dollars off the books, all because they do not want to take an embarrassing vote, or all because they do not want to roll back their obscene tax cuts or rein in their massive increases in military spending.  They cannot do this to the Social Security trust fund. It is an irrefutable obligation of the Government of the United States of America. They cannot disappear it.                          ____________________
