President, I will accept my colleague from Virginia's kind words with at least an indirect apology for the defamation which he included in his speech suggesting that I was somehow an Ancient Mariner here in the Senate. I wear my trousers rolled but not quite as rolled as my friend suggested.  I thank the Senator for his leadership on this deficit and debt issue. We have a lot to do and we have to do it thoughtfully. I am glad my colleague highlighted the two employees.  I read the obituary of the one the Senator from Virginia highlighted. It was an extraordinary story of a woman who persevered in an agency which didn't have much use for women beyond the secretarial staff. I am glad the Senator continues this tradition of acknowledging these important Federal employees.  I thank my friend from Virginia.                          ____________________
