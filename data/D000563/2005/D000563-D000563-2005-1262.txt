I am concerned about the oil that is consumed in America and the gasoline consumed in America. I don't care if Toyota makes a car that is sold in Australia and what the mileage might be. That is their concern.  For us to take the attitude or approach that we are not even going to hold the manufacturer to any higher standards with fuel efficiency in my mind is a concession that we will be dependent on foreign oil for as long as we can imagine.
