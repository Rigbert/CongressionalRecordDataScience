In a sense, it might prove too much. The idea that we can do things outside of fast track raises or begs the question why we do certain things within fast track. Why, for example, are we saying let's make foreign laws with respect to commercial practices consistent with our laws, when, in fact, when it comes to the environment, we are saying, ``Oh, no, don't include environment in this same context''?  I think perhaps the logic might be that some people either feel the environment is not important to international trade--and I think our discussions tonight should have indicated it is very important, indeed crucial--or others are simply saying we want a trade agreement, an arrangement with a foreign country which will allow us all the benefits of commercial practice in the United States, all the protection of intellectual property laws, all the protections for capital investment but none of the burdens, if you will, of high-quality environmental laws.  Again, I just can't understand, with respect, why we can't include environmental conditions as we have otherwise.
