President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter in the introduction of two bills, S. 437 and S. 440, that will correct inconsistencies and provide fairness to lawyers and their clients under the Federal Tax Code.  Currently, attorneys who take on contingency fee cases, and advance their clients funds for court costs, witnesses, or other expenses, cannot deduct these expenses as ordinary business expenses at the time they are made. Instead, attorneys who advance these costs may not take a deduction until the case for which they are advanced is resolved. In most cases this is a timeframe of several years. This results in an attorney carrying the burden of these costs from year to year until the case is resolved. For many small law firms or solo practitioners, this is a significant burden.  Where attorneys are advancing costs to clients so that those clients may pursue their rights in court, they deserve to be treated as any other small business owner. This disparate treatment is inequitable and correcting it will make legal representation more easily provided by attorneys and more available to clients.  The other bill we introduce today helps clients who have been awarded funds through a contingency fee arrangement. Under current tax law, punitive damages awards and awards to a plaintiff resulting from certain claims are subject to Federal taxation for the entire amount of the award, even if the plaintiff then uses a portion to satisfy a contingency fee agreement. The result is that the portion of an award to a plaintiff in a contingency fee arrangement that then goes to an attorney is taxed twice--once through the plaintiff and again through the attorney.  This legislation will allow a plaintiff who has recovered an award to take an above the line deduction for the portion of his or her award that will be transmitted to the attorney who provided the representation. This is a commonsense solution and where an individual has suffered an injury and will rely on his or her award it is sound policy to reduce this unnecessary and duplicative tax burden.  Neither of these bills gives any special treatment to attorneys or their clients. Rather, in combination, they will help attorneys provide more representation to clients who by virtue of their financial or other circumstances must enter a contingency fee arrangement, and will allow a greater amount of funds recovered to be put to use by the individual for whose benefit they were awarded.  I thank Senator Specter for introducing this legislation and I hope all Senators will join us in supporting these sensible corrections to our Tax Code.                                 ______                                       By
