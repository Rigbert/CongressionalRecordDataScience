President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator Schumer to introduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and disabled citizens have timely access to home health services under the Medicare program.  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives and clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be in scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in 1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services provided by these health professionals as long as those services are within their scope of practice under State law.  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home health services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the patient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, this requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps to the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it can lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home health care they need simply because a physician is not readily available to sign the form.  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for Medicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these providers may be the only health care professionals available. For example, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a Medicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only health care professional serving the patient's small town, and the supervising physician was located 60 miles away.  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her collaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. As a consequence, the patient experienced a 2 day delay in getting needed care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another physician.  Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous that she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute facility but cannot order home health care. One of her patients had to wait eleven days after being discharged before his physical and occupational therapy could continue simply because the home health agency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation of the same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to authorize when the patient was in the facility.  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act will help to ensure that our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care that they need when they need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives to order home health services. Our legislation is supported by a broad coalition of organizations, including the AARP, the National Council on Aging, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of Nurse Midwives, and the Visiting Nurse Associations of America. I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 25, 2015.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Chuck Schumer,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Schumer: Thank you for      introducing the bipartisan Home Health Care Planning      Improvement Act of 2015. We, the undersigned groups, pledge      our continued support of your efforts to obtain passage of      this important legislation in the 114th Congress. As you      know, the bill authorizes nurse practitioners, clinical nurse      specialists, certified nurse-midwives and physician      assistants as eligible health care professionals who can      certify patient eligibility for home health care services      under Medicare. This critical     change would improve access to important home health care      services, and potentially prevent additional hospital, sub-     acute care facility and nursing home admissions--all of which      are costly to the consumer, the taxpayer and Medicare.       The undersigned organizations are committed to ensuring      that consumers have access to health care providers who are      qualified, educated, and certified to provide high quality      primary care, chronic care management, and other services      that keep them living a high quality life, with dignity, in      locations of their choice.       Although current law has long recognized advanced practice      registered nurses and physician assistants as authorized      Medicare providers, and allows these clinicians to certify      eligibility for nursing home care for their patients, it      precludes these same practitioners from certifying patient      eligibility for home health care services. This is an      unnecessary barrier to care and adds at least one more step      in the process of accessing home health care services by      requiring the provider to find a physician to certify      eligibility. In addition, time delays to locate a physician      to certify eligibility, particularly in rural and underserved      areas, can result in an extended hospital stay or nursing      home admission because the beneficiary could not be moved      back to or remain at home without home health care services.       There are decades of data supporting the ability of these      providers to deliver high quality care to people of all ages,      including Medicare recipients with multiple chronic      conditions. Advanced practice registered nurses are often the      only care providers available in health professional shortage      areas such as urban, rural, and frontier regions. Given the      existing and future projected primary care physician      shortages, and the coming of increased numbers of Medicare      eligible patients, the need will be even greater for all      qualified providers to be allowed to certify home health care      eligibility.       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act would help to      ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in need of home health      care services whose providers are nurse practitioners,      clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives, and      physician assistants would be able to directly access home      health care by referral from their providers. This bill would      provide beneficiaries continued access to care and increase      the likelihood that they would experience better health and a      higher quality of life. Additionally, outside experts      assessed the impact of the bill earlier last year and      projected a Medicare savings of $7.1 million in 2015 and up      to a ten-year savings of $252.6 million. This analysis also      notes the potential to reduce beneficiary admissions to and      lengths of stay in institutional settings under the policy      change.       We appreciate your continued leadership and are committed      to working with you to ensure that this bipartisan      legislation is passed and placed on the President's desk for      signature at the first opportunity. The time is now to ensure      that patients have timely access to the quality, cost      effective care they need. For any questions, please contact      [email protected] or 703-740-2529.
