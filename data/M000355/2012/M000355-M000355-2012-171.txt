 President, today I wish to honor Mrs. Alice Helton of Laurel County, KY. Though she may have never held public office, Mrs. Helton invaluably served her community through kindness, hospitality, and an unselfish desire to help those around her. On April 26, 2012, she died at age 94. Her legacy of faith, generosity, and love will survive her in the memories of her family, friends, and the citizens of London, KY.  Mrs. Alice Helton, then-Miss Alice Hill, the last of eight children, was born on May 2, 1917, in Keavy, KY, to farmers Mr. John and Mrs. Sallie Hill. She was raised in the country and lived a simple life. The family would work together in the fields during the day and on Sundays be visited by neighbors while the children played marbles. Alice, in her interview with the Sentinel-Echo for the London Living Treasures special series, recalled plucking duck feathers with her mother as a child and walking for hours to find ducks to make feather beds and pillows.  At age 7, Alice began attending Keavy School. One of her fondest memories of grade school was spending time at recess with her friends throwing horseshoes and watching boys play basketball. After elementary school, she attended a boarding school called London School. Upon finishing the eighth grade, she returned home, lived with her parents, and looked after her siblings' children while they were at work.  Alice met William Raymond Helton, a truckdriver from Corbin, KY, when she was 22. Though her family didn't support the relationship, the two eloped and were married. Mrs. Helton, during the first 17 years of her marriage, had seven children. The family lived in a small house, near her parents, which soon became the place where the entire family would meet and spend time together.  Her children have many colorful memories of growing up with Mrs. Helton. They never questioned her love or willingness to protect the family because during the week, when her husband was away driving a truck, she would ward off thieves trying to steal the family chickens by shooting her rifle toward a row of trees behind the coop. In order to avoid becoming a victim of her unique security system, all family members would call out to her any time they passed the yard.  Mrs. Helton was described as a ``magnet'' that drew all of the family together. She would take on the role of mother to her nieces and nephews as her siblings passed away and loved them as if they were her own children. Her love also was shown by entertaining them at game nights, wherecard games and Yahtzee were the main attraction.  Mrs. Helton was more than a wife, mother, grandmother, aunt, and member of the Laurel County community. She was the matriarch of the Helton family and the glue that held it together. From talking on the phone for hours on end with her children and grandchildren to taking in family and friends in need, Mrs. Helton lived a life of compassion and kindness. After her death, a neighbor said that she tried to live the way Jesus lived, but if she only lived half as well as Mrs. Helton, she would be satisfied.  It is a privilege to honor the legacy of Mrs. Alice Helton. A true pillar of the Laurel County community, she was an example for all Kentuckians of a woman who lived her life with integrity and love. I ask my fellow colleagues in the Senate to join me in remembering this remarkable woman from Laurel County, KY.  A recent article published by a Laurel County publication, the Sentinel-Echo, recognized Mrs. Helton's lifetime of contributions to her family and community. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [The Sentinel-Echo, May 16, 2012]                 Alice Helton Was Surrounded by Family                           (By Tara Kaprowy)       Before Alice Helton passed away a few weeks ago, just six      days shy of her 95th birthday, she said getting to see her      loved ones in heaven would be the best birthday present she      could ask for.       It was a Thursday afternoon, and Alice's family members had      gathered around her hospital bed, which she'd occupied for      just a few days. ``She said she was ready to go, and for us      to please just let her go peacefully,'' granddaughter Lisa      Alexander said. ``She made sure she held each family member's      hands, and told them how much she loved them. She told them      to love each other and to take care of each other.'' She      quietly slipped away around 2 in the afternoon, and the woman      who was the magnet that pulled her large family together, and      whose home was always described as Grand Central Station, was      gone.       She had a good, long life. One that started May 2, 1917, in      Keavy, ``right across the field'' from her current home on      German Lane. The youngest of eight siblings, she was born to      John and Sallie Ann Karr Hill. ``Our house was about like a      school, there were so many of us,'' Alice said. ``Mommy and      poppy were good people.'' John and Sallie were farmers, and      ``mommy would do the cooking and we would all come back in      from the field and eat dinner; plain old country meals of      beans, potatoes, and cornbread. Then we would go out in the      field and work and come back and have a cold supper, usually      milk and bread.''       In addition to farming, John Hill delivered the mail for      the U.S. Postal Service. ``Sometimes I'd go with him and he'd      deliver those packages on horseback from Vox to Lily. He'd      buy me a little candy to eat on while we was gone, that sugar      candy.''       The Hill home was a plain but happy one, with the kids      playing hide and seek and marbles while the adults visited      with neighbors on Sunday afternoons in between going to      church at Locust Grove and Level Green.       It was hot in the house in the summer, with no screens to      keep the flies ``and everything else there is to have'' away,      and so cold in the winter the dipper would freeze in the      water bucket overnight. On snowy days, ``we would pop popcorn      on the stove and piece quilts,'' Alice said. Once a week, the      family would head to a big spring ``and there was a great,      old big rock there we'd use to set our tubs on'' to do      laundry. Another tub was used for baths. ``It was a lot of      trouble,'' Alice said about bathing when she was a kid, ``but      the water stayed pretty warm.'' Alice, being the baby, would      always be the last one in the water.       One of the chores she keenly remembers was rounding up her      mother's paddling of ducks. ``Mommy would pick the feathers      off them and make pillows and feather beds,'' Alice said.      ``Here we'd go marching down the branch to find her ducks.      We'd have to gather them back up and drive them back home.      Some later, there they'd go again. We'd go up and down      through there catching them. And then we'd go and look for      wildflowers up and down the branch. My mom would walk us to      death.''       Alice's mother made all of her children's clothes, often      cobbling together feed sacks for the girls to wear. But Alice      didn't mind. ``They were just as comfortable and pretty as      store-bought,'' she said.       Alice started attending Keavy School at the age of 7--``I      didn't want to go when I was 6'' and she quickly made fast      friends with Georgia Alsip and Anna Lee Bunch. ``We'd get out      and roam around at recess. We'd watch 'em play basketball.      Sometimes we'd pitch horseshoe. Back then we had a recess      that lasted about half an hour of a morning. Then we had      another at dinner, then another half an hour in the evening.      We had time to play.''       The school was a ``big, white, two-story building with an      aisle up through the middle and rooms up each side. There      were stairs up each side of the front door.'' One of her      teachers, Oscar Parman, boarded with the Hills, and he ``was      just like a brother to me.''       Following elementary school, Alice went on to London      School, where, boarding with her sister in town, she stayed      until the eighth grade. She then returned to her parents'      house and, since several of her siblings had become teachers      and started raising their own families, the care of their      children during the day fell to Aunt Alice. She took on the      role naturally and was a loving, tender caregiver whose      influence long outlasted her babysitting days.       At the age of 22, Alice met a man by the name of William      Raymond Helton, a truck driver who lived in Corbin, with whom      she was soon taken. Though she didn't have the support of her      family--``They just didn't think he was the kind I should      marry''--Alice got up early one morning, washed a white dress      with pink flowers and told her sister, with whom she was      living, she was headed down to a revival. ``I got down there      at the foot of the hill and he's sitting there on a bench      waiting for me and we turned around and went back to Preacher      Grubb's house. In other words, we eloped.''       Alice and her husband moved into a tiny starter house, and      soon she and Raymond started a family. Over the next 17      years, they had seven children--Freda, Herschel, Joan, Wanda,      Wayne, Debbie, and Danny--and during World War II moved into      their first real home a stone's throw away from her parents.      ``It wasn't much because you couldn't get lumber back then      because of the war,'' she said. ``They just threw it up as      good as they could make it.'' Still, Alice made it her own,      and soon it was a popular gathering spot for friends and      family.       Alice was an indulgent, kind mother, and her children have      fond memories of chasing lightning bugs in the twilight,      listening to the Grand Ole Opry, watching ``Lassie'' and      ``Rin Tin Tin,'' and heading out for ice cream cones at the      local dairy drive-in. Though Alice very rarely had a chance      to relax, when she did, she liked spending time ``watching      the kids play.''       But Alice was deeply protective too. ``Daddy would be gone      during the week and it was just us kids,'' daughter Joan      remembered, laughing. ``She would hear people trying to steal      her chickens. So she would make all of us kids get behind the      couch and she would get out there and start shooting at the      trees, to try and scare them off. My uncle worked for the      railroad, and he would have to walk to the end of our road to      catch his ride at night. And he'd start hollering, It's me,      Alice!' because he didn't want to get shot.''       In 1969, Raymond built the family a new, bigger home across      the street, and it's there Alice remained, even after Raymond      died from Alzheimer's at the age of 83. Though widowed, Alice      didn't stop ``being the glue that held us all together,''      Joan said. As she'd done before she married, Alice continued      taking care of kids; this time it was her grandchildren whom      she would babysit. Her nieces and nephews would constantly      visit or call, and when her mother decided she no longer      wanted to live alone, she showed up at Alice's door and moved      in. ``As our parents passed on, Aunt Alice would say, I'm      adopting you now and I have a little job for you to do,' so      Aunt Alice became our surrogate mother and we all snuggled      under her loving wings to survive our tragedies,'' one of      Alice's nieces, Peggy Black, said.       During the week and every Sunday, Alice would get together      with her siblings for game night, entertaining, and      competitive evenings involving Yahtzee, Aggravation, Chinese      checkers, and a complicated game called Hand and Foot that      required seven decks of playing cards. ``We'd always come in      here and we'd hear the dice rolling and we'd say, `It sounds      like the casino is open today,' '' granddaughter Lisa      recalled. Alice and her brothers and sisters would gather in      the kitchen while their children and grandchildren would sit      outside to visit, the laughter and drama stemming from the      game wafting onto the porch. This tradition continued for      decades, with most of Alice's siblings living into their 90s.       In the end, Alice was the last of her siblings to survive      but continued to be surrounded by family. On the afternoon of      her interview, her phone rang nearly every 10 minutes, with      family members on the other end calling for a chat. One of      her daughters and a granddaughter sat on the couch to ask her      questions. And Alice sat in her recliner talking, remembering      and smiling at the past.       Thoughts from the family:       Alice's family said that when she first found out that she      not only had been nominated, but also chosen as one of      London's Living Treasures, the first thing she said was ``I      haven't done anything special to deserve this. I haven't      fought in any wars, or held any high positions in the      community. I don't know what they will find to write about      me.'' We assured her that yes, all the things she had      mentioned were indeed important, but that she too had done      some pretty important things in her life as well. We told her      that when someone needed her she was always there to help,      she was kind to people, she made people feel loved and      needed, she always made people feel welcome at her home,      people always wanted to be around her, she was a loving      caregiver, she indeed impacted peoples' lives in a profound      way. One example is something that was said about Alice by      one of her neighbors--she said     that she knew she was supposed to try to live her life      patterned by the way Jesus had lived his, but that she would      feel satisfied if she could just live her life the way Alice      Helton had lived hers. Another testimony of how much she was      valued by the community was when one of the preachers at her      funeral said that he felt as if he was officiating the      funeral of ``royalty.''       Alice was a special lady to many people, and those who knew      her, and loved her, and respected her, will miss her dearly.      Her family said that they were so thankful that she was able      to do her interview for the London Living Treasures project      before she passed. And during her final hours on this earth,      it was so clear to them how strong her faith in God was. They      said she wasn't scared; she knew where she was going. They      said that witnessing that kind of faith was one of the      greatest gifts she could have ever given them.                          ____________________
