Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Family Smoking Prevention Act; and, Mr. Speaker, I want to take the time to thank Mr. Waxman for all of his great work in making it possible for us to have a vote on this bill.  We all know that tobacco is a killer. We all know that it causes cancer and respiratory problems. We all know that smoking is addictive and that most people who are hooked began smoking as children. We cannot and we must not wait a moment longer to protect our children from this killer. We must break the cycle. This bill is the right approach.  Children should not see cigarette advertisements from their school playground and at sporting events. Children should not be able to buy cigarettes in a vending machine. And children should not be the target of advertisements designed to get them hooked on smoking.  We should know what it is in the cigarettes that people smoke. People try to fool us and say that certain things are not in the cigarette. With the passage of this bill, for the first time, the FDA will know the ingredients in a cigarette, and they will be able to reduce or eliminate harmful ingredients.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot and must not allow another child to get hooked on cigarettes or on tobacco. We must pass this rule, and I support the rule and I strongly support the bill.
