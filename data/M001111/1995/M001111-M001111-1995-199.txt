 President, this system needs reform. S. 240 will retain the rights of investors to bring suit if they have been the victims of securities fraud.  At the same time, it will clamp down on the abusive suits that prey on investors and small business owners.  It is an honest effort to reduce the excessive costs to investors and our economy. It enjoys bipartisan support.  It is a good compromise.  For those of us concerned about the rights of investors--let me be very clear.  It is absolutely critical to me that businesses and entrepreneurs remain bound to their obligations to maximize the return-on-investment--to seniorsand average American families who invest in stocks and bonds.  I will not support a bill which goes further than this in changing the current system.  I will not support a loser pays provision.  I will fight efforts to remove the protections for small investors in the bill.  I will reject any legislation that takes away the SEC's powers to fight fraud.  These are lines I will not cross, and in fact, no Senator should cross.  They set my standards publicly for Senators offering amendments today--and Senators who go into conference with the House.  As it stands now, S. 240 brings rationality and perspective and common sense to the system.  And, I urge its swift adoption.
