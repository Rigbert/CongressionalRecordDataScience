President, I take our advice and consent function very seriously and especially so when it comes to the confirmation of Federal judges who are given lifetime appointments. In our system of Government, with coordinate branches and separation of powers, that is our responsibility in the Senate. But once a Federal judge is confirmed, our role is concluded.  I have voted to confirm some judges who rendered decisions with which I strongly disagreed and have voted against a few who have surprised me by turning out to be better judges than I predicted. Whenever I disagreed with a particular ruling in a particular case, after a Federal judge was nominated, examined and confirmed, I have not attacked that judge or tried to influence that judge's consideration of an ongoing matter.  If we disagree with the result in a case, we can determine whether the law needs to be amended or new law needs to be enacted. If a judge decides a case incorrectly, the remedy in our system is through judicial appeal. Indeed, the reason the Founders included the protections of a lifetime appointment for Federal judges was to insulate them from politics and political influence.  I ask that a statement from a group of distinguished judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Second Circuit and an editorial from the Washington Post on this subject be made part of the Record.  The material follows:                            Joint Statement       The following is a joint statement of Jon O. Newman, J.      Edward Lumbard, Wilfred Feinberg, and James L. Oakes, who are      respectively, the current and former chief judges of the      United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit:       The recent attacks on a trial judge of our Circuit have      gone too far. They threaten to weaken the constitutional      structure of this Nation, which has well served our citizens      for more than 200 years.       Last Friday, the White House press secretary announced that      the President would await the judge's decision on a pending      motion to reconsider a prior ruling before deciding whether      to call for the judge's resignation. The plain implication is      that the judge should resign if his decision is contrary to      the President's preference. That attack is an extraordinary      intimidation.       Last Saturday, the Senator Majority leader escalated the      attack by stating that if the judge does not resign, he      should be impeached. The Constitution limits impeachment to      those who have committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' A      ruling in a contested case cannot remotely be considered a      ground for impeachment.       These attacks do a grave disservice to the principle of an      independent judiciary, and, more significantly, mislead the      public as to the role of judges in a constitutional      democracy.       The Framers of our Constitution gave federal judges life      tenure, after nomination by the President and confirmation by      the Senate. They did not provide for resignation or      impeachment whenever a judge makes a decision with which      elected officials disagree.       Judges are called upon to make hundreds of decisions      each year. These decisions are made after consideration of      opposing contentions, both of which are often based on      reasonable interpretations of the laws of the United      States and the Constitution. Most rulings are subject to      appeal, as is the one that has occasioned these attacks.       When a judge is threatened with a call for resignation or      impeachment because of disagreement with a ruling, the entire      process of orderly resolution of legal disputes is      undermined.       We have no quarrel with criticism of any decision rendered      by any judge. Informed comment and disagreement from lawyers,      academics, and public officials have been hallmarks of the      American legal tradition.       But there is an important line between legitimate criticism      of a decision and illegitimate attack upon a judge. Criticism      of a decision can illuminate issues and sometimes point the      way toward better decisions. Attacks on a judge risk      inhibition of all judges as they conscientiously endeavor to      discharge their constitutional responsibilities.       In most circumstances, we would be constrained from making      this statement by the Code of Conduct for United States      Judges, which precludes public comment about a pending case.      However, the Code also places on judges an affirmative duty      to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary. In      this instance, we believe our duty under this latter      provision overrides whatever indirect comment on a pending      case might be inferred from this statement (and we intend      none).       We urge reconsideration of this rhetoric. We do so not      because we doubt the courage of the federal judges of this      Circuit, or of this Nation. They have endured attacks, both      verbal and physical, and they have established a tradition of      judicial independence and faithful regard for the      Constitution that is the envy of the world. We are confident      they will remain steadfast to that tradition.       Rather, we urge that attacks on a judge of our Circuit      cease because of the disservice they do to the Constitution      and the danger they create of seriously misleading the      American public as to the proper functioning of the federal      judiciary.       Each of us has important responsibilities in a      constitutional democracy. All of the judges of this Circuit      will continue to discharge theirs. We implore the leaders of      the Executive and Legislative Branches to abide by theirs.                                                                    ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 26, 1996]                        Life Tenure for a Reason       In an angry and misguided response to an unpopular judicial      ruling in New York last month, the White House let it be      known that it was considering asking for the resignation of      the federal judge in question. Within days of this thinly      veiled and constitutionally empty threat, however, cooler      heads prevailed. In a letter to a member of Congress who had      called for resignation, the president's counsel, Jack Quinn,      took the right tack, declaring that ``the proper way for the      executive branch to contest judicial decisions with which it      disagrees is to challenge them in the courts, exactly as the      Clinton administration is doing in this case.''       At issue is a decision by Judge Harold Baer, a Clinton      appointee, to suppress evidence in a multimillion-dollar drug      case because the police did not, in his opinion, have      probable cause to stop and search the car being used to      transport the drugs. Such a ruling is always unpopular,      especially in a case like this, in which a defendant at risk      of a life sentence will go free if the evidence is      inadmissible. But Judge Baer unfortunately used this      opportunity to take a gratuitous swipe at the police. It was      reasonable, he wrote, for the men involved in this crime to      run from the police, because in their neighborhood officers      have a reputation for corruption and violence.       The public uproar has caused Judge Baer to reconsider his      ruling. But whether he is correct on the law is of secondary      interest. Because this evidence is crucial to the case, the      government can appeal an adverse decision and get a ruling      from a higher court before the trial proceeds.       What is notable about the case is the eagerness of elected      officials to demand the ouster of the judge, not because of      corruption but because they did not agree with his ruling in      one case. It is exactly this kind of situation that the      Framers of the Constitution sought to avoid by providing life      tenure     for judges. Because of their wisdom, a judge acting in good      faith who makes an unpopular call--protecting the free speech      of political dissenters, for example--cannot be removed from      office. The president, members of Congress and the public in      general can demand his resignation until they are blue in the      face, but a judge cannot be personally punished for taking an      unpopular position. He can be removed only by impeachment.       An election-year assault on the judiciary is already in      full swing. There will be the expected claims that one side      will pack the courts with turn-'em-loose liberals and the      other will nominate only right-to-life stalwarts. Fortunately      for the country, judicial officers are sufficiently insulated      from the political process that they are able to do the right      thing even when the majority objects. Their mistakes can be      reversed. Their independence from political pressure must be      preserved.                          ____________________
