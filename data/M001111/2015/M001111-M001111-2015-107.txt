 President, over the weekend, we all cheered on the women's national soccer team as they beat Japan 5 to 2 in the World Cup. Their teamwork and the skills they displayed on the field were years in the making. Many of the players on the women's national team developed their skills and a love for soccer while attending their public schools growing up.  In fact, before midfielder Carli Lloyd shattered records in the World Cup finals on Saturday, she was the star of the Delran High School soccer team in New Jersey. Unfortunately, not all young girls have the same opportunities today as young boys do to participate in school sports. In our Nation's schools, all girls should have equal opportunities to pursue athletics, whether they just want to help their high school team have a winning season or whether they dream of one day playing in the World Cup final.  Today, I am offering an amendment to help close the opportunity gap in sports between young men and women. Back in 1972, Congress passed what is known as title IX. That is the law that bans discrimination in education on the basis of gender. This law applies to all educational opportunities that have had a huge impact on opening opportunities for young women to play sports.  For the first time, schools were required to provide equal opportunity to girls and boys to play organized sports, and they were required to provide equal benefits and services, like coaches and courts and playing fields. Title IX has truly changed our country for the better. The number of women and girls whose lives it touches is growing every single day. I have seen that firsthand in my own family. When I went to school, the atmosphere was a lot different than it is today. Back then, I could participate in just a very few sports, and it was simply unheard of for women athletes to receive athletic scholarships.  Now, 15 years later, it was amazing to watch my own daughter choose to play soccer, learning to be a part of a team and cheering each other on and learning how to be gracious in victory and in defeat. The differences between my daughter's generation and my own could not be more stark.  Today, more young women than ever are playing sports, but inequality still exists and girls don't have the same opportunities to play sports as boys. In fact, if you add up all of the missed opportunities across the country, young women have 1.3 million fewer chances today to play sports in high school compared to boys. That is according to the National Federation of High School Associations. So the amendment I am offering that we will be voting on shortly will help ensure that schools simply report information about school sports in elementary, middle, and high school.  I thank Senator Mikulski, who has been a champion for title IX, for working with me on this amendment. Under our amendment, schools would report on both access to girls organized sports and the funding for girls sports. For the first time, schools would need to show the public, show all of us, what they spend on travel expenses and equipment and uniforms for both boys and girls sports teams. This information will simply help us shine a light on the persistent inequalities in sports between men and women.  Playing sports isn't just good for a single sports season, it has a positive effect on and off the field. According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, when young women play sports, they are more likely to have higher grades, and they are more likely to graduate from high school than nonathletes. Research also shows that girls who have opportunities to play sports have lower risk of obesity later in life, lower incidence of depression, and more positive body image than nonathletes.  Congress can help ensure that girls all over our country have the chance not only to improve their athletic ability but also to develop valuable skills like teamwork and discipline and self-confidence. Those skills lead to success on and off the playing field.  I urge our colleagues to vote for this important amendment. Let's give young women and girls equal opportunity in sports. So many girls across the country spent this week dreaming of one day being one of those women champions they saw on television last weekend. Let's make sure they know Congress has their back.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Tennessee.                Amendment No. 2139 to Amendment No. 2089  (Purpose: To allow States to let Federal funds for the education of disadvantaged children follow low-income children to the accredited or otherwise State-approved public school, private school, or supplemental                educational services program they attend)
