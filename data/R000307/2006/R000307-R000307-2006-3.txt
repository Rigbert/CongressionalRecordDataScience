President, today I honor Salvatore Ferro's 40 years ofdedicated service at the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA. ``Sal,'' who has worked for all 16 Directors of the DIA, will be retiring on January 3, 2007. He will be sorely missed by the Select Committee on Intelligence.  Sal has had a long and distinguished Government career. Sal served with honor in the Army in the Vietnam War, working as an intelligence officer with the ``Phoenix'' program. After his discharge from the Army in 1969, Sal joined DIA, just 8 years after its establishment as an agency and went right back to Vietnam for a 1-year tour as a civilian intelligence officer.  After finishing his service in Vietnam, Sal returned to the United States to work in DIA's Arlington Hall Station facility in northern Virginia. During the next decade, Mr. Ferro drew on his wartime experience and his analytical talents to work on issues related to American servicemen taken as prisoners of war or declared missing in action in Southeast Asia.  In 1991, Sal moved over to DIA's Office for Congressional Affairs in the Pentagon. This is when our committee really came to know Sal. He has been an invaluable asset to the members and staff of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. He has been tenacious in getting answers to our many questions and requests for information. He has taken pride in being responsive and making sure that DIA consistently met our deadlines. More important, his professionalism, diplomatic skills, and amazingly positive personality have smoothed over countless ripples in DIA's relations with Congress. Ask any Intelligence Committee staffer who has dealt with Sal over the years, an they will tell you that he is not only a pleasure to work with, he is also a good friend. You can always count on Sal for a kind word and a ``happy Friday.''  Sal has supported the Intelligence Committee's oversight work on countless topics. Some of the most significant and time-consuming include the 9/11 Joint Inquiry, the review of the intelligence community's prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq, and the Able Danger review. I will always be most grateful to Sal for his tireless support over the years in my efforts to resolve the status of Navy pilot CAPT Scott Speicher, who has been missing since the first gulf war.  Mr. Sal Ferro is a true national intelligence asset, and he has been one of the Defense Intelligence Agency's secret weapons. He will be missed.  Thank you for your service, Sal, and don't be a stranger.                          ____________________
