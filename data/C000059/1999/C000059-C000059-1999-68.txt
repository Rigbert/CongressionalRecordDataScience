Speaker, after rising yesterday to honor the passing of one of America's greatest space hero's, Pete Conrad, I happily return to the floor to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of man landing on the moon.  Last night, I memorialized one of the many heroes involved in the arduous task of sending man from Earth to the moon. Tonight, I would like to recognize all of the men and women that were responsible for one of the single greatest scientific and technological accomplishments in history, man walking on the moon.  President John F. Kennedy challenged the men and women in our nation's space program to accomplish a goal that most believed was unachievable. This goal was the singular focus of a small group of American leaders in space for nearly a decade, a small group that would eventually become international heroes. Heroes, not because they simply went to the moon, but because they set out an impossible goal, dared to dream when they were on the short end of logic, inspired a nation and the world. These men and women worked feverishly for nearly a decade and committed their lives to the program. Some men even gave the ultimate sacrifice and lost their lives chasing this goal.  To every child in America, I hope that you will take the time to learn of the thrilling story of the men and women involved in Apollo 11's ultimate success. It is a story about working to achieve success against long odds. I am proud to have been alive during this great accomplishment and to know the story behind the men and women who dedicated their lives to ensuring the dream of all mankind was achieved.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to give one last salute to Captain Pete Conrad and congratulate all of the men and women who helped our nation and perservere against impossible odds, and land a man on the moon.                          ____________________
