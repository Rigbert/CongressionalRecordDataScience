President, as you know, natural disasters exact a tremendous toll on our nation. In just two decades (1975-1994), 24,000 individuals nationwide lost their lives to natural disasters. An additional 100,000 were injured, and the resulting property damage reached a staggering $500 billion.  Hurricanes are responsible for 80 percent of these $500 billion in damages. The continued rapid building of homes and commercial facilities along our coastlines increases the potential for even higher natural disaster costs in the future. Since Congress often responds to these disasters with emergency supplemental appropriations, it makes sense to also support the development of technologies and building techniques to mitigate damage resulting from hurricanes and other natural disasters.
