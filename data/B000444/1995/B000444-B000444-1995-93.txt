 President, I rise to point out that the most important change in the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill just happened in the most quiet of ways. The Senate has just restored the funding for next year's installment of the 100,000 COPS Program. This important program has already funded 25,891 State and local police officers devoted to community policing. This bill now continues the 100,000 COPS Program.  The program is continued due to the addition of an amendment I offered that eliminated the law enforcement block grant and restored the 100,000 COPS Program. I am gratified that the amendment offered by Senator Hollings and myself has been adopted by the Senate.
