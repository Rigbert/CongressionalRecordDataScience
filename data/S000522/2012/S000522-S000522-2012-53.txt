In conclusion, tomorrow night, the President will call for a return to American values in his State of the Union message.  Mr. President, the violent destruction of the child in the womb, of the killing of babies and of the wounding of their moms is not an American value.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
