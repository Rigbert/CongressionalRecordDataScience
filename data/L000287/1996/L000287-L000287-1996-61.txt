Mr. Speaker, let me say that, first, we are about appropriating funds that are available under the lids that dramatically impact all of these agencies, VA, HUD, EPA, et cetera. Within that limitation, we are attempting to produce as much money as possible and can be meaningful insofar as the Superfund is concerned.  I remind the gentleman that the other party controlled the House and both Houses during the last Congress. They controlled this House for 40 years. They controlled the House since the Superfund was created. Everybody has known that the program has not worked almost from the beginning. It seems to me it is long past due that a bill was passed and sent to the President that changed this.  Indeed, they produced a bill last year that supposedly was going to work. For some reason, the director, Ms. Browner, has not chosen to take that bill up and send it up here and said, yes, this is the answer.  There is no doubt this is a complicated process. There has to be a reauthorization, hopefully to make this process make sense. There has to be appropriations. That is our job. There also has to be ways and means work that reexercises the tax in order to provide the fund in the first place. So it is a complex issue. We have to get on with it, indeed, instead of pointing fingers at other Members.
