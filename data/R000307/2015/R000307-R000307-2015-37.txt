This was a senseless act of violence. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, and all affected by this horrible tragedy.  I know we all hope the perpetrator is swiftly brought to justice. I pray for the safety of the entire Charleston community. This was an act of senseless violence, to be sure. But as I understand it, the perpetrator saved one woman and told her: ``I want you to tell everyone what happened here.'' That is beyond sinister. That is evil. That evil must be stopped and must be dealt with.                               ObamaCare  What I would like to talk about now is the Supreme Court's critical ruling on the most recent review of the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare. It is important to highlight many of the ways this law is negatively impacting our health care system as a whole, my constituents in Kansas, the Presiding Officer's constituents in her neighboring State of Nebraska--all over the country.  Trying to list all of the problems with this law is nearly impossible. Perhaps the best way is to review the promises of the President of the United States. The crafting of this law was supposed to follow his promise of being the most transparent administration inhistory. The problem is that there has been a lack of transparency--not to mention the oversight of this law since it was originally being crafted and throughout its implementation.  Despite hearing the contrary from our docs and nurses about practices and hospitals closing and premiums and copays increasing, the administration continues to turn a blind eye. The administration continually moves the goal posts to which they measure success and have claimed victory.  In 2012, the Congressional Budget Office projected there would be 14 million people enrolled in exchange plans this year. Then late last year, the administration back-pedaled on its projections for the second year of enrollment, moving the goal posts. The most recent data out of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the infamous CMS, shows that when you look at how many individuals had effectual coverage or actually paid their first month's premium and continued to have an active policy, that number is 10 million. Madam President, that is nearly 30 percent below the 2012 enrollment projections--30 percent. That is not transparency. That is not victory.  So why is this number lower? Why aren't folks signing up? First, we had a Web site that crashed and that didn't work. Then Americans tried to shop around and view the policies available to them. But as it turns out, the law didn't lower premiums for the average family by $2,500--remember that promise--as the President promised. This didn't happen. Premiums are increasing.  The President also promised you could keep your same health care plan and your doctor. We have known for some time that is just not true. It didn't happen.  Yet just last week the President responded to questions regarding his signature law--his legacy law, if you will--at a press conference following the G-7 summit. He said: ``The thing is working.'' Now, one might add that the ``thing'' is a pretty good term for the Affordable Care Act.  The President also said: ``I mean, part of what's bizarre about this whole thing is we haven't had a lot of conversation about the horrors of ObamaCare because none of them have really come to pass.''  Really?  President Obama concluded: ``It hasn't had an adverse effect on people who already had health insurance.''  Well, I am not sure what data has been presented to the President or which American family he has been listening to, but it is certainly not the reality that I have experienced and that Kansans are experiencing. The real-life threats of this law we hear from Kansans back home have not stopped. They are increasing.  A small business owner in Cummings, KS, called my office to inform me his premium this year went up over $500 a month--more than double last year's.  Eddy, in Spring Hill, says his premium has doubled and his deductible has doubled. He is being forced to choose between running his company and buying health insurance. He says he can't do both.  Let's go back to the President's comments about this ``thing'' having no adverse effect. Just a couple of weeks ago his own administration published the proposed double-digit--double-digit--premium increases for 2016--next year. The plans on the list affect more than 6 million people across the country and are seeking an average increase of 21 percent.  The Kansas Insurance Department tells us that premiums for some individual and small group health care plans are likely to increase by as much as 38 percent.  According to the administration's list, 14 insurance plans are seeking premium increases above 10 percent for next year. That covers 100,000 Kansans. When you look at just two insurance plans, those two insurance plans have increases of 28 and 38 percent. Perhaps the President does not categorize these 100,000 Kansans as being adversely affected by this ``thing.''  Simply put, premiums will continue to spiral upward if we do not act. Facts and reality are really very stubborn things. Even ObamaCare's chief architect, Jonathan Gruber--we all remember Jonathan Gruber--was quoted last year as saying if ``you made it explicit that healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed. Lack of transparency is a huge political advantage.'' So said Mr. Gruber.  Still quoting Mr. Gruber: ``And basically, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that really was really, really critical for the thing to pass.'' That is his quote.  Those comments belittle the American people and try to rationalize why, when you have an agenda, the government should not be transparent. The President and proponents of ObamaCare all said publicly this was the first step to nationalized health insurance. That certainly has become transparent.  Now, not only are individuals adversely affected in terms of their own insurance coverage, but also due to the law's mandate on employers, many are seeing the law's negative repercussions at their jobs. The law's employer mandate hinders job creation and growth. Its new definition of full-time employment at 30 hours a week has been a real problem. According to one estimate, 2.6 million workers--2.6 million workers--could potentially have their hours and therefore their paychecks reduced as a result of this provision.  Most concerning is that this new definition of full-time employment hits low-wage earners who work in the service industries. Of the individuals at risk, about half work in retail and half in restaurants. If these folks were previously working the traditional 40 hours per week, you are not just taking 10 hours from them, but you are reducing their paycheck by 25 percent a week. That is why they work in two different jobs. That is a very noticeable adverse effect.  The concerns I have outlined today are only a few of the many reasons why we need to repeal this law, both the individual and employer mandates. We need to fix health care. Everybody knows that. But we don't need to fix ObamaCare. We need to give peace of mind to the families hurt by ObamaCare.  Now, no one is saying go back to the system we had before. We need reforms to our health care system every day. ObamaCare is costing millions of dollars. But with this law--what the President has called ``this thing''--we may have mandated greater coverage for all but not access to care and at a cost that is unaffordable. Let me repeat that. We may have mandated greater coverage for all--if that was the goal of my friends across the aisle--but not access to care and at a cost that is unaffordable. That is not a health care plan.  Perhaps some can afford the rising premiums, but can you actually go see your doctor and receive treatment or is your deductible too high? And is your doctor still available to you? Will your doctor spend at least 5 minutes with you--5 minutes with you--or more time filling out forms or electronic medical records? And are those records secure?  Any day now the Supreme Court will hand down its decision in King v. Burwell. This is the case that will determine the legality of the administration's regulation extending health insurance subsidies to people in States that use the Federal insurance exchange. And we will see--we will see--if the Court decides that the law should be implemented as written by this Congress--with all of us on this side of the aisle voting no--or implemented as interpreted by the administration.  This is similarly troubling for Kansas, where we have a federally facilitated exchange. If these tax subsidies go away, 77,000 Kansans and millions of Americans, will be affected. These individuals would be confronted with ObamaCare's true cost--true cost--and would face much higher premiums, with only the administration to blame for recklessly offering tens of billions of dollars in subsidies they had no authority to offer, if the Court rules that way.  A ruling against the administration would also free many of these Kansans from the individual mandate penalty if that coverage is too expensive for them and they, therefore, would qualify for an affordability exemption.  The employer mandate penalties would also be unenforceable. Employers can then add employees above the 50 threshold without fear of penalty and increase workers' hours to more than 30 hours per week.  If the Court invalidates the subsidies, we will be ready. We will be ready on this side of the aisle with our solutions to help mitigate the pain for those individuals harmed by the administration and provide States greater flexibility and build a bridge away from ObamaCare.  However the Court rules, I know that I and everybody on this side of the aisle will continue fighting to repeal this harmful law and replace it with true health care reforms that lower costs, lift the burden on our job creators, and restore the all-important relationship between a doctor and a patient.  The test to fix health care, not ObamaCare, is coming soon. Let's fix health care.  I yield the floor.                            Vote Explanation
