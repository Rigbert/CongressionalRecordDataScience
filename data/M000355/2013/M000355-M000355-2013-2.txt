 It is not the same body it was only a few years ago in the way we are being treated. It is a very discouraging development, as we approach the end of the year, to see the way the Senate deteriorated under the current leadership.  I thank the senior Senator from Utah for pointing out that it was not too long ago that the two parties actually functioned on issues such as the majority leader was trying to ram through today without any committee consideration.
