It is all Federal money. The Governor of Oklahoma can decline the money. They do not have to help the 78,000 unemployed workers in Oklahoma who would be benefited by this. They can exert their State rights. They would be fools to do it because they know these people need a helping hand in Iowa, in Oklahoma, and in Illinois.  I really am saddened to hear the stereotype that unemployed people are lazy. Could any of us live on $1,000 a month? That is what these people are struggling to get by with. To give them $25 a week is the breaking point for too many Senators. Way too much, $25 a week? This is not even nickels and dimes.  These are women trying to keep their families together. These are mothers and fathers down on their luck. And this Senate cannot spare $25 a week? That is what this vote is all about. I hope the Members of the Senate will support the people who want to get back to work but need a helping hand and support the Durbin amendment.
