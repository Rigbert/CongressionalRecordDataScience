President, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Dan ``Ohno'' Ohnesorge on the occasion of his retirement. In his 11 years as the Enid Woodring airport director, Dan has been a fixture in the Oklahoma aviation community, even serving as president of the Oklahoma Airport Operators Association for the 2012-13 term. In recognition of his passionate service to the Woodring Airport, Dan was awarded the Oklahoma Airport Manager of the Year in 2016, the same year that Enid Woodring Regional Airport was recognized as the Oklahoma Airport of the Year by the Oklahoma Airport Operators Association.  Dan has been a passionate advocate for aviation since 1975. After graduating from Florida State University with a BS in meteorology, he earned a masters of aero science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In his time in the U.S. Air Force, he flew F-16s with the 307th Fighter Squadron, and his dedication to serving the country has continued to the present.  In his time as president of the Oklahoma Air Force Association, Dan has worked tirelessly to ensure the men and women training to become pilots at Vance Air Force Base are able to augment their training by using the runway at Woodring Airport. He was instrumental in the decision to locate a memorial honoring the men and women who gave their lives in service to their country during the Vietnam war at the Woodring Airport. It is a testament to his vision for this memorial that Oklahomans from across the State regularly visit this memorial.  Under his leadership, Enid Woodring Regional Airport expanded the main runway which enhanced the safety and capability of Vance Air Force Base's pilot training program and built a new terminal building which will more efficiently serve the general aviation and military pilots and other users of the growing airport.  I am thankful that I have gotten to know Dan through his passion for aviation and his commitment to the men and women who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. I know that I join his family, the Enid Woodring Regional Airport, Vance Air Force Base, and the city of Enid in thanking Dan for his years of service and contributions to the aviation community.  Congratulations on your retirement.                          ____________________
