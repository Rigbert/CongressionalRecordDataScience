President, it is a pleasure to point out that we are completing another brisk ski season at one of Vermont's fabled slopes, Mount Snow. This year marks the 60th anniversary of winter sports at Mount Snow, and while the temperatures dropped well below zero for many weeks, outdoor enthusiasts of Vermont and from far beyond have descended on Dover, VT, to embrace Mother Nature's challenge, and they have enthusiastically embraced the joys and challenges of our gorgeous mountainous terrain.  Mount Snow was born in the 1950s as Alpine skiing solidified itself as a popular American sport. It has been a vital contributor to the economies of Vermont and New England ever since. Since its birth as one of Vermont's go-to ski slopes, Mount Snow has been an innovator and a pioneer, staying ahead of the industry and adding features to the resort that are now commonplace at ski areas throughout our country and the world.  As Mount Snow enters a new phase in its development, its future will include state-of-the-art advancements with a new ski lodge to meet skier needs and an expanded snowmaking infrastructure to ensure snowmaking is available across the mountain. As the closest mountain to Boston and New York City, these improvements will only encourage more people to choose Vermont as their primary destination for skiing and riding.  I want to congratulate the entire team at Mount Snow for 60 years of great and vibrant winter activity, and I look forward to all they have planned for the future. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Manchester Journal sketching Mount Snow's history and planned growth be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Manchester Journal, Nov. 22, 2014]-                 Mount Snow To Make Major Improvements                         (By Brandon Canevari)       Dover.--Mount Snow--which is celebrating it's 60th      anniversary this year--is about to undergo some significant      changes.       The resort has had a master plan in place for a while now,      which is now in motion.       ``We're seeking financing for a couple of major capital      projects,'' said Mount Snow Communications Director Dave      Meeker. ``Thus far it's been very successful and we're well      on our way to reaching our goal. It's a total investment of      about $52 million dollars.''       One of the two major projects that resort is looking to      begin is the construction of a 20 million gallon snowmaking      water reservoir called West Lake.       ``That is really going to be the biggest step towards our      goal of having 100 percent snowmaking coverage on the      mountain,'' said Meeker.       Once they begin the project, Meeker said that it will      probably take about two years to complete.       ``It will take a couple years to get it completed because      it's not just excavating the pond. It's installing the new      pipes, installing the new facilities to push the water to the      mountain,'' said Meeker. ``There are just a lot of other      components that go along with constructing a reservoir that      size and with all the machinery and stuff that goes along      with it.''       The other components to the project are installing      snowmaking pipes, pump houses, booster houses and the other      components that are needed for snowmaking.       The other major component to the first phase of the plan is      the construction of a 36,000 square foot base lodge at      Carinthia Parks at Mount Snow.       ``It'll have skier services, food and beverage, retail, all      sorts of stuff. So, it will be a great improvement over to      the base area at Carinthia,'' said Meeker.       Depending on how financing goes, Meeker said that the      resort could break ground on West Lake as early as next      summer. When they will be able to build the base lodge and      make some of the other improvements that they are planning      though is still uncertain.       ``The timeline really depends on financing,'' said Meeker.      ``Our planning director, they've been globe-trotting      basically, going out and seeking investors and we've been      very successful so far. So . . . if we had all of the      investors today we'd be making plans to break ground as soon      as possible. So, it really hinges upon when we are able to      get enough investors to secure the financing to begin these      projects.''       The mountain installed 645 new low-energy snowmaking guns      this year as part of their master plan as well.       ``That would have been a big component to the improvements      that we would be making in future after building West Lake,      but we had the opportunity to take advantage of a program      that was offered by Efficiency Vermont this year to upgrade      our snowmaking system to all low-energy guns,''     said Meeker. ``A lot of other resorts took advantage of it,      but we took full advantage of it. It was the largest single      snowgun update of any resort in Vermont's history and that      was a big step in the right direction for our snowmaking      system to run as efficiently as possible and also make the      best product possible.''                              Anniversary       Mount Snow's 60th Anniversary is right around the corner      and Meeker said that a weekend of festivities have been      planned in celebration.       The celebration is going to be on Friday, Dec. 12, which is      known as ``Founder's Day.'' The date is the first day Mount      Snow opened back in 1954, Meeker said.       ``Since it's on a Friday and it is our 60th we're going to      celebrate all weekend long. So, we're going to have stuff      going on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Saturday we're going to      have a party at the Snow Barn with Orange Crush, which is an      80s band, so we're going to have a throwback party. We're      already encouraging people to wear retro gear all weekend      long; whatever time period in which they have some clothes      from the past.''       Part of what the resort will be doing to celebrate is      offering $12 lift tickets when the tickets are purchased in      advance online. The resort is also going to have a big      historical display of Mount Snow memorabilia.       There are also going to be parties at Cousins and the Main      Base Lodge.       On Sunday of that weekend, Meeker said they are also      probably going to have an ``old school'' bamboo gate series.       ``Back in the day when people would run gates they would be      made of bamboo and so we're going to set some of those up.      We're going to have a straight ski category,'' said Meeker.      ``It's just going to be a real focusing on our history.''       While the Dec. 12 weekend is going to be the big      celebration of the resort's 60th Anniversary, Meeker said      that they will be celebrating throughout the winter with some      other events as well.       ``We love to celebrate things here at Mount Snow,'' said      Meeker. ``It's one of the things that we do so hopefully      folks will come out and help us celebrate because it's not      just about our history this season, it's about our future and      we have a lot of great stuff to talk about with that.''                          ____________________
