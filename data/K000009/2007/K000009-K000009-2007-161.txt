The Toledo Symphony will formally recognize his remarkable achievement on May 22, 2007.  Robert Bell joined the Toledo Symphony in 1956. In his five decades with the symphony he has performed as a percussionist, principal timpanist and teacher. He has been the orchestra's personnel manger, managing director, and in his last decade has been President and Chief Executive Officer of the Toledo Orchestra Association since 1997. The hallmark of his tenure is the design and development of a ``music organization characterized by shared ownership.'' The Andrew F. Mellon Foundation described our symphony in 2005 as ``a remarkable organization that is approaching its evolution with a deep understanding of the community in which it operates . . . the Toledo Symphony is embedded in its community like no other American orchestra.'' Robert Bell's innovations and creative style can be credited for this high praise.  Partnerships Mr. Bell pursued with not only the Mellon Foundation, but also with the Stranahan Foundation and the Owens-Illinois Charitable Foundation have brought a financial stability to the symphony which now operates with a six million dollar budget. At the same time, Mr. Bell's efforts have led to a fourteen million dollar endowment fund which continues to grow. Its financial footing has enabled the symphony to draw talented musicians worldwide for its 60 positions and additional guest artists.  At his heart both musician and teacher, the Musicians in Action initiative was developed under Mr. Bell's tutelage. Through it, the symphony presents concerts especially for young people at 300 schools throughout the region. Annually, about 100,000 children benefit. The Community Music Lessons program offers group music lessons for underserved and needy students, fostering a talent these youngsters may have no other opportunity to develop. Music in Our Schools matches professional musicians with high school musicians for one-on-one coaching, rehearsals, and performances.  It has been said that without art civilization is lost. Robert Bell has dedicated his life to taking our civilization to new heights, helping us reach our potential individually and in community. His gift has been a soaring spirit of music and his legacy will be a symphony performing for decades beyond his own half century of service. For his time and talent, passion and inspiration, we are most grateful. I know I join with our entire community in offering congratulations to Robert Bell on his fiftieth anniversary season.                          ____________________
