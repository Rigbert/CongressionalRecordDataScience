 There are some technical amendments which I can read. But the one that deals right now with the situation that my colleague is referring to, smokeless or black powder would be as follows.       At the end of subsection (c)(1) insert the following:       For purposes of this subsection, explosive material does      not include smokeless or black powder manufactured for uses      set forth in section 845(a)(4)(5) of this chapter.  Which is ``Small Arms Ammunition and Components Thereof.'' That is the exception, just for small arms ammunition and components thereof.
