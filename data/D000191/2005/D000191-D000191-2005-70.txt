  Mr. DeFAZIO. Well, we have the newfound foe, fiscal conservatives on that side of the aisle. They control everything, the House, the White House, the Senate. They have increased the debt of the United States 62 percent in the last 5 years to $8 trillion, and now they want to cut spending.  Now, what spending are they targeting? Is it the big wasteful spending? No. It is duplicative programs like school lunch and breakfast. I guess those kids are taking two meals. Or student loans. I guess those kids are taking a double load of classes and paying too much. So they will cut $50 billion, and the next week they are going to cut taxes for those who earn over $300,000 a year by $70 billion.  Now, in their world, even though that is a $20 billion increase in the real deficit, they say, no, that is not an increase in the deficit, because those rich people, why, they are just going to trickle down on the rest of America. They are going to put the rest of us to work, and they are going to increase productivity, and some day that will increase Federal revenues because working people pay taxes, not rich people, in their world. This is a bizarre turn of events here in Washington, D.C., and their cuts and their tax cuts should be rejected.                          ____________________[Page H9644]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                      REPUBLICAN BUDGET PRIORITIES  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
