Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the gentleman's resolution.  It seems inconceivable to me that we could be waiving Jackson-Vanik at a time when the Vietnamese Government is paying $100 a head for the return of the Montagnards who have been escaping. Dissidents, men and women who have been repressed by this government, are being returned from Cambodia back to this repressive regime. To waive this in the Pollyanna-ish view that somehow human rights are improving is inconceivable to me.  I would also point out to my colleagues that this body passed the Vietnam Human Rights Act, which I introduced, overwhelmingly last year, 410 to one. The Vietnamese Government has moved Heaven and Earth in the other body to put a hold on that legislation which simply looks for human rights improvements. They have not happened, I say to my colleagues. We need to step up to the plate and say, despite the expectations that might have been there, they have not been realized. Human rights continue to be trashed.  I again rise in strong support of the gentleman's resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letter for inclusion in the Congressional Record:Commission Asks Secretary Powell to Raise Religious Freedom Issues With                         Vietnam at ASEAN Meeting       Washington, July 23--The U.S. Commission on International      Religious Freedom, a federal agency advising the      Administration and Congress, last week wrote Secretary of      State Colin L. Powell, asking that he raise religious freedom      issues with Vietnamese officials during the ASEAN Regional      Forum at the end of this month. The text of the letter      follows:                                                    July 17, 2002.       Dear Secretary Powell: I am writing on behalf of the U.S.      Commission on International Religious Freedom, which urges      you to raise prominently the protection of religious freedom      in Vietnam during your upcoming participation at the ASEAN      Regional Forum in July 2002. We also urge you to impress your      Vietnamese officials that improvements in the protection of      religious freedom in Vietnam are critical to continuing      progress in U.S.-Vietnam relations.       Since the Congress ratified the U.S.-Vietnam Bilateral      Trade Agreement (BTA) in September 2001, the protection of      religious freedom in Vietnam continues to be minimal at best.      In February 2002, the Commission sent a delegation to visit      that country. Despite the increase in religious practice      continues its repressive policy toward all religious and      their followers in Vietnam.       Key Vietnamese religious dissidents remain under house      arrest or imprisoned, including two senior leaders of the      outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) ? Most      Venerable Thich Huyen Quang and Venerable Thich Quang Do ?      and a Hoa Buddhist leader, Mr. Le Quang Liem. Mr. Quang has      been denied access to much needed medical treatment. in      addition, Father Thaddeaus Nguyen Van Ly, who last year      submitted written testimony to the Commission, was sentenced      to 15 years in prison after having been convicted on charges      of ``undermining state unity'' and ``slandering the      government.'' During the Commission's visit,      Vietnamese officials refused the delegation's requests to      meet with these and other religious leaders who were      either in prison or under house arrest.       Government officials continue to harass leaders of      unregistered religious organizations and their followers,      particularly unregistered Protestant fellowships, as well as      clergy members of officially recognized religious groups who      oppose government interference in their activities. At the      same time, Vietnamese authorities have refused to register      some religious groups. For example, the Vietnamese government      has refused to register or permit any activity of Baha'i      adherents, whose membership in Vietnam before 1976 counted      close to 200,000. Meanwhile, provincial and local officials      continue to force Hmong Christians in northwestern Vietnam to      renounce their faith. Hmong Christian leaders have been      arrested and beaten, and their followers are not allowed to      meet in homes and conduct worship. Catholic bishops continue      to have limits imposed on them by the government regarding      the number of candidates who can be admitted to study for the      priesthood as well as the number of qualified men who are      allowed to be ordained to the priesthood.       Although the government recognized the Evangelical Church      of Vietnam in the South in April 2001, that recognition      apparently has not been extended to the Montagnards who      reside in the Central Highlands. Government repression of      religious freedom for Monagnard Christians, coupled with an      ongoing land dispute between the Montagnards and the      government, led to unrest and government crackdown in      February 2001 that ultimately resulted in the flight to      Cambodia of over 1,000 Montagnards. Nonetheless, it appears      that the Vietnamese government continues to violate the right      to religious freedom of Montagnard Christians in the Central      Highlands through arrests and the closing of churches.       In light of these conditions, the Commission urges you to      raise these issues in substantive discussions with Vietnamese      officials during your attendance at the ASEAN Regional Forum.      In particular, we hope you will inquire about the confinement      of Mr. Quang, Mr. Do, and Mr. Liem, and the imprisonment of      Fr. Ly.       Furthermore, we wish to draw your attention to the      following recommendations, first set out in our 2001 Annual      Report. We urge you to press the Vietnamese government to      take the following steps:       (1) Release from imprisonment, detention, house arrest, or      intimidating surveillance persons who are so restricted due      to their religious identities or activities.       (2) Permit full access to religious leaders by U.S.      diplomatic personnel and government officials, the U.S.      Commission on International Religious Freedom, and      international human rights organizations. The government      should also invite a return visit by the UN Special      Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion.       (3) Establish the freedom to engage in religious activities      (including the freedom for members of religious groups to      select their own leaders, worship publicly, express and      advocate religious beliefs, and distribute religious      literature) outside state-controlled religious organizations      and eliminate controls on the activities of officially      registered organizations. Allow indigenous religious      communities to conduct educational, charitable, and      humanitarian activities, in accordance with the UN      Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance      and Discrimination.       (4) Permit religious groups to gather for observance of      religious holidays.       (5) Return confiscated religious properties.       (6) Permit domestic Vietnamese religious organizations and      individuals to interact with foreign organizations and      individuals.       (7) Permit domestic Vietnamese religious and other non-     governmental organizations to distribute their own and      donated aid.       (8) Support exchanges between Vietnamese religious      communities and U.S. religious and other non-governmental      organizations concerned with religious freedom in Vietnam.       In its May 2001 report, the Commission also recommended      that the U.S. government continue to support the ASEAN Human     Rights Working Group, and that it should encourage the      Vietnamese government to join the working group by      establishing a national working group. The Commission urges      you to take this opportunity to engage officials of the ASEAN      working group in serious discussions about the promotion of      human rights, including religious freedom, among ASEAN member      states. Moreover, we urge you to impress upon Vietnamese      officials that the establishment of a national working group      by their government would be an important sign of Vietnam's      commitment to protecting religious freedom and other human      rights.       Thank you for your consideration of the Commission's      recommendations. We would be grateful if you would share with      us the findings and achievements of your visit upon your      return.           Respectfully,                                                      Felice Gaer,                                                            Chair.
