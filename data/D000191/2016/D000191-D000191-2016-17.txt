Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not in opposition.  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to congratulation the gentleman for shining a spotlight on this. This is something that is critical to his district and region, and it was authorized in WRDA in 1988. It is past time that this received positive consideration and moved forward, and I think his amendment will help in that effort with that. I urge Members to support the amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
