President, we are fast approaching the end of this Congress and we have much unfinished business. While there are many items of importance to the American people that remain undone, I will speak today about a single bill that has been languishing for some time despite the fact that it is wholly uncontroversial. That bill is S. 671, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.  This bill is important to American businesses, both big and small. As the International Trademark Association explained in a letter to me on February 9, 2000 on behalf of its 3,700 member companies and law firms, ``the practical benefits of the Madrid system, such as ease of applying and renewing trademark registrations internationally, will be of tremendous benefit to U.S. companies'' and, in particular, the benefits to ``small, entrepreneurial companies which do not have the financial means to seek separate national registrations for their trademarks in every country where they wish to do business.'' The bill and the Protocol are also supported by the American Intellectual Property Law Association and the Information Technology Association of America.  I first introduced this legislation in the 105th Congress as S. 2191 and again in this Congress in March, 1999. The Judiciary Committee reported S. 671, favorably and unanimously, on February 10, 2000. Unfortunately, the legislation has been languishing on the Senate calendar for the past eight months. In the House of Representatives, Congressmen Coble and Berman sponsored and passed an identical bill, H.R. 769, on April 13, 1999. This marked the third time and the third Congress in which the House of Representatives had passed this bill.  There is no opposition to S. 671, nor to the substantive portions of the underlying Protocol. The White House recently forwarded the Protocol to the Senate for its advise and consent after working to resolve differences between the Administration and the European Community, EC, regarding the voting rights of intergovernmental members of the Protocol in the Assembly established by the agreement. These differences over the voting rights of the European Union and participation of intergovernmental organizations in this intellectual property treaty are now resolved in accordance with the U.S. position. Specifically, on February 2, 2000, the Assembly of the Madrid Protocol expressed its intent ``to use their voting rights in such a way as to ensure that the number of votes castby the European Community and its member States does not exceed the number of the European Community's Member States.''  Shortly after this letter was forwarded by the Assembly, I wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright requesting information on the Administration's position in light of the resolution of the voting dispute. At a hearing of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee on April 14, 2000, I further inquired of Secretary Albright about the progress the Administration was making on this matter.  With the voting rights issue resolved, President Clinton transmitted Treaty Document 106-41, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement to the Senate for ratification on September 5, 2000. United States membership in the Protocol would greatly enhance the ability of any U.S. business, whether large and small, to protect its trademarks in other countries more quickly, cheaply and easily. That, in turn, will make it easier for American businesses to enter foreign markets and to protect their trademarks in those markets.  Senators Helms and Biden moved promptly to hold a hearing in the Foreign Relations Committee on September 13, 2000 to consider the Protocol, and I commend them for acting quickly so this treaty may be considered by the full Senate before we adjourn. Members on both sides of the aisle have worked together successfully and productively in the past on intellectual property matters, and I am pleased to see these efforts again with the Protocol and implementing legislation.  Passage of S. 671 would help to ensure timely accession to and implementation of the Madrid Protocol, and it will send a clear signal to the international community, U.S. businesses, and trademark owners that Congress is serious about our Nation becoming part of a low-cost, efficient system to promote the international registration of marks.  The Madrid Protocol Implementation Act is part of my ongoing effort to update American intellectual property law to ensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests both here and abroad. The Protocol would help American businesses, and especially small and medium-sized companies, protect their trademarks as they expand into international markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform American trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol in anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty. Ratification by the United States of this treaty would help create a ``one stop'' international trademark registration process, which would be an enormous benefit for American businesses.  S. 671 makes no substantive change in American trademark law but sets up new procedures for trademark applicants who want to obtain international trademark protection. This bill would ease the trademark registration burden on small and medium-sized businesses by enabling businesses to obtain trademark protection in all signatory countries with a single trademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office. Currently, in order for American companies to protect their trademarks abroad, they must register their trademarks in each and every country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple countries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a process which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American companies seeking international trademark protection. The practical benefits of the Madrid Protocol system will be to provide small and medium-sized U.S. businesses with faster, cheaper and easier protection for their trademarks.  I again urge the Senate to promptly consider and send to the President the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act.                          ____________________
