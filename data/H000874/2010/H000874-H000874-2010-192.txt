Go Terps! And they did. I'm a graduate of the University of Maryland. Like so many others, I am very proud of my alma mater. I went there many, many years ago. I have owned a number of homes throughout my life, but one of them was three doors from Gary Williams. I've known Gary Williams for all the time he's been at the University of Maryland, which is now over 20 years. Gary Williams is an extraordinary individual, an extraordinary coach, and hashad great success at every school he's coached at throughout this country. He's been at Maryland for, as I said, over two decades. He's the most winning coach in Maryland history. Lefty Driesell was his predecessor--not immediate predecessor, but in terms of holding that record. Lefty did a great job at the University of Maryland.                              {time}  1800  Maryland was picked very low in the ACC standings at the beginning of this season. The expectations were not high. The University of Maryland team had a freshman strong forward. So it was perceived that inside, they wouldn't have the kind of game they needed to compete in a conference like the Atlantic Coast Conference, which we, of course, in the ACC believe is the best conference in the United States, although I want to observe, it may not have been the best conference this year in the United States; but over the years, it certainly has been. But there were some very strong conferences. Not to forget to mention the Big East, it is pretty strong itself. But in any event, we weren't picked very high.  The reason Gary Williams has been chosen appropriately for the honor of being Coach of the Year in the ACC, which has some extraordinary coaches, like Coach Krzyzewski, Coach Roy Williams at the University of North Carolina, and other great coaches, is because he took a team that did not have high expectations from the public and took it to a tie with Duke, one of the great teams in this country, to lead the ACC. They both finished 13-3, I believe, in the ACC.  Wake Forest, a great team as well. I want to thank the gentlelady from Maryland, Donna Edwards, who shares Prince George's County in which University of Maryland College Park is located, for her gracious congratulations. She gives me a hard time. Wake beat us this year, and I don't know whether we'll meet again this year, probably not. But notwithstanding that, I appreciate her gracious support of this resolution.  I want to tell you that we have a young player. He is a senior. His name is Greivis Vasquez. Greivis Vasquez is a real personality on the court. Greivis Vasquez was the high scorer, picked as Player of the Year in the ACC, and was an extraordinary leader of our team on the floor. He was the spark plug of our team.  And when our team was down and needed to get up, needed to be inspired, it was Greivis Vasquez who, along with some other extraordinary players--and we had nine or 10 players who could have started at some other teams, frankly, wonderful players. Some, Jordan Williams, our new freshman who is going to be an extraordinary sophomore, and hopefully we may even keep him until his junior year.  But that is why we prevailed in the ACC. That's why we're going to prevail in the NCAA. We play Houston, as you've heard. I'm sure I will talk to the Representatives from the Houston area about this game, coming up Friday at 9:50 p.m. We will focus on that game, and we'll talk to you a little bit about what you think and what we think. But it's going to be an excellent year.  But notwithstanding that, I was in Atlanta when the University of Maryland won the national championship. We played Indiana that year. I want to personally congratulate my friend Gary Williams on the great coaching job he did this year. I want to congratulate the entire team for the great job they did, and I want to wish them the very best of luck in the NCAA tournament.  I thank the gentlelady, and I thank the gentleman for bringing this resolution to the floor to appropriately recognize a great year for a great team, a great coach and a great ACC player of the year.
