President, today Senator Craig and I are introducing a bill that will help protect the global climate system by improving local natural resource management and strengthening the economy in rural communities. The Forest Resources for the Environment and the Economy Act of 1999 will expand the nation's forested lands and provide effective tools for including forests in our national efforts to fight global warming. The bill focuses on forests because they are the lungs of our planet. Investing in healthy forests is an investment in the health of our environment today and the well-being of our planet for decades to come.  In the Pacific Northwest, forests are more than critical environmental resources--they are also a cornerstone of our economy. In debates about forest policies, there are those who have advocated an exclusively environmental pathway, and others who have stressed an exclusively economic pathway. This bill is part of what I believe is a third pathway through the woods--a path to both stronger rural economies and healthier forests. It will reduce the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and help protect our global climate for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. It will provide improved wildlife and fish habitats and protect our waterways. It will enhance our national forests by reducing water pollution within their watersheds. It will provide jobs in the forestry sector in areas that have been hard hit by declining timber harvests. And it will grow additional timber resources on underproductive private lands.  The legislation does all of this through an entirely voluntary, incentive-based approach. The bill makes new resources available to private landowners through state-operated revolving loan programs that provide assistance for tree planting and other forest management actions. By quantifying forests' contribution to climate protection, the bill puts the free market to work at turning the initial Federal investment into a long-term source of non-federal funding for forestry projects. And the bill takes an important first step toward reducing greenhouse gases on Federal lands by directing the Forest Service to report to Congress on options to increase carbon storage in our national forests.  I am deeply concerned about the risks that we are taking with our unprecedented experiment with the global climate system. Global climate change may jeopardize critical forest and other natural resources that are closely tied with Oregon's economy and our citizens' quality of life. Water managers in the Northwest may be faced with daunting challenges if the predicted climate changes, such as drier, hotter summers, complicate protection and management of water supplies. Over the last Century, the average temperature in Corvallis, Oregon has increased 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and average temperatures across Oregon could increase by 5 degrees or more over the next century, putting the elderly in Oregon especially at risk from more intense heat waves. And sea level rise resulting from global warming could eliminate the salt marshes along Tillamook and Coos Bay regions. Given these potential hazards of global warming, the challenge is to find strategies to protect our quality of life that won't cause an economic meltdown.  One of the key strategies for meeting this challenge is something this planet has been doing for more than 300 million years--growing abundant and healthy forests. Forests are a critical part of our global climate system. The total amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere depends in part on the efficiency of forests and other natural ``sinks'' that absorb carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse gas--from the atmosphere. In fact, the world's forests contain 200 times as much carbon as is emitted to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels. The implications are as simple as they are scientifically sound--if we grow more trees, bigger trees, and healthier trees, we will remove more greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and help protect the global climate. According to the Pacific Forest Trust, our forest lands in the United States are only storing one-quarter of the carbon they can ultimately store. Just tapping a portion of this potential by expanding and increasing the productivity of the nation's 737 million acres of forests is an important part of a win-win strategy to slow global warming.  And here's the good news--an ounce of investment in our forests is worth not only a pound of global warming cure, but also two pounds of jobs and three pounds of protection for our waterways and wildlife. The bill that I am introducing today will not only protect our global environment, but also willprovide immediate dividends in terms of watershed and habitat protection. It will provide jobs today for tree planting and forest management, and jobs tomorrow in carbon accounting and monitoring to ensure that greenhouse gas reductions are real and verifiable.  I recognize that global warming is a large problem that cannot be solved by forestry actions alone. We need a portfolio of approaches, and I continue to strongly support research, development and deployment of energy efficient and renewable technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But increasing our nation's forest lands is a key part of the solution and something we can do immediately. Forests may not be a silver bullet that will solve the entire global warming problem, but they are a silver lining to the problem that can provide jobs around the country while taking a big step to reverse the buildup of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.  It is sometimes hard to believe that seven years ago Senators from both parties proclaimed their universal support for taking action to protect the climate system and reducing the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. When the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was ratified by the Senate, Senators from both parties came to the floor to applaud this commitment to begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot afford to let the current debates about international treaties paralyze this Congress into inaction when there are opportunities here at home to protect our environment in ways that also provide jobs and economic growth.  Forests are one of those opportunities. This bill will take the money that polluters pay when they are caught violating the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act and use it to expand our forests, protect streams and rivers and help remove greenhouse gases from the air. In fiscal year 1998, $45 million of these environmental penalties were assessed against polluters. There are currently no guarantees that these penalties, which revert to the General Fund, are used to improve our environment. This bill would make this money available as loans to small and medium landowners to cover the upfront costs of tree planting and other projects that grow healthy, productive forests and provide better wildlife habitats.  This bill is supported by the National Association of State Foresters and the Society of American Foresters. It responds to recent recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences by providing assistance to overcome the capital constraints that prevent non-industrial, private forest land owners from growing healthy forests. Almost 10 million landowners in the United States own 42 percent of non-industrial, private forest land in parcels of less than 100 acres. Access to these low-interest loans can empower these landowners to improve their lands while providing global environmental protection.  Under the bill, State Foresters will be able to give loans for forest projects that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere while improving habitats and protecting waterways. For example, loans will be available for planting trees as buffer zones along salmon streams and rivers in areas that are currently being used by livestock or for crop production. Loans will be available to turn thin and poorly stocked forest lands into healthier and more productive lands that remove greater amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and provide additional timber resources on private lands. And loans will be available to grow trees for use in bioenergy facilities that can provide energy without increasing the greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.  These loans must be repaid with interest--money that will be reinvested in additional loans to double and triple the impact of every federal dollar over time. Loans may not be provided for reforestation activities already required under any state or local laws. And the bill ensures that people aren't paid to cut their existing trees in order to receive funding for replanting afterwards.  A critical element of the bill is that it harnesses the power of the free market to allow responsible businesses to invest in the nation's forests. Across the nation, companies are voluntarily seeking ways to reduce greenhouse gases. Some companies are going as far as sending money oversees to protect forests in other countries. Forests in Brazil are important, but forests in Bend, Oregon, can do just as good a job at fighting off global warming. In fact, our Northwest forests are some of the best carbon ``sinks'' in the world. This bill provides a way for companies to invest in American forests and know with accuracy the amount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere due to their investments. Once businesses recognize that the nation's forests are an opportunity for environmental investment, their entrepreneurial ingenuity will generate new opportunities for consumers and other businesses to tap into this win-win opportunity.  We know that this approach works because of the leadership of my home State of Oregon. The loan program is modeled after the innovative Forest Resource Trust, which was established in Oregon in 1993, and is just one of the many ways Oregon continues to lead the nation in state actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am pleased to say that PacifiCorp announced last month that it is contributing $1.5 million to the Forest Resource Trust to support tree planting and reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leadership by PacifiCorp will create forestry jobs in Oregon, protect salmon and fish habitat, create new wildlife habitats, and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. I am introducing this bill to make sure that we take advantage of these opportunities across the country and encourage more businesses to invest in the nation's forests.  In addition to establishing the state revolving loan programs, the bill makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to strengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of greenhouse gas reductions from forestry activities. The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to develop new guidelines on accurate and cost-effective methods to account for and report real and credible greenhouse gas reductions. These guidelines will be developed with the input of a new advisory board representing industry, foresters, states, and environmental groups.  This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. It's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable forestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for rural communities.  For these reasons, the bill is already supported by timber companies and environmental organizations alike. I have already received supportive letters from: American Forest and Paper Association, American Forests, Environmental Defense Fund, Governor John A. Kitzhaber of Oregon, National Association of State Foresters, PacifiCorp, Society of American Foresters, The Nature Conservancy, and The Pacific Forest Trust.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we pursue this common-sense good step toward protecting the environment and supporting our forest workers.  I ask unanimous consent that the Section-by-Section Analysis of the Forest Resources for the Environment and the Economy Act be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows: The Forest Resources For The Environment And The Economy Act--Section-                          by-Section Analysis                                SUMMARY       The purpose of the bill is to promote sustainable forestry      in the United States by increasing forest carbon      sequestration, improving forest health, enhancing wildlife      and fish habitats, improving water quality, providing      employment and income to rural communities, providing new      sources of forest products and increasing use of renewable      biomass energy that improves the energy security of the      United States. The bill achieves these purposes through four      major actions:       (1) State Revolving Loan Programs. The bill provides      assistance to nonindustrial private forest landowners and      Indian tribes to grow new forests and increase the      productivity of existing forests in order to increase carbon      sequestration, protect watersheds and fish habitats and      improve wildlife diversity. Assistance to landowners will be      provided through State-based loan     programs. The Federal share of funding for these State loan      programs will come from penalties that are being assessed      against violators of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water      Act (civil penalties assessed in FY 1998 totaled $45      million).       (2) Guidelines for Accurate Carbon Accounting for Forests.      The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish      scientifically-based guidelines for accurate reporting,      monitoring and verification of carbon storage from forest      management actions. The bill establishes a multi-stakeholder      Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council to assist USDA in      developing the guidelines.       (3) Report on Options to Increase Carbon Storage on Federal      Lands. The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to      report to Congress on forestry options to increase carbon      storage in National Forests.       (4) National Forest Watershed Restoration Cooperative      Agreements. The bill allows the Secretary of Agriculture to      enter into cooperative agreements with willing State and      local governments, Indian tribes, private and nonprofit      entities, and landowners for protection, restoration and      enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and other resources      on public land, Indian land or private land in a national      forest watershed.                         SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE       The title of the bill is the ``Forest Resources for the      Environment and the Economy Act''.                    SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES       This section states the purpose of the bill, which is to      promote sustainable forestry in the United States by      increasing forest carbon sequestration, improving forest      health, enhancing wildlife and fish habitats, improving water      quality, providing employment and income to rural      communities, providing new sources of forest products and      increasing use of renewable biomass energy that improves the      energy security of the United States.       This section also states the findings of the bill,      including:       The Federal Government should increase the forest carbon      storage on public land while pursuing existing statutory      objectives, but insufficient information exists on the      opportunities to increase carbon storage on public land      through improvements in forest land management;       Important environmental benefits to national forests can be      achieved through cooperative forest projects that enhance      fish and wildlife habitats, water and other resources on      public or private land located in national forest watersheds;       Forest projects also provide economic benefits, including      employment and income that contribute to the sustainability      of rural communities and future supplies of forest products;       Monitoring and verification of forest carbon storage      provides an important opportunity to create employment in      rural communities and substantiate improvements in natural      habitats or watersheds due to forestry activities; and       Sustainable production of biomass energy feedstocks      provides a renewable source of energy that can reduce carbon      dioxide emissions and improve the energy security of the      United States by diversifying energy fuels.                         SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS       This section defines terms used in the bill, including the      following:       ``Forestry carbon activity'' is defined as a forest      management action that increases long-term carbon storage and      has a positive impact on watersheds, fish habitats and      wildlife diversity.       ``Forest carbon reservoir'' is defined as trees, roots,      soils or other biomass associated with forest ecosystems or      products from the biomass that store carbon.       ``Forest carbon storage'' is defined as the quantity of      carbon sequestered from the atmosphere and stored in forest      carbon reservoirs, including forest products.       ``Forest land'' is defined as land that is, or has been, at      least 10 percent stocked by forest trees of any size,      including land that had such forest cover and that will be      naturally or artificially regenerated, and including a      transition zone between a forested and nonforested area that      is capable of sustaining forest cover.       ``Forest management action'' is defined as the practical      application of forestry principles to the regeneration,      management, utilization and conservation of forests to meet      specific goals and objectives, while maintaining the      productivity of the forests. ``Forest management action''      includes management of forests for aesthetics, fish,      recreation, urban values, water, wilderness, wildlife, wood      products and other forest values.       ``National forest watershed'' is defined as a watershed      that contains national forest land, that consequently has      unique interest to Federal land managers, and in which all      landowners, including the Federal Government, share interest      and influence in the management and health of the watershed.       ``Reforestation'' is defined as the reestablishment of      forest cover naturally or artificially, including planned      replanting, reseeding and managed natural regeneration.  section 4. carbon management on federal land; carbon monitoring and                         verification guidelines.       This section directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report      to Congress on carbon management on Federal land, and directs      the Secretary of Agriculture to develop guidelines for the      voluntary reporting, monitoring and verification of carbon      storage resulting from forest management actions. This      section is accomplished through amendment of Title XVI      (``Global Climate Change'') of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.       (a) Definitions. This subsection amends the Energy Policy      Act to add the definitions for ``forest carbon storage,''      ``carbon storage program,'' ``forest carbon reservoir,''      ``forest management action'' and ``sequestration'' that were      specified in Section 3.       (b) Carbon Management on Federal Land. This subsection      directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress      within one year on the quantity of carbon contained in the      forest carbon reservoir on Western national forests (i.e.,      ``national forests derived from the public domain''). The      report will include an assessment of forest management      actions that can increase carbon storage on these national      forest lands while providing positive impacts on watersheds      and fish and wildlife habitats. Finally, the report will      include an assessment of the role of forests in the carbon      cycle and the contributions of forestry to the global carbon      budget. This subsection is accomplished by amendment to      section 1604 of the Energy Policy Act (``Assessment of      Alternative Policy Mechanisms for Addressing Greenhouse Gas      Emissions'').       (c) Monitoring and Verification of Carbon Storage. This      subsection amends section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act      (``Voluntary Reporting'') by directing the Secretary of      Agriculture to review the existing Federal guidelines on      reporting, monitoring, and verification of carbon storage      from forest management actions. Within 18 months of enactment      and following an opportunity for public comment on the      existing guidelines, the Secretary of Agriculture will make      recommendations to the Secretary of Energy for amendment of      the guidelines.       Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council: This subsection also      directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an 18-     member, multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory      Council for the purpose of advising the Department of      Agriculture on: the development of the guidelines for      accurate voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas sequestration      from forest management actions; evaluating the potential      implementation of the guidelines; estimating the effect of      proposed implementation on atmospheric carbon mitigation;      reviewing and updating the guidelines; reporting to Congress      on the results of the carbon storage program established in      Section 5 of this bill; and assessing the vulnerability of      forests to climate change. The Advisory Council includes      experts on carbon sequestration representing Federal      agencies, the forestry industries, forestry workers and      professionals, States, environmental organizations and      landowners, as well as independent scientists. Terms of the      Advisory Council are staggered to ensure continuity from year      to year.       Criteria: The guidelines developed by the Secretary of      Agriculture must be based on: (1) measuring increases in      carbon storage in excess of that which would have occurred in      the absence of the forest management actions; and (2)      comprehensive carbon accounting that reflects net increases      in the carbon reservoir and takes into account any carbon      emissions resulting from disturbance of carbon reservoirs      existing at the start of forest management actions. The      guidelines must include options for estimating possible      leakage of carbon emissions to other lands, and for      quantifying the expected carbon storage over various time      periods, taking into account the likely duration of carbon      stored in the carbon reservoir.       Recommended practices: The guidelines must also include      recommended practices for monitoring, measurement and      verification of carbon storage from forest management actions      that, to the maximum extent practicable: are based      on statistically sound sampling strategies, are cost-     effective and allow pooled assessments across lands with      multiple owners.       Guidance to States: The guidelines will include guidance to      States for reporting, monitoring and verifying carbon storage      achieved under the carbon storage program established in      Section 5 of the bill.       Biomass energy projects: The guidelines will include      guidance on calculating net greenhouse gas reductions from      biomass energy projects, including net changes in carbon      storage resulting from changes in land use, and the effect      that using biomass to generate electricity (including      cofiring of biomass with fossil fuels) has on the      displacement of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.       Adoption of recommendations by DOE: The subsection directs      the Secretary of Energy,     acting through the Administrator of the Energy Information      Administration, to revise the existing voluntary reporting      guidelines to include the recommendations provided by the      Secretary of Agriculture.       Periodic review of guidelines: At least every 24 months,      the Secretary of Agriculture must convene the Advisory      Council, review the guidelines and revise the guidelines as      necessary, including to ensure consistency with any future      Federal laws that provide recognition, credit or reward for      reductions of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations      resulting from forest management actions.       Monitoring of State revolving loan programs: States      participating in the revolving loan program established in      Section 5 of the bill must report annually to the Secretary      of Agriculture on the results of the program. If a company or      non-governmental organization provides funding to the State      for specific projects, then the State shall report the carbon      achieved by those projects. The Secretary of Agriculture      shall review each of these reports, certify reports that are      in compliance with the guidelines established by USDA and      submit the certified report to the EIA Administrator for      inclusion in the 1605(b) voluntary reporting data base.      SECTION 5. CARBON STORAGE AND WATERSHED RESTORATION PROGRAM       This section directs the Secretary of Agriculture to      establish a program to provide assistance through State      revolving loan funds to Indian tribes and owners of      nonindustrial private forest land to undertake forestry      carbon activities. This section also allows the Secretary of      Agriculture to enter into cooperative agreements to protect      and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and other resources.       (a) National Forest Watershed Restoration Cooperative      Agreements. This subsection allows the Secretary of      Agriculture to enter into cooperative agreements with willing      State and local governments, Indian tribes, private and      nonprofit entities and landowners for protection, restoration      and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and other      resources on public land, Indian land or private land in a      national forest watershed. Projects under such a cooperative      agreement are eligible for loans discussed in the next      subsection. This subsection extends appropriations      authorities that were first provided under Section 334 of the      Interior and Related Appropriation Act for FY 1998 (``the      Wyden Amendment'').       (b) State Revolving Loan Funds. This subsection establishes      a program to provide assistance through State revolving loan      funds to Indian tribes and owners of not more than 5,000      acres of nonindustrial private forest land. The assistance is      in the form of loans to support forestry carbon activities      that increase long-term carbon storage or provide new sources      of biomass feedstocks for renewable energy generation, and      that have a positive impact on watersheds, fish habitats and      wildlife diversity. The program will be administered by the      Secretary of Agriculture.       Guidance: USDA, in collaboration with States, will provide      guidance on eligible forestry carbon activities based on the      criteria of the bill, recognizing that States should have      maximum flexibility to achieve the purposes of the bill in      ways most appropriate for each State.       Prohibitions: Loans will not be issued for activities      required under other applicable Federal, State or local laws,      nor for costs incurred before entering into a loan agreement      with the State.       Limitation on land considered for funding: States shall not      enter into new loan agreements under the bill to fund      reforestation of land that has been harvested after enactment      if the landowner receives revenues from the harvest      sufficient to reforest the land.       Native species: Funding of reforestation activities shall      be provided only for a species that is native to a region,      with preference given to species that formerly occupied the      land.       Sustainable forest management plan: States must give      priority to projects on land under a sustainable forestry      management program or forest stewardship plan, if the      projects are consistent with the program or plan.       Loan amount: Loans can cover up to 100 percent of total      project costs, not to exceed $100,000 during any 2-year      period.       Repayment: Loans must be repaid to the State with interest      at a rate of at least 5 percent per annum. Loans are to be      repaid when the land is harvested, or in accordance with any      other repayment schedule determined by the State (for      example, a portion of proceeds from each timber sale to be      paid over more than one rotation).       Risk: Landowners do not have to repay loans for timber that      is lost to natural catastrophes or that cannot be harvested      because of government-imposed restrictions on timber      harvesting.       Lien: The loan terms will include a lien on all timber,      forest products and biomass grown on land covered by the      loan, with an assurance that the terms of the lien shall      transfer with the land on sale, lease or transfer of the      land.       Buyout option: The loan terms will specify financial terms      allowing the owner to pay off the loan with interest prior to      harvesting the timber specified in the loan.       Greenhouse gas reductions: A loan agreement must include      recognition that, until the loan is paid off or otherwise      terminated, all reductions in atmospheric greenhouse gases      achieved by projects funded by the loan are attributable to      the State that provides funding for the loan, or to any      company or NGO that provides funding for the loan via the      State program.       Permanent conservation easements: Loan recipients can      cancel the loan by donating to the State or another      appropriate entity a permanent conservation easement that      permanently protects the land and resources at a level above      what is required under applicable Federal, State and local      law and furthers the purposes of the bill, including managing      the land in a manner that maximizes the forest carbon      reservoir of the land.       Reinvestment of funds: All repayments collected by a State      must be reinvested in the program and used by the State to      make additional loans.       Records: The State Forester shall maintain all loan records      and make them available to the public.       Matching funds: A State must match Federal funding by at      least 25% beginning in the second year of participating in      the program.       Funding Distribution: Not later than 180 days after      enactment, the Secretary will report to Congress on a formula      under which Federal funds will be distributed among eligible      States. The formula will be based on maximizing the potential      for meeting the objectives of the bill, and give appropriate      consideration to:       The acreage of unstocked or underproducing private forest      land in each State within national forest watersheds; the      potential productivity of such land; the potential long-term      carbon storage of such land; the potential to achieve other      environmental benefits, such as restoration of native forest      communities in riparian areas; the number of owners eligible      for loans in each State; and the need for reforestation,      timber stand improvement, or other forestry investments      consistent with the objectives of the bill.       The formula will give priority to States that have      experienced or are expected to experience significant      declines in employment levels in the forestry industries due      to declining timber harvests on Federal land.       Private funding: A revolving loan fund may accept and      distribute as loans any funds provided by nongovernmental      organizations, businesses or persons in support of the      purposes of this Act.       Bonneville Power Administration (BPA): States served by BPA      (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana) may apply for funding      from BPA for purposes of funding loans that meet both the      objectives of this Act and the fish and wildlife objectives      of BPA under current law. Any such application will be      subject to the same rules and procedures as any other      application.       Authorization of Appropriations: For the state revolving      loan program, this subsection authorizes funding from FY 2001      to FY 2010 at amounts equal to civil penalties collected      under the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, which      currently revert to the Treasury as General Revenues. In      fiscal year 1998, $45 million in penalties were assessed.      Because penalty assessments can not be accurately predicted      in advance, authorization in any given year would be based on      the penalties assessed two years preceding.                                 ______                                       By
