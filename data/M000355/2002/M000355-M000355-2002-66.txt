 President, I respectfully correct the observation, in case the Senator from Maryland misunderstood. I didn't doubt that his answer was no. He doesn't want to deal with this at any point, ever--not now, not tomorrow, not ever.  The issue before the Senate is whether it is appropriate to deal with client misbehavior when they are representing plaintiffs, as well as when they might be representing defendants.  My amendment is very simple. I would love to have gone further. My amendment does not cap fees, does not cap damages. It simply deals with the following: Providing, for the client, information about the arrangements under which the client is retaining the lawyer at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the case so the client fully understands the terms of the arrangement; second, that there be a 45-day bereavement rule established 45 days after the occurrence of the accident where the victims and their families would not be harassed by those seeking to represent them. It is just a 45-day bereavement rule which we already did under Federal law for airplane accidents.  I hope this amendment will be adopted. It is very reasonable and very appropriate to this bill.  I yield the floor.
