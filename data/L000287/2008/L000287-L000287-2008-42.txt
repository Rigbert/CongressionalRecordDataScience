Mr. Speaker, the untimely death of Republican Stephanie Tubbs Jones gives us pause. There was a great writer who once said that the death of one of us diminishes us all. As Stephanie's friends and colleagues in the U.S. Congress, we all feel a little lost and a little less because one of our most fearless champions is gone.  Those who are voiceless in America today, who have been left out and left behind, have lost a warrior, a fighter, a crusader who did what she could to defend the dignity of human kind. There was not anything shy about Stephanie.  She had the courage, the ability, and the desire to speak up and speak out, to fight forwhat she believed was right, what was fair and just.  As a fellow member of the Ways and Means Committee, she was very concerned about using the tax code to help lift the burdens of the least among us. I always enjoyed it when she made a statement or questioned a witness. She was a brilliant judge and prosecutor, and that helped make her a gifted member of Congress.  Stephanie Tubbs Jones will be deeply missed by the Cleveland community, by the people of Ohio, by the citizens of America, by her family, friends, and all of her colleagues in the U.S. Congress. Peace be with you Stephanie, my friend. May God Almighty grant you eternal peace.
