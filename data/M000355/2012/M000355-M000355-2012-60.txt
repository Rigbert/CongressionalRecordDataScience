 President, I rise today to salute Campbellsville University in Campbellsville, KY, for what is quite a long list of achievements they have received recently. Campbellsville athletics has taken the country by storm. Recently, four Campbellsville students won national championships in track and field, and the Campbellsville men's tennis team won a national championship. A school would be proud of having any one of these winning student-athletes as part of its number--for Campbellsville University to have them all is quite a feat.  Campbellsville's mascot is the Tigers, and the school is part of the National Christian College Athletic Association. Four students on the Tigers track and field team won five individual national titles this year. P.J. Randles won the triple-jump title at the NCCAA Men's Indoor Track & Field National Championships in February. Tiana Benjamin won the javelin title at the NCCAA Women's Outdoor Track & Field National Championships in May. Nathelie Zetrenne won the 100-meter hurdles title at the NCCAA Women's Outdoor Track & Field National Championships this May. And Tiosha Beasley won both the long-jump and triple-jump titles at the NCCAA Women's Outdoor Track & Field National Championships in May.  P.J. Randles is the first student at Campbellsville to win an indoor track and field national title. Tiana Benjamin is the first women's track and field athlete to win a national title. And Tiosha Beasley was also an NAIA All-American at both the NAIA Indoor National Championships and NAIA Outdoor National Championships.  The four women's national titles are the most individual national titles won in one meet by any sport. They are also the most individual national titles of any sports program at Campbellsville University. Since 2009, Campbellsville's men's and women's track and field has won eight individual NCCAA national titles.  On top of these achievements are the tennis champions. The Campbellsville Tigers men's tennis team are the 2012 National Christian College Athletic Association national champions, and they are the first Tigers' program to win a team national championship, after the school reached the semifinals in 2009 and 2010. They swept through the NCCAA Tournament in Mobile, Ala., with a 5-0 record in the tournament after finishing the 2012 season with a school-record 19 wins and a 19-7 overall record.  In addition to its NCCAA championship, this is the first time a Campbellsville University men's tennis qualified for the NAIA Tournament as a team. The team finished runner-up in the Mid-South Conference.  I want to particularly congratulate head coach Kyle Caven, who was honored as the Mid-South Conference Coach of the Year and NCCAA National Coach of the Year. Several tennis team members received honors as well. Carlos Anton was named to the NAIA All-America Second Team and the NCCAA All-America First Team. Pablo Numbela and Sebastian Marot were named to the NCCAA All-America First Team. Pontus Blom, Zac Maylon, and Alberto Diaz were all named to the NCCAA All-America Second Team. John Harbold was named a Mid-South Conference Champion of Character.  The assistant coaches were Kelly Anderson and Phil Carlisle. The team also includes Terry Caven, Austin Colvier, Alfredo Bencid, David Castillo, Tyler Hyatt, Bradley Jeffries, Chase Padgett, and Austin Spalding.  Campbellsville University is a leading Christian university of more than 3,500 students that is dedicated to educating its students and preparing them to be servant leaders. Their excellence in athletics is only matched by their dedication to instilling character and a love of learning. I want to congratulate Campbellsville University president Dr. Michael V. Carter, the school's faculty and staff, the athletics department, and all these wonderful student athletes for representing the very best of what Kentucky has to offer.                          ____________________
