 President, I rise today to submit a resolution designating October 19, 1995 as ``National Mammography Day.''  Over the course of the past 2 years, I have introduced joint resolutions that designate October 19th as a special day to encourage women to get mammograms as part of the early detection process in the fight against breast cancer. Both times the joint resolution has been signed into law by President Clinton.  This year, the House of Representatives is no longer considering commemoratives. Nevertheless, I feel that the Senate should go on record to continue to educate and raise the consciousness about the importance of early detection and the value of mammography.  Mr. President, according to the American Cancer Society, national figures on breast cancer indicate that, in 1995 alone, 182,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Forty-six thousand women will succumb to this disease.  My home State of Delaware still ranks among the worst in breast cancer mortality, with an estimated 570 new breast cancer cases and over 150 breast cancer deaths.  Although a cure for breast cancer may be some time away, early detection and treatment are crucial to ensure survival. Studies have shown and experts agree, that mammography is one of the best methods to detect breast cancer in its early stages. Mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers up to 2 years before regular clinical breast examinations or breast self-examinations [BSE], saving as many as a third more lives of those diagnosed with the disease.  With 50 percent of the breast cancer cases occurring in women over age 65, no women can be considered immune from the disease; in fact, 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have no family history of the disease.  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting today sets aside 1 day in the midst of ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month''--to encourage women to receive or sign up for a mammogram, as well as to bring about greater awareness and understanding of one of the key components in fighting this disease.  Once again, I am pleased to sponsor this resolution, and invite all of my colleagues to join me in this effort.                          ____________________
