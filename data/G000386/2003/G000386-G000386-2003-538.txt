 President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington. First, many priorities identified by Senator Murray have already been addressed in Senator Collins' amendment. Second, I consider $40 billion for this amendment to be fiscally irresponsible. I do appreciate the needs for State fiscal relief, and that is why I supported Senator Collins' amendment. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this very costly amendment.  The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington increases mandatory spending and, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to exceed the committee's section 302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act.
