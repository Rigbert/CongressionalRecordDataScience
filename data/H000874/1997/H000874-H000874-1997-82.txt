Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Following up on the comments of the gentleman who has just spoken, this is not a back-door way to do anything. The amendment that the gentleman refers to, as I understand it, has been introduced in the form of a bill. It is in committee. It can be reported out. The fact of the matter is, we could add the amendment that the gentleman suggests to any bill being considered by this House. It is not germane on this bill because nothing in this bill deals with pay, as the gentleman knows. I presume he knows that. If he does not know it, I will inform him. Nothing in this bill deals with pay.
