 Any more than they should be in Iraq. This amendment is a disaster. I understand the frustration. But this is a case where, as my dear mother would say--and my friend from Arizona has met my mom--she would look at me when we were both young--neither the Senator from Arizona nor I have a temper any longer, but when we were young we were alleged to have tempers. My mother, every time I would lose my temper, would look at me and say: Joey, don't bite your nose off to spite your face.  We are about to, in the colloquial phrase, bite our nose off to spite our face if, in fact, we were to ever allow this amendment to become law.  Mr. McCAIN. One more question: As the ranking member and senior and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, suppose in the case of Kosovo, where Germany contributed enormously in the force of peacekeeping, medical care, other provisions of sustenance, particularly in Kosovo and Bosnia, where there was enormous devastation, suppose we had passed a law like this with regard to Bosnia or Kosovo: Do you think we would have gotten the kind of assistance from the German government and the people we have received to date, including leadership of the peacekeeping forces?
