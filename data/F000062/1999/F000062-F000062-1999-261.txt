 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey for his thinking. I very much appreciate it. It seems to me, those of us who have big cities in our States really understand what a lot of this is about. I think it is very important. When we get back here I think we forget what it is like out there, the ease with which youngsters can obtain these high-powered implements which are capable of killing so many people at one time. So I thank the Senator very much for his support in this.  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?
