Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleagues and friends, Peter Welch of Vermont and Jerry Weller from Illinois, for joining me in offering this important amendment.  Mr. Chairman, hospitals need more than just 2 months to change their coding system. It's too much too soon. CMS needs to give them the time they need. In addition, we must not allow CMS to implement this behavior offset.  I've talked to hospitals in my district. They're doing everything right when it comes to coding and charging Medicare. This cut will punish the hospital before they've done anything wrong. 269 Members of the House feel the same way.  Mr. Weller and I sent a letter to CMS on June 12, along with 267 of our colleagues and 63 Senators urging CMS not to make this $24 billion cut. Hospitals do not deserve a $24 billion cut. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and help our hospitals.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller).
