 President, it is not surprising to me today that we are where we are today--forced to seek enforcement in the courts of a subpoena for documents from the White House.  It is no surprise to me, Mr. President, because the White House's refusal to release the notes sought under this resolution is part and parcel of this administration's consistent and continuous way of operating, its modus operandi, if you will, on how to cooperate with the special committee without really cooperating.  It goes something like this: ``Do not give up any information or documents unless you absolutely have to, and if forced to give them up, release it to the press first with your spin on it before giving it to the committee.''  Mr. President, throughout the committee's investigation, witnesses from the White House have come before the committee and, en masse, failed to recollect, remember, or to recall important meetings, conversations, and phone calls.  We have so much testimony on the record, reciting the lines, ``I cannot remember, I do not recall, I do not have a specific recollection,'' that you would begin to wonder whether amnesia is, in fact, contagious.  We had the dance of the seven veils from the White House witnesses, whom the committee was being forced to recall every time a new document or phone log previously unattainable mysteriously appeared in some way.  Interestingly, Mr. President, while White House officials were suffering under the debilitating loss of memory, or selective memory, career prosecutors and law enforcement personnel were able to remember phone calls, conversations, and meetings with great specificity.  Quite frankly, the testimony before the committee has come to be the tale of two stories. One story was told by the Clintons' political appointees and long-time business partners and friends, versus the story told by career professionals, civil servants, law enforcement personnel and, yes, investigators.  Mr. President, this wholesale memory loss, evasive answers, and claims of privilege against document production sounds strangely familiar, does it not?  Indeed, Mr. President, in the past couple of weeks I have noted what I believe is an increasing similarity between this White House and the Nixon White House. In my view, the committee's need to enforce the subpoena for the notes only reinforces the Nixonian comparison.  Last week, during the committee hearing on Whitewater, I compared some of the arguments that Mr. Clinton has made with the arguments that Mr. Nixon made in support of Executive privilege in 1973 and 1974. Now, some have suggested that this is purely a political exercise. But the fact is, Mr. President, that this is the first time that such a defense--that I am aware of--has been raised since the Nixon administration.  Furthermore, this same defense of privilege has been tried and tested in the courts, and it has failed. The comparison is, therefore, self-evident, Mr. President, and the exercise rather instructive, giving all of us an opportunity to examine the reasonableness of the White House's claim of attorney-client and possibly Executive privilege.  I would like to share some of the quotes with you. First, this is President Nixon's response to a question from a UPI reporter on March 15, 1973.  He said:       Mr. Dean is counsel to the White House. He is also one who      was counsel to a number of people on the White House staff.      He has, in effect, what I would call a double privilege, the      lawyer-client privilege relationship, as well as the      Presidential privilege.  Those were the words of President Nixon. Compare those with the following words, which were sent up to the committee by the White House on December 12, 1995:       The presence of White House lawyers at the meeting does not      destroy the attorney-client privilege. On the contrary,      because of the presence of White House lawyers, who      themselves enjoy a privileged relationship with the President      and who are his agents, was in furtherance of Mr. Kendall's      and White House counsel's provision of effective legal advice      to their mutual client, their presence reinforced, rather      than contradicted, the meeting's privileged nature.  Think about that just a minute. Compare them in your own mind.  I will read President Nixon's address to the Nation announcing an answer to the House Judiciary Committee subpoena for additional Presidential tape recordings on April 29, 1974.  President Nixon said:       Unless a President can protect the privacy of the advice he      gets, he cannot get the advice he needs. This principle is      recognized in the constitutional doctrine of executive      privilege, which has been defended and maintained by every      President since Washington and which has been recognized by      the courts, whenever tested, as inherent in the Presidency.  Let us compare Nixon's statement to the White House brief on behalf of President Clinton to the committee, December 12, 1995:       If notes of this type of meeting are accessible to a      congressional investigating committee, then the White House      counsel could never communicate, in confidence on behalf of      the President, with the President's private counsel, even      when the discussions in question are properly within the      scope of the official duties of the governmental lawyers.      Such a rule would deprive the White House counsel of the      ability to advise the President and his White House staff      most effectively regarding matters affecting the performance      of their constitutional duties.  You be the judge. The words of Nixon and the words on behalf of President Clinton.  I will now share with you a statement President Nixon made to reporters' questions, the National Association of Broadcasters, on March 19, 1974:       Now, I realize that many think, and I understand that, that      this is simply a way of hiding information that they should      be entitled to, but that isn't the real reason. The reason      goes far deeper than that. In order to make decisions that a      President must make, he must have free, uninhibited      conversation with his advisers and others.  The words of President Nixon. Compare those with the words of the White House brief on behalf of President Clinton, December 12, 1995:       The committee's action also implicates important      governmental interests--namely, first, the ability of White      House counsel to discuss in confidence with the President's      private counsel matters of common interest that indisputably      bear on both the proper performance of executive branch      duties and the personal legal interests of the President, and      second, the ability of White House counsel to provide      effective legal advice to the President about matters within      the scope of their duties, including the proper response of      executive branch officials to inquiries and investigations      arising out of the President's private legal interests.  Again, ``Private legal interests.'' Compare, again; you be the judge of the similarity.  Now, from the words of President Nixon in a letter responding to the House Judiciary Committee subpoenas requiring production of Presidential tape recordings and documents, June 10, 1974. What did he say?       From the start of these proceedings, I have tried to      cooperate as far as I reasonably could in order to avert a      constitutional confrontation. But I am determined to do      nothing which, by the precedents it set, would render the      executive branch, henceforth and forevermore, subservient to      the legislative branch, and would thereby destroy the      constitutional balance. This is the key issue in      my insistence that the executive must remain the final arbiter of      demands in its confidentiality, just as the legislative and      judicial branches must remain the final arbiters of demand on      their confidentiality.  The word of President Nixon.  Now, in the brief on behalf of President Clinton to the committee, December 12, 1995:       In a spirit of openness and with considerable expenditure      of resources, the White House has produced thousands of pages      of documents and made scores of White House officials      available for testimony, foregoing assertion of applicable      privileges. In view of this cooperation, the committee's      attempt, after 18 months, to invade the relationship between      the President and his private counsel smacks of an effort to      force a claim of privilege by the President, who must assert      that right to avoiding risking the loss, in all fora, of his      confidential relationship with his lawyer.  Now, you compare it. You have seen the words and the comparison. I think they are relevant. This comparison, I believe, Mr. President, is self-evident and the exercise rather instructive.  I do not know whether the Clinton administration has anything to hide. But I do know this: The first administration to use these arguments certainly did have something to hide, and we know what happened there.  If the White House does not have anything to hide, and I hope they do not, if there is nothing of substance in these notes, nothing damaging in these notes as they claim, then they should comply with the subpoena and produce them to the committee without any reservations, without any conditions, because, Mr. President, if there is nothing damaging in these notes, it is incomprehensible to me why they would raise a defense clearly rejected over 20 years ago.  Mr. President, I also would ask unanimous consent that a letter from Mr. Hamilton, to the President, dated January 5, 1994 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                    Washington, December 14, 1995.     Michael Chertoff,     Special Counsel.     Richard Ben-Veniste,     Minority Special Counsel, U.S. Senate, Special Committee to          Investigate Whitewater Development Corporation and          Related Matters, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.       Gentlemen: Pursuant to the agreement described in my letter      to Mr. Chertoff of December 13, 1995, I am enclosing copies      of the January 5, 1994, letter from James Hamilton to the      President (S 012511-S 012516).       Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.           Sincerely yours,                                                Jane C. Sherburne,     Special Counsel to the President.                                                                    ____                                             Swidler & Berlin,                                  Washington, DC, January 5, 1994.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: At Renaissance you asked for my ideas      on management of the Whitewater and trooper matters. This      responds.       As a preface let me mention that, because of my      representation of the Foster family, I've had numerous calls      from the media about these issues and thus know the views      that some of them hold. Let me also say that, so far, the      White House generally has handled these matters well.       Here are my ideas, some of which are obvious and have been      implemented, but perhaps bear repeating.       1. Despite the falsity of the allegations, these remain      treacherous matters, L.A. Times reporters basically believe      the troopers (although this confidence should now be shaken).      Washington Post reporters consider the Lyons report a      ``joke'' because of its incompleteness, and suspect a cover-     up when it is cited in response to current inquiries.      Reporters are intrigued by Vince's inexplicable death, and      thus continue to search for Whitewater connections.       2. Investigations, like other significant matters, must be      carefully managed. One person in the White House (Bruce, I      assume) should be assigned responsibility for coordinating      information gathering, responses to official inquiries and      public statements about these matters. This cannot be treated      as an incidental assignment.       3. The White House should say as little and produce as few      documents as possible to the press. Statements and documents      likely will be incomplete or inclusive, and could just fuel      the fires.       4. The White House should ensure that what statements it      does make are consistent and coordinated. Erroneous or      conflicting statements could be disastrous; the Nixon White      House brought huge trouble upon itself by issuing inaccurate,      inconsistent statements about Watergate. The Washington Times      in particular has been dissecting current White House      communications.       5. Responses to official inquiries--both written and oral--     must be carefully made. Even oral misstatements could result      in investigations and sanctions. Moreover, the Department of      Justice, FBI and Park Police all leak unconscionably (and      already have as to these matters), and some officials      obviously are inclined to attack the White House's handling      of the inquiries.       6. The White House should not forget that attorney-client      and executive privileges are legitimate doctrines in proper      contexts. While the on-going release of Whitewater documents      to Justice seems appropriate, Bernie initially acted properly      in protecting the contents of Vince's files.       7. If politically possible, Janet Reno should stick to her      guns in not appointing an independent counsel for Whitewater.      An independent counsel--who might pursue his or her self-     aggrandizement rather than the truth--is a recipe for      trouble.       8. The White House must let Justice do its investigation      without interference. Any hint of attempts at interdiction or      manipulation would raise the spectre of Watergate.       9. The White House also should avoid any future contacts      with subjects of the investigation that might provoke cover-     up allegations.       10. You should continue to demonstrate that you are engaged      fully in the business of running the government and not      distracted by these side shows. If the press senses concern,      its efforts redouble.       11. Because you will continue to receive reporter questions      about these matters, I respectfully suggest that you always      be prepared personally with a response to the issues of the      day. I expect that ``no further comment'' often will suffice.       I hope the above views are at least somewhat useful.      Kristina and I hugely enjoyed the opportunity to visit and      recreate with you and Hillary in Hilton Head. The football      game was stupendous fun; the ``scrum play'' was the call of      the day. I only wish the rest of America knew you as the      Renaissance family does and had heard your moving remarks on      Saturday night.           Best regards,                                                   James Hamilton.
