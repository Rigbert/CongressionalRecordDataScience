President, good teachers lead to good students. In fact, recent evidence suggests that providing great teachers may be the single most important thing that we can do to give our children the good education they deserve.  Most of our teachers are hardworking, selfless, and dedicated to helping our children learn. We are asking them for more, however. We continue to demand that our teachers develop greater subject matter expertise, but we have yet to figure out how to help teachers learn while they are still needed in the classroom full time. In addition, to meet growing student need we will need to bring over 2 million new teachers into our public schools over the next decade.  We must attract, develop, and retain as many talented teachers as we can muster. We must act now to begin meeting this critical national crisis.  That is why I am proud to introduce with Senator Kennedy the Teacher Excellence For All Children Act of 2005. The TEACH Act provides financial incentives to attract and retain our best teachers and principals. The TEACH Act helps schools recognize and reward the best teachers. The TEACH Act encourages good teachers to work in the schools that need good teachers the most, and it also encourages teachers to specialize in the subjects which need the most teachers. Finally, the TEACH Act helps new teachers transition into the classroom, it helps veteran teachers keep their skills sharp, and it attracts talented new principals into our schools.  Developing great teachers takes time, but this is an investment that we as a nation must make. I therefore encourage my colleagues to support the TEACH Act now. Our children deserve nothing less.                          ____________________
