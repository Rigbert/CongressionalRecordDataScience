 However, I do not agree that employing a parliamentary technique of filling the tree, which is what my good friend, the majority leader, did, will help facilitate the completion of the bill. This, of course, gives the majority leader the opportunity to basically pick which amendments from my side will be allowed. That is the kind of procedure that makes it impossible to get enough cooperation on the minority side to get cloture and finish the bill.  This process is not going to help us get the bill finished. We will have to continue our discussions on both sides about the amendments we are going to insist be offered.  Hopefully, at the end of the day, after we get through the various procedural moves that have been made, we can develop a regular amendment process. I do not think there will be a huge number of amendments, but the amendments that need to be dealt with are important to this side of the aisle.  Until that kind of procedure is agreed to or worked out in one way or another, it would be difficult to get cloture and to finish the bill.  I see my good friend from Texas on the floor. She has been working diligently on this, along with Senator Rockefeller, for quite some time. She may want to offer her observations as well.
