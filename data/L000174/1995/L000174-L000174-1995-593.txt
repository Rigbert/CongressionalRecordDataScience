President, I find curious the delay in the filing of the Senate report on the constitutional amendment to impose congressional term limits. When this matter was first listed on a Judiciary Committee agenda back on January 18, our Republican colleagues seemed in a tremendous rush to proceed on this matter, one of the 100 or so constitutional amendments introduced so far this Congress. When the Judiciary Committee voted to report Senate Joint Resolution 21 to the Senate back on February 9, the rush continued. The fervor seems to have cooled for now here in the Senate. Indeed, it took the majority 3 weeks to circulate a draft report. The committee was asked last Thursday to reconsider the procedural manner in which the resolution was reported, and as far as I can tell, the committee report is still yet to be filed.  I have no problem with the majority putting off consideration of this matter, which I oppose. The proposal is, in my view, a limitation on the right of the people to choose their representatives. I am concerned that our House colleagues will not have the benefit of our views when they take up this matter next week.  Because I have no assurance that the Senate report will be printed and available to them in time for their debate, I ask to include in the Record my opposition views, which were submitted to be included in the committee report back on March 3, and which I hope will appear in the Senate report, if and when it is printed.  The views follow:  Additional Opposing Views of Senator Patrick Leahy in Opposition to    Senate Joint Resolution 21, a Constitutional Amendment To Impose                        Congressional Term Limits       I oppose this constitutional amendment. The Constitution      does not set congressional term limits, trusting to the      people to decide who will best represent them. Indeed, this      proposal is, in essence, a limitation on the rights of the      electorate. I reject it as such.       I urge my colleagues not to be afraid to do the right      thing, even if it does not appear from certain polls to be      the currently popular thing, and stop demagoguing      constitutional amendments as the cure to our ills. Our      Constitution has served us well, over more than 200 years. It      is the cornerstone of our vibrant democracy. It has been      amended only 17 times since the adoption of the Bill of      Rights in 1791--and two of those were prohibition and its      repeal.       The Constitution is now under attack. The fundamental      protections of separation of powers and the First Amendment      are under siege. In the opening days of this Congress almost      100 constitutional amendments have been introduced. One, the      so-called balanced budget amendment, has already been passed      by the House and been narrowly defeated in the Senate. We      risk making a mockery of Article V's requirement that we deem      a constitutional amendment ``necessary'' before proposing it      to the states.       One way to consider the impact of this proposed amendment      is to look at who would not be here currently were this 2-     term limit already part of the Constitution. The 2-term limit      contained in S.J. Res. 21 would eliminate all of us who have      been returned to the Senate by our constituents after      standing for reelection more than once.       Think for a moment what imposing such a limitation would      mean to the Senate. For example, are Senators Thurmond,      Hatfield, Stevens, Packwood, Roth, Domenici, Chafee, Lugar,      Kassebaum, Cochran, Simpson and Hatch, and Senators Byrd,      Pell, Kennedy, Inouye, Hollings, Nunn, Glenn, Ford, Bumpers,      Moynihan, Sarbanes, Biden and others not possessed of      judgment and experience on which we all rely and on which      their constituents depend? What of the Majority Leader,      Senator Dole, should he have had to retire in 1980 after      serving only two terms?       Consider what this type of measure would have meant over      our history. Those who have served beyond two terms include      among their ranks some of our most distinguished      predecessors. Each of our Senate Office Buildings, in fact,      is named for a Senator whose service would have been cut      short by the type of term limit being proposed as a      constitutional amendment: Richard Russell, Philip Hart,      Everett McKinley Dirksen. It is a loss when illness takes      such leaders from us; it would be a tragedy to have denied      the country and their constituents their service through an      arbitrary rule limiting congressional terms.       Think about Kentucky's Henry Clay; South Carolina's John C.      Calhoun; Missouri's Thomas Hart Benton; Ohio's Robert Taft;      Iowa's William Allison; Michigan's Arthur Vandenberg;      Arizona's Carl Hayden and Barry Goldwater; Maine's Margaret      Chase Smith and George Mitchell; Vermont's Justin Morrill and      George Aiken; Massachusetts' Daniel Webster and Charles      Sumner; Montana's Mike Mansfield; Washington's Scoop Jackson;      North Carolina's Sam Ervin; Arkansas's William Fulbright; New      York's Jacob Javits; Wisconsin's William Proxmire and the      LaFollettes; Minnesota's Hubert H. Humphrey; Tennessee's      Howard Baker, Jr. Such lists invariably leave out many who      distinguished themselves through their service into a third      Senate term.       Voters have not had any trouble electing challengers in the      last several years. In 1978, 1980 and 1986, numbers of      incumbents were defeated in primaries and general elections      for the United States Senate. From the last election, one-     third of those elected      to the Senate are serving in their first terms. In the House      of Representatives fully one third of the Members are      beginning their first or second terms. The electorate does      not seem to have a problem deciding whom to elect and whom      not to reelect.       Indeed, rather than debating a constitutional amendment to      impose term limits, our time might be better spent thinking      about why more and more of our respected colleagues are      choosing to abandon this body. Our friend from Colorado, the      Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, has already      announced that he will not seek reelection in 1996, after      five terms in the House but only one here in the Senate. The      senior Senator from Illinois, the Ranking Democrat on the      Constitution Subcommittee, has also announced that he will      not seek reelection after five terms in the House and two      terms here in the Senate. The distinguished Ranking Democrat      on the Energy Committee, the senior Senator from Louisiana      has announced his intention to return to Louisiana.       Last year, George Mitchell and a total of nine of our      colleagues in the 103rd Congress chose not to seek      reelection. The Congress has become less and less a place      where Members choose to run for reelection.       I respect my colleagues for doing what they think is right      for themselves and their families. I commend those who like      Hank Brown and our freshman colleagues believe strongly in      term limits and conform their own actions to that rule. I      urge them, however, to stop short of seeking to impose their      view on all others and upon all other States for all time by      way of this constitutional amendment.       The reality is that this is an institution that is called      upon to deal with many important and complex matters, where      judgment and experience do count for something. Some sense of      history and some expertise can, from time to time, be helpful      in confronting our tasks and fulfilling our responsibilities      to our constituents and the country. Thus, I do not believe      that a one-size-fits-all limit on congressional service makes      sense.       Further, as the representative of a small State, I am      acutely aware that we fulfill the purposes of the Senate and      sometimes best represent our States when we have a bit of      seniority and a track record on the issues. I believe, as did      our Founders, that it is up to the people to let us know if      we seek to overstay our term of service.       Before we embark on this course to rewrite the work of the      Founders and impose an artificial limit on the length of      congressional service, we should know what evil this      constitutional amendment is intended to reach? On this the      proponents speak in conflicting voices--some urging that term      limits will make us more responsive to the electorate      [[Page S4406]] and others arguing that it will give us      greater distance and independence from them. Which is it?       It is remarkable that while the majority's rhetorical      flourishes raise to new heights the mythological citizen-     legislator and the majority report discusses everything from      Aristotle, ancient Greece and term limit suggestions that      were rejected by the Founders in the ``final draft of the      Constitution,'' to bills, amendments and resolutions not      considered by the Judiciary Committee, it nowhere discusses--     let alone justifies--the specific congressional term limits      it seeks to impose. The sole hearing into this matter was      focussed in large part on proponents arguing that a 6-term      limit for the House was ``no limit at all'' and that to      include such a provision in this measure amounted to ``phony      term limits,'' since 12 years is longer than the average term      of service in the House. Nowhere in its long-delayed report      does the majority discuss Senator Kyl's amendment to double      the House term limits from three to six terms, hint at the      controversy surrounding this key, substantive provision, nor      indicate that it would invalidate limits adopted in over 20      states.       Further, the majority gives no consideration to the      effectiveness of limiting terms of only one group of actors      in our political democracy. Will we also limit the tenure of      professional staff? Will we limit the number of years someone      may lobby the Congress? Why not limit the years that someone      can serve as a political consultant, a pollster, or an      adviser? Are we prepared to venture into campaign reform and      limit the number of times a person may contribute to Senate      races over time? If not, term limits on candidates will only      serve to increase the influence of these other groups at the      expense of the people.       Do we expect first-term Senators intent on reelection to be      less responsive to lobbyists and political consultants? For      those who succeed in being reelected to a second and final      term, will they be oblivious of the need to earn a living in      succeeding years? With no prospect for a career in public      service, Members of Congress may become more solicitous of      ``special interests'' as they look beyond their lame duck      status to new career opportunities.       Despite good intentions, this proposed constitutional      amendment would not give us a citizen-legislature but,      instead, a legislature made up of those independently wealthy      and capable of taking 12 years from building a career outside      this body to serve as philosopher-kings for a time.       I must oppose what I perceive to be a growing fascination      with laying waste to our Constitution and the protections      that have served us well for over 200 years. The First      Amendment, separation of powers, the power of the purse, the      right of the people to elect their representatives should be      supported and defended. That is the oath that we all swore      when we entered this public service. That is our duty to      those who forged this great document, our commitment to our      constituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us.       The Constitution should not be amended by sound bite. This      proposed limitation evidences a distrust not just of      congressional representatives but of those who sent us here,      the people. Term limits would restrict the freedom of the      electorate to choose and are based on disdain for their      unfettered judgment. These are not so much term limits on the      electorate to choose their representatives.       To those who argue that this proposal will embolden us or      provide us added independence because we will not be      concerned about reelection, I would argue that you are      turning our democracy on its head. This proposal has the      effect of eliminating accountability, not increasing it.       It is precisely when we stand for reelection that the      people, our constituents, have the opportunity to hold us      accountable. This proposal would eliminate that      accountability by removing opportunities for the people to      reaffirm or reject our representation of them. It would make      each of us a lame duck immediately upon reelection.       Thus, my fundamental objection to the proposed      constitutional amendment is this: It is, at base, distrustful      of the electorate. It does not limit candidates so much as it      limits the rights of the people to choose whoever they want      to represent them. We should be acting to legislate more      responsively and responsibly, not to close off elections by      making some candidates off limits to voters. I will put my      faith in the people of Vermont and keep faith with them to      uphold the Constitution.                            Leahy Amendment       When this matter reaches the Senate for debate, I intend to      offer an amendment, along the lines of the one that I offered      during the course of the Judiciary Committee's deliberations.      I will try to move us toward an honest discussion of what      this amendment would mean and what impact it would have on      Congress. When politicians talk about imposing term limits,      they tend to support proposals that, on examination, will not      affect them. Thus, I have pointed out that S.J. Res. 21 is      drafted so as not to affect adversely any of us.       This proposal is designed to become effective after the      ratification process, which may itself take seven years.      Thereafter, and only thereafter, are we to start counting      terms in office for purposes of these constitutional term      limits. Thus, this proposal is drafted so that some of us can      get in two more successful reelection campaigns before we      have even to start counting terms toward the 2-term limit. I      suspect that all of us expect to be ``former'' Senators in      2020 after as many as four more      terms, anyway. That is all that this amendment contemplates.       By contrast, my amendment will have the affect of making      these constitutionally-mandated congressional term limits      apply to each of us immediately upon ratification. Thus, the      2-term limit would apply to each of us then currently      serving. Those of us serving in our second term, or greater,      would be able to serve out the remainder of that term. Those      in their first term in the Senate at the time of ratification      would be able to run for reelection, once.       As I noted in the course of the Judiciary Committee's      deliberations, my amendment would conform the congressional      term limits amendment to the transition rule adopted in the      22nd Amendment, which imposed term limits on the President.      The 22nd Amendment provides that it would ``not prevent any      person who may be holding the office of President, or acting      as President, during the term within which this Article      becomes operative from holding the office of President or      acting as President during the remainder of such term.'' The      22nd Amendment did not say that the President serving at the      time of ratification could be elected to two more, 4-year      terms. It is noteworthy that this precedent continues to be      ignored by the majority.       As reported, S.J. Res. 21 includes language in section 3      intended to provide special privileges to those Members who      are serving at the time of ratification. Thus, all prior and      current service is to be disregarded and Members serving at      the time of ratification are to be accorded the prospect of      two additional 6-year Senate terms and six additional 2-year      House terms, regardless of the number of prior terms in the      Senate or House. Rather than have the constitutional      amendment eligibility limitations apply to everyone, S.J.      Res. 21 is drafted so that Members serving at the time of      ratification would be accorded the special privilege of being      able to complete their current terms and then start over,      counting from zero, with respect to elections and service      toward term limits. This is, in the words of a member of the      Committee who voted in favor of the constitutional amendment      ``transparent hypocrisy.''       A few examples indicate the unfairness of these special      privileges:       Senators elected after ratification would be locked into      inferior status in terms of seniority, chairmanships,      committee assignments and staff allocations. By contrast,      Senators serving now and at the time of ratification would      have their seniority preserved and protected.       A Senator elected one day before ratification would be able      to serve three full 6-year terms before the limits took      effect.       A Senator first elected in 1990 could run for reelection to      a second term in 1996, run successfully for a third term in      2002, see the ratification process subsequently completed in      2003, finish out the third term in 2008 and still be      reelected to two more full terms through 2020 before being      affected by any term limits. At the same time a new      Senator first elected in 2004 would be restricted to two      terms and be barred from serving past 2016. Thus, the      older Senator would be able to serve four years past the      forced retirement of the newer and for a total of 18 years      more than the newer Senator.       Senators voting for the amendment ought to be willing to      bind themselves to its terms and not just to bind others who      follow in their footsteps. Yet during the Judiciary Committee      markup, the following Senators voted for this popular      proposal and against my amendment to have it apply to them      fully upon ratification: Hatch, Thurmond, Simpson, Grassley,      Brown, Thompson, DeWine, Kyl and Abraham.       The amendment I will propose to the Senate will strike 3      and its language excluding elections and service occurring      before final ratification from the calculation of the term      limits being imposed. Instead, the amendment will expressly      provide that the term limits being imposed by the      constitutional amendment would apply to Members serving at      ratification.       In order to avoid a retroactive effect or canceling the      results of a completed election, the amendment will allow      Members serving at the time of ratification to complete their      current term. The prohibition in the proposed constitutional      amendment would then operate prospectively to forbid any      Member serving a term at or beyond the term limit being      imposed from seeking reelection.       The amendment will also be intended to remove the ambiguity      created by language included in Section 1, which begins:      ``After this article becomes operative, no person. * * *''      Unless stricken, this language might be interpreted to exempt      Members of Congress serving before ratification from the      effect of the constitutional amendment entirely. At the      least, the language implies that the eligibility of those      Members of Congress serving at ratification is intended to be      determined by consciously disregarding their current and past      elections and service.       Unless stricken this language could create a special class      of Members and grant them special privilege from the full      effect of the constitutional amendment at the moment that it      is ratified. The irony is that many of the very Members who      vote to impose term [[Page S4407]] limits on others elected in the future would secure for themselves special dispensation so that they may serve either an unlimited number of terms or as many terms as can be begun before final ratification plus an additional two terms in the Senate and an additional six terms in the House.       The effect on my amendment will be that upon ratification      of this constitutional amendment to impose congressional term      limits, our current terms of service will be considered. This      is in keeping with the substance of the amendment and would      give it full effect upon ratification, rather than waiting      for another 12 to as many as 20 years before it takes effect.      If constitutionally-mandated congressional term limits are      necessary to solve an important problem, then why should the      amendment to the Constitution exclude the very situation that      it is being proposed to correct? We should not provide      ourselves with special privileges and adopt rules for the      next generation of Members. ``Grandfathering'' or      ``grandparenting'' ourselves from the full effects of this      amendment is not any way to proceed, if it is the will of the      Congress and the States that we should proceed.                               ____________________
