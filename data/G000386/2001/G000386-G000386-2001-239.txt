 President, in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the following nominations: Nos. 43, 79, 80, 81, 82, 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, and 95.  In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the nomination of William Hansen (PN 274) be discharged from the HELP Committee and, further, that the Senate proceed to its consideration as well.  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then return to legislative session.
