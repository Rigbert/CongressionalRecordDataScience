 President, first of all I want to thank everyone in this body for the overwhelming vote of confidence on the work that Senator Durbin and I have done on this bankruptcy bill. Getting to this point has been a very tough process involving a lot of compromise and a lot of refinement.  You heard me say on the first day of debate that for the entire time that I have been in the Senate and on this subcommittee on the subject of bankruptcy--maybe not on every subject, but the subject of bankruptcy--there has been a great deal of bipartisan cooperation, first of all between Senator Heflin of Alabama, now retired, and myself. Sometimes I was chairman when Republicans were in the majority. When we were in the minority, I was ranking member and he was chairman. But this legislation has always passed with that sort of tradition.  So I want to say to all of my colleagues that I not only thank them for their support but, more importantly, thank Senator Durbin, who worked so closely with me on this legislation, and that tradition has continued. I thank him for carrying on that tradition, because I don't think we would have had the vote that we had today if it had not been for the bipartisanship that has been expressed since he first took over leadership for his party on our subcommittee.  I also want to give commendation to his staff, Victoria Bassetti and Ann McCormick; and also to Senator Hatch's staff, Maken Delrahim and Rene Augustine; and also my staff, John McMickle and Kolan Davis, because without the long hours of staff work that went into this bill, we would not have had the great compromise that we had to make this vote possible.  Mr. President, I'm pleased that we've come to the point where the Senate has passed the Grassley-Durbin consumer bankruptcy bill. Getting to this point has been a tough process involving a lot of compromise and refinement. Of course, I thank Senator Durbin for his help and suggestions for improving the bill. I think that Chairman Hatch also deserves a great deal of credit as well.  The bill we voted is a very fair and balanced piece of legislation with broad support. The administration, in its ``statement of administration policy,'' encourages the Senate to pass this bill. The Judiciary Committee was almost unanimous in passing the bill, and many changes have been made to the version of the bill reported by the committee to accommodate the concerns of the minority. So, this is a bill I think we can all support regardless of party. Again, Senator Durbin has been instrumental in making this bill truly bi-partisan.  As I've said numerous times on the floor during the debate on bankruptcy reform, the American people are four-square in support of meaningful bankruptcy reform. The fact is that some people use bankruptcy as a convenient financial planning tool to skip out on debts they could repay. This has to stop.  Mr. President, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Bankruptcies of convenience are like shoplifting. Honest consumers have to pick up the tab for losses due to bankruptcy just as they pick up the tab for shoplifting. Bankruptcies of convenience impose a hidden bankruptcy tax of $400 per family of four. My bill will cut that tax.  Mr. President, it's not just consumers paying higher prices who stand to lose from bankruptcy abuse. Small businesses, a vital component of our healthy economy, can be crippled by bankruptcy losses. That's why the National Federation of Independent Business supports bankruptcy reform.  Let's cut the bankruptcy tax. Let's restore personal responsibility to the bankruptcy system. Let's help protect American consumers and small businesses.  Mr. President, I want to thank the people from the administration, because they have followed the course of this legislation. They have issued a statement of administrative policy in support of this legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management            and Budget,                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1998.                   Statement of Administration Policy            S. 1301--Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998              (Grassley (R) Iowa and Durbin (D) Illinois)       The Administration encourages Senate passage of S. 1301 as      an important step toward balanced bankruptcy reform; however,      the Administration ultimately would support enactment of      bankruptcy legislation only if the essential reforms      incorporated by the Senate managers' amendment are preserved      and strengthened and the unbalanced and arbitrary elements of      the current House bill are omitted.       The Administration supports bankruptcy reform that asks      both debtors and creditors to act more responsibly. Debtors      who genuinely have the ability to repay a portion of their      debts should remain responsible for those debts. But      creditors must also be responsible for treating debtors      fairly, recognizing creditors' superior information and      bargaining power.       As reported from Committee, S. 1301 focused heavily on      perceived debtor abuse, with little to curtail abuses by      creditors. However, if changes incorporated in the manager's      amendment are adopted, the Senate bill will take significant      steps to address abusive practices by both debtors and      creditors. Essential changes included in the managers'      amendments include: (1) new disclosure requirements to ensure      that credit card companies provide consumers with the      information about their accounts that they need to manage      their budgets; (2) procedural protections to avoid      inappropriate and unwise reaffirmations of unsecured and      certain secured consumer debts; and (3) modifications made to      the nondischargeability provisions in the bill so that the      bill no longer inappropriately puts credit card debt in      competition with child support, alimony, and other societal      priorities like education loans and taxes.       The Administration also strongly prefers the discretionary      approach to limiting access to Chapter 7 used in S. 1301 over      the rigid and arbitrary approach in the House bill. We      support changes made by the Senate bill to ensure that those      debtors denied access to Chapter 7 under Section 707(b) of      the Bankruptcy Code are those that have a strong likelihood      of successfully completing a Chapter 13 plan.       More can and should be done to produce a truly balanced      bill. The bill must address the potentially coercive effect      of allowing creditors to bring 707(b) motions based on any      allegation of abuse and strengthen the protections against      coercive reaffirmations.       The Administration also supports financial contract netting      provisions in the bill, which are important to reducing      systemic risk in our financial markets and are based on a      proposal from the President's Working Group on Financial      Markets.       The Administration supports Senate passage of the ``Omnibus      Patent Act of 1998'' as an amendment to S. 1301 because that      bill supports American innovation through needed patent law      reforms. While the Administration is disappointed that the      bill does not include all of the performance based      organization reforms it proposed, the provision's inclusion      of the annual performance agreement is welcome.       Finally, the Senate is expected to vote on an amendment to      raise wages of 12 million Americans and help ensure that      parents who work hard and play by the rules do not have to      raise their children in poverty. Two years ago, the President      signed into law a moderate increase in the minimum wage. The      results of that action are clear: it raised the wages of the      lowest paid workers and did not cost jobs. Now we must      continue to take actions to ensure that all Americans are      benefitting from our prospering economy. That is why the      Administration strongly supports raising the minimum wage by      $1 over two years.
