Ninety-eight Customs inspectors are currently stationed in my home State. Yet, according to a Customs Service resource allocation analysis based on threat and workload assessments, Maine should have 253 inspectors, or two-and-one-half times more than are currently there. Maine has 23 land border ports of entry, some of which are manned by a single inspector at any given point in time. Our Customs and Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors work long and hard to protect the integrity of our border. But they need reinforcements.  I understand that the lack of Customs officials in Maine would not be ameliorated completely by this bill. But it, in conjunction with the $25 million for additional Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors included in the Senate-passed Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill, would take a strong step in the right direction. And I ask the distinguished chairman and ranking member to help ensure that Maine receives its fair share of additional inspectors.
