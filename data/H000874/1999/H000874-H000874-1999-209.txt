Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fattah) for yielding, and I join the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts).  I do not know how many Americans have seen Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks is a woman small in stature. But that belies the fact that she was a giant in her courage and in her commitment and in the impact she made on America, not just on African Americans, though an impact she had on their lives and the respect accorded to them, but on the lives of every American who live today in a better country, more conscious of our need to give to each individual within our country the respect that they are due as human beings and children of God.  Rosa Parks, Mr. Speaker, is a giant in the history of America. On December 1st, 1955, Rosa Parks looked up from her seat and said, ``No, I will not give you my seat. I was here first. I'm an American citizen. I paid my fare. And I ought to be able to sit on this seat.'' Mr. Speaker, she was absolutely correct. But as Martin Luther King observed some 8 years later, in August of 1963, America had yet to live out the reality of the promises made in our Declaration of Independence and in our Constitution, that Rosa Parks, like the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Emerson), was endowed not by government but by her Creator with certain unalienable rights, and among these were life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And our Constitution said, particularly in the 14th amendment and the 15th amendment, that color would not dictate lesser Americans.  Rosa Parks is a giant, and I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, to join the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from Oklahoma in setting aside, as the gentleman from Oklahoma so ably articulated, the Rotunda, a revered spot not only in this country but around the world, to honor Rosa Parks, to say to her, ``Thank you. Thank you for helping America be a better country.''
