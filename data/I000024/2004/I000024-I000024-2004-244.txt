I made that mistake once. I was commenting back when a little boy was born to my older son and his wife. My older son is James Mountain Inhofe II. He kept having baby girls. The years went by and they kept cranking the girls out. I always wanted to have a boy, selfishly, James Mountain Inhofe III. So we found out--and this happened a couple years ago--that in fact my daughter-in-law was unexpectedly pregnant--Jimmy's wife. I respond to the Senator that what we did is for 8 months we prayed every day it would be a boy. I figured if Abraham could do it, I could do it. Sure enough, we were up in the waiting room and the nurse came in while I was doing a 30-minute talk show with Ollie North. Right in the middle of that, she came in and said, ``Senator, how did you know? You are the only one who knew it was going to be a boy.'' I said, ``Ollie, James Mountain Inhofe III has been born.'' On the way back it occurred to me they had not yet named that child, and I announced the name on the radio. So I learned that lesson.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Missouri is recognized.
