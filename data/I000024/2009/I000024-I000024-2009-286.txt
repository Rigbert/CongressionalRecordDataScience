President, yesterday I spent over an hour on the floor talking about a report that we put together that is pretty incredible, the numbers of scientists coming forth now who were always on the other side, or 10 years ago were on the other side ofthis issue and at that time were agreeing with former Vice President Gore in saying that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2 and such were the major causes of global warming. Now these scientists are coming over in droves, even individuals who are leading riots in the streets throughout the world talking about having to do something or we are all going to die. I spent more time than I should have on it because it deserved the time. But I had to read a lot of the stuff. I know you go to sleep when you think about things like this, and it does get to be heavy lifting. What I am trying to say is, we need to view this with a fresh look because so many things have happened.  It is going to be difficult for many of my colleagues whom I deeply respect who crawled way out on the limb saying it is manmade gases and we will have to have expensive cap-and-trade solutions to the problem; they now are facing a very liberal constituency that is saying: Wait a minute. Now we have the White House, the House, and the Senate. We have everybody lined up on this issue, as if it is a done deal, a fait accompli; we are now expecting you to come forward.  This is totally ignoring the fact that everything has changed from what it was before. Last year we had the Lieberman-Warner bill. Let's go back further than that. Let's go back to the original Kyoto Treaty. Quite frankly, way back 7 years or so ago, when I became chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, all we ever heard was that manmade gases were causing global warming and, therefore, we have to do something about it.  Frankly, when the Kyoto Treaty was first suggested, I was one who thought it must be true because that is all we heard in the media. When I became chairman, I knew that I would have an impact on the decisions that were made that would concern global warming. I thought at that time it was something we should address.  Then the Wharton School of Economics came out with the Wharton Econometric Survey. This was something that was pretty well done, and it is still out there. In fact, I have a Web site, epw.senate.gov. If you access that, you can see this in more detail than you probably really want. If you are not a believer in the cost of this issue, then you would want to do that. The Wharton Econometric Survey asked: What would it cost the United States if we were to ratify the Kyoto Treaty and live by its emission requirements? They came to the conclusion that it would be in the range of between $300 to $330 billion a year. I always hesitate to use figures such as that because it is hard for people to conceive how that affects them. What I normally do is take the number of families in America who file tax returns, and then I do the division. That $330 billion a year it would cost us to comply with the treaty comes out to be almost $3,000 a family. We are talking about something that is big. This is huge.  After looking at that, I thought: If it is going to cost that much, let's be sure the science is real and it is there. After looking at it, we found that the science was not there. Even though you had the appearance of it being there because the National Academy of Sciences and the United Nations all said the science was there, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, something started by the United Nations--I hasten to say I have never been much of a fan of the United Nations to start with. Maybe I am a little bit biased in this analysis. When they put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, they did so for the purpose of trying to do something to force the whole world to be involved and say: This is a world problem that we will have to correct.  This is just a suspicion I have. Every once in a while the United Nations comes out with something that totally contradicts our interests. My good friend from Alabama and several of us put together resolutions. These resolutions say we will withhold 20 percent of our dues to the United Nations unless they reverse their position. The United Nations doesn't like that. They would like not to have to answer to anyone. Consequently, if they could ever get in a situation of global taxation, which is what they have openly been promoting for many years, they would be in a position not to be accountable to anyone.  This is kind of what happened. So this was the Kyoto Treaty.  Fastforward then to 2003 and 2005 when we had two bills, the first of which was McCain-Lieberman. Those bills were also cap and trade. Cap and trade costs about the same amount of money. This is very interesting. You will hear a lot of people during the next few months say: We want some kind of controls on CO2. But we are not going to do it in a way that will cost a lot of money. We will have offsets. The bottom line is, it is going to cost about the same $300 billion regardless of what scheme we adopt and how we massage it.  I have to say, there has been an awakening in the last few years. In 2005 there were only two Senators who came to the floor and helped me. I was the one, as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who was charged with fighting this issue. It was on the floor of the Senate for 5 days, 10 hours a day. That is 50 hours. We only had about 3 hours of other Senators coming to assist me. Now fastforward to 2008. That was the Warner-Lieberman bill. We had 25 Senators, including the Senator in the Chamber presently from Alabama, who came down to assist in this debate. That is a huge difference. We resoundingly defeated that bill, mostly on the economic arguments, not on the scientific arguments.  When we started the debate, I said: I don't believe the science is there. Evidence is showing that it is not there. But let's assume for purposes of this debate that the science is there, that manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, are all responsible for climate change and for increasing the temperature or global warming. Let's assume that. So the debate started, and we talked about the economics of the issue. Even assuming the science is there, we defeated that by a huge margin. In fact, Barbara Boxer was handling the Democratic side. They only had 37 Democrats committed for final passage. That is a big change from 2005.  Now we have something where everybody is assuming that it is going to pass because the Democrats have control of everything. They have the White House, the House, and the Senate. I remind them not to get too arrogant because we went through the same thing, or they went through the same thing in 1992, and things turned out pretty well after that.  If you look at where the attitudes of people are right now, that we are going to be passing something, I wouldn't get too far ahead. What we are trying to do and what I did yesterday--and I took far too long in doing it--was talk about the size of the tax and the fact that the tax is going to be a regressive one.  I have to say also that I was one of the few people who actively opposed the $700 billion bailout. Again, when we relate that to each family that files a tax return, it is about $5,000 a family. That was giving an unelected bureaucrat the sole control over $700 billion. One of the things I don't like about that, not only was it the wrong thing to do, but that also got people changing their thinking as to these large numbers. Now that $300 billion a year that it would cost us, if we had a cap-and-trade policy, doesn't seem nearly that big. But it would be, and it would be regressive.  The argument on the other side is, you may be right in the regressive nature of a tax because everybody has to buy energy. Everybody has to buy gasoline and heat their homes, so a larger percentage of the expendable income of someone who is in a lower income is going to be far greater than it would have been otherwise, but we can take care of that by redistribution of wealth toward low-income consumers. They have actually said that. That sounds a little bit un-American to me. Keep in mind, if we are talking about redistributing wealth, somebody has to create wealth before it can be redistributed. Right now--and we are looking at the figures going around now--there will not be a lot of wealth to redistribute, if we get to that point.  Anyway, that was the main argument I was using yesterday and have used up through the last 7 years. I have had occasion to give 13 rather lengthy floor speeches on the science on global warming. What I did yesterday was use this report that we put together of the 650 very top international scientists who refute all the arguments usedheretofore. I would like to concentrate for a moment on some of the left-of-center scientists, environmentalists, and activists we are talking about, the so-called consensus.  The Huffington Post is a left-leaning publication. We all understand that. Harold Ambler was demanding an apology from Al Gore for promoting unfounded global warming fears. The Huffington Post article accused Gore of selling ``the biggest whopper ever sold to the public'' in American history.  We see a former Greenpeace member who was in Finland. His name is Jarl Ahlbeck. He says there has been little or no global warming since 1995. This is interesting. Everyone is talking about global warming. We are in a cooling spell now. It has been that way since the turn of the century. Nobody argues that. I am sure that upset a lot of people, the promoters, because it is kind of hard to be talking about some very expensive scheme to fight global warming when we are going through global cooling.  Nonetheless, we have all types of people, and I cited a long list of them, who say we are in the middle of this cooling period right now.  Going into the liberal side or the left-leaning scientists, one of them is Martin Hertzberg, a meteorologist with a Ph.D. in physical chemistry. He said:       As a scientist and life-long liberal Democrat, I find the      constant regurgitation of the anecdotal fear mongering clap-     trap about human-caused global warming to be a disservice to      science.  You have some of the punishment that has been covered in this report. They talk about how they no longer can get grants from various organizations, whether it is the Heinz Foundation or others, unless they go along with their philosophy.  The other argument that has come up that we want to use and make sure everybody understands is, even if you are a believer that manmade gases cause climate change, global warming, the things we are looking at now and the things we looked at after Kyoto, Kyoto actually made more sense than some of the bills I have been talking about that happened in 2003 and 2005 and 2008 because that would single out the United States and say: This is what we are going to do regardless of what they do in China and Mexico and India and other countries.  So, obviously, if we did it, and we had this punitive tax arrangement, that would drive our manufacturing base overseas to places where they wouldn't have this heavy expense. Consequently, it would be going to countries such as Mexico and China where they have almost no restrictions on their emissions. It would have a net increase on the amount of CO2 going into the atmosphere.  As to the manual we have with over 650 scientists, I would like to suggest to you that you compare that to the IPCC reports. The IPCC--that is the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--report is called a Summary for Policymakers. We never saw the report. We just see the summary. That was put together by 52 scientists who are pretty much owned by the politicians who are wanting to come to these conclusions.  So if you canvas the scientists now in Canada who came out with a report just recently--51,000 Canadian scientists--68 percent of them disagree that global warming is a science that is settled. At the same time, you have the same percentage--and this came from the International Geological Congress which just had their meeting in Norway--an overwhelming number of the scientists were skeptical. Two-thirds of the presenters and question askers were hostile and even dismissive of the U.N. IPCC report. So the same two-thirds keeps reappearing in terms of what the scientists are saying about this issue.  Now, yesterday, I did not get into this, but if you look at those scientists who are on the left side, Dr. Robert Giegengack, the former chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, actually was a strong Gore supporter in the 2000 election. He now states that global warming does not even qualify as 1 of the top 10 environmental problems facing the world. This is not me or any other Senator talking. This is one of the far left leaning environmental scientists.  With Alexander Cockburn it is the same situation. He is a maverick journalist who leans left on almost all topics. He lambasted the alleged global warming consensus on a political Web site called counterpunch.org, arguing that there is no evidence that humans are causing the rise in global temperature. This gets to the intimidation factor. He said:       I have been treated as if I have committed intellectual      blasphemy.  Alexander Cockburn stated:       This turn to climate catastrophism is tied into the decline      of the left, and the decline of the left's optimistic vision      of altering the economic nature of things through a political      program.  I guess what he is saying is, these intellectuals, any of these scientists who were formerly on the far left side who have come over--as most of them now have; more than 50 percent of them have--are beat up pretty badly by the scientific community, or at least by the National Academy of Scientists.  Another left-leaning individual is Denis Rancourt, professor of physics and an environmental science researcher at the University of Ottawa. He stated that the global warming campaign does a disservice to the environmental movement by beating this drum. He is a big environmentalist. When, obviously, the science is not there, it is doing a great disservice, and I think that is right.  Then you get into the three I like the best. Dr. Claude Allegre is a socialist. He is one of the top French scientists. He is the one who was marching in the streets with Al Gore 10, 15 years ago. Claude Allegre is recognized by everyone. He has now totally reversed his position. He was the top guy in France. With Dr. David Bellamy from the UK, it is the same situation. He was on the far left side of this issue. He has come around.  I have all the quotes by these individuals. There is not enough time to read them. The same thing is true with Nir Shaviv. Nir Shaviv was a scientist in Israel who is now quite outspoken in his opinion that the science just flat is not there.  Ecologist Dr. Patrick Moore, he was a founder of Greenpeace and has now joined the ranks of the dissenters. He said:       It is clear the contention that human-induced      CO2 emissions and rising CO2 levels in      the global atmosphere are the cause of the present global      warming trend is a hypothesis that has not yet been elevated      to the level of a proven theory.  So this goes on and on and goes over many of these areas. I think even some of the mainstream media has begun to take notice of this issue. An article in Politico noted the other day--that is a paper we are all familiar with in the Senate--that a ``growing accumulation'' of science is challenging warming fears, and added that the ``science behind global warming may still be too shaky to warrant cap-and-trade legislation.''  Canada's National Post, which is always promoting cap and trade, is now saying ``the number of climate change skeptics is growing rapidly.''  So I leave with three thoughts: First of all, the left is now abandoning the whole global warming fear concept, and we have all the names. I can recall when we had our 2-hour session with former Vice President Al Gore, and I never saw any sweat coming off his forehead until we started talking about people such as Claude Allegre, David Bellamy, and Nir Shaviv, who were always on his side before.  Second is the cost. If you do not want to use my $300 billion-a-year tax increase figure, use the figure that was used in the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill last year. It was $6.7 trillion.  The third thing to keep in mind has to do with Kyoto. It would have been bad enough, but for us to do it unilaterally would really be a very bad idea.  I would suggest people go to a Web site. I have the Web site: epw.senate.gov/minority. ``EPW'' stands for Environment and Public Works--epw.senate.gov/minority. I have a lot of documentation there for anyone who might be interested in the truth, not that that always produces a lot of interest around here.                            Bailout And Jobs  Lastly, Mr. President, I want to go into one other thing unrelated, and I do not want to use too much time because others want to speak.  I have said--I do not think it is unfair, at least in my mind--that as tothis whole idea of the $700 billion bailout, 75 percent of the House and the Senate supported this legislation. Let's keep in mind that was to give an unelected bureaucrat the power to do with the first half of the $700 billion anything he wanted to do.  In fact, when Secretary Paulson--he actually said at one time: I promise this is going to be used to buy damaged assets. Well, we found out that, obviously, 3 our 4 minutes after he received the money, it did not go to that. I have heard, and just this past Wednesday an economist gave a presentation, that if we had used that for the intended purpose, it might have had an effect. They contend this did not have any effect at all on what has happened.  So with the concern that several of us have, I would only like to say that it has fallen on deaf ears. But I have been trying to get Members of this body to understand--I am talking about Democrats and Republicans; we have some Democrats, such as Bernie Sanders, who do understand this--and that is, the concept of giving the money to an unelected bureaucrat is wrong.  This is something we can do now on the second half of the $350 billion that remains. They spent every cent of the first $350 billion. As to the second $350 billion, if we leave the law like it is today, they can come forward and say this: Well, I want to have the other $350 billion. I am going to spend it on this and this and this--and maybe not even talk about the whole amount. They may be very uncertain as to what he is going to use it for. But then the only way to stop that would be to pass a resolution of disapproval.  Now, it would be very difficult to pass a resolution of disapproval. In fact, for obvious procedural and other reasons, it could not be done. What I have proposed, in S. 64, is to make a modest change in that law, and instead of saying it is going to automatically pass unless a resolution of disapproval, in a 15-day period, is successfully passed, say that you have to come forward and show us what it is going to be, how you are going to spend the money.  I have been trying to get more sponsors on this legislation. As I say, I already have some Democratic sponsors, and I applaud them for having the courage to come out and say: We want accountability. We don't care who it is in the White House, we need to have accountability.  So as we get toward the bailout bill, the last thing I want to mention is something I have very strong feelings about, and that is this: The figures I have heard--and at this point I do not think anyone can intelligently say exactly what the bailout bill is going to be--we have heard figures batted around about $1.2 trillion, huge amounts of money. But the report I got from the President-elect's team, they talked about out of $1.2 trillion, only $25 billion in total investment would be on infrastructure. That is nothing, $25 billion out of $1.2 trillion.  Now, I would say this: My good friend, Jim Oberstar, over in the House of Representatives, with whom I served on the Transportation Committee for 8 years before coming over here, has come up with a much more ambitious portion of it.  Now, if we are going to spend money for a stimulus bill, let's spend money on something that will actually come up with some jobs. I am not saying I want to spend all this money, but if it is going to be spent anyway.  I do not want to play down the whole idea of tax relief. We all know--we have learned from experience--what can happen if tax relief is done in the right way. We all remember what Woodrow Wilson did after World War I. He decided to cut taxes because the war was over. He did not need them anymore, and he expected revenue to drop down. It did not. It increased.  A very smart President of the United States, in the 1960s, John Kennedy, said--this is an exact quote--we need more money for the Great Society programs, and the best way to increase revenue is to decrease marginal rates. So he decreased rates, and it increased revenue.  Remember in 1980, the total amount of money that was raised from marginal rates was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion. That was during the 10-year period that had the largest tax reductions in the history of this country.  So we know we can stimulate the economy. I fear that is not going to be that type of tax reduction if we just merely have a redistribution of wealth and give money to people who do not pay taxes. That is not going to do it. So I say that because if tax relief were done properly, I would not be standing here and saying we ought to have a larger percentage of this spent on infrastructure. We have huge critical needs in the United States on our infrastructure. We are in a position right now where we had passed the last authorization bill, and it was a $286 billion bill in 2005. That was the transportation reauthorization. We are going to do it again. But if we could get a running start and spend some of the money that is going to be spent anyway on providing jobs immediately, we have $80 billion ready to go right now for jobs, where we could have the spade in the dirt tomorrow.  Then we have the categoric exclusion projects that are out there in addition to this. Those are projects that do not increase capacity, do not increase the footprint, but just maintain some of the crumbling bridges and infrastructure that is out there. So all that can be done. I think Gary Ridley is the best director of highways anywhere in America. He is our highway director in Oklahoma. We have, just in our State, one billion dollars' worth ready to go right now. So this is what we want to do.  On Monday, I am going to elaborate a little more on our opportunities that we have for infrastructure. I have been ranked most of the time as the most conservative Member of the Senate, and yet I am a big spender in some areas. One is in national defense, but another certainly is in infrastructure. That is what we are supposed to be doing.  I think we have an opportunity to do what we are supposed to be doing and at the same time produce jobs, and that will be my intent. I plan to talk about this in more detail on Monday.  With that, I yield the floor.
