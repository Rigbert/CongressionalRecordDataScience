President, the 1-year anniversary of the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City reminds us of many things. We recall the emotional shock and grief. We visualize the physical destruction and devastation. We revisit the still unanswered questions: Why this terrible deed and why Oklahoma, of all places?  But at the same time, we must also remember the remarkable flowering ofthe true spirit of our great Nation. In the wake of unspeakable pain and adversity, there came extraordinary acts of heroism, compassion, and voluntarism. There came a unity of purpose and strength of faith few would have believed possible.  We were moved beyond words by the outpouring of help and assistance which came without solicitation from friends far and wide, from caring individuals, public servants, private organizations, and communities throughout Oklahoma and throughout America. We were reminded what a truly great country this is and how blessed we are here in the land of the free and the home of the brave.  On behalf of all of us in Oklahoma, thank you, America. Thank you for helping. Thank you for caring. Thank you for being there in this most difficult time of need.  Nothing anyone can do will erase the indelible scars, pain, and loss that innocent citizens in our State have suffered. But the memories of the generosity and compassion displayed by so many will live in our hearts forever.
