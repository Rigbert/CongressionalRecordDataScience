Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 1082, the resolution that condemns the decision by the city of St. Denis, France, to name a street in honor of Mumia Abu-Jamal, the convicted murderer of Philadelphia Police Officer Danny Faulkner. In 1981, Officer Faulkner was shot multiple times by Abu-Jamal, who was then convicted and sentenced to death. Although Abu-Jamal's conviction was upheld on appeal, the death sentence was overturned on habeas review in 2001, 20 years after the crime was committed.  The city of St. Denis exhibited gross disregard for the family of Officer Faulkner, the city of Philadelphia and the families of slain law enforcement officers all over the United States when it callously announced the naming of a street to honor Abu-Jamal during the 2006 National Police Week.  House Resolution 1082 condemns the heinous murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner and urges the city of St. Denis to reconsider the decision to name a street after a convicted police murderer. Should the city of St. Denis fail to act, the resolution asks the government of France to take action to correct this injustice and concludes by commending all police officers for their commitment to public service and safety.  This resolution has received the support of the Fraternal Order of Police and the National Troopers Coalition.  I would like to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick) for his leadership on this issue. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
