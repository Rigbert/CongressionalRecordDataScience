Chairman, I give the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Gekas] great credit to this process of witnessing to the witnesses, and trying to adjust the form of the legislation.  I believe Mr. Hubner was the only business person who spoke specifically about the threshold, and in fact, the witness that I heard with most sort of persuasive force was C. Boyden Gray, who is a representative of the business community, the president of Citizens for a Sound Economy, which is one of the groups that represents the business community.  In Mr. Gray's written testimony, and also in his verbal testimony, he said ``$100 million is a central threshold.''
