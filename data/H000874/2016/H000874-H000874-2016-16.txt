Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for taking this Special Order hour.  We are all sad and lament the fact that an extraordinary human being was taken from us far too early. I tell my colleagues, this picture says it all: that wonderful, warm, accepting, engaging aloha smile that is represented in this picture of our colleague, Mark Takai.  I join my colleagues in celebrating and remembering a life well lived. Though he only served alongside us in this House for a short time, he made a big impact on us all with his kindness, his sincerity, and his intellect. All of us admired the steadfastness with which he fought for his constituents and the courage with which he fought his illness. All of us saw Mark on this floor, determined to serve his constituents for as long as his health allowed him to do so.  As was said yesterday, Mark did not greet us with any self-pity or any wringing of hands, but with a positive attitude to the end. I wasn't with him at the very end, but my, how we were blessed to be with him for the short time that we had him. What an example he set for all of us to overcome adversity and welcome opportunities rather than focusing on that which he could not do.  Not only was Mark an outstanding Member of Congress, he was, as has been said by his fellow officer, a warrior willing to serve, to risk, and to save this great country, its democracy, and its people.  As a lieutenant colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard, he deployed on Active Duty to Kuwait in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He earned the Army's Meritorious Service Medal for his achievements there.  We all are standing here to speak of the meritorious service he gave right here. Yes, on the battlefield; yes, at the point of the spear; but right here as well. He drew on his experience in the Army as a veteran when he served as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans, Military, and International Affairs in the Hawaii legislature, and later as a member of the House Committee on Armed Services here in Congress.  A proud native of Hawaii, Mark dedicated his life and career to the people of his beloved State. He was elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the age of 27. I can empathize with that because I was elected to the Maryland State Senate at the age of 27. We talked about that. Some have entered earlier, but that was pretty early. It gave us a great opportunity to serve.  Mark believed strongly that every child deserves a chance to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. In my own State, there are 52 Judy Centers named after my late wife, who died almost 20 years ago, that serve 3-and 4-year-old children.  Mark had that same kind of compassion and concern and focus on making sure that young people received all that we could give them early in life so that they could succeed later in life, as Mark Takai did so extraordinarily.  I have other words that I will submit for the Record because there are so many of my colleagues who want to speak about Mark and their relationship to him, their respect for him, their love for him, and his love for us.  I thank Congresswoman Gabbard for taking this hour, and I thank her for being such an example. Both of you define aloha.  God bless.  Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today in remembering the life of our friend, Representative Mark Takai, who lost his battle against cancer in July.  Though he only served alongside us in this House for a short time, he made a big impact on us all with his kindness, his sincerity, and his intellect.  All of us admired the steadfastness with which he fought for his constituents and the courage with which he fought his illness.  Not only was Mark an outstanding member of Congress, he also served our nation in uniform.  As a lieutenant colonel in the Hawaii Army National Guard, he deployed on active duty to Kuwait in support of operation Iraqi Freedom, and he earned the Army's Meritorious Service Medal for his achievements there.  He drew on his experiences in the Army and as a veteran when he served as chairman of the House Committee on Veterans, Military, and International Affairs in the Hawaii Legislature and later as a member of the House Committee on Armed Services here in Congress.  A proud native of Hawaii, Mark dedicated his life and career to the people of his beloved state.  Elected to the Hawaii House of Representatives at the age of twenty-seven, he spent two decades working hard to improve lives, strengthen communities, and bring jobs and opportunity to Hawaii. He championed education and fought for better schools.  Mark believed strongly that every child deserves a chance to learn in a safe and nurturing environment.  He stood up for Hawaii's veterans and worked to combat homelessness among those who were coming home from war.  Concerned about the dangers of climate change and rising sea levels, Mark did more than just support green energy through tax credits; he outfitted his own house with solar panels and drove an electric vehicle to show others how easy it is to live sustainably.  When Mark ran for Congress in 2014 and won, all of us believed he would be making a difference here in Washington for many, many years ahead.  He was one of those who loved being a legislator, who had the experience and talent to get things done in Congress.  All of us are deeply saddened that our country lost Mark at such a young age, with surely many great achievements ahead.  Losing a colleague is always difficult, but with Mark Takai it was more than that--we lost someone who had quickly become our friend, someone as warm as he was dependable, as jovial as he was wise.  My thoughts continue to be with Mark's wife Sami and their two children, Matthew and Kaila.  My heart goes out to them and to the people of Hawaii's first District he served so ably.  I also offer my condolences again to Senators Schatz and Hirono and Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Mark's colleagues in the Hawaii Congressional delegation, who worked closely with him every day.  We will miss him dearly in the halls of Congress, and I thank Representative Gabbard for leading the effort to pay tribute to him in the United States House of Representatives today.                              {time}  1115
