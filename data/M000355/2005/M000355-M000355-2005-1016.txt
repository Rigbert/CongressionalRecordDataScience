 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Kentuckian who has spent much of his life dedicated to improving access to healthcare and educational opportunities for the people of the Commonwealth. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Owensboro native, Mr. Bernard A. ``Tony'' Goetz, as he prepares to begin a new chapter in his life--retirement.  I have had the pleasure of working with Tony on several different occasions, particularly through his tenure at the University of Kentucky where he served as Associate Dean of the College of Medicine and later as Director of Government Relations. In addition, Tony dedicated more than half of his professional career to developing an effective alumni affairs program at UK. He also helped establish the UK Center for Rural Health, create the UK Area Health Education System and launch the McDowell Cancer Network, which later became the Kentucky Community Cancer Program.  Tony's background in healthcare education and advocacy dates back to 1965, when he first served as executive director of the Owensboro Council for Retarded Children. He then served as executive director of the Blue Grass Association for Mental Retardation. In his next two jobs, Tony served as chief executive officer of the Bluegrass Regional Health Planning Council, Inc. and the East Kentucky Health Systems Agency, Inc.  Continuing his pattern of selfless service, Tony most recently worked in the Office of the Governor in Frankfort, KY. For the past two sessions, he has served as liaison between the Governor and the Kentucky General Assembly, combining his legendary affable nature with encyclopedic command of details he helped the Commonwealth move forward on a number of legislative fronts. Though his employers and responsibilities have changed over the years, it is obvious that Tony was instrumental and effective at every position he held. He balanced many duties and he performed each of them with tremendous skill. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring Tony Goetz for his dedicated service. I wish him well in retirement.                          ____________________[Page S7799]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  TRIBUTE TO BERNARD A. ``TONY'' GOETZ  Mr. McCONNELL.
