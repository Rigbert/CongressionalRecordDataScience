President, earlier this year, the widely read, widely respected Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly launched his Nothing But Nets campaign after learning that thousands of Africans--including about 3000 children--die each day from malaria and that simple mosquito netting could save many of these lives.  When I saw recently that his readers had kicked in more than $1.2 million for this effort--enough to buy 150,000 nets--I had to give that dollar total a double-take before it sunk in. His campaign has collected enough to buy thousands and thousands of nets, enough to save thousands and thousands of lives. Those nets, distributed by the United Nations Foundation and the World Health Organization, already are accomplishing that.  What Rick Reilly's crusade shows is that if you give Americans a clear and worthy goal, just about anything is possible.  Government and private relief agencies should be taking notes--and a lesson--from Rick Reilly. There are so many other devastating diseases that we could control or even conquer, if we summon the will.  I ask unanimous consent that Rick Reilly's column about this project be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record.                  [Sports Illustrated, Nov. 28, 2006]                           Nothing But Thanks                            (By Rick Reilly)       Seven months ago you and I found out that each day 3,000      African children die of malaria for the very sad reason that      they can't afford mosquito nets over their beds. Didn't seem      right to us. Sports is nothing but nets--lacrosse nets,      cutting down the nets, New Jersey Nets. So SI started the      Nothing But Nets campaign. Doctors guaranteed that if you      sent in $20, you'd save at least one kid's life, probably      two.       It was the alltime no-brainer. Skip lunch; save a life. Buy      the Top-Flites instead of the Titleists; save a life. Don't      bet on the Redskins; save a life. Nothing to research. No      government to topple. No warlords to fight.       Bless your little hearts, all 17,000-plus of you who      chipped in more than $1.2 million--enough to buy 150,000      nets, which the United Nations Foundation and the World      Health Organization started hanging all over Nigeria, where      kids younger than five are getting murdered by mosquitoes      that come out only at night.       I know, because I saw the nets. Just got back. Feel a      little bad about going without you. After all, it was your      money. So let's pretend it was you who made the trip, not me.       Remember? Everywhere you went, people mistook you for King      Tut. Women got down on their knees and kissed your hand.      Whole towns threw festivals. The king in every ward summoned      you to his one-room, one-lightbulb palace. One pointed his      horsehair scepter at you and pronounced, ``Thank you for dee      nets. All my wives use dem!'' Turns out he has four wives and      23 kids, and they're all under the nets, which is a good      thing because the open sewer that runs right outside his      shack is a kind of one-stop malaria center.       Everywhere you went, 40 people followed: doctors and nurses      and random government suits and guards with AK-47s and vice-     kings. You rode in an eight-truck caravan past unimaginable      squalor, vans on fire and guys selling caskets on the      street--a very good business in Nigeria, where the average      life span is 47. And every time you opened your car door, two      drummers beat a skull-busting welcome. You'd pull into a      school, and the principal would hang a ribbon around your      neck and say something you couldn't hear. ``What?'' you'd      holler over the drums.       "We humbly fumalk apoplia!''       And you'd shrug, and he'd gesture to the 200 kids behind      him, who were chanting something over and over, their faces      beaming. Later you'd find out it was, ``Thank you, white      person!''       And they'd play a soccer game in your honor that featured      nine-year-olds who played like 14-year-olds in the U.S., on      fields full of weeds and trash, with goals made of tree      branches. In three games the closest thing you saw to a boy      with shoes was a set of brothers who wore one sock each.       And they'd hand you the mike, and you'd try to say how      blown away you were and how you wished you could raise 100      times more in donations, because already one hospital in      Nigeria is saying that since the nets went up, outpatient      cases of malaria have dropped from 80 a month to 50. But      they'd all put their hands to their ears and go, ``What?''       When you bribed the drummers into taking a union break, you      finally met the people you'll never forget: the mothers.      Turns out they're nothing but nuts about the nets. In fact,      so many mothers want the nets that to get one, the World      Health Organization requires them to bring their kids in for      a measles vaccination. How often do you get two for one on      diseases?       You met a mother who walked half a day to get a net. You      met a woman who sleeps with her four kids under her net,      maybe because she knows that three out of every 10 child      deaths in Nigeria are from malaria.       In the fetid slums of Lagos you met a woman named Shifawu      Abbas who's had malaria twice. ``Everybody wants the nets      here, everybody!'' she said, beaming. ``My sister visited      from the country and tried to steal it from me!''       Still, as you were climbing back into your air-conditioned      SUV, she yanked back your hand and begged, ``Please? Can I      come with you?''       Sorry, you said.       On the last day you met Noimot Bakare, a mother whose      youngest child died of malaria. She was so grateful that she      trembled as she spoke. ``Malaria is killing our children,''      she said, holding her toddler. ``There is so much need here.      God will bless you for the work you are doing.''       Please go to NothingButNets.net and keep it up.       For that, we humbly fumalk apoplia.                          ____________________[Page S11686]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            FIGHTING MALARIA
