 Thousands will gather on the Capitol grounds for the chance to hear him speak. I think I can speak for every colleague when I say the Senate welcomes him with open arms. We look forward to his visit.                           Government Funding  Madam President, it obviously is going to be a busy week in the Senate. That is true of the legislative issues before us as well. One is government funding.  Earlier this year, a new majority took office with a different outlook on government funding from that of the previous majority. We thought it made sense to actually pass a budget and then to fund it. So we passed a budget for the first time in 6 years. Then we passed all 12 appropriations bills through a committee for the first time in 6 years. Democratic colleagues voted for and praised the appropriations bills in committee. Had we passed the 12 appropriations bills on the floor, it would have funded the government without the dramas of the past. But Democrats didn't change their minds and decided to pursue a regrettable ``filibuster summer'' strategy of blocking all government funding for months. Some blocked bills they had just praised, all with the aim of pushing Washington into another one of these manufactured crises they just cannot seem to shake. It is truly unfortunate, but they have succeeded in making this a reality we now face.  We have to push forward, and we will. I will have much to say on the issue as the week progresses. Discussions on the best way forward are ongoing. Discussions about the character of our country continue as well.  Madam President, tomorrow we will take up a bill the House of Representatives has already passed. It is legislation that would allow America to join the ranks of most civilized nations when it comes to protecting the lives of the most innocent and vulnerable.  We--along with countries like North Korea--are one of just seven nations to allow late-term abortions after 20 weeks, in other words, 5 months, when science and medical research tell us unborn children can feel pain. As the father of three daughters, I find that both tragic and heartbreaking. Many Americans feel the same way. Polls show that both men and women support protections for innocent life at 5 months.  I am asking colleagues to open their hearts and work with us to help defend the defenseless. Help us pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. I will have more to say about this important bill before we take a vote on it tomorrow.
