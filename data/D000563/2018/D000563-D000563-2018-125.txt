President, I thank Senator Kaine, Senator Wicker and Senator Warner for raising this issue. Plans for procurement of Ford-class carriers will be debated in the upcoming conference on the defense appropriations bill. I look forward to the Department of Defense and the Navy providing more information on the proposal, and I will keep Senator Kaine's comments in mind as the discussion continues.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2017.     Hon. James Mattis,     Secretary of Defense,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Mattis: As you continue preparation of the      Fiscal Year 2019 Budget Request for the Department of      Defense, we write to express our support for the block buy of      Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. It is our      understanding that the Navy and industry have been evaluating      the feasibility of block-buy for CVN-80 and CVN-81, as well      as the potential cost savings from such a procurement      strategy. We applaud the Department of Defense's efforts to      examine smarter and more efficient acquisition approaches and      would actively support the Department's pursuit of a block      buy of Ford-class aircraft carriers in Fiscal Year 2019.       Previous block-buys have yielded savings of several percent      of the total cost of the ships when compared to annual      procurements, which could be in excess of $1 billion for two      Ford-class carriers. Total savings could grow to something      closer to $2 billion if the procurement intervals between the      ships are additionally shortened from five-year centers to      three- or four-year centers, which would be consistent with      the Navy's goal of achieving and maintaining the 12-carrier      force called for in the Navy's 355-ship requirement.       In light of the increased budgetary demands placed on the      Department, we believe that revisiting a proven acquisition      method, one that could be executed without reducing funding      for other vital shipbuilding programs, is not only warranted,      but a sound investment.       As recent events in the Pacific have shown, our nation's      carrier fleet is under considerable demand, with 3 of 11      deployed and 7 of 11 carriers underway in recent weeks. A      block-buy of Ford-class will help the Navy achieve its      objective of 12 carriers that better meets combatant      commander requirements and readiness goals to sustain      worldwide operations. Additionally, a block-buy would      continue to signal to the shipbuilding industrial base about      our nation's resolve to field a 355 ship fleet. Over the past      25 years, our shipbuilding industrial base has undergone a      massive consolidation. The community, which used to tap into      more than 17,000 suppliers now relies on fewer than 3,000      across the country. These remaining suppliers would      significantly benefit from the predictability and stability      of a known future workload. We believe the stability offered      by a block-buy approach would enable suppliers to develop      greater efficiencies and invest in their own businesses which      would further benefit other Navy shipbuilding programs as      well.       At the forefront of today's Navy is the Nimitz class      carrier and Virginia-class submarine, both of which are      successful products of block-buy type initiatives. As we look      to the next 50 years, we believe a wise investment of our      precious defense dollars would be in the time-proven      acquisition method of block-buy for our next generation of      aircraft carrier. Thank you for your consideration and      service to our country.           Sincerely,         Roger F. Wicker, U.S. Senator; Tammy Baldwin, U.S.            Senator; Cory Gardner, U.S. Senator; James M. Inhofe,            U.S. Senator; Marco Rubio, U.S. Senator; Luther            Strange, U.S. Senator; Sherrod Brown, U.S. Senator; Tim            Kaine, U.S. Senator; Tom Cotton, U.S. Senator; Mazie K.
