Mr. Speaker, the American people continue to wait for real campaign finance reform. The need for campaign finance reform is clear. Both parties raised millions and millions of dollars last year, twice as much as they raised just 4 years ago. The Senate is scheduling a vote on campaign finance reform; the President is waiting for a deal. Two years ago, just 2 years ago, the Speaker shook hands with the President on the promise of campaign finance reform. What happened to that promise? What happened to that vow? What happened to his word?  The American people deserve better, Mr. Speaker, than to be stonewalled, put down, put off and ignored. They deserve to be heard. They deserve to be respected. The Speaker is the only one in Washington standing in the way of campaign finance reform.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to end the delay. Schedule a vote on campaign finance reform today.                          ____________________
