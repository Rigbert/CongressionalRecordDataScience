 President, as the United States observes National Police Week, I believe this to be an appropriate time to recognize the outstanding work performed by the men and women of the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS).  As the security and law enforcement arm of the Department of State, the DSS, since 1916, has protected U.S. diplomatic installations and personnel around the world as well as providing critical security and law enforcement services within the United States. Presently, 260 DSS special agents are serving in over 140 of our embassies and consulates throughout the world. Additionally, 500 special agents are assigned to offices throughout the United States and work closely with their counterparts in federal, state, and municipal law enforcement organizations.  DSS special agents have been in the forefront of the fight against international terrorism and transnational crime. In 1995, DSS special agents assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, working closely with Pakistani Authorities, were instrumental in the apprehension of Ramzi Yousef, a terrorist wanted in connection with the World Trade Center bombing in New York City. DSS agents had the lead role in debriefing the original informant, coordinating surveillance of Yousef's activities, and entered Yousef's room alongside Pakistani police to effect his arrest. Subsequently, Yousef was convicted in New York of his heinous act of terrorism and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.  The DSS also runs effective Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Narcotics awards programs in which it offers large cash rewards of up to $4 million. In 1995, this program, along with the efforts of DSS agents throughout Latin America, helped to bring about the downfall of the Cali drug kingpins of Colombia, apprehending eight high ranking members of that organization. The DSS is currently playing a very key role in attempting to apprehend suspects involved in the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie Scotland, as well as Mexican drug trafficking.  The DSS also plays an important role in ensuring the security of our borders through investigations of falsified U.S. passports and U.S. visas. In the U.S., work in this area complements the work of state and local authorities as well as other federal agencies. This role enables the DSS to utilize versatile charges that enable it to apprehend fugitives and return them to various jurisdictions throughout the United States.  In my own state of California, DSS agents were instrumental in establishing a verification system involving possession of U.S. visas, whereby many illegal immigrants have been identified who were previously, and fraudulently, claiming and receiving medical and welfare benefits from the state of California. The California Department of Health Services estimates that this system saved California taxpayers over $2 million in 1997 alone.  Additionally, the DSS has conducted extensive training programs for foreign police officials, both in the U.S. and abroad, which over the last decade have resulted in over 18,000 foreign police officers receiving training in anti-terrorism and anti-crime skills. By enhancing the capabilities of these police elements, the DSS is increasing the capacity of other countries to render assistance to the United States in our continuing struggle against international terrorism and crime.  Furthermore, the technical expertise of the DSS' security engineering personnel has enabled the nation's business to be transacted safely and securely in hostile environmentsthroughout the world. U.S. diplomatic installations rely on the ability of the DSS to provide a secure area in which to conduct sensitive functions. These programs provide the secure technical foundation in computer and information security which is so necessary in today's technological age.  The DSS has continually provided crucial support services for our foreign policy and law enforcement objectives. Their contributions have been recognized by the granting of heroism awards by organizations such as the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA) and the International Organization of Chiefs of Police (IACP).  In the first session of Congress, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999 (H.R. 1757), approved the inclusion of members of the DSS under the provisions of the Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP). A separate proposal, H.R. 633, would also include these personnel under the law enforcement retirement provisions. These measures, which provide long overdue parity for DSS personal with federal law enforcement colleagues, will be important in determining the future role of DSS agents.  I would like to thank the Diplomatic Security Service for the tireless role that they have played in combating terrorism and transnational crime as well as helping to protect U.S. businesses, embassies, and all the branches of the U.S. government represented abroad. They have continually provided crucial services in support of our foreign policy and law enforcement objectives, often at substantial risk to their own lives.                          ____________________
