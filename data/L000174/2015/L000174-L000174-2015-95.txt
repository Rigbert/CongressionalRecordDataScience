President, last month, the Supreme Court took a significant step towards a more perfect union when it ruled that every American has the right to marry the person they love and have that lawful marriage recognized. It was a victory for love and justice over bigotry and intolerance. This historic milestone should be celebrated, but we must remember that the journey is not complete. The Fourteenth Amendment's principles of liberty and equality safeguard all couples' right to marry, and also serves as a bulwark against discriminatory treatment in the other aspects of everyday life, including where we live, where we work, and our interactions with the government.  While LGBT Americans are now able to marry the person they love, they continue to experience discrimination in many other aspects of their lives. Achieving full equality means that LGBT individuals should be able to provide security for their families without fear that they will be fired from their jobs or denied housing. It means that a restaurant cannot refuse to serve an LGBT couple because the owner disapproves of that couple's relationship.  These are not abstract concepts. In our country today, LGBT Americans continue to experience discrimination, and it must end. In a June 27 article in the New York Times, entitled ``Next Fight for Gay Rights: Bias in Jobs and Housing,'' the author Erik Eckholm provides clear documentation of such discrimination. A landlord in East Nashville, TN, refused to rent his apartment to two women in a loving relationship after he learned of their partnership because it made him ``uncomfortable.'' He refused their rental application even after they offered to raise the rent by $150. A transgender individual was fired from her job as an industrial electrician because, according to her boss, her identity was becoming ``too much of a distraction,'' in spite of the fact that she was doing ``great work.''  If such discrimination were based on race, religion, sex, or national origin, these individuals would be protected under Federal law. But because Federal civil rights law, as well as many state and local laws, do not provide explicit protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity, these individuals continue to experience discrimination without any legal protection. Their stories show us that LGBT Americans continue to be treated as second class citizens in their daily lives.  That is why I am an original cosponsor of the Equality Act. The bill would amend existing Federal law to provide explicit civil rights protections for LGBT individuals. This non-discrimination bill would ensure that sexual orientation and gender identity are protected under Federal law in the same way that race, sex, religion, national origin, and disability are also protected classes. The result would be to protect LGBT individuals against discrimination in public accommodations, federally-funded programs, employment, housing, education, credit, and other aspects of daily life. This is the kind of equality and security that all American families should enjoy.  I am proud that Vermont was one of the first States to pass a comprehensive law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 1992, and also passed a law explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender identity in 2007. All Vermonters are protected from discrimination in employment, places of public accommodation, housing, credit, and other services. This is what we need on the Federal level as well.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article referenced above be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, June 27, 2015]          Next Fight for Gay Rights: Bias in Jobs and Housing                           (By Erik Eckholm)       Exhilarated by the Supreme Court's endorsement of same-sex      marriage, gay rights leaders have turned their sights to what      they see as the next big battle: obtaining federal, state and      local legal protections in employment, housing, commerce and      other arenas, just like those barring discrimination based on      race, religion, sex and national origin.       The proposals pit advocates against many of the same      religious conservatives who opposed legalizing same-sex      marriage, and who now see the protection of what they call      religious liberty as their most urgent task. These opponents      argue that antidiscrimination laws will inevitably be used to      force religious people and institutions to violate their      beliefs, whether by providing services for same-sex weddings      or by employing gay men and lesbians in church-related jobs.       Nationally, antidiscrimination laws for gay people are a      patchwork with major geographic inequities, said Brad Sears,      executive director of the Williams Institute at the School of      Law of the University of California, Los Angeles. ``Those who      don't live on the two coasts or in the Northeast have been      left behind in terms of legal protection,'' he said.       At least 22 states bar discrimination based on sexual      orientation, and most of them also offer protections to      transgender people.       Tennessee is one of the majority of states that do not bar      such discrimination. There, in East Nashville, Tiffany Cannon      and Lauren Horbal thought they had found the perfect house to      share with a friend, and the landlord seemed ready to rent      when they applied in April.       Then he called them to ask what their relationship with      each other was, Ms. Horbal, 26, recalled.       She said that when the landlord learned that she and Ms.      Cannon, 25, were partners, he said, ``I'm not comfortable      with that.'' He refused to process their application, even      after they offered to raise their rent by $150, to $700 a      month, Ms. Horbal said.       The women, both restaurant workers, are still looking for a      place to live.       In many states, some local governments have      antidiscrimination laws, but they are often weak or poorly      enforced, said Ruth Colker, an expert on discrimination law      at Moritz College of Law at Ohio State University.       ``Typically, the penalty for violating a city ordinance is      more akin to a traffic violation,'' she said. ``State-level      penalties can be much more significant.''       As they push for more state and local safeguards, rights      advocates are also starting a long-term campaign for a broad      federal shield that would give sexual orientation and gender      identity protected status under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.       The goal is to achieve overlapping local, state and federal      laws, an approach that has proved effective in curbing other      kinds of discrimination, said Sarah Warbelow, legal     director at the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy      group. Visible laws can not only permit lawsuits, she said,      but also deter employers and others from biased behavior.       Although a majority of states lack such protections,      federal orders and court decisions, especially in employment,      are gradually offering more safeguards.       With executive orders last year, President Obama barred      discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender      identity by federal agencies and federal contractors,      including companies employing about one in five American      workers, Mr. Sears said.       At the same time, the Equal Employment Opportunity      Commission, charged with enforcing federal law in the      workplace, has determined that discrimination against gay      men, lesbians and transgender people amounts to illegal sex      discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and      it is bringing or endorsing lawsuits under that provision.       That application of existing law is still being tested in      court and is more established for transgender workers than      for gay and lesbian workers. In the past two years, the      agency has successfully pursued 223 cases involving gay or      transgender people who faced workplace harassment or other      discrimination, gaining settlements or court orders, said      Chai R. Feldblum, one of the agency's five commissioners.       Patricia Dawson of Pangburn, Ark., 46, hopes to join that      list. Ms. Dawson, who grew up as Steven, had more than 15      years' experience as an industrial electrician and had been a      rising employee at H & H Electric, an industrial contractor,      for four years when she informed her boss in 2012 that she      was transitioning to female and had changed her name.       The boss, she said in a Title VII-based lawsuit brought by      the American Civil Liberties Union, told her to keep her      plans secret and not to ``rock the boat'' with clients.       When her identity became obvious and gossip raged at the      work site, she said, the boss said to her, ``I'm sorry,      Steve, you do great work, but you are too much of a      distraction, and I am going to have to let you go.''       Ms. Dawson said she was devastated by her treatment. ``I      love what I do; I get the greatest joy out of fixing      things,'' she said in an interview. ``Treating us as second-     class citizens, it's hurtful.''       Civil rights groups worked for years for an employment      antidiscrimination act, an effort that was blocked by House      Republicans and collapsed this year over discord about      religious exemptions. Buoyed by the rapid advance of same-sex      marriage, these groups are now determined to seek a far wider      law.       ``I think there's a very strong consensus now among      advocacy groups that we need a broader bill that puts      discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender      identity on the same footing as race, religion and gender,''      said Shannon P. Minter, legal director at the National Center      for Lesbian Rights.       ``No court decision could accomplish all of that,'' Mr.      Minter said.       Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said he planned      to introduce a bill within the next few months to add      protections for gays and transgender people to the Civil      Rights Act.       ``People are going to realize that you can get married in      the morning and be fired from your job or refused entry to a      restaurant in the afternoon,'' Mr. Merkley said. ``That is      unacceptable.''       But the effort will take years, he said, because it appears      unlikely that Republican committee heads in Congress will      advance such a bill.       In the emerging state-by-state battles for      antidiscrimination laws, the strongest opposition has come      from conservative religious groups that have been alarmed by      a few well-publicized cases, like that of a florist in      Washington State who was fined for refusing to provide      flowers for a same-sex wedding.       ``We've got good reason to be concerned about these laws,      because they've been found to be coercive where they've been      enacted,'' said Greg Scott, vice president of communications      at Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal group.       Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious      Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said      that it was wrong to equate religious objections to      homosexual behavior with racism, and that proposed      antidiscrimination laws could ``do more harm than good.''       ``Some have suggested that we work out a compromise,      addressing housing and employment discrimination and      protecting religious freedom for those who dissent from the      ideas of the sexual revolution,'' he said. ``But I have yet      to see any proposal that would do both of those things      well.''       There is some common ground. For example, under the Civil      Rights Act, religious organizations have the right to give      preference in hiring to those of their faith, Ms. Warbelow of      the Human Rights Campaign noted. In housing, federal rules      exempt owner-occupied rentals with four or fewer units from      discrimination provisions.       ``We wouldn't expect these things to change,'' Ms. Warbelow      said. ``We really want L.G.B.T. people to be protected the      same as those in other protected categories.''       But some disagreements, especially involving private      businesses, may be unbridgeable. The major gay and civil      rights groups are united in their opposition to ``religious      liberty'' bills, a priority of conservative Christian      advocates, which would allow religious vendors to refuse to      serve gay couples or wedding celebrations.       ``Religious liberty does not authorize discrimination,''      said James D. Esseks, the director of gay rights issues at      the American Civil Liberties Union.       ``It's profoundly harmful to walk into a business open to      the public and be told, `No, we don't actually serve your      kind here,' '' he said. ``That's not how America works.''
