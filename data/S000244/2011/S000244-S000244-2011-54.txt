Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2681, the Cement Sector Regulatory Relief Act, and H.R. 2250, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Regulatory Relief Act, which are common-sense bills that will reduce uncertainty in the marketplace, and allow businesses to compete and grow.  We can no longer continue with the failed economic policies of the past couple of years. As was seen with the nearly $1 trillion failed stimulus program from last year, throwing money at our economic problem does not create jobs. Instead, we need to tackle the heart of the issue and create an environment that attracts new businesses and allows them to successfully compete in our global economy. Industries across all sectors have been reluctant to expand, in large part due to the uncertainty over the slew of heavy-handed government regulations. I believe reducing and eliminating these costly regulations will stimulate confidence and allow small businesses to grow and be successful.  Today and tomorrow, Members will have an opportunity to vote on legislation to delay two of these job-killing regulations and give industry officials more time to come into compliance. H.R. 2681 and H.R. 2250 are two important bills that will give the EPA 15 months to re-propose and finalize regulations on boilers, process heaters, incinerators, and cement manufacturing facilities. Additionally, these bills instruct the EPA to establish new rules that are actually achievable, and are in the least burdensome regulatory standard.  The Cement MACT and Boiler MACT rules are two examples of over-regulation by the government that are estimated to cost billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of jobs. The Boiler MACT regulations are estimated to affect approximately 200,000 boilers, and have a compliance cost of approximately $14.4 billion, threatening 200,000 jobs. Even the EPA has admitted that more time was needed to consider this rule, given the outpouring of concerns they received from industry officials. The impact of the Boiler MACT regulations will be felt across a wide range of industry sectors including agriculture, chemical, biomass power, forest and paper, refining and municipal utilities. I believe we need to give the EPA more time to reconsider this rule, and we must also give those affected by it a reasonable amount of time to comply.  Additionally, the Cement MACT regulations are another set of rules that will have major implications on jobs. According to the Portland Cement Association (PCA), the likely cost of compliance for the cement industry is estimated at $3.4 billion, nearly half of the industry's annual revenues. It will cost an additional $2 billion to comply with incinerator requirements. The PCA estimates that almost 20 percent of the domestic industry will potentially shutdown due to these regulations. In addition to the jobs lost by the plant closures, the effect of rising cement prices on our already struggling construction industry is cause for serious concern.  I am mindful of the fact that we must do our part to preserve our environment for future generations, which includes reasonable environmental regulations. However, it is troubling to see the EPA's total disregard for our current economic situation, and its push for unrealistic and unattainable goals that are stifling economic growth. Just last month, President Obama addressed a joint session of Congress demanding that Congress pass legislation to restore confidence in our economy and create jobs. I am pleased that House Republicans have once again brought to the floor legislation that does just that. I strongly support passage of H.R. 2681 and H.R. 2250, and urge my colleagues to support these bills.                          ____________________
