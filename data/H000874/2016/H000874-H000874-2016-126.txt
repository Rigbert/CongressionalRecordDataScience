 Madam Speaker, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for leading today's Special Order on the important issue of the vacancy on the Supreme Court and the Senate Republicans' unprecedented obstruction of the President's nominee.  That nominee, of course, is Judge Merrick Garland of the U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He is one of the most highly qualified nominees ever. Let me repeat that. He is one of the most highly qualified nominees ever to be put forward for a seat on the Nation's highest court. He is a respected former prosecutor and is well regarded as an appellate judge. He was confirmed to his present position in 1997 by a vote of 76-23, with a majority of Republicans voting in favor.  Madam Speaker, in fact, notwithstanding the opposition of some Republicans, they articulated--in particular, Mr. Grassley, who is now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--that Judge Garland was eminently qualified and would be good for an appointment to another court but that he was not for expanding the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia, and it was for that reason alone that he voted against Mr. Garland.  Madam Speaker, today is the 21st anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. Judge Garland, as Deputy Assistant Attorney General during the Clinton administration, oversaw the successful investigation into the bombing and the prosecution of its perpetrators. His insistence on traveling to see the remains of the Murrah Building in the days after the attack and his hands-on approach to the investigation and prosecution won him praise across the political spectrum.  The Constitution is clear: the President has a responsibility to nominate Justices to the Court, and the Senate has the ability to advise and consent, but it also has the responsibility to provide its advice and consent with regard to these nominees. It can, of course, reject a nominee, and it can advise and consent to the appointment of a nominee; but the Senate has chosen to do neither. It has chosen to do nothing. It has chosen to perpetrate gridlock in the Supreme Court of the United States. President Obama met his responsibilities. Now the Senate must do the same. It needs to do its work. Senate Republicans can't just pick and choose when to do their jobs.  Last month, we saw the real-life consequences of an eight-member Supreme Court as it split 4-4 in a key case concerning the right of the teachers to organize and collect union dues. Madam Speaker, I was pleased with that particular outcome because the lower court had ruled in a way that I thought was appropriate. It is an example, however, of a case too important to be the result of a default to the lower court because of a split bench. In cases like these, the Court cannot set precedent. The American people, however, deserve a Court that operates at full strength so that it can establish precedent.  We cannot wait until after the election to vote on Judge Garland's nomination. Senate Republicans, Madam Speaker, continue to insist that, somehow, their obstruction is based in precedent--that a nomination ought not to be made in the final year of a President's term. Ranking Member Conyers, the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, just spoke to that. Nowhere in our Constitution is the President's authority limited by the number of days or months into or remaining in his or her term. The President is the President from January 20 until January 20 4 years later. This is yet another example of congressional Republicans holding this particular President to a different and unfair standard.  The Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy, as has been said, during the final year of President Reagan's second term. Thirteen other Justices have been confirmed during Presidential election years, including Louis Brandeis and Benjamin Cardozo--two of the great members of the Supreme Court of the United States.  During the Kennedy confirmation process in 1988, President Ronald Reagan said: ``The Federal judiciary is too important to be made a political football.''  I would hope that Senate Republicans, who often cite President Reagan as a guide for the kind of leaders they want to be, would heed this admonition. Some have had the political courage to reject their colleagues' disrespectful approach of refusing to even meet with Judge Garland. I congratulate them. They are doing their jobs.                              {time}  1615  Not only should all Members of the Senate give him the courtesy of a meeting, they ought to do their jobs as well and not stand in the way of hearings and consideration.  The Senate's duty to advise and consent certainly, Madam Speaker, was not envisioned by the Founders to be optional or that the Senate could effectively pocket veto a nomination to the Court. The Senate ought to do its job.  I don't think a single Founder would have conceived of the possibility of the Court receiving a nomination pursuant to the President's constitutional responsibility and authority and simply say: Too bad, Mr. President. Too bad, Supreme Court. We are not going to consider that nomination.  No Founding Father would have conceived that to be possible, and they, therefore, did not provide for a time limit in which the consideration could occur.  I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, that, if we meet our oath to the Constitution of the United States to uphold the laws of the United States, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the Supreme Court of the United States is fully manned so that it can, in fact, assure the faithful execution and adherence to the laws and Constitution of this country.  I thank my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for leading this Special Order tonight on a subject of profound consequence to all Americans.
