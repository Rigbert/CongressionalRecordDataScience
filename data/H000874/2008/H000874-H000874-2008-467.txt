Yow on her selection as the next President of the Division 1A Athletic Directors' Association. Ms. Yow is the first woman to fill this national leadership role, responsible for coordinating the efforts of collegiate athletic directors at 1,600 colleges and universities across the United States and Canada.  The Association's Executive Director, Dutch Baughman, praised Ms. Yow as ``an extremely capable and effective leader.'' He added that ``She has not only influenced the lives of over 450 athletics administrators over the past seven years, but she has been evaluated by those [fellow administrators] as the best.''  After 14 years of success at the University of Maryland, her national role is well-earned. Overseeing 27 sports and more than 700 student-athletes, Debbie Yow has built a reputation as one of America's most accomplished athletic leaders. Under her leadership, Maryland teams have won 17 national championships, while maintaining balanced budgets and a high graduation rate of 85 percent. In fact, last year's graduation rate was the highest in the history of Maryland athletics and the best of any public institution in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Ms. Yow has excelled as an educator, an administrator, and a fundraiser, and has repeatedly been ranked among the 20 most influential people in collegiate athletics. At the same time, she has served in public life as an advocate for women's sports and the protection of Title IX.  Her new position is the capstone on a career dedicated to the highest purposes of college athletics: Debbie Yow's work shows that ``student-athlete'' is far from an empty expression. I thank her for all that she has done for our State, its flagship university, and its students. And I wish her the best of luck, both in her continuing duties as University of Maryland Athletic Director and as a voice for athletic directors throughout North America.                          ____________________
