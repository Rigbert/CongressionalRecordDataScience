Speaker, I just wanted to add my comments. For those of us who were here that tragic day, the perpetrator of that horrendous act was a schizophrenic who was off his medicine, untreated, and drove three-quarters of the way across this country to commit those heinous crimes.  Before this House today are two bills, one authored by a Republican from Pennsylvania, Tim Murphy, and another authored by a Democrat from Arizona, Ron Barber.  All these years have passed, and we have never yet brought to this floor a measure that would make a difference in this country for those who suffer with mental illness and some of whom, unfortunately, obtain weapons.  I believe that we have a moment in this House to do something exceptional, and I hope it can happen in this Congress.                          ____________________
