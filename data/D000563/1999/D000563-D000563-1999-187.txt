I thank him for that.  Here is the question: Should we in the Senate be kicking off a new century by announcing to America, when it comes to education, we will lay off 1,200 teachers in Illinois?  I will ask another question: Should we announce to America that in terms of education as a priority in the new century, we will kick it off by laying off 29,000 teachers? Would the Senator from Washington respond to that question.
