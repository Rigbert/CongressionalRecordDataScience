Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the amendment offered by the gentlemen from Colorado and Massachusetts.  I do believe, given the work of the subcommittee, that the dollars that are contained in it represent an attempt to ensure that, looking down the road with the hopeful ratification of the New START Treaty, we will be consistent with those funding levels that will be required.                              {time}  1540  While a world without nuclear weapons would be my preference and while the U.S. must maintain its deterrent capability today, we should also maintain the capabilities necessary to ensure that they are safe and effective.  The gentleman from Massachusetts rightfully asked are there any savings that we can see under the defense accounts, whether at the Department of Defense or the Department of Energy. And I would point out one of the eliminations in this year's budget are moneys for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement Nuclear Facility.  So I would again emphasize to my colleagues that the subcommittee try to look at this account with great specificity to remove those items that were not necessary and to spend our tax dollars wisely.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
