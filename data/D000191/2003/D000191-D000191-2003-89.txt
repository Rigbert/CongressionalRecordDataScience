  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, congratulation to President Bush on a perfect record: 32 straight months of job loss; 32 straight months of industrial manufacturing job loss and yet another record trade deficit. This is something that will be hard for anybody to match, the disastrous trade policies of this Nation.  We are hemorrhaging $1.5 billion a day of wealth from the United States overseas, $1 million a minute, more than 1,000 jobs a day are being exported. The President likes to talk about the wealth and benefits of exporting. Yes, there are tremendous wealth and benefits in exporting, particularly exporting jobs at the bidding of multi-national corporations who are so generous when campaign time comes around.  Yes, they are feigning concern down there at the White House because they know there is an election coming and the money cannot take care of all the problems. So they are pretending they do not know where these jobs have gone and they have decided to change the flow chart at the Commerce Department and make one politically appointed bureaucrat responsible for finding out where they went and rectifying the situation.  All we need now is a new trade policy.                          ____________________
