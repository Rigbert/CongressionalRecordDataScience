President, Senator Reid, the majority leader, is absent today. I will be acting in his place. Senator Reid called me this morning. He sounded good. We look forward to his speedy recovery.  Following my remarks and those of the Republican leader, the Senate will resume executive session to consider the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to be Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security postcloture.  The next hour will be equally divided and controlled between Senators Carper and Coburn. There will be six rollcall votes at approximately 10:15 a.m.                          ____________________
