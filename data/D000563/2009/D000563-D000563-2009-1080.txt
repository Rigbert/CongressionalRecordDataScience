President, I would amend that unanimous consent request. I wish to amend that to allow 5 minutes for the Senator from Louisiana, and 5 minutes for Senator Crapo, and then the Senate resume legislative session and resume consideration of H.R. 627; and at that point, Senator Menendez be recognized for 10 minutes.
