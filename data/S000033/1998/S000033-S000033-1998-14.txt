 Speaker, let me start by saying I voted against the absurd balanced budget agreement last year because it cut Medicare by $115 billion. That is how it was paid for. We are suffering from it right now.  More importantly, I rise in strong opposition to the Republican plan, which takes money from the social security trust fund in order to provide tax breaks, 6 weeks before an election. Let us be clear, the so-called surplus this year that the Republicans are taking from is made up completely from the social security surplus. Without that $100 billion social security surplus, the government this year is in deficit, not to mention a $5 trillion national debt.  It seems to me to be the essence of hypocrisy for some Republicans to go running around the country saying that we have to privatize the social security system because it is going broke, and the next day to be taking money from the very same social security system.  Mr. Speaker, if we want targeted tax breaks for the middle class, fair enough, take it from corporate welfare and the huge loopholes that exist for billionaires.
