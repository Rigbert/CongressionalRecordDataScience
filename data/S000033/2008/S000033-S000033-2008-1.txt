 President, this bailout, caused by Wall Street's greed and irresponsibility, may cost as much as $700 billion. The simple question is: Who is going to be paying for it?  Today, in America, the top 1 percent earn more income than the bottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent have more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. Since President Bush has been in office, the middle class has seen a significant decline in their standard of living while the top 400 individuals have seen a $670 billion increase in their wealth.  What this amendment does is impose a 10-percent surtax on a household that makes $1 million a year, which raises over $300 billion in 5 years. Under this amendment, the bottom 99.7 percent of Americans will not pay 1 penny for this bailout.  The middle class has had nothing to do with causing this crisis. They should not have to pay for it, and I ask for a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.
