Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arthur B. Campbell of Wakefield, RI for his 31 years of dedicated service to the South Kingstown Public School System. As a teacher and as superintendent for the past 12 years, Mr. Campbell has been an outstanding educational leader.  In 1965, Mr. Campbell began his career in the South Kingstown Public Schools as a junior high instructor. While serving in this capacity, Mr. Campbell also became president of the local teachers' union, leading the first strike in the town's history. He was instrumental in forming the Rhode Island National Education Association's first political action group.  Mr. Campbell was promoted to director of instruction in 1972, and then to the post of superintendent of schools in 1984. During his tensure in this position, he guided the district through an unprecedented period of population growth. With his vision and professionalism, the district met this challenge without compromising student safety or academic integrity. His leadership made possible the emergence of modern educational facilities with dynamic and capable faculty, and students who rank among our State and our Nation's best and brightest.  In addition, known for his expertise and leadership in the school budget process, Mr. Campbell has ensured the efficient operation of school department finances, providing a healthy educational future for all South Kingstown schools.  In today's increasingly competitive job market, a quality education is absolutely necessary for success and advancement. Mr. Campbell's proactive approach toward achieving educational excellence has made these opportunities available to our young people. His accomplishments clearly demonstrate that an investment in education is indeed an investment in the future.  Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of Arthur Campbell's retirement, I respectfully ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating this outstanding administrator and educator.                          ____________________
