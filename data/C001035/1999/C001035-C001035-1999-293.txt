President, we are on the edge of an exciting breakthrough in the treatment and ultimately the prevention and cure of diabetes. That is why I am so excited by the possibility of a significant increase in research in this area.  As the chairman of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have had the opportunity to visit some of the leading-edge research labs that are doing work on diabetes. I have visited Jackson Labs in Bar Harbor, MA, where very exciting research is ongoing into the causes of both type I and type II diabetes. I am very proud of the contributions made by these distinguished scientists in my home State.  In addition, I have had the pleasure of visiting the JDF Foundation Center at Harvard Medical School, where there is also tremendous research underway. I am convinced, with the kind of increased commitment called for by my resolution, and indicated in the Appropriations Committee's report, that we can in fact break through and reach a cure for this devastating disease.  Mr. President, I do not know whether there is any other request for time. It is my understanding the vote is scheduled for 9:30. We have reached that hour.  Mr. President, seeing no one seeking further time to speak, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment.
