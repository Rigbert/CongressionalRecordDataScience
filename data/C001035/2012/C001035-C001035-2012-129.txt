As always, it has been a great pleasure to work with him to produce this bill. I also wish to commend the author of the bill, Senator Scott Brown, who was the first to introduce this legislation in the Senate, and also praise the work of the Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, for her contributions.  The STOCK Act is intended to affirm that Members of Congress are not exempt from our laws prohibiting insider trading. There are disputes among the experts about whether this legislation is necessary, but we feel we should send a very strong message to the American public that we understand Members of Congress are not exempt from insider trading laws, and that is exactly what this bill does.  We need to reassure a skeptical public that we understand elective office is a place for public service, not for private gain. Underscoring that important message is clearly the purpose of this bill, and that is why I support it.  I thank the Chair. Amendments Nos. 1478, 1477, 1474, 1476, 1490, 1492, and 1503 Withdrawn
