Chairman, I agree with my colleague, the gentleman from California [Mr. Berman]. We do need a verification for employers, and we will be voting on that later today. But in the meantime, we make decisions here to cut spending both nationally and locally on programs that are important to all American citizens in this country. Now we have an amendment to pay tax dollars to people who have entered this country illegally. All I can say, Mr. Chairman, that is wrong, and we should oppose this amendment as it comes forward.
