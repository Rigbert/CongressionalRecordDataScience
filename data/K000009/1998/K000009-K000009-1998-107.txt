Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Ladies Literary Club of Sylvania, Ohio in my district. The club proudly celebrates its centennial this year, with a special event on October 14, 1998. Members past and present will celebrate the 100th year of active study of the fine arts, with a luncheon and historical presentation.  In October of 1898, four women who lived in Sylvania met in the home of Mrs. Walter Cutler, the wife of a Congregational Minister, to begin the study of Oliver Wendall Holmes' ``The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table''. Regularly since that day, the ladies of Sylvania continued to gather to discuss works of literature. They meet once a month. September through May, with the membership by invitation only remaining at thirty.  The purpose of the club since its inception has been ``to read, listen, share, and be aware of the world around us.'' The ladies of the club live by words from Audobon: ``Use the talents you possess; the woods would be silent if no birds sang but those who could sing best.'' In keeping with the group's first study, a message from an 1884 Address given by Oliver Wendall Holmes carries this motto a step further, and captures the spirit of the Ladies Literary Club of Sylvania, Ohio. Holmes noted, ``. . . as life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.'' Through what is certainly lively discussion not only of arts and literature but also the events of the day, the ladies of the club have celebrated and participated in their times, their discussions weaving their way through the fabric of each of their lives in ways both big and small and perhaps even they didn't always realize. Their discussions may have helped shape their actions, and their actions may have helped shaped their times.  It is truly a gift that the Ladies Literary Club of Sylvania, Ohio have continued for 100 years. It is a privilege to be among members of an organization which, in the words of one of its members, ``will have touched three centuries''. I wish both past and present members of the Ladies Literary Club of Sylvania, Ohio my heartiest congratulations on this momentous achievement, and wish them well as they are poised to begin a new century.                          ____________________
