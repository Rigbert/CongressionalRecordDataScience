Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the appointment of my good friend, Mrs. Sally Jameson as executive director of the Charles County Chamber of Commerce.  For the past six years, Sally has been affiliated with the Charles County Chamber of Commerce; five of those years she served the legislative committee.  Prior to her appointment, Sally was the director of the Waldorf Jaycee Community Center since it opened in 1992. Today, it has evolved as a focal point for Charles County and is currently undergoing expansion.  Mr. Speaker, she is working with the Charles County Public Schools on a student exchange with students in Walldorf, Germany and with the Charles County Commissioners on a twin-city establishment between Waldorf, Maryland and Walldorf, Germany.  Sally is a life-long resident of Charles County and resides in Bryantown with her husband, Gene and two children, Donnie and Michelle.  Mr. Speaker, I am convinced that Sally will be a tremendous asset to the Chamber of Commerce and southern Maryland. I am proud to be her representative in Congress and I ask you and the remainder of my colleagues to join with me in acknowledging the appointment of this fine American.                          ____________________
