  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Bush-Cheney energy policy has led America to a dead end, increasing dependence on imported oil and price gouging by big oil companies.  The new direction in energy policy to be considered here today puts America on a new path to energy independence and sustainability. It will be great for American consumers, saving billions at the pump; our businesses; our economy. And it will be great for the environment.  But it will be even better for millions of Americans in rural counties acrossAmerica. This bill also includes funding for critical county school payments. 780 counties in 42 States will get critical funding for law enforcement, search and rescue, and struggling rural schools.  My district, the Fourth Congressional District of Oregon, will avert a disaster if this legislation is adopted.  I thank the Democratic leadership for leading us in a new direction on energy and fulfilling their commitment to rural counties.  The ball was dropped by the Bush administration and by the Republicans. We're taking it up for all America here today by passing this bill.                          ____________________
