President, just so the Record is straight on law enforcement officers, it is interesting that there was no contact of anybody on this side. Senator Ashcroft said the reason he stopped Judge White was because of that urging of law enforcement groups. But then subsequently, press reports and then the reports by the law enforcement officials themselves and Senator Ashcroft's own testimony at his hearing contradicted that; that he had instigated and orchestrated the groups' opposition to Ronnie White. I am not suggesting Ronnie White was defeated because he was an African American, but it would be hard for anybody not to know he was insofar as that was mentioned at great length in the debate the day before and the debate just before the vote by those who were on the floor debating it.  I yield the floor.
