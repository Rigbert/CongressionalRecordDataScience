Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in the 106th Congress, the Bring Them Home Alive Act was enacted as Public Law 106-484. This law, sponsored by Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell and the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Hefley), offers refugee status to any national of Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, China, or any of the independent states of the former Soviet Union, who personally delivers into the custody of the United States Government a living American prisoner of war from the Vietnam War. It grants similar status to any nationalof North Korea, China, or states of the former Soviet Union who differs delivers a living American prisoner of war from the Korean War. Information regarding the act is broadcast by the International Broadcasting Bureau over the Voice of America and other broadcast services.  The Bring Them Home Alive Act signals our continuing dedication to all the Americans who served in the Vietnam and Korean wars. It shall be needed until all of our soldiers are accounted for. This bill amends the Bring Them Home Alive Act to broaden its coverage for the Persian Gulf War and any future hostilities in Iraq. There have been recent reports that Michael Speicher, a Navy pilot shot down over Iraq in 1991, may still be in Iraqi hands. We owe it to him and to all those who may be called to serve in the coming months to pass this bill.  The bill provides refugee status to a national of Iraq or a nation in the greater Middle East who personally delivers into the custody of the United States Government a living American prisoner of war from the Persian Gulf War or any successor conflict. To receive refugee status, the alien cannot be eligible for asylum on account of being a criminal, a terrorist, or a danger to the security of the United States. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
