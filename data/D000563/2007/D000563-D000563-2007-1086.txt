 Mr. DeMINT. Could I make one additional comment?  Again, I appreciate the Senator's remarks, and obviously we don't want to tie the hands of Congress unnecessarily, but when we are speaking of earmarks--and we defined it in this amendment ourselves. When we take this bill that was created for the purpose of improving competitiveness in America and we earmark, which means we target it to a specific State, locality, or congressional district other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process--when we take what we have done and basically pervert it into a system where I want it to go to South Carolina, or the Senator wants it to go to Tennessee, that has nothing to do with the original intent of the bill, we call that an earmark. We would like to prevent that if we could with this one bill, but I appreciate the courtesy of both managers to allow us to explain. I hope we will have an opportunity to bring it up and offer it later.  I yield the floor.
