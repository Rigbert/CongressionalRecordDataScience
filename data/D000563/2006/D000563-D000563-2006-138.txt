President, I would like to say to the majority leader by way of a question that I have been working with Senator Chambliss, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, on the reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and we have worked out what I consider to be a fair apportionment of time and amendments. We have been ready to go, prepared, waiting for that propitious moment, hoping that the majority leader would smile our way and give us that opening, that hour or two to get this important legislation passed. I would like to ask the majority leader if he has been thinking about that.
