But this is, as I said before, not an issue of political ideology, it is an issue of simple justice. It is an issue that reflect what is best in this country, what is the best in us as Americans.  In fact, it would be hard to think of a better example of how unworkable this provision is--the one in the bill that we seek to correct--than a woman who joined me at a press conference yesterday. Two years ago, she fled Peru. She had been horribly treated and threatened by rebel guerrillas there. She came to this country without proper documents. She was able to convince an immigration judge after an opportunity for a fair hearing that she would suffer persecution if she returned home.  Yesterday, I asked her to tell about her experience. Less than two sentences into her story, as the memories of what she had put up with 2 years ago played back, she broke down crying. Her case has been very well-documented. She was able to establish a basis for asylum. But now, 2 years later, the memories are so strong that, emotionally, she was unable to talk with us about it.  Can you imagine if the provisions in this bill had been the law and she got to the border, and an INS officer said, ``Quick, tell me why you should stay here. What is going on? Why should you stay here?'' This woman, who was unable to talk about it 2 years later after having been granted asylum, what would she have done, how would she have established her case? The answer would have been, ``Well, obviously, you are not establishing the necessary criteria. You did not come here with a proper passport, so you are going back. Come back when you get a proper passport.'' What would she have gone back to?  Fortunately, instead of being sent back summarily to the hands of her abusers, she had a chance to be heard before a judge.  Mr. President, I am sure there are others who wish to speak. I will have more to say about this.  Mr. President, I withhold my time.
