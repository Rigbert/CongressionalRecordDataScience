Speaker, I rise today to recognize the men and women of this country who work the land, process and refine our agricultural commodities, and engage in the research that keeps American farmers and ranchers the most efficient in the world. I rise to pay tribute to the U.S. agricultural community.  As we all know, 1995 is a year in which American agriculture and our national farm policy will be in the spotlight. With severe [[Page E640]] budget constraints and political pressure to rethink and reshape our agriculture policy, the farm bill will undoubtedly stimulate passionate discussion about the future of American agriculture.  This year, Congress will have the important task of steering American agricultural policy into the 21st century. We will examine and debate issues ranging from how we direct Federal farm programs to new uses--ethanol and biodiesel--to trade and new markets to environmental and conservation concerns. I am pleased to note that President Clinton will convene a national rural conference in Iowa on April 25 to discuss these important issues as well as the future of rural America. I am honored to have the opportunity to host one of the sessions leading up to the national conference in Illinois.  However, before we proceed with debate on the reauthorization of farm programs, we should pause to say thank you to the men and women who work the land on America's 1.9 million farms and to the more than 21 million people working in agriculture--from growing to transporting to processing to marketing and selling to conducting the research.  It may surprise many of my colleagues to learn that today's farm population is only 1.9 percent of the total U.S. population. More importantly, today one farmer, on average, feeds 129 people. Forty-five years ago, farmers comprised over 12 percent of our population and one farmer fed only 15 people. The world's most productive and efficient farmers live and work here in the United States, including on Illinois' more than 77,000 farms.  Mr. Speaker, American farmers are the most efficient producers of food and fiber in the world. We, as Americans, are blessed to have the natural resources and farming expertise that help guarantee consumers a safe and abundant food supply. The food and fiber system in this country now generates more than $900 billion a year in economic activity--about 14 percent of our gross domestic product. Clearly, American agriculture has a good story to tell.  Mr. Speaker, we need to take time to recognize the significant contributions that agriculture makes to our everyday lives. From production agriculture to research, it is easy to see that the diversity of American agriculture touches almost every aspect of our lives.                          ____________________
