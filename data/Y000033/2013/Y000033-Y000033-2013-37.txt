Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  I urge the chairman to accept this amendment. This amendment takes no money away from anyone, other than the Natives themselves.  This program has worked. It has worked so well that I'm asking my colleagues to keep it in the existing bill that's coming before us. I'm not going to argue about Leave No Child Behind or the new bill, H.R. 5. But if a program is working and it's neutral, for God's sake let's leave it in there. Why take it out?  Everybody says, Well, they have a chance at it. Not when we don't have BIE funding in the State of Alaska. This is a neutral bill financially. It doesn't take away from any other programs.  I ask very respectfully for my colleagues to vote for this legislation to promote American Indian, Hawaiian Indian, and Alaska Native educational programs. It's the right thing to do, and let's do what's right today.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
