 Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro].  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Sanders amendment, which will provide additional funding to the low-income weatherization program.  It is my understanding with regard to the NPR that the private industry sources say that they can cut operating costs between $30 and $40 million. So this $11 million is indeed a paltry sum, as my colleague from Minnesota has talked about. This is not going to break the NPR. It is just not going to do that; that is a fallacy.  The weatherization program provides essential energy assistance, and it provides that in my State of Connecticut to the working poor, to the elderly, to the disabled, to low-income individuals. Without this help, many residents could not afford to heat their homes through the winter, and it gets cold in the State of Connecticut.  Weatherization projects protect the homes from elements and make them more energy efficient. It reduces the costs for these individuals and their families. Last year's support for the weatherization program took a big hit from its regular funding level, and despite the President's request to raise funding of this program to $150 million in 1997, this bill would slash weatherization by 60 percent from 1995 levels.  Let us pass the Sanders amendment, let us help working families.
