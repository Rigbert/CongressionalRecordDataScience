 Speaker, if I may, the outrage, while all of this goes on, while they do not have enough money to clean up the environment, I was down in Mexico and we talked to women who were having miscarriages because they were working in such unhealthy environments. Children were being born with major birth defects.  They do not have the money to do that, but they do have the money to pay their CEO's 54 percent more this year than last year. They do have the money to hire all kinds of lobbyists to come here to Washington to tell Members of Congress how good this policy is that makes the rich richer and everybody else poorer.  They do have the money to put ads in newspapers all over America telling us how we have to cut back on Medicare and Medicaid and education and give tax breaks to the rich as part of a budget agreement several years ago. They suddenly have the money for those things, but when working people in this country and in Mexico ask for decent wages, gee, there is just no money available. I think this is the untold story of the last 30 years.  What saddens me very much is the corporate media, which is owned by these very same people, is not going to tell the story, but what we are seeing is a situation of unparalleled greed in the modern history of this country, where the people on top are making huge amounts of money, pushing down the American workers, pushing down the Mexican workers, forcing people to compete against each other, destroying the environment so they can sit up with their billions and billions of dollars. It is an outrage, and it is an outrage that this Congress has not effectively dealt with that issue.
