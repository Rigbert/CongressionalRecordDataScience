Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would first like to salute the chairman of this committee, Mr. Skeen, who has done an extraordinarily good job over the last 2 years under very difficult circumstances. As I have said before, this is the most bipartisan subcommittee in the House. I think that that is the case because of the leadership of Mr. Skeen. I have enjoyed serving with him. It has been a tough job for him and the entire staff. He has done an excellent job in preparing this conference committee report.  We have responded to the need to reduce spending. We have done it. We have done it in a way that will not imperil food and fiber production across America. It will cause some discomfort, I am sure. The cutbacks will affect some people, but I think we have done our job in a responsible way.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Traficant].
