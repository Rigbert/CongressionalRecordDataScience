 The Department of Energy is initiating the rulemaking and data collection process to consider amending the energy conservation standards for ceiling fans and ceiling fan light kits. Making ceiling fans more efficient would potentially reduce carbon output by 22 million metric tons. This amendment would erode the Department of Energy's effort to curb carbon emissions and save consumers money on their electric bills. The Department estimates that the higher standards for ceiling fans will result in $4.3 billion in undiscounted energy bill savings through 2030.  Also, I would be remiss if I did not point out that these amendments seek to undercut the administration's rulemaking authority given to it by Congress. Speaker after speaker on the other side of the aisle criticized this administration for not undertaking rulemaking on other issues and instead issuing guidance. Now we have rulemaking that allows for public comment, and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are still not satisfied.  The Department is following its responsibility under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to regulate ceiling fan energy usage. And you know what? It's not a bad idea. We actually own ceiling fans in our family. What's interesting about them is, if you have two or three speeds on them, the first speed, which is supposed to be the low speed, is more than we want, and it's very hard to get these fans demonstrated in the showroom sometimes. If you want to be a responsible consumer, I think it would be really helpful to the buying public to have standards, to be able to have labeling, to know what you're buying.  This is an important market. I would guess it's one that's growing in our economy. But I think it's really important to have this kind of effort. The industry will be able to comment. That's what rulemaking is all about. We can work with consumers. Consumers like us can write in. We can make our comments. Overall, we get a better product and we get one that's more energy efficient.  I know that there's a Hunter Fan Company located in Memphis, Tennessee, so I imagine the gentlelady may be speaking on their behalf. That's okay. That's what we're all here for. But the consumers out there also have a right to try to buy the most energy-efficient product.  The fan that we bought, the light is too bright in the ceiling. And I don't know if you've ever tried to install one of those things. It's not so easy to get that off and to put the different bulbs in and all. As I think it's an industry that is growing and improving, I would think they could use a little bit of help.  This amendment is anti-consumer. I think it should be defeated, but I admire the gentlelady for bringing it to the floor and the gentleman who supported her. I think working together we can all make it a little bit better for the environment, for consumers, and for the company. They will sell more fans, and people will have more confidence in their product.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).  The amendment was agreed to.                Amendment No. 31 Offered by Mr. Higgins
