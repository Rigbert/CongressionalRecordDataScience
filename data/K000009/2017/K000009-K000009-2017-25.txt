Speaker, there couldn't be a more dangerous industry to work in. Do you want to put some of these foreign companies in charge of worker safety in those places? Not I. I have seen too many mangled bodies in places around the world that tell me no.  I am for workers being protected as well as the interests of corporations. Today's action eliminates 80 years of safeguards, safeguards on joint employer responsibility.  What does that mean? It means that a company that subcontracts or franchises work to save a buck can shielditself when workers aren't paid fair wages or are denied basic employment rights.
