 President, I thank my friend from Nevada for his kind comments. I will have a good deal more to say about him tomorrow as well because this has been a challenging undertaking. I do think we have made substantial progress, if not having achieved everything we hoped, but I think we have come a long way in the right direction.                          ____________________
