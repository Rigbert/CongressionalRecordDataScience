Speaker, I would like to call your attention to a noble initiative proposed by Dr. Anthony S. Lenzo of Crown Point, Indiana. Dr. Lenzo has toiled selflessly for many years in an attempt to designate a ``Weekend of Prayer, Meditation and Thought on the Futility of War and the Desperate Need for Peace in the World.'' His goal is to have the United States submit his resolution to the United Nations. Dr. Lenzo feels that, as a global leader and the chief proponent ofpeace, the United States should be the country to propose such a resolution. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization constitution itself reads, ``since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defenses of peace must be constructed.''  His own words most eloquently express his intentions. According to Dr. Lenzo, who recently retired from teaching elementary school and from his position as a colonel in the Army Reserves, peace is still a possibility: ``With the entire world, together with its political and religious leaders, all praying for peace at the same time, marked with parades, speeches, dinners, fireworks, and whatever else is necessary to make this the most important event of the year, it has to have impact on everyone and further the cause of peace.'' Dr. Lenzo continues, ``It will be a thankful day when we can once again live in peace * * * peace in the world, peace within our nations, peace in our neighborhoods, peace on our streets.'' He dismisses claims that this is impossible: ``Years ago it was said that it was impossible to find a cure for polio, but we did; impossible to find a cure for smallpox, but we did; impossible for the Berlin Wall to come down, but it did; impossible to overcome Russian communism, but we did! The endless list of accomplishments that were once thought to be impossible are now realities. Peace in the world can also become a reality.''  During the course of his campaign, Dr. Lenzo has met with great success. Between 1992 and 1994, he received responses from 30 states, 9 of whom instated a weekend of prayer for peace at his request. He has received responses from Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Pope, and Elizabeth Taylor. Nearly all who hear Dr. Lenzo's plea to champion peace commend his campaign.  The last time I called your attention to Dr. Lenzo's initiative, in January 1991, we were just four days away from the United Nations' deadline for Saddam Hussein to remove his troops from Kuwait. Five days after I spoke of Dr. Lenzo's project, we deployed military forces in Kuwait. Now, again, we are nearing a stand-off with Iraq. And again, Dr. Lenzo works to remind us of the gravity of the actions we contemplate. As we negotiate and strategize and consider all our options, Dr. Lenzo tells us to keep in sight the end we all seek. His suggestion that we step back and remember to whom we are accountable is vitally relevant at this time.  In the words of John Milton, ``Peace hath her victories, no less renowned than War,'' and Dr. Lenzo's work is surely one of those victories. I admire Dr. Lenzo's insight and encourage all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to seriously contemplate his ``Weekend of Prayer, Meditation and Thought.''                          ____________________
