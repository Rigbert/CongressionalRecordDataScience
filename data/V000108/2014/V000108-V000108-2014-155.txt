Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I recognize the Schererville Fire Department, as the organization celebrates its 100th anniversary. In honor of this momentous occasion, the Schererville Fire Department is hosting a celebratory event on Friday, September 26, 2014, at the Patrician Banquet Center in Schererville, Indiana.   The Schererville Volunteer Fire Department was established on June 25, 1914, under the direction of Fire Chief Fred Henderlong, and was made up of twenty-five volunteer members. In the early days, the firefighters did not receive compensation for their work. This changed in 1953, when one dollar was given to the members for attending a monthly meeting, responding to a call, or working for one hour. Today, the Schererville Fire Department is a fully paid organization consisting of sixty-one employees. Throughout the years, the department has changed its standards to fit the needs of the community. From purchasing the department's first motorized piece of fire equipment in 1922, to upgrading their ambulance service from basic life support to advanced life support in 2006, the Schererville Fire Department has upheld their mission statement of ``serving the needs of its people.''   The leaders and members of the Schererville Fire Department continue to touch lives through their outstanding community service, especially to those most in need. Every year, the organization lends its support to a variety of charitable organizations, including Hoosier Burn Camp, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the American Heart Association, Northwest Indiana Cancer Kids, ``Bump Out Cancer,'' Tri-Town Safety Village, Schererville Baseball League, and the Down Syndrome Association of Northwest Indiana.   At this time, I would like to acknowledge several individuals who, in conjunction with the Schererville Fire Department, have worked diligently to support this outstanding organization. In addition to the firefighters and all of the employees of the department, I would like to recognize Fire Chief Joseph M. Kruzan, Jr., Deputy Fire Chief Robert Patterson, Town Council President Mike Troxell, and Board of Safety Chairman Pete Sormaz.   Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the Schererville Fire Department on its 100th anniversary. Northwest Indiana is both grateful and proud to have had the organization's support during the past 100 years, and for their selfless service, the leadership and members of the Schererville Fire Department are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
