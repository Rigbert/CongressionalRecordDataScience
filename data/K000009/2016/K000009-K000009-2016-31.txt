Chair, it would not have been unusual or extraordinary for the Rules Committee to have protected from a point of order the mail delivery standards added to this bill when, in fact, they actually included 30 other amendments that are in the bill that affect the SEC, the IRS, the FCC, and the District of Columbia.  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman will suspend.  The Chair is prepared to rule.  The Chair finds that this provision includes language imparting direction to the United States Postal Service. The provision, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of clause 2 of rule XXI.  The point of order is sustained, and the provision is stricken from the bill.
