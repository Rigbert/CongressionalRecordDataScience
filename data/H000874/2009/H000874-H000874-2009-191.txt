On the Defense Appropriations bill, it is my understanding there are well over 100 amendments that have been filed. Clearly, if we did that under an open rule or allowed all 100 amendments--which, by the way, are by one Member. There are over 100 amendments by one Member--we would never finish the bill if we stayed through August.  Having said that, I have talked to the chairwoman, and it's my belief that Mr. Flake, who has filed over 100 amendments, will be given, certainly, ample opportunity to choose which amendments he wants to offer at the time that we consider the bill. I don't know the other amendments. Notice has been filed. I don't know the other amendments and don't know what the Rules Committee is going to do. But I will tell the gentleman, as I'm sure he knows, the bill will come under a rule.  We believe that your side of the aisle has had most of the amendments that have been offered, clearly, and Mr. Flake and others, Mr. Hensarling were given the opportunity to offer a number of their amendments on earmarks, which I know are of great concern to both sides of the aisle.  So I say to the gentleman, we do expect to take the Defense bill up under a rule similar to those under which we have operated, which have facilitated,by the way, as the gentleman knows, all 11 of the 12 appropriations bills having passed. And while I was not sure of what was going to happen on the health care bill, we will achieve our objective of passing all 12 appropriations bills in a timely fashion.  I yield back.
