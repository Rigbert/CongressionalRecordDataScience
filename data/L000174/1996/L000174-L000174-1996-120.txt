President, this Senator has spent years supporting UNICEF. As I read this, we are unable to give money to UNICEF.  Let us be clear. There are a lot of other things in here. Whatever agency provides funds for river blindness, we would be precluded from that. We would be precluded from others.  The Senator has an absolute right to have such an intention, but I just want to make sure we understand precisely what we are doing. If they borrow funds from any of these international financial institutions, I would assume this would then preclude our dollars to UNDP, UN Environmental Program, the World Food Program, International Atomic Energy Agency, UNICEF, and others. Am I correct?
