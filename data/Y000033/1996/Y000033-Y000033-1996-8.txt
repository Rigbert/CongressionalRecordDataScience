Mr. Speaker, thank you for the chance to bring to the floor the biggest and most important parks and public lands package since 1978. In addition to provisions for protection of some of the most important natural landmarks, historic places and landscapes in the country, it includes a landmark bipartisan effort led by Representative Bill Baker to protect the California Bay-Delta, a priority for both sides of the aisle. This package is chock full of solutions to local problems which have been brought to the attention of the committee by individual Members of the House or the other body.  Before a brief outline of the bills' many fine points, I am compelled to give a short history of how we arrived at such a massive package at this point in the session. Frankly, it was a few Members of the other body's fault. Though the Resource Committee has sent scores of individual bills to the Senate, holds by certain Members on these measures stopped the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources from moving individual or even small groups of bills for months. This hostage taking became so bad that when a large package of bills was finally freed in that body and attached to a Presidio bill we sent them, we made a conscious decision to try to place many of the bills stuck over there in this package. They followed suit.  As a result, many items were considered through this process, and some remain while others were dropped. I believe we have achieved a package which will benefit many Members, States and people throughout the Nation.  Mr. Speaker, I will also say I have Members that have been disappointed, such as myself, because I think this administration deals with a forked tongue. Every time we reach an agreement, they would move the goalposts. I am not sure, maybe my good friend, the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], knows we reached an agreement, and already the White House has tried to undo it. Already there are phone calls being made from the White _______________________________________________________________________                              N O T I C E   A final issue of the Congressional Record for the 104th Congress  will be published on October 21, 1996, in order to permit Members to  revise and extend their remarks.

THOMAS, Chairman._______________________________________________________________________House to individual Members saying ``Oh, this has to be changed,'' after they signed off. That is not the way we should be doing business in this body.  A few highlights are in order: As I mentioned before, this bill has the monumental authorization for the environmental enhancement of the San Francisco Bay-Delta introduced by Congressman Bill Baker.  In addition, it creates new units at Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve in Kansas; Nicodemus National Historic site in Kansas; New Bedford National Historic Park in Massachusetts and Boston Harbor Islands in Massachusetts.  It also protects important Historic Sites like Manzanar National Historic Site in California and Independence Hall in Philadelphia through boundary adjustments. It celebrates the Selma to Montgomery civil rights march trail and reauthorizes the National Council on Historic Preservation.  It provides for the protection of Sterling Forest to protect the watershed for New Jersey and New York.  It finalizes a creative approach to the management and funding for the new Presido Park in San Francisco; it protects rivers, from the Columbia in Washington to the Lamprey in New Hampshire; it helps out Olympic effort in the 2002 Olympics in Utah with its solution to the Snowbasin facility problems; it also resolves long standing necessary administrative reforms in the National Park Service; and it also solves many, many longstanding local problems, from helping the children of the Alpine School District in J.D. Hayworth's district with a land grant in Arizona, to solving a problem in Congresswoman Seastrand's district by rounding out the Channel Islands National Park.  While I am pleased we have the bill before us, let me say that just as important as the things in the bill, are the things which are not in the bill. Many of our Members, including myself, would have liked to have more in the bill, but we have deleted many provisions, based upon Administration and Member objections. This includes a grazing provision very important to family ranchers and the Representatives in the public land west and a provision to save over 1,000 jobs in my district in Alaska in the timber industry.  Mr. Speaker, this is late in the session. I hope though Members will understand, each and every one of the them, we will be back. As long as I am chairman, and I believe that will happen, we will again address those issues we were unable to obtain in this legislation, and it will happen very early in the session. We hope we will be able to urge our Senators to act with a little more responsibility.  Again, may I suggest there are over 43 Republican projects in the bill and there are over 54 Democrat projects in this bill, and if that is not a bipartisan effort, I do not know what is.  Mr. Speaker, many good provisions have been dropped from this bill to ensure its passage at this late hour, largely in response to concerns expressed by the Clinton White House, the minority and other Members. That is a shame, because many of these provisions were real but we intend to bring them back as soon as possible next year and fix them. I urge Members to support the bill.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to all of you to understand one thing. We are going to vote on this legislation. I hope I do not see the fingerprints of the administration. Then it goes over to the other body to act on this legislation, and it is probably the only chance we have. There is a slight chance that we may have the conference up yet before this session is over, if we do not get out of here tonight, and God help us, I hope we get out of here tonight.  The Congress has been told that this will be vetoed by this administration. I do not think they will veto this. If they do, they are being very, very foolish.  Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment the staffs that were working on this very hard. I want to say this to the minority and majority side: I think we have worked out something that every Member will have some responsibilities for and can take home and say we have done our job.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
