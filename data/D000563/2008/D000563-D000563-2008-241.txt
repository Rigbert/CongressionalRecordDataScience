President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, who has come to the floor almost every day to talk about the energy crisis. But if the American people had their choice, all of us would be talking about it every day of the week. It takes anywhere from an hour to 2 hours to go from downtown Chicago out to O'Hare. I have made the trip a lot. But recently, the fellow who was driving me said: I have noticed something strange. Even during rush hour, there are fewer cars out here. I know a lot of people are on vacation, but something is changing.  I have noticed it all over my State, and I think people are noticing it all over the country. What is changing is people are looking at gasoline that costs $4.50 or $4.30 a gallon and saying: I will drive less. I am going to look for a car or truck that is more fuel efficient. People are understanding in their daily lives that things are changing, not always for the better, because as the price of oil goes up and the price of gasoline goes up, we may make energy-conserving decisions, but some of those are forced on us. Some of those are painful, painful when we pay for the gasoline each week and painful when people find their family budgets wrecked by the cost of gasoline.
