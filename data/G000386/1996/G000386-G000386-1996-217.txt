 President, I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and my friend the ranking minority member, Senator Inouye, for doing the good work again this year on the Defense Department's problem disbursements.  The bill includes a provision--section 8089--that makes the Department match disbursements with obligations before payments are made.  This measure helps to sustain the momentum we started back in 1994, continued in 1995, and re-energized this year.  Section 8089 ratchets down payment thresholds even more as recommended in audit reports just issued by the inspector general and General Accounting Office.  This piece of legislation and the accompanying report language send the right message to the Department.  We intend to keep the pressure on until this problem is fixed.  That's the message the bill sends.  I thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their willingness to follow through on this important issue.
