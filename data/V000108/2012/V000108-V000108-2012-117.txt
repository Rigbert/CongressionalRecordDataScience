Chairman, I want to add my remarks, along with the chairman, to thank the gentlewoman for her vision of our energy future, for her doggedness, and for her commitment to basic scientific research in this country, as well as the issue of fusion.  Too often people lose sight that we have to be consistent, we have to be persistent and dogged, and some day we are going to achieve success and primarily because of the gentlelady from California. I appreciate her remarks very much.  I reserve the balance of my time.
