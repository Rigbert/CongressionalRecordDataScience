President, before I address some of the issues before us, let me say a word about my friend and colleague from North Dakota who, during this recess, announced he is going to retire at the end of this year. Senator Dorgan and I have served together both in the House and the Senate. He has been such a powerful force and powerful voice in the Senate Democratic caucus on so many important issues that we share values on. I am not going to bid him farewell because I know this year will be a busy year for him, representing his State and being engaged. His talk, just this moment on the floor, about issues of concern are clear evidence he is going to be fighting for his causes and his people in this upcoming year. But I do have to express my regret that my colleague is leaving us and thank him for his many years of fine service to the people of his State, in the House and the Senate, and I look forward to making this a great sendoff year and again thank him for his contribution.
