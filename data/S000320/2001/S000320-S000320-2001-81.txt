 President, I rise today with my colleague Senator Dodd to introduce the ``Student Privacy Protection Act''. This legislation is intended to ensure that parents have the ability to protect their children's privacy by requiring that anyone who wishes to collect data for commercial purposes from kids in school must first seek and obtain parental permission.  The need for this legislation stems from the fact that a large number of marketing companies are going into classrooms and using class time to gather personal information about students and their families for commercial gain. In many cases, parents are not even aware that these companies have entered their children's school, much less that they are exploiting them in the one place they should be the safest, their classroom.  Our legislation builds on a long line of privacy legislation to protect kids, such as the Family Educational Rights Act, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the Protection of Pupil Rights Act. The goal of these laws, as is the case with our legislation, is to ensure that the privacy of children is protected and that their personal information cannot be collected and/or disseminated without the prior knowledge, and in most cases, consent of the parents.  We understand that schools today are financially strapped and many of these companies offer enticing financial incentives to gain access. Our goal is not to make it more difficult for schools to access the educational materials and the computers that they so desperately need. Rather our goal is to ensure that the details of these arrangements are disclosed and that parents are allowed to participate in the decision-making process.  The bottom line here is that parents have a right and a responsibility to be involved in their children's education. Much of what is occurring now is being done at the expense of the parents' decision making authority because schools are allowing companies direct access to students. This legislation enhances parental involvement by giving them an opportunity to decide for themselves who does and does not get access to their children during the school day.                                 ______                                       By
