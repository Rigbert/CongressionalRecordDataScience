 President, I rise today to express my support for the joint resolution to renew the import ban on Burma for another year.  I am proud to be joined in this effort once again by Senator McConnell, a true champion for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Burma.  The House passed this resolution unanimously on July 20 and I urge the Senate to begin action on it now by supporting the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed.  These sanctions expired on July 26 and we should extend them as soon as possible.  We must send a message to the people of Burma that we continue to stand with them in their struggle for a truly representative government.  I have been involved in the struggle for freedom and democracy in Burma for over 10 years.  In 1997, former Senator William Cohen and I authored legislation requiring the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma if he determined that the Government of Burma had physically harmed, re-arrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale repression or violence against the democratic opposition.  President Clinton issued the ban in a 1997 Executive order and the ban remains on the books today.  In 2003, after the regime attempted to assassinate Aung San Suu Kyi, Senator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003 which placed a complete ban on imports from Burma. It allowed that ban to be renewed 1 year at a time.  It was signed into law and has been renewed one year at a time since then. A renewal of that ban is now before us today.  Since we last debated the import ban on the Senate floor, we have received one piece of good news.  On November 13, 2010, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the democratic opposition, Aung San Suu Kyi, was released from house arrest.  Her latest detention lasted more than 7, and in total she has spent the better part of the last 20 years in prison or under house arrest.  Her release was wonderful news for those of us who are inspired by her courage, her dedication to peace and her tireless efforts for freedom and democracy for the people of Burma.  Yet our joy was tempered by the fact that her release came just days after afraudulent and illegitimate election for a new parliament that was based on a sham constitution.  The regime's intent was clear: keep the voice of the true leader of Burma silent long enough to solidify their grip on power using the false veneer of a democratic process.  Neither I, the people of Burma, nor the international community were fooled.  We all know that the last truly free parliamentary elections were overwhelmingly won by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy in 1990, but annulled by the military junta, then named the State Law and Order Restoration Council or SLORC.  In 1992, this military government announced plans to draft a new constitution to pave the way for a return to civilian rule.  Yet the human rights abuses and the suppression of Suu Kyi and the democratic opposition continued and no constitution emerged.  In 1997, the junta changed its name to the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, in a vain attempt to put a more positive spin on its oppressive rule and lack of democratic legitimacy in the eyes of its people and the international community.  Again, nothing changed.  The new constitution was drafted in secret and without the input of the democratic opposition led by Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy.  It was approved in an illegitimate referendum held just days after Cyclone Nargis devastated the country in May 2008 setting up elections which eventually took place in November 2010.  It set aside 25 percent of the seats in the new 440 seat House of Representatives for the military.  That is in addition to the seats won in the November, 2010 elections by the Union Solidarity and Development Party, which was founded by the military junta's Prime Minister Thein Sein and 22 of his fellow cabinet members who resigned from the army to form a so-called ``civilian'' political party.  The constitution barred Suu Kyi from running in the parliamentary elections.  And it forced the National League for Democracy to shut its doors because it would not kick Suu Kyi out of the party.  It should come as no surprise that the military-backed party won nearly 80 percent of the seats in the new parliament.  In addition to preventing Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy from competing in the elections, the regime ensured that no international monitors would oversee the elections and journalists would be prohibited from covering the election from inside Burma.  President Obama correctly stated that the elections ``were neither free nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections.''  The National League for Democracy described the elections and the formation of a new government as reducing ``democratization in Burma to a parody.''  Indeed, the new parliament elected Thein Sein, the last Prime Minister of the junta's State Peace and Development Council, as Burma's new president.  He is reported to be heavily influenced by Burma's senior military leader and former head of state, General Than Shwe.  The names change--the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the State Peace and Development Council, the Union Solidarity and Development Party--but the faces, the lack of democracy, the human rights abuses and the lawlessness remain the same.  So while we celebrate the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, we recognize that Burma is not free and the regime has failed to take the necessary steps to lift the import ban.  As called for in the original Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, we must stand by the people of Burma and keep the pressure on the military regime to: end violations of internationally recognized human rights; release all political prisoners; allow freedom of speech and press; allow freedom of association; permit the peaceful exercise of religion; and bring to a conclusion an agreement between the military regime and the National League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic minorities on the restoration of a democratic government.  By every measure, the regime has failed to make progress in any of these areas.  We cannot reward the regime for 2,100 political prisoners, the use of child soldiers or the persecution of ethnic minorities. We can't reward the use of rape as an instrument of war or the continued use of torture. And we can't reward the use of forced labor or the wholesale displacement of civilians.  Until the regime changes its behavior and embraces positive, democratic change, we have no choice but to press on with the import ban as a part of a strong sanctions program.  This must include tough banking sanctions.  I would like to take this opportunity to once again urge the administration to put additional pressure on the ruling military junta by exercising the authority for additional banking sanctions on its leaders and followers as mandated by section 5 of the Block Burmese Junta's Anti-Democratic Efforts Act.  Some of my colleagues may be concerned about the effectiveness of the import ban and other sanctions on Burma and the impact on the people of Burma.  I understand their concerns. I am disappointed that we have not seen more progress towards freedom and democracy in Burma.  But let us listen to the voice of the democratic opposition in Burma on the efficacy of sanctions:  A paper released by Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy in February 2011 argues that sanctions are not targeted at the general population and are not to blame for the economic ills of the country.  Rather, the economy suffers due to mismanagement, cronyism, corruption and the lack of the rule of law.  The best way for the Burmese government to get the sanctions lifted, the paper argues, is to make progress on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. It concludes:       Now more than ever there is an urgent need to call for an      all inclusive political process. The participation of a broad      spectrum of political forces is essential to the achievement      of national reconciliation in Burma. Progress in the      democratization process, firmly grounded in national      reconciliation, and the release of political prisoners should      be central to any consideration of changes in sanctions      policies.  I agree.  So, let us once again do our part and stand in solidarity with Aung San Suu Kyi and the people of Burma.  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and vote yes on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
