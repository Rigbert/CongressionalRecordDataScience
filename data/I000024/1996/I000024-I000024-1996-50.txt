Requiring EPA to arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a full analysis of the science on endocrine disrupters will enhance our understanding of this new potential environmental threat. While I understand that the Academy's Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology is already undertaking a study at the request of the Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency that focuses primarily on wildlife, toxicological mechanisms, and some human effects, this analysis could and should be broadened substantially to include a more comprehensive analysis of human exposures, sources of exposure, and the best ways to measure them, in order to help guide the EPA in developing these screening programs. In addition to comparing the relative risks between natural and synthetic endocrine disrupters and providing information on the proper way to prioritize chemicals and samples for testing, the Academy could also be useful in providing advice on how to use the resulting information in making public policy decisions and how to best communicate the results of any screening and testing program to the public.
