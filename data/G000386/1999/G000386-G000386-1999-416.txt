 President, I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself, Senators Kyl, DeWine, Hagel, and Kohl, a bill referred to as the Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999.  I do this in my capacity not only as a Senator from Iowa but as chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus of the Senate--a caucus that has had a tradition of working in a very bipartisan way on legislation and oversight hearings.  Methamphetamine is emerging as a new major drug problem across the entire country. It is one of the most dangerous drugs currently available. Its use destroys individuals and its production harms the environment. It is a problem that disproportionately affects rural America, even in our most urban States.  Methamphetamine is not a new drug in this country, but its growing use is very much a new problem. As the chart shows, meth has been around our country since the early 1980s, but its use then was largely confined to biker gangs and with a very limited market. Even then, much of the meth was produced in homemade labs in this country. Very little of it came out of Mexico and not so much in rural America.  The chart shows the city of Philadelphia with lots of examples of use of meth and meth laboratories. The numbers were few then and medical cases of meth-related problems were limited.  In San Francisco, for example, there were only 65 medical cases of meth-related problems, even in the year 1984. Let me assure Members that very low level activity situation for methamphetamine was not going to last very long because it began to change in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  During that period of time, Mexican criminal gangs began to become moreinvolved, taking over production and marketing from the biker gangs in America. In doing so, they began to rapidly expand the availability of drugs and at the same time lowering the costs. Use began to grow, as it will, when drugs became widely available at affordable prices. It will also grow if there is a perception of low risk with that drug.  Somehow--and wrongly so--meth got a reputation for being harmless. It is simple. Most new drugs start that way. They are pushed on particularly young people as safe and OK. Of course, it is a lie. But it is common enough. Thus, it should come as no surprise that as meth use increased and spread beyond the Western States, along with this, so did reports of meth-related medical problems.  In 1989, medical cases in San Francisco reached 1,125, or 17 times the 1984 level of 65 which I already mentioned. The number of lab seizures increased, as well.  Remember, on this chart, the previous chart, and the next chart I will show, the red lines show an expanding importation of methamphetamine into our country with some from outside of Mexico, but most of the lines coming from Mexico and spreading all across our country--it is now beginning to reach the West and the Midwest--not so much in the East where it was when it started with biker gangs, but all over the United States.  While most of the drug is produced in Mexico by Mexican criminal gangs, there is a growing domestic production, much of this in rural areas. It is devastating.  Looking again at the chart previously shown, from 1982 to 1985, we had very little meth coming from Mexico into the United States. Most of what we had was domestic production. The numbers here in green illustrate the dimension of medical-related meth problems that are reported in the media. It also relates, to some extent, to the lab busts in that particular case. But from 1982 to 1985, it was very much limited to biker gangs being involved in that, very little out of Mexico.  Then you go to the period of the late 1980s, early 1990s. You see more red lines, meaning quantity and diverse distribution coming out of Mexico, some from Korea, probably some from other countries we will not show on this particular map but still, relatively little. Then after 1994, you see a very dramatic acceptance of meth use, but also most of it coming from Mexico and most of it from that source just finding itself spread all across the United States, so very much a growing problem, very much a problem of Mexican sources and cartels being the source of our problem in this country.  In 1998 we had 321 methamphetamine labs found in my State of Iowa. This was more than double the year before. As of the first quarter this year, over 170 labs have been found in my State. If you multiply that by 4, you are going to see Iowa doubling the trouble of meth again in local production. That is what we know about. It does not account for the flow of meth from Mexico.  I know many other States in the West and the Midwest can tell a very similar story. We know this is a problem that is moving eastward. We are becoming a producing country for this dangerous drug. You can get the formula for producing meth off the Internet, and many of the chemicals to produce it can be found in local hardware stores and pharmacies. One of the common chemicals used in production is increasingly being stolen from farms.  The problem of production and use is growing worse. As it does so, it leaves in its wake broken homes and ruined lives. It is known on the street as crank, ice, speed, or meth. However it is named, the drug hooks users from all socioeconomic backgrounds. What is worse, medical experts and law enforcement officials point to younger and younger users. This is one of the most dangerous drugs we have ever seen. It is highly addictive, and it is a brain toxin. It attacks important functions of the brain, and, over time, prolonged use poisons these functions, in some cases permanently. The word on the street is that meth is a safe drug, but in fact it is a very vicious drug.  The physiological side effects of meth include brain damage, heart attacks, and seizures. It can cause insomnia and lead to paranoia as well as violent, erratic behavior. It has made routine police encounters with motorists more dangerous, and it has made investigating lab sites a risky undertaking. This highly dangerous, addictive stimulant disrupts homes, schools, workplaces, hospital emergency rooms, and even our courts. Worse yet, the production creates toxic waste dumps that endanger the environment and public safety.  Much of this problem disproportionately affects rural communities. Even in our most urban States, the threat is just overwhelming to local resources that have to bear the brunt of fighting the methamphetamine problem, because few small communities such as we have in rural America can cope with the explosion of users, pushers, and labs.  So those of us introducing this legislation--as I said, Senators Kyl, DeWine, Hagel, and Kohl, and I--are then introducing this Rural Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 today because we cannot turn a blind eye to this threat anymore. Passage of this legislation will move us forward in our efforts to protect our children and our future from the ravages of meth.  There are several key areas where this legislation will improve our ability to respond to the threat.  First, we need to get a handle on what the problem is. This legislation requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services report to Congress on how drug use, and particularly methamphetamine use, is different in rural versus urban settings. Today we can break drug use down into patterns by sex, by age, region of the country, education, and the type of drug use. We have some idea when kids--and they are kids--first try drugs. I believe there is a more serious problem in rural America today than there has ever been. Meth production and use disproportionately affect rural areas, even in large urban States such as California.  Meth is often called the poor man's cocaine, because it is most widely used in blue-collar communities, rural areas, and small to mid-sized cities. Yet our resources and focus tend to go to large urban areas, because that is where we can more easily document the problem.  After getting a better handle on the problem with better statistics on a national basis from our Secretary of HHS, we, second, suggest the Attorney General, through this legislation, provide the Congress with an annual strategy on how to deal with the problem systematically and coherently. This will establish a benchmark to guide future research and action. As part of this problem, this strategy is meant as a mechanism for tracking both use and the proliferation of meth labs. We do establish, then, this mechanism to do it. This will require the administration to relate resources to action. We do not see that connection today in a coherent way.  In addition, the legislation will support the creation of rapid response teams at the Federal level to provide language and intelligence-collection expertise to communities that must deal with foreign-based meth gangs.  Next, the legislation will increase resources to provide training in meth lab cleanup as well as increased funding to the Drug Enforcement Agency so it can improve assistance for lab cleanup and disposal. That is not something a lot of States are waiting for the Federal Government to do, but it is being done on an ad hoc basis, State by State. In my particular case, the State of Iowa has set up two teams with the resources to help in this cleanup, because it is such a dangerous environment.  One of the problems with meth is we have this proliferation of home meth labs, large and small. They are toxic waste dumps filled with dangerous chemicals. Handling these labs requires special training and equipment. My legislation will create a number of regional training centers to help struggling communities deal with the explosion in meth production.  The legislation would enhance the ability to provide training to local police and sheriffs to meet this challenge.  Finally, this legislation will increase penalties for trafficking anhydrous ammonia, one of the major components in one method of producing meth, across State lines and would provide assistance for research methods for makinganhydrous ammonia useless in meth production.  The intent of this legislation is to address a problem that is growing and spreading across the country, one that disproportionately affects small and mid-sized cities and rural areas.  I urge my colleagues in this body to join in supporting the Methamphetamine Use Response Act of 1999 and respond now to this challenge before it grows worse and before it spreads any further if, in fact, it can spread much further.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
