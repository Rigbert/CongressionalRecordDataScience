President, it was extraordinary to watch this bipartisan effort on TSCA.  An hour ago, Senator Peters and I thought we were going to have floor time for some brief remarks. I would like to ask unanimous consent that Senator Peters have the chance to address the issues he thought he was going to address, and he is going to be brief. I will go next. I will be brief. I ask unanimous consent that following Senator Peters' remarks, I be allowed to address the Senate briefly.
