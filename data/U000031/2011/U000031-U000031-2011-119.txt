Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Public Safety Officer Eric Zapata of Kalamazoo, Michigan, who was killed in the line of duty on the night of April 18th, 2011. Our heartfelt prayers and condolences go out to his family and loved ones.  A ten-year veteran of the Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety, Zapata was a tireless public servant who put the wellbeing of his community above himself. Like so many in local law enforcement, Zapata was a father, a son, a brother, and a friend--he will be greatly missed.  We are all deeply indebted to those brave men and women in public safety, whose countless sacrifices allow us to go about our daily lives and take our own safety for granted. The pain of this tragic loss is felt by every member of our southwest Michigan community.  PSO Zapata's ultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom and security will never be forgotten. He leaves a legacy of distinguished service and selfless heroism.  Officer Zapata was the first Kalamazoo Public Safety Officer killed in the line of duty. Let's all pray he will also be the last.                          ____________________
