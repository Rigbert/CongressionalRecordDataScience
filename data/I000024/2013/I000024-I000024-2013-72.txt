President, while not many people know about the Federal Housing Finance Agency, it has become one of the most powerful and important government agencies. Following the financial crisis and massive bailouts of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and all the big banks, the Federal Government took a primary position in the mortgage market. Right now, 48 percent of all outstanding U.S. mortgages and 77 percent of those issued last year were guaranteed by the Federal Government. This is a problem in and of itself, but the FHFA is the agency that oversees all of them.  Mel Watts is the guy President Obama has nominated to lead the agency. I know Mel from my time both in the House and the Senate, and I am deeply concerned that he will push the Federal Government further into the mortgage business, instead of moving us away from it. He has shown his colors during his time here in Washington, and he is not the right guy to lead the agency. I am opposed to his nomination and urge my colleagues to oppose him.
