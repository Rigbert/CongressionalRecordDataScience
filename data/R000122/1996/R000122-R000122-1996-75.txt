Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exceptional officer of the U.S. Marines in Maj. Scott Buran. This week, Major Buran completes a highly successful tour as the Marine Corps' assistant liaison officer to this body over the past 4 years. It is truly a pleasure for me to recognize a few of his many outstanding achievements.  A native of Vestal, NY, Major Buran became dedicated to the service of this country by following the fine example of his father, Lt. Col. Frank Buran. A retired Marine officer with his own impressive achievements, the elder Buran led marines during the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima during World War II and later during the Korean war. Following in his father's footsteps, Major Buran was commissioned in the Marine Corps on May 15, 1982, upon his graduation from the State University of New York via the Platoon Leaders Course Program.  Upon completion of The Basic School in Quantico, VA, Second Lieutenant Buran attended the Artillery Officer Basic Course at Fort Sill, OK, before reporting for duty with the First Battalion, Eleventh Marines at Camp Pendleton, CA, in August 1983. With 1/11, he served successively at a forward observer, adjutant, and battery executive officer.  In July 1985, First Lieutenant Buran joined Marine Barracks Subic Bay, Republic of the Philippines, for duty as a platoon commander and guard officer. Completing a successful 14 months in the Philippines, he returned stateside in the winter of 1986 for his new assignment at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, CA. Here, newly promoted Captain Buran contributed immeasurably to the process of making marines while serving successively as a platoon, series, and company commander, and finally as the S-3 training officer.  After a 6-month return to school at Fort Sill for the artillery officers advanced course, Captain Buran returned to the Fleet Marine Force in November 1989. Just 4 months later, Scott deployed with 3rd Battalion, 10th Marines as an artillery battery commander for duty in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Serving with distinction, Captain Buran participated in the liberation of Kuwait City.  Captain Buran arrived at the Capitol in August 1992 for duty as the Marine Corps assistant congressional liaison officer. Soon thereafter, he was advanced to the grade of major. In this capacity he has been instrumental in providing Congress with a working knowledge of the Marine Corps. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, Maj. Scott Buran has come to epitomize those qualities that we as a nation have come to expect from our marines--impeccable integrity, moral character, and absolute professionalism.  I had the privilege of traveling with Major Buran to Somalia and to the former Yugoslavia. His superb professionalism, maturejudgment, and tireless effort and enthusiasm made this trip not only possible, but extraordinarily useful as a means of informing the Congress of the situation in these troubled lands. Major Buran consistently exceeds the very high expectations of an officer of the Marines.  Major Buran's personal awards include the Combat Action Ribbon, the Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal with two gold stars in lieu of second and third awards, and the Meritorious Service Medal. Mr. Speaker, Maj. Scott Buran has served this Nation with distinction in war and in peace for the last 14 years. As he continues to do so, I call upon my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him, his lovely wife Ann, and their three beautiful children, Elizabeth, Sydney, and Samuel, every success as well as fair winds and following seas.                          ____________________
