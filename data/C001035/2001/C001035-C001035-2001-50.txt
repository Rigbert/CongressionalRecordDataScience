President, I am pleased to join Senator Snowe in introducing legislation for the private relief of Nancy B. Wilson. Nancy's compelling case merits such action.  In 1945, Al Wilson was married with two children when tragedy struck the family. His wife Edna was institutionalized following a severe mental breakdown, and Al was left with no one to care for his children. Five years later, he met Nancy Butler, who took up residence with Al and began caring for his two children, as well as her own son. The eldest child has written that Nancy ``is the person who brought me up in place of my biological mother, who was institutionalized. I think of Nancy as my real mother.''  Though Al and Nancy wished to get married, Al was prohibited from divorcing his first wife under a Massachusetts law barring divorce for reasons of insanity or institutionalization for insanity. Time passed, and although not legally married, Al and Nancy raised their family together.  Edna Wilson died on April 12, 1969, and Al and Nancy were married twenty days later. Tragically, just seven months after their wedding, Al died of cancer. Though only married for those seven months, Al and Nancy had lived together for 19 years.  When Nancy turned 64 she applied to the Social Security Administration for survivor's insurance benefits. She was told that a couple must be married for 9 months for the spouse to be eligible to collect survivor benefits, and that her legal marriage failed to meet that threshold. Nancy has since exhausted the administrative appeals process to no avail.  The private relief bill we are introducing will simply allow Nancy to receive widow's benefits from her husband's earnings. Though Al and Nancy were legally prevented from being married for all but seven months of their years together, they were, for all practical purposes, married for 19 years. She raised his children, allowing him to work and accumulate a Social Security benefit.  These unique circumstances illustrate why Congress must enact private relief legislation from time to time. Certainly, Nancy's unique situation fulfills the intent of the Social Security Act, and it is a situation that will not be repeated due to a change in Massachusetts law repealing the legal hurdle that prevented Al and Nancy from being married in the first place. Mrs. Wilson's case is truly compelling, and merits this corrective action by Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.                                 ______                                       By
