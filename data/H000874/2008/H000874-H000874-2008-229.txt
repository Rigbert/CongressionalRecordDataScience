That's a happier announcement, I know, so I thought I would make it, trying to even things out here.  We will have a suspension vote at the end of the consideration of the Waters bill. The votes will be rolled until tomorrow, and so that there will be no more votes tonight. There will be a suspension vote, but the minority has indicated that there will not be a vote on that suspension bill.  We will then, tomorrow, finish the votes on the Waters bill, and then go to the Franks housing bill and complete that tomorrow. My expectation is we are probably talking somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 o'clock tomorrow, assuming that things are nice and pleasant and peaceful.  Have a good night's sleep.           Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Mahoney of Florida  The Acting CHAIRMAN. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 110-621.
