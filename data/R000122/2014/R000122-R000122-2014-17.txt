Haze, who retired from the U.S. Department of the Interior this past August after 34 years of Federal service.  Ms. Haze served as the Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Finance, Performance and Acquisition for the past 5 years. Her most recent position was the culmination of many years of experience working in various capacities within the Department's budget office. Her career prior to that time was spent in other bureaus of the Department, where Pam worked as a biologist and hydrologist, and served in other management roles with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation.  As the primary liaison between the Department and the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, Pam has been an indispensable and trusted adviser. I have had the good fortune as chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee to both work and travel with Pam, most notably on a trip to Alaska that included our subcommittee's ranking member, Senator Lisa Murkowski, and former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. I have witnessed firsthand Pam's dedication to the Department's mission. She has worked tirelessly with me and my staff during the annual appropriations process and we have steadily relied on Pam's vast store of knowledge and keen insights to help resolve challenges that have arisen over the years.  The appropriations process simply would not be the same without her and the dedication, wisdom, and the good humor she brought to her work. I join with many in wishing her all the best as she begins a well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
