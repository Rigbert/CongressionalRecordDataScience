  Mr. DeFAZIO. What does the President's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, have to hide? It might have been that she told the 9/11 Commission that she misspoke when she said that there was no intelligence that terrorists might use airplanes as weapons and that the administration had no knowledge of that. Of course, she did all that in private. In public she is spinning a very different story. She has appeared everywhere and anywhere on the press, with the press, in public; but she will not go before the 9/11 Commission and give sworn testimony to that commission and the American public. We deserve better. We deserve the truth about 9/11, what the administration knew and when they knew it.                          ____________________
