 Mr. President, a few minutes ago I talked about two amendments I had in the FAA bill. One was what I would call the Good Samaritan amendment. We have talked about this for years. Senator Leahy and I have come to an agreement. I would like to have it go further and offer liability protection beyond just the pilots who might be offering their services, as my friend from Iowa and I have done many times at our own expense because no one else would do it.  I would say to the occupier of the chair, it wasn't that many years ago there was a horrible hurricane that wiped out an island called Dominica, north of Caracas, Venezuela. I remember putting together 10 airplanes, general aviation airplanes, and we took doctors and nurses and generators and goods down there and food and water because nobody else would do it. This type of thing is going on all the time, and I think they should be afforded some protection from the liability laws. But I do realistically know with this compromise, we can get it passed and this would offer individuals protection.  The other amendment I have is quite different. It has to do with something called subpart S of FAR in the regulations, part 121. The Department of Defense--in the movement of many of the troops and individuals--relies on supplemental carriers. We are talking about nonscheduled carriers or charter airlines, and these are people or airlines that are nonscheduled. They come under a separate part, subpart B, and they are given some exemption from the crew rest rigid parts that affect the scheduled airlines. It is easy for a scheduled airline to have these very rigorous crew rest times because they are, as it says, scheduled. But when you get into nonscheduled, you are getting into areas where it is much more difficult.  So I wish to say two things about it. First of all, the supplemental air carriers have had a safety record that is even better than scheduled. There has never been one time in 15 years that the NTSB has cited something wrong, something that has happened with the part B or nonscheduled carriers as a result of fatigue. It hasn't happened. I often say we get too anxious to pass laws around here. I have always had the philosophy if it ``ain't'' broken, don't fix it. This is not broken, and it has worked very well. So I think their record speaks for itself.  The thing a lot of people are not aware of is if you are a nonscheduled airline, you are able to have longer rest periods, even though you may go over the 15 hours of actual flight time. So it works out, in the long range, they can do things they couldn't do otherwise.  Here is the thing not many people realize about nonscheduled airlines. The Department of Defense depends on them for 95 percent of all military passengers and 40 percent of military cargo. That is going into Iraq, Afghanistan, all throughout the danger points, and Southwest Asia, and it is expected that these new regulations will negatively impact the mission capability and increase the cost to both the carriers and to DOD.  Supplemental flights in support of the Department of Defense are carried out under control of the Air Mobility Command, which is at Fort Scott Air Force Base in Illinois. A central feature of the supplemental carrier's ability to complete these critical missions every day is the flexibility built into subpart S of the FAA regulations.  I am not offering something that is going to change how they treat subpart S. I am only going to say they currently have a rule they are considering, and this rule would do away with the distinction between subpart Q, R, and subpart S, which is nonscheduled airlines. So if we are depending upon these nonscheduled airlines to fly our troops, our cargo into these war-torn areas, then there is no other way of doing it.  You can say: Well, the Air Force can use their C-17s. Right now the Air Force's C-17s are in an OPTEMPO, where they can't take on any more missions. So you have critical things that are happening--such as flying blood into areas of combat. Let me give a couple examples. There is a regular run that goes from NATO--that is Belgium--from Belgium to Bagram, then back to Amsterdam. They are taking things such as tents, cargo, gasoline, food, and other supplies. That would be 19.6 hours. That means they can't do it. To do it, they would have to have crew rest time, and that would have to take place in Bagram. There are rules against it. You can't leave a commercial airline in Bagram. It cannot be done. So you have to figure out some way to get that cargo in and out of Bagram.  There is another regular run from Germany to Kandahar and then to Hong Kong. Well, that is 17.5 hours, so you can't do that because you can't leave your aircraft in a war zone. There is another run from Shannon to Kyrgystan and return, and that is something that is 16 hours and 15 minutes. That can't be done.  I think the one that is most critical is twice a week one carrier currently operates and takes lifesaving blood runs from McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey to Ramstein in Germany and then to Qatar. From Qatar, they have to go all the way into Afghanistan and back, and that round trip extends beyond the 15 hours that would be allowed with a scheduled airline. So under subpart S, they can do it. We are talking about twice a week, regular runs, taking blood into areas in Afghanistan where it is critical we get it in.  So I am just saying the FAA, in promulgating the rules they are looking at right now, should take into consideration that there is a separate type of a mission that has to be performed for our young men and women in harm's way, and we can't do it unless we treat the subpart S of the rule FAR 121 from the scheduled airlines. So I am hoping we will have a chance.  My concern is this: There are a lot of people who, for some labor reasons, don't want to have anyone to have the ability to go beyond the 15 hours, even though they get more rest time. I am the only one talking about the fact we have the lives of our young men and women in harm's way at stake depending on this subpart S treatment. So this thing is very critical. I believe we should do something to make sure, if they are going to look at the rules, they at least look at the rules in a different light than just looking at them altogether, but look at subpart S and hear the testimony and see if that doesn't work, the special consideration.                               The Budget  Mr. President, I don't see anyone else in the Chamber waiting to talk, so I wish to make one additional comment. I was in shock when I got off the plane and read what the President came out with in his budget. I think it is unbelievable--$8.7 trillion in new spending, $1.6 trillion in new taxes, $13 trillion in new debt, the current year deficit increased by $1.6 trillion--not $1.4 or $1.5, as they talked before--and it is incredible this could be happening right now.  I wonder if he didn't get the message of last November 2; that is, people know we cannot keep extending the spending, the fact we had an increase in the first 2 years--and this came straight from the White House, from the administration--in our spending greater than all spending in the history of this country from George Washington to George W. Bush can't happen. People are talking about the deficits that took place during George W. Bush, with an average deficit of $247 billion, and that was right after trying to rebuild a military and after 9/11, when we found ourselves, for all practical purposes, in two wars. So instead of a deficit of $247 billion, the deficit in this administration has been $3 trillion in 2 years. That is inconceivable.  I thought he would come out with something, after listening to the State of the Union Message, that would start moderating and start trying to save some money, but it hasn't happened. There is spending money on everything except the military, which is the big loser. I don't know why it is that liberals never want to spend money on the military--an $80 billion cut over a 5-year period in the Department of Defense. This is right after we went through the 1990s, where we had adrawdown of our Defense by about 40 percent, and of course we find ourselves now, after 9/11, in two wars.  So I think we need to make sure the American people realize the State of the Union Message sounded real good when he said we are going to start putting a freeze on. You know what that freeze is? The freeze is to take the nondefense discretionary spending and freeze it for 5 years. But wait a minute, that is after he increased it over 20 percent. So he increased it so we can't afford it and then he freezes it there so we can't bring it back down.  So anyway, I hope people are looking carefully and seeing what is happening. They will. If you look at what they are doing just to the oil and gas industry--and I know a lot of people in the liberal communities who want to put them out of business, and they are going to successfully do it if they pass this particular budget--I am talking about percentage depletion, the IDC--the section 199 manufacturer's deduction. By the way, the only industry under this budget that is affected negatively by that is oil and gas. All other manufacturers in industry are all right. So I hope people have a chance to look at this carefully.  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
