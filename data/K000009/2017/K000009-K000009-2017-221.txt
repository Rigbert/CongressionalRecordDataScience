Speaker, the freedom to live in a democratic society with freedom of speech, assembly, press, and religion are rights Americans hold most precious.  Not so in Putin's Russia. Putin's Russia brutally invaded Ukraine in 2013, resulting, to date, in over 10,000 war dead, with millions of displaced persons. The war grinds on.  Dozens and dozens of Putin's critics in the press have ended up dead, murdered for expressing their views. In 2015, Boris Nemstov, about to lead an assembly in favor of Ukrainian independence in Moscow, was murdered on the stairs near the Kremlin.  Georgiy Gondgadze, editor of the news Website Ukrayinska Pravda, featured critical articles about Putin ally Leonid Kuchma. He disappeared in the year 2000, and his headless body was discovered in a forest more than 40 miles from home.  Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian journalist, was murdered in the elevator of her block of flats in 2006.  And Paul Klebnikov, an American, who was chief editor of the Russian edition of Forbes, was killed in 2004, likely by hired assassins.  All dead, no investigations, no justice. This is Putin's Russia.  President-elect Trump best be very wary of whom he showers praise upon, for the cock is crowing too close to home.                          ____________________
