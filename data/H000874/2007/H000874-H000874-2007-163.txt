As you well know, as you get down towards the end, if we are going to have any shot at adjourning on the 16th of November, when the Senate is scheduled to leave for the last 2 weeks, if we have any shot of doing that, it will be because we complete that work which we think must be done, should be done prior to that. And, therefore, I am reserving those Fridays, and if we have work, we will be working. And the logical follow-on is that if we don't have work, although we won't give the kind of notice we are giving for the 5th and 19th, we will try not to have Members here simply watching the other body.
