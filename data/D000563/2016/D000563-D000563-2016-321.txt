These cases are working their way through the courts, but only the Supreme Court can finally resolve the issues. But the Court may be unable to do that. A 4-to-4 Court with a tie will not resolve an issue. Unless the Senate Republicans do their job, the Supreme Court will be stuck with eight members for more than a year.  I have a trivia question. When was the last time the Senate left a vacancy on the Supreme Court for a year or more? During the Civil War. It took a war between the States for us to leave a vacancy that long in the Court--a vacancy which the Senate Republicans are continuing by this obstruction.  As we reflect on the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will take a step back from politics. I hope they will acknowledge that Merrick Garland stepped up for this Nation, did the right thing, and proved he could do his job. Senate Republicans have no less responsibility. It is time for the Senate Republican majority to do its job.  I yield the floor.
