Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3851, the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act, which targets perpetrators of genocide or war crimes, and commend my friend Virginia Foxx for authoring it. The War Crimes Rewards Program, administered by the State Department, has helped apprehend perpetrators of atrocity crimes on the run from the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. But our current law does not explicitly authorize rewards to enable prosecutions in the United States or domestic courts in other countries. This bill would make it clear rewards can be used to support domestic prosecutions.  Tribunals like those for the Former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have done yeoman's work and we should continue to support them. That is why I have called for the United States to support and help stand up a Syria war crimes tribunal. But domestic courts are also essential for prosecuting perpetrators. With so many fugitive terrorists who committed atrocity crimes in Iraq or Syria, and can be tried in the domestic courts of their home country or another country, this legislation is especially timely.  I support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do likewise.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I call on the Senate to finally vote on and pass H.R. 390, the Iraq and Syria Genocide Emergency Relief and Accountability Act.  This House passed it unanimously last June 6 and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously passed it last September 19. The Committee Chairman, Senator Corker, has since been holding it hostage and will not permit it to proceed to the full Senate for a vote.  The bill would authorize the State Department and USAID to direct some aid to Christians, Yazidis and other religious and ethnic minorities targeted for genocide to enable them to survive in their ancient homelands. It would enable oversight to ensure the career bureaucrats are fully implementing the policy of the Administration and provide clear, detailed authorization for appropriations.  H.R. 390 also authorizes the State Department and USAID to support organizations conducting criminal investigations into ISIS perpetrators of atrocity crimes and collecting evidence that can be used in domestic courts and tribunals. This advances our counter-terrorism initiatives and justice for the victims. The House voted on H.R. 390 and the Senate should be given the same opportunity.                          ____________________
