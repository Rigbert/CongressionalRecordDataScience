President, I thank Senators Wellstone, Gregg, and Dayton and those who have initiated this effort for giving me an opportunity to be cosponsor. I thank them for this amendment and for giving us a chance to express our gratitude to the men and women in the National Guard across America who are serving our country so well. They make extraordinary sacrifices, put their lives on the line and serve their country.  This amendment gives them the recognition and reward they need. We can do more. I believe we will. But this amendment is an excellent first start to say to these men and women: We know you are serving our country. You deserve our praise, our prayers, and the recognition and help of this amendment.
