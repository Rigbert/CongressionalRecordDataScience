 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the 11:30 a.m. vote today, the nomination of Norman Mineta, to be Secretary of Transportation, be placed on the calendar. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration and a vote on the confirmation of the nomination. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the vote, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
