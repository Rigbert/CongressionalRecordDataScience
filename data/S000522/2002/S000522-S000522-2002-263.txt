Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the thirteenth anniversary of the Department of Veterans Affairs becoming a Cabinet Department. As Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am privileged to work with thousands of dedicated employees of the Department to improve the delivery of benefits and services to our nation's 25 million veterans and their families.  On October 25, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed the Department of Veterans Affairs Act (H.R. 3471 in the 100th Congress), legislation I cosponsored and strongly supported. This Act led to the Veterans Administration (VA) becoming the 14th federal Department of the Executive Branch.  Subsequently, on March 15th, 1989, thirteen years ago this week, the Honorable Edwin Derwinski, was sworn in as the first Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Finally, the nation's veterans had a full and permanent seat at the President's Cabinet table.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is the second largest federal agency in terms of employees, with over 220,000 dedicated men and women providing a range of vital benefits and services for veterans around the country. The VA operates the largest integrated health network in the world, comprised of 163 medical centers, over 800 Community Based Outpatient Clinics, 135 nursing homes, 43 domiciliaries and 73 comprehensive home-care programs. The VA continues to provide quality care to millions of veterans, their families and their survivors.  In addition, the VA operates one of the most important medical research programs in the world, with more than 15,000 research projects at 115 VA medical centers. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is on the cutting edge of research on matters ranging from brain trauma to hepatitis C to Alzheimer's disease. The VHA also pays particular attention to the wounds and illnesses of soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen, and recently opened two new Centers for the Study of War-Related Illnesses, one in Washington, DC, and the other in my home state of New Jersey.  The Department of Veterans Affairs maintains a national network of veterans' cemeteries for our nation's veterans, consisting of 119 national cemeteries in 39 states and Puerto Rico and also administers six life insurance programs with 2.2 million policies in force having a face value of $22 billion.  The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), created as part of the new Department of Veterans Affairs, oversees a myriad of benefits programs for veterans, including disability compensation, education and training, job placement, home loans, and life insurance. Over 2.7 million veterans receive disability compensation payments for wounds or illnesses resulting from their service to our nation, and an additional 570,000 widows, children and surviving parents of deceased veterans also receive monthly benefit payments.  Mr. Speaker, the VA also operates the GI Bill program, which has provided college education and training to more than 20 million veterans since its creation in 1944. This historic program not only changed the way America looked at veterans benefits, it also changed the nature of higher education and helped to create the modern middle class. In addition, the VA operates the veterans home loan program, which has helped over 16 million former servicemen and women buy their own homes.  Since the creation of the original Veterans Administration in 1930, our nation has recognized the unique contributions and sacrifices of the men and women who have defended our freedom at home and abroad. Today, the Department of Veterans Affairs, ably led by Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi, continues to provide the benefits and services that our nations veterans have earned.  On the wall outside the VA's main office in Washington, DC, the words of President Abraham Lincoln are engraved on the building: ``To care for him who have borne the battle, and his widow and his orphan.'' This is the mission that draws so many committed men and women to the VA.  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to work on behalf of our nation's veterans and I want to pay tribute to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and especially all of their gifted and dedicated employees, on the 13th anniversary of their becoming a full Cabinet Department of the federal government.                          ____________________
