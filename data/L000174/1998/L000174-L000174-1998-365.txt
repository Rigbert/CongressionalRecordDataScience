President, I rise today to recognize a commendable group of Vermont teens. Oftentimes, society shortchanges teenagers by placing unfair stereotypes upon them and by not listening to what they have to say. The eighth grade students of Barton Academy have written an article to prove that they, as teens, are vital members of their community and of society as a whole. I was particularly impressed with not only the message but with the eloquence of this article. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Congressional Record so that all Senators may read the words of these fine teenagers.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the 1997 Vermont Kids Count]                          Youth Health Issues       The following article, written by a class of Barton eighth      graders, introduces this section on youth health issues. It      provides the much-needed perspectives of teenagers, drawing      attention to not only their daily lives but to the heart of      many teen issues--the adult society in which they live and      grow.              teens defend themselves against stereotypes       We present ourselves not as problems to society, but as we      really are, 32 teens looking at themselves and society. Not      statistics, but the real thing, us. We would like to present      what we do that we are proud of, feel we have accomplished,      and what we have given to others. We come from all social and      economic backgrounds and come together each day in our town      school. We have our ups and downs with each other, but get      along more often than we do not. Life is not perfect, but      neither is yours.       If you knew us, lived with us, celebrated and grieved with      us there would be no need for this response. However, it is      our experience that most adults simply ignore, disregard or      fear teens. How many adults can you see in any given line at      a movie even nod recognition of a teen's humanity, much less      start a short conversation? We want to start that      conversation.       Hey Mister, did you know that some of us do barn chores      before we even go to school every morning. We do evening      chores, too. In between, we go to school, make honor roll on      occasion, play sports, participate in band and chorus and      ride the roller coaster of adolescence.       Some of us have part-time jobs to earn the money we want      for things. We shovel snow, mow lawns, baby-sit and clean      houses for less than minimum wage. We've saved our money for      a few years to get what we wanted. We also earn money to buy      some of our own clothing, sports equipment and entertainment.      Some of us even earn money to contribute to family      necessities. Imagine that.       We have a sense of community. Who do you see picking up the      trash along our roads and fields during Green Up Day? Who is      collecting bottles for a class trip? Who are the crossing      guards so younger children won't get hit by cars? Whose      clothes have thoughtfully been gone through and chosen with      care to give to clothing centers, or victims of fires? We      have given our clothes, our bicycles, games, money and music      to others in need just because we were asked.       We, the 32 teens of the eighth grade of Barton, have      volunteered to carry elders' grocery bags just because we saw      them struggling. We also volunteer to shovel out our      grandparents' dooryards, and even accept the money they      insist we take because we know it makes them feel good, too.      We march and play our musical instruments in Memorial Day and      Veterans Day parades in honor of those who served. Sometimes      we go to local nursing homes and play our instruments or      sing. Sometimes we go just to share and talk.       Most of us have family responsibilities that we honor. We      split wood and stack it; and move it from one place to      another. We trudge through snow and mud to gather sap and      help sugar. We do the laundry for the family, set the table,      cook some meals, and clean up afterward and empty the trash.      We grumble, but we do the chores. We watch our younger      brothers and sisters. For the most part, we think we are      pretty helpful. Some of us were even responsible for bringing      the possibility of recycling into our homes.       Did you know that teens in our community volunteer to tutor      younger children? Some of the teens at Lake Region Union High      School coach our junior hoop program and referee our games.      Most of us would gladly lend a hand if we were asked.       Society says that our job is school. Mandatory. We do that,      too. We go, learn, try to learn, and try to learn again.      Sometimes we give up but not too often. The dropout rate at      Lake Region union High School is less than 2 percent,      according to Lake Region Annual Report, Jan. 15, 1997. We      might not be in the top 10 percent of the world's smartest      kids, but do we really need to be? Society is a problem to us      sometimes, too. If you want to separate society into parts,      we, as teens and citizens, are not responsible for the      pollution of the world, the genocide in most corners,      poverty, houseless people, pornography, gridlock and the      corruption of our national leaders. Drugs are everywhere. Do      we manufacture them or smuggle them into the country? Society      has taught us from the first time we viewed a sporting event      that beer is where it's at. How are we to sort out the mixed      messages we are bombarded with? We listen weekly to the      adults in the news who compare us unfavorably with the test      scores of other countries. We do not make the movies rated      PG-13 that include more profanity than we would ever think of      using. Where are the everyday role models that you would like      us to emulate?       Our advice--get to know a teen up front and personal. We      don't like the word scapegoat for anyone. It makes it too      easy to cast the first stone.                          ____________________
