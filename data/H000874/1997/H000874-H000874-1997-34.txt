Speaker, the majority leader is correct. We stand in those seats and we raise our right hand and we swear to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. There is no more sacred right that the people have than to select their representatives, and to select them in an election that is fair and does not dilute in any way their votes.  Therefore, I tell you that it is appropriate that if those who voted illegally affected this election, this election should be scrutinized carefully and appropriate action taken. But in the same vein, the voters of the 46th Congressional District have the right to expect us to conduct that process in a manner befitting of that oath.  I tell my friends in this House, sadly, as the minority member of this task force, that that has not been done. I asked early on that we proceed in a bipartisan fashion to establish process, to establish the way that we would reach a decision, in an orderly, fully dispositive, timely way.  I tell my friend, that has not been done. In point of fact, as the resolution points out, the task force has not met since April of this year. I asked in February in a letter to the chairman of the task force, let us meet together to come to agreement on the process. No such meeting has ever occurred.  I tell my friends that I asked to be fully apprised of the information we were seeking and the information we were receiving. I tell you sadly, that has not occurred.  In fact, my friends, this very day I found out at 4:15 that there will be the third meeting of the task force since the beginning of this year, tomorrow at 10 o'clock. No prior notice. And I tell my friend, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Ehlers], the chairman of the task force, he and I talked for approximately 45 minutes this morning at 10 o'clock, and I was never informed that there would be a task force meeting.  No, my friends, this process has not been fair, it has not been open, it has not been directed at fully getting out the information that is necessary to fairly determine this election.  Now, my friends, I tell you, the Republican Secretary of State in latter March or early April said there were 303 votes that were in question in this election. You heard the testimony from the gentleman from Connecticut saying many of those votes have already been found to be registered, valid voters.  The Secretary of State of California, two weeks ago, had a press conference and he said, after 6 months, he now believed there were not 303, there were 305. That is a third of a voter a month. I tell my friend from California, at that rate it would take us 160 years to get to 984, and then you would have to assume that every one of those voters voted for [Ms. Sanchez], and our precedents do not allow that, and logic does not compel it.  My friends, this resolution says, as the two bipartisan individuals who were counsel for the Republicans and counsel for the Democrats in March of this year said, let Mary Landrieu go, because they have not made a prima facia case. And, very frankly, the Republican leadership rejected that. It took them 5\1/2\ months.  I tell my friend from California, the distinguished legal professor, to come to exactly the same conclusion. Why, Mary Landrieu twisted in the wind and had to spend money and had to have her focus diverted to defend a case that Republican counsel and Democratic counsel 5 months ago said had no merit.                              {time}  1715  I ask that this resolution pass; that we decide the case on the gentlewoman from California [Mrs. Sanchez] or we dismiss this case, which is without merit.
