 Speaker, today I would like to salute six outstanding young women who are being presented with the Girl Scout Gold Award by the Vermont Girl Scout Council. They are:  Kellie Miner, 619 Basin Harbor Road, Vergennes, VT 05491, Cassie Charlebois, PO Box 323, Vergennes, VT 05491, Catherine McEnerney, 39 Boothwoods, Vergennes, VT 05491, Linnea Oosterman, 1074 Slatterly Road, Vergennes, VT 05491, Stephanie Leonard, 201 Sunset Drive, Morrisville, VT 05661, Rebecca Robare, 6 Giorgetti Blvd., Rutland, VT 05701.  They are being honored on May 16, 2000 for earning the highest achievement in U.S. Girl Scouting.  The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning and personal development. The award can be earned by girls aged 14-17, or in grades 9-12. To receive the award, these Girl Scouts first earned four interest project patches, the Career Exploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award and the Senior Girl Scout Challenge as well as designing and implementing a Girl Scout Gold Award project tomeet what they saw as a need in their community. A synopsis of Gold Award projects is provided here.  Kellie Miner, Vergennes, VT is a musician with a gift for teaching youth. Kellie developed an after school music program teaching guitar and keyboards at her local elementary school with another Senior Girl Scout from her community. Kellie knows that musical education enhances children's ability to focus, to practice numerical and language skills and to feel a sense of success. Kellie served children from Kindergarten through sixth grade. Though the age range was a bit broad, she enjoyed teaching something she loves. She believes that her Girl Scout Gold Award Project will influence her to decide about a future as a high school choral director.  Cassie Charlebois, Vergennes, VT was the song leader for the after school music program she developed with another Senior Girl Scout from her community. Cassie collaborated on the project with the hope of engaging children in the fun and sense of group cooperation that singing provides. Cassie taught music to younger children who had varying reading abilities through repetition and reinforcement with the words written out on a flip chart. She organized a closing concert and invited the community. Cassie feels her own personal growth was in discovering her success as a teacher and overcoming shyness. She knows that her project has reminded children of the importance of music in their lives.  Katie McEnerney of Vergennes, VT is an artist. Her Gold Award Project was to collaborate with a fellow Senior Girl Scout to restore a playground structure at a local preschool. Katie first had to communicate with the school's administration to explain how the playground area could be improved. She selected a colorful rainbow theme, created the plans, and sketched the designs over the entire wooden structure inside and out. Katie was also concerned about the structure's stability and the over all safety of the playground. Her involvement in this Gold Award Project has been one that required careful planning, negotiating skills and a sense of timing so that the project would not inhibit the school schedule. Katie hopes to continue her skills through a career in the arts.  Linnea Oosterman of Vergennes, VT is interested in art. Linnea chose to collaborate with a fellow Senior Girl Scout to restore a playground structure at a local preschool. Linnea contributed to the project by securing the necessary materials, painting the design created by her partner and helping to restore the safety of the playground by sanding and treating the wood before painting. She completed the project by building a sandbox around the base. Linnea was primarily concerned that the children have a fun, safe and colorful place to play. Linnea chose this project as a worthwhile activity that she hopes will improve the playspace and make her a better artist.  Stephanie Leonard of Marrisville, VT is a musician who plays several instruments. In her community it is sometimes challenging for families to find adequate after school child care that is fun, accessible and safe. Stephanie developed an after school arts program for the Bishop Marshall Catholic School as part of their ongoing after school offerings. Stephanie incorporated both her musical talents and her interest in arts and crafts in the activities for the children. Stephanie enjoyed working with the children and found the collaboration with the existing after school program goals to blend well with her own vision of a fun experience for youth.  Rebecca Robare of Rutland, VT is a multiply talented young woman. As a past member of our Board of Directors, Becky was personally involved in policy decisions at the Council. Becky chose her Gold Award Project to respond to what she felt was a lack of creative statewide offerings for older girls through the Vermont Girl Scout Council. This project was her attempt to create change on a programmatic level. Becky chose to host an event at the Fletcher Farm School for Arts and Crafts. She coordinated use of space for activities, meals, lodging and entertainment and collected her own registrations. Becky learned a great deal about her organizational abilities and how to effectively communicate with numerous players in hosting of this event. The success of the event was evident from the evaluations of girls in attendance.                          ____________________
