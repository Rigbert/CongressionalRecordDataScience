 President, I rise today to commemorate Memorial Day and pay tribute to the brave men and women who have given their lives in defense of the freedom and liberties we cherish in this great Nation.  Throughout this country, Memorial Day, originally recognized as Decoration Day, is a day to remember those who have died in service to our Nation.  It was first widely observed on May 30, 1868, to commemorate the sacrifices of Civil War soldiers by proclamation of General John A. Logan of the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of former sailors and soldiers. Over a century later, in 1971, Congress declared Memorial Day a national holiday to be celebrated the last Monday in May. Today, thousands of people attend Memorial Day ceremonies across the country to commemorate this special day.  This year, our observance of this national holiday is marked by the opening of the National World War II Memorial in our Nation's capital. Authorized by President Clinton in 1993, this national memorial will be the first of its kind dedicated to all who served during World War II.  It is during this Memorial Day weekend, in conjunction with the new memorial dedication, that Americans will honor the nearly 16 million who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II, the more than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war effort from home.  According to the Department of Defense, more citizens from California served in World War II than any other State. And an estimated 457,000 World War II veterans currently live in California. That generation, led by the Nation's Armed Forces, defended America's ideals during World War II and changed the world in the process.  At this moment, another generation faces an equally difficult challenge that will define the world for many years to come. Today, we face a new foe, terrorism, which threatens the very freedoms that World War II was fought to protect. The battleground this time is less clear. Indeed, the threat of terrorism exists all over the world--not merely in the Middle East, but also on our shores.  The war on terror is a massive effort that will require the highest level of commitment and dedication possible to enable America and her allies to prevail. Today over 1.6 million men and women serve in active duty spread throughout 67 countries. California alone provides over 182,000 military and civilian personnel.  In Afghanistan, American troops, along with a multinational coalition, have defeated the Taliban regime, striking a severe blow to al-Qaida's operation in that country. Our forces have enabled Afghans to draft a constitution, laying the groundwork for a democratic government. Women will soon have the right to vote and hold office. Girls are being educated in schools again. Nonetheless, there is still much work to be done to secure the country and ensure the basic rights of Afghan citizens.  The military success in Afghanistan has not come without sacrifice. No example drives home this point more than the death of Army Ranger Pat Tillman, killed in action a few weeks ago while on a mission in southeastern Afghanistan.  Tillman, a native of San Jose, California, was an All-American football player at Arizona State who later went on to play professionally with the NFL's Arizona Cardinals.  At the height of his career, he walked away from pro football to serve his country during wartime. On April 23, 2004, Tillman became one of 110 U.S. soldiers killed during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. His life was a model of sacrifice.  The war in Iraq has proven to be an even more difficult task. Although our Armed Forces have removed Saddam Hussein from power and taken steps to set up a transitional democratic government run by the people of Iraq, our troops are in a very dangerous situation. It is rare that a day goes by without the report of another American who has fallen victim to the attacks of Iraqi insurgents. As of May 21, 92 Californians have lost their lives in Operation Iraqi Freedom.  One of them was Marine Lance Corporal Brad Shuder, 21, of El Dorado Hills, east of Sacramento. He enlisted a month after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and fought in the invasion of Iraq last year before returning for a second tour.  Shuder, a South Korean native, was adopted at 22 months and grew up to be a gourmet cook and opera lover. He was killed on April 12 of this year.  I would also like to take a moment to name the other Californians who have given their lives in Iraq.  Specialist Marcos O. Nolasco, Chino; Private 1st Class Michael A.

The Pentagon reports that through today, America has incurred 797 casualties in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 120 deaths in Operation Enduring Freedom. And more than 4,800 men and women have been wounded in these conflicts.  Such grim statistics underscore the fact that the current administration must do more to seek international help, especially in Iraq, during these trying times. Additionally, we must provide the equipment necessary to keep our soldiers safe. At the very least, we owe our soldiers this for their tremendous sacrifice.  In closing, I am honored to take this time to join every American in saluting those individuals who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to uphold the ideals of our democratic Nation.  On Memorial Day, we renew the commitment of this great Nation to the common defense of the country and to the broader causes of peace and freedom from tyranny throughout the world.                          ____________________
