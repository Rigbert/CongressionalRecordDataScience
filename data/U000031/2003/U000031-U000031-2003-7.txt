Speaker, reclaiming my time, I just want to say that our two districts in southwest Michigan share a boundary. We are a victim of transient air coming from Milwaukee, from Chicago, and Gary, Indiana. Our problem is not with the clean air. We want those communities to have clean air and to have transient clean air so that we do not have a problem on our side of the State. We are a victim. We would have to impose literally a fan to send this air someplace else without this legislation to avoid some type of sanction that will cost tens of millions of dollars.
