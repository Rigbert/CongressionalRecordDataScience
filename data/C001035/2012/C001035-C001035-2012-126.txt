President, in his famous essay titled ``Courage,'' Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that he most admired those ``who can organize their wishes and thoughts in stone and wood and steel and brass.'' In our time, when so much is mass produced and temporary, we have a special regard for the craftsmen and women who turn the materials provided by nature into objects of beautiful form and lasting function.  I rise today to congratulate the craftsmen and women of Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers of Auburn, ME, as they celebrate the 40th anniversary of this remarkable company. With skill and creativity, they transform black cherry, maple, ash, and walnut into fine furniture that is recognized worldwide as the pinnacle of the woodworkers' art.  This story of success driven by the pursuit of excellence began in 1972, when Tom Moser left the secure life of a college professor to follow his dream to revive the craftsmanship of woodworkers of the past. With his wife Mary, they set up shop in an old Grange Hall in New Gloucester, ME.  They met the challenges faced by all entrepreneurs with determination. Soon, their sons joined them in the growing business. Today, 70 skilled men and women work in their modern woodshop in Auburn and another 50 in other aspects of the operation, including showrooms in major American cities, from New York and Washington, DC, to Los Angeles and San Francisco.  When Tom and Mary Moser founded this company, they did more than revive quality woodworking--they were pioneers in Maine's thriving creative economy. From cutting-edge technology to the arts, these visionaries are moving our State forward, building new industries and new opportunities.  This segment of the creative economy truly defines Maine. The resurgence of furniture making, cabinetry, pottery, and textiles bring the past alive and remind us of the special quality of something made by hand in Maine. The talented designers and woodworkers of Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers create objects that bring pleasure today and will be treasured heirlooms for generations to come. I congratulate the Moser family and all their employees for 40 years of success.                          ____________________
