Chairman, the key here is the word ``demonstration.'' Demonstration to me means let us go out and see if it will work, and then let us review it. In fact, there is a logical review point: Next March.  This bill extends for 2 years beyond October 1, 1999 the demonstration program, after it is no longer a demonstration, with all of its faults intact. The logical thing to do is not extend it now. The Committee on Appropriations could come forward next year with an extension, if we fail to authorize it in the authorizing committee, and again legislate on an appropriations bill.
