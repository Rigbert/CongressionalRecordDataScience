 President, today the Senate will be conducting a period of morning business to allow Senators to speak and introduce legislation. Talks continue with respect to the committee resolutions.  On behalf of the majority leader, I announce to all Members that this week we will need to complete action on the committee resolution and the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2003. It is the hope that the committee resolution will be agreed to by consent once an agreement is reached.  The appropriations bills will require floor time and votes throughout the week. As the majority leader mentioned last week, the Senate will remain in session to complete those matters. Therefore, votes are possible each day this week and Senators should plan their schedules accordingly.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Nevada.                          ____________________
