Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  [[Page H2560]] Mr. Chairman, what I just heard was the developer has an absolute right with 10 percent diminishment of any part, tiny fraction of his property under Federal regulation if it goes to the Wetlands Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act or others. But that the adjoining or downstream property owner has a right of civil action. So what we are saying here is we are creating two categories. If you are a major developer, you have an absolute right to reimbursement by Federal taxpayers if there is a tiny diminishment of the optimal development value of your land, but if you are an adjoining or downstream property owner, you can go to court.  That is what I just heard the gentleman say, civil right of action. I was a county commissioner. We had a gentleman who had an island in the river. He drove a giant belly scraper out there, a D-9 Cat, and he was just terra-firming the land, and this was not allowed under our State land use law but the State land use law had trouble prosecuting him. We had to bring in the Feds to put a stop to that development. The people who wanted that development stopped were the adjoining farm downstream, because he said, ``You know what happens when he builds those berms and he does that? My land floods, I get all these road seeds and pollution and sediment on my land and it ruins my land.''  But you are saying to my farmer downstream and where we use the Clean Water Act for an enforcement, my farmer downstream is now going to have to go to court as opposed to getting the Federal Government to enforce this.
