Speaker, I rise today to recognize the departure of a valued member of my team, Mr. Deke Tompkins.  A proud native of the Great Lakes State and a graduate of Michigan State University, Deke began working in my Washington, DC office as a staff assistant in 2006. Sitting in the front office, he quickly distinguished himself as a welcoming face to all who walked through the door. He was a great resource to those calling the office and made everyone he spoke with know that their voices were being heard.  Deke worked his way up to legislative assistant, working on projects in the district and managing a broad legislative portfolio, including: national security, foreign policy, law enforcement, immigration, and labor issues, to name a few. But above all, Deke was a passionate advocate for Michigan's military service members, veterans, and their families, as well as our local farmers and the Great Lakes.  Deke has been an invaluable member of our office--a team player who was always willing to pitch in wherever help was needed and a friend to us all. His enthusiasm in the office was contagious; his intense love for all things Michigan State unmatched. A hardworking, humble, and selfless person, Deke made a lasting impact in the lives of many, which is what public service is all about. Our team will not be the same without him.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Deke Tompkins and his outstanding service to the folks of Michigan's Sixth Congressional District. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors and know that he will continue on to do great things. Go Green!                          ____________________
