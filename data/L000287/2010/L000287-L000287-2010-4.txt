Mr. Speaker, the DREAM Act, this is a bill that we should have passed a long time ago. The American dream--isn't that why we are all here, why we work, toil, and sacrifice for these United States of America? These young people, uprooted from their homes and brought to this country as children, some of them so young this is the only home they have ever known. They have obeyed our laws, became excellent students, sacrificed blood and tears for our country, just as any good American would do.  Mr. Speaker, the time is always right to do what is right. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and pass it now.
