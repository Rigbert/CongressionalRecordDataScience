President, today I pay tribute to the long and distinguished service of chief warrant officer and ancient keeper, Kevin J. Galvin of the U.S. Coast Guard.  For over 30 years, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin has served proudly in our Nation's Coast Guard, exhibiting the classic attributes of a ``Coastie'': a profound dedication to duty, unsurpassed technical expertise, and an uncompromising commitment to operational excellence.  Since June 2006, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin has served as the commanding officer of Castle Hill Station in Newport, RI. Through this period, during which the Coast Guard has taken on an increasing burden to help secure our homeland, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin exhibited sound and capable leadership. Under his watch, the Castle Hill Station exceeded every operational expectation, including the successful execution of over 350 search and rescue cases which resulted in 46 lives saved, 428 persons assisted, and $23 dollars in property secured. Chief Warrant Officer Galvin also oversaw more than 500 law enforcement boardings, directed multiple ports, waterways, and coastal security missions to protect critical infrastructure, provided security for visits by the President and foreign heads of state, and led his crew in providing security and SAR response for Tall Ships 2007, where 27 ships visited Rhode Island from around the world culminating in a Parade of Sail with over 6000 spectator vessels.  On June 21, 2008, Chief Warrant Officer Galvin relieved master chief boatswain's mate John E. Downey as the ancient keeper of the Coast Guard, becoming the second recipient of the Joshua James Ancient Keeper Award. The Ancient Keeper Award is presented to a Coast Guard member on Active Duty in recognition of their longevity and outstanding performance in boat operations. The award's namesake, CAPT Joshua James, is the most celebrated lifesaver in Coast Guard history with 626 lives saved. Only those who have exemplified the finest traits of maritime professionalism and leadership are appointed keepers. The ancient keeper is charged with overseeing Coast Guard boat operations to ensure the service's traditional professionalism remains intact. Chief Warrant Officer Galvin has carried out this responsibility with honor and distinction.  On July 1, 2009, Chief Officer Galvin will bring his long and impressive career in the Coast Guard to an end and will be relieved of his duty as the ancient keeper and commanding officer of the Castle Hill Station by another outstanding member of the Coast Guard, CWO Thomas Guthlein.  Again, I commend Chief Warrant Officer Galvin for his dedicated career in the U.S. Coast Guard and thank him for all he has done in service to our country.                          ____________________
