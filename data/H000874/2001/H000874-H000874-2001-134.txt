Speaker, I rise today in support of honoring New York City firefighters John Downing, Brian Fahey, and Harry Ford.  Mr. Speaker, these three brave men made the ultimate sacrifice on June 17th when they responded to a fire at a hardware store in Queens in the early afternoon.  Some might have called it a routine call. All three men were veterans of the department and had between 11 and 27 years of experience in one of the busiest departments in the country. Undoubtedly they had all been on this type of call hundreds of times before.  Unfortunately, no call in the fire service is ever really routine. Every 82 seconds in this country the call for help goes out to America's fire service. And when that alarm bell rings, the men and women of the fire service know all too well that the call could be their last.  Every year in this country we lose about 100 firefighters in the line of duty. A number that I consider appallingly high. An additional 45,000 firefighters suffer injuries--some of them permanently debilitating. When you factor in training accidents and injuries sustained responding to calls, the number tops 88,000.  I did not know firefighters Downing, Fahey, or Ford. But they say that the measure of a man's character is his service to others. By this standard these men were giants for the sacrifice they made. I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.
