 It would give the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, as well as others who historically have been on the other side of this issue, an opportunity to offer amendments. It also will give us an opportunity, as the Senator from Arizona has indicated, to know what bill will be called up for debate on September 14. So I think this is a reasonable way to dispose of this issue that is fair to everyone, and it gives us an opportunity to proceed with the Senate's much more important business between now and the August recess.  I thank the majority leader for his good work on this, and I look forward to the debate later this year.
