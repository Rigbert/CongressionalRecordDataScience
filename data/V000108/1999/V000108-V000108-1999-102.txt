Speaker, it is my distinct honor to commend two of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Rabbi Stanley Halpern and Rabbi Michael Stevens. On Sunday, October 17, 1999, Rabbis Halpern and Stevens will be honored for their exemplary and dedicated service to Northwest Indiana and to the State of Israel. Their praiseworthy efforts will be recognized at the Northwest Indiana-Israel Dinner of State, as they receive the Shema Yisrael Award. The Shema Yisrael Award is given to worthy recipients who demonstrate their dedication and outstanding service of Israel and their community.  Rabbi Stanley Halpern, a resident of Portage, Indiana, came to Temple Israel in Gary, Indiana, in 1988 from Central California where he served as the Executive Director of the Bureau of Jewish Education in Sacramento. Rabbi Halpern is very involved in several organizations, including: the Jewish Deaf Congress, the Gary Interfaith Clergy Council, and the Interfaith Alliance of Northwest Indiana. He also serves as chaplain of the Gary Police Department. Additionally, he serves on the board at the Northwest Indiana Open Housing Center, the Bio-Ethics Committee of Munster Community Hospital, the Liheyot panel of the UAHC Committee on Family Concerns, and the CJF Special Committee on Accessibility.Though Rabbi Halpern is dedicated to his career and his community, he has never limited his time and love for his 16-year-old daughter, Sasha.  Rabbi Michael Stevens, a native of Brooklyn, New York, received both a bachelor's and master's degree in music, as well as a master's degree in Hebrew literature. In 1976, Rabbi Stevens was ordained as a Rabbi at the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. Before coming to Northwest Indiana in 1987 to serve the Temple Beth-El in Munster, Rabbi Stevens served as Rabbi of Beth Israel Temple Center in Warren, Ohio, and of Congregation Rodeph Shalom in Montreal, Quebec. He also served as Interim Rabbi of Congregation Keneseth Israel in Allentown, Pennsylvania. While Rabbi Stevens has dedicated considerable time and energy to his work, he always made an extra effort to give to the community. He has served on the Lake County AIDS Pastoral Care Network, reviewed concerts of the Northwest Indiana Symphony Orchestra, composed music for the Temple Beth-El choir, and has played the role of the Rabbi in a production of ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' He has served for many years on the faculty of the Olin-Sang-Ruby Union Institute camp in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, and currently teaches in the Department of English and Philosophy at Purdue University Calumet. Rabbi and Judy Stevens are the proud parents of four wonderful children, David, Joshua, Andrea, and Aaron.  The special guest at this gala event will be Mr. Uriel Lynn. Mr. Lynn is a distinguished lawyer and businessman and a former highly regarded member of Israel's Knesset.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating Rabbis Stanley Halpern and Michael Stevens for receiving the Shema Yisrael Award. Their dedicated service to both the State of Israel and our Northwest Indiana community is commendable and admirable.                          ____________________
