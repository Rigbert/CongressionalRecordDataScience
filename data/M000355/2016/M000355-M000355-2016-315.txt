 President, I rise to pay tribute to a hard-working businessowner, veteran, and respected Kentuckian, Mr. Roy Schott. Mr. Schott recently celebrated 61 years of work as a mechanic and service station owner and 55 years as a U-Haul outlet. His dedication to his work is something to be admired by us all.  Mr. Schott's journey began at the age of 15 when he discovered his interest and aptitude in mechanics. This led him to his first job in a garage, where he repaired motor vehicles. In 1951, he left his job and home to serve our country in the Korean war as a motor sergeant.  Upon returning to London, KY, from his time in the military, he and a friend opened a service station. Mr. Schott made an addition to his business in 1961 after seeing a U-Haul ad in the paper. The service station became Schott Marathon and U-Haul Dealership. At that time, U-Haul charged only $3 a day to rent a trailer, later adding a $1 fee for hitch rentals.  Mr. Schott's secrets to U-Haul success are good help, good customer service, and a good field manager. To this day, he has remained active in his business, coming every day to work alongside his loyal employees and interacting with his customers. After the loss of his wife in 2002, Mr. Schott considered retiring, but ultimately decided that he loves his job too much to ever stop.  I am very honored to represent Mr. Schott here in the U.S. Senate and want to wish him congratulations on his many years of service not only to the people of London, KY, but also to this nation. I am sure my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing gratitude and admiration for his service as well. He truly represents the finest of Kentucky.  Mr. President, an area publication, the Sentinel-Echo, published a compelling article on Roy Schott's life. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel-Echo, Aug. 22, 2016]Still Going Strong: Roy Schott Celebrates 61 Years of Keeping Vehicles                               on the Road                           (By Nita Johnson)       London businessman Roy Schott has many memories.       He will share some of those, but often says they are not      important.       But after 61 years of operating Schott's Service Station on      Main Street, he has a lot of memories and a lot of knowledge      to go with it.       ``Be sure to find out what kind of oil it needs,'' he said      to a customer who called his business on Thursday afternoon,      before going into the service section and assisting an      employee with loosening bolts on a car part.       Schott said he got involved in the mechanic business      because it paid better than some other vocations available in      1943.       ``I started working at a garage that is where the Sentinel-     Echo is now,'' he said. ``I got $1.50 a day. Other places      only paid $1 a day, except the railroad and it paid $1 an      hour.''       Schott learned to weld as part of his job, recalling that      parts weren't manufactured then as they are today.       ``If a bus came in with a broken window, you had to fix it      with a piece of tin,'' he said.       Schott left the business in 1951 with many other Laurel      Countians who went to serve their country in the Korean War.      He served two years during that conflict ``when all hell was      going on.'' War is no good memory for Schott, who still tears      up when he thinks about the end of World War II.       ``When World War II ended, the bell at the courthouse rang      all day,'' he said. ``There would be four or five bodies of      boys come in every day.''       Schott served as combat engineer in Korea, where he was a      motor sergeant and oversaw 23 trucks. He remembers those      trying times through a book presented to Korean veterans by      the Korean government. The book shows pictures of the      devastation during and following the war there, but      highlights the achievements made over the years as the      country rebuilt.       Once safely back home after the Korean War, Schott opened      his service station on South Main Street near the former      Ormsby Hardware. While also operating his service station,      Schott became an authorized U-Haul rental facility. He      credits Bill Ormsby for that venture--one that earned him      recognition from U-Haul last year for 55 years as an      authorized dealer.       ``I'm the oldest one in the state, probably the oldest one      in the country,'' he laughed.       But in 1955, Schott got a loan to start his own business.      He remembers that day when his loan was approved.       ``It was August 28, 1955,'' he said. ``When you borrow      money you know the date you got it.''       He moved the business to its current spot on North Main      Street across from London Elementary School in 1960. Now, 56      years later, he continues the tradition he began, still      working performing his magic on brakes, tires and air      conditioning units. The business has served him well,      providing for his four children over the years. He also has      grandchildren, of whom he cannot hide his pride.       ``Let me tell you about my grandchildren. No, that would      take too long,'' he said with a laugh.       Schott plans to continue to work until he is no longer      able, refusing to retire. When asked if he still works on      vehicles himself, he holds out his hands as proof.       ``I guess I do,'' he said.       He once considered retirement following the death of his      wife 14 years ago. But his son-in-law quickly talked him out      of it.       ``He said, `What are you going to do, climb the walls?' so      I decided to stay open,'' he said.       He believes working and staying busy is why he continues to      be able to serve residents in the London and Laurel areas.       ``A friend who retired told me to work all I could,'' he      said. ``He said the walls would close in on you after a      little while. So when people ask me if I'm going to stay here      until they have to carry me out, I tell them I guess they      will.''                          ____________________
