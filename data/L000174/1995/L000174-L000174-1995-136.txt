President, imagine the 4-H Club being banned from receiving any Federal grants because it spent too much money letting people in the hard-to-reach areas of rural America know about changes to agricultural laws. Imagine Planned Parenthood being forced to spend millions of dollars defending itself against suits filed by anyone ideologically opposed to their mission.   Well, if House Republicans have their way, you have to imagine much longer--you will be able to see it for yourself.  The authors of the so-called Contract With America would have you believe that they want to get government out of people's lives. Apparently that commitment does not extend to people who disagree with them. The Istook language is a thinly veiled attempt to gag non-profit organizations, to bind them up in bureaucratic red tape and prevent them from letting Congress or the public know about the impacts of Federal legislation.  It is no wonder that the American people hold such a low opinion of Congress. Today, more than 5 weeks into the fiscal year, only 2 of the 13 appropriation bills needed to run the Government have been signed into law. But instead of making a serious attempt to pass a continuing resolution that will keep Federal workers at their desks, House Republicans have chosen to send to the Senate a resolution sprinkled with items from their ideological wish list.  There are 800,000 Federal employees who have bills to pay and families to support, who will not be paid starting Tuesday if a continuing resolution is not passed. The Istook amendment has no place in the continuing resolution, it has no place in law. I urge my colleagues to strike the Istook language and send the President a continuing resolution that he can sign.
