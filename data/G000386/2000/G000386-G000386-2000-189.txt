 President, I am very pleased to join my esteemed colleagues, Senators Graham and Jeffords, in introducing this important piece of legislation. Title XX, the Social Services Block Grant, is crucial to states. Congress needs to meet its earlier commitment to this program and restore funding to the level authorized in 1996.  The Social Services Block Grant allows states the flexibility to fill in the gaps in their human services system. Through this funding, states, local governments and non-profit organizations can supplement other federal programs and leverage additional funding and resources to support an array of social service programs that are critical to those in need.  Millions of elderly people have benefitted from Title XX as have hundreds of thousand of individuals with disabilities. States use these funds to help support crucial services such as respite care for the elderly, adult protective services, supported living and transportation for the disabled. In recent years, more than a quarter of these funds have been used to support children's services. Child protective services, foster care and adoption programs have all been supplemented with these funds.  In my home state of Iowa, Social Services Block Grant funds are used to supplement numerous service programs. One program uses these funds to help transport individuals with developmental disabilities to their jobs and so that they may receive medical treatment. Funds are also used to help people with disabilities live in their communities, saving significant amounts of money that would otherwise go to caring for them in institutions.  Congress has consistently cut this important program in order to pay for other things. It is time that we restore funding to the level we authorized in 1996. Without this funding, important services that protect children, the elderly and the disabled will not be provided. I urge my other colleagues in the Senate to support our efforts to restore this program to the necessary level of funding.                          ____________________
