 President, because of the sudden death of the former mayor of Wilmington, Delaware, who was a close friend of mine, I had to return to Delaware today directly after the funeral for Senator Pastore. Consequently, I was necessarily absent for the roll-call votes on Senate amendments No. 3925 and No. 3927 to the Agriculture Appropriations bill. Had I been present, I would have voted yes on both amendments.  The high cost of pharmaceuticals in this country relative to the cost of the same drugs in nearby countries, such as Canada and Mexico, is a major irritant to many seniors struggling to make ends meet in the face of fixed incomes and high expenses for medications. Reimportation of drugs from foreign countries, although it may lower prescription drug costs for Americans, should not be permitted if it will jeopardize the health of this country's citizens. The potential effect of these provisions to reduce pharmaceutical research and development in the U.S. is an unknown but important factor. The controversy over these provisions serves to emphasize once again the need to expand Medicare to provide prescription drug insurance coverage for seniors and the disabled.
