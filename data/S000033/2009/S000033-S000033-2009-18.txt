 Yet I think virtually every one of them is in support of the repeal of the asset tax, which would benefit solely the top three-tenths of 1 percent and would cost the Treasury $1 trillion over a 20-year period--$1 trillion over a 10-year period. I am sorry, $1 trillion over a 10-year period.  I am really concerned about the deficit, I am concerned about the national debt, but I am prepared to vote for repealing the entire estate tax which only impacts--gives $1 trillion in tax breaks over a 10-year period to the top three-tenths of 1 percent.  Some may question the sincerity about their concern about the national debt.
