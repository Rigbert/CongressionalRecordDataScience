 Speaker, I rise today in support of the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997, legislation which supports communities across the Nation in their efforts to reduce rising teenage drug abuse. Studies show that teenage use of marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, methamphetamine, LSD, heroine, and other drugs is on the increase--and it is among children that we are seeing the greatest increase in use. The Drug Free Communities Act of 1997 is an important step toward empowering communities to fight the growing phenomenon of drug abuse among our Nation's youth.  I would like to add that I very much appreciate that the original cosponsors of this bill, Mr. Portman, Subcommittee Chairman Hastert, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Rangel, as well as the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. Barrett, were very willing to work with me to mold this legislation so that rural communities, as well as urban communities, are given the same chance to benefit from this Federal program. Because of our discussions, this bill now provides that antidrug coalitions in rural communities, communities under 30,000 people, will be given the opportunity to receive up to $100,000 in Federal matching funds. This puts rural communities at the same level as urban communities for receiving Federal matching funds.  Mr. Speaker, let me emphasize that drug abuse is not only an urban problem, but is also a problem in the rural communities of this country. Drug pushers find a market for their drugs, not only in the schools of urban areas, but also in the schools of our rural areas. We are beginning to see gang activity in our rural communities and these gangs are largely centered around drug use. Presently, it is our rural areas which are ill-equipped to handle an influx of drugs because rural areas do not have access to the local resources which urban areas enjoy. Because of bipartisan cooperation which has taken place, rural anti-drug coalitions will be better able to deal with drug abuse problems.  Again, I thank the gentlemen for their cooperation and willingness to accept my input on this bill, and I urge passage of this important legislation.                          ____________________
