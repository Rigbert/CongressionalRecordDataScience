Speaker, the President to whom the gentleman is very close, he says so. The gentleman says so. The President says, and the gentleman heard the quote, he probably gets tired of hearing it, I am sure: I am proud, he says--I am proud, he says, to shut down the government. I will shut down the government. Absolutely, I will shut it down.  That is what the President said just 2 days ago.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thought that was the gentleman's quote from our Congress earlier.  So I don't hold people to what they go through. I realize all the time we had these colloquies before, all the time I studied the history in here, the gentleman always said a shutdown was bad. I quoted back to him numerous times where he had told me that all the way through these. But when the day came in this Congress, he changed his ways. He thought a shutdown was right. I am thankful that he changed. That quote could have been his quote just in this Congress.
