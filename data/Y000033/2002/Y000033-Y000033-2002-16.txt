Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Real Interstate Driver Equity Act of 2001, H.R. 2546, as amended by the Senate.  This legislation has been under consideration for more than 3 years now, and I am glad that we have been able to find a fair and agreeable solution in the waning days of the 107th Congress.  I want to especially recognize my colleague from Missouri, Mr. Blunt, who sponsored this bill and has championed the cause of for-hire motor carriers. I believe this legislation will remove barriers to passenger choice and effective management of transportation services.
