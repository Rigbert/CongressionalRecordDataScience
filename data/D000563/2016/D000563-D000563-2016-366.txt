President, 1 week ago the Republican majority leader made an announcement that stunned a lot of observers on Capitol Hill. Senator McConnell said that the Senate Republicans would basically turn their backs on what I consider to be a constitutional responsibility and that they would refuse to consider the nomination to fill the vacancy of Justice Scalia, who recently passed away.  In article II, section 2 of the Constitution, the Founding Fathers established a very clear process for appointing Supreme Court Justices. Under the Constitution, the President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.'' That is the language of the Constitution. It is explicit.  The President has a constitutional obligation to send a Supreme Court nominee to the Senate, and the Senate has a constitutional obligation to consider the nominee. But the majority leader for the Republicans said last week that he would not give any consideration to a nominee sent by President Obama--not a hearing, not a vote--and then he went so far as to say he will not even meet with that nominee. This is a stunning abdication of the Senate's constitutional responsibility. All of us, as Senators, walk down this aisle, stand over to the side, raise our right hands, and swear to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and to bear true faith and allegiance to it. It is an oath each of us takes very seriously.  The majority leader has tried to justify his decision by noting that this is an election year. Well, it turns out it doesn't take much constitutional study to realize that the Constitution applies to election years as well as every other year. There is nothing in the Constitution that directs the President or the Senate to ignore their responsibility when there is a political Presidential campaign underway. I have searched the Constitution. There is no reference whatsoever to a Presidential campaign year absolving either the President or the Senate from their constitutional obligations.  One of the great ironies of the decision by the Senate Republican leadership was the way they reached it. Shortly after Justice Scalia passed away, Majority Leader McConnell issued a statement saying: ``The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.'' Then last Tuesday he summoned the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to his office, and there he decided with them that they would deprive the American people of a chance to view a hearing on President Obama's nominee to fill the Scalia vacancy. This is an unprecedented obstruction of a Supreme Court nominee, and this decision to obstruct certainly wasn't made by the American people. It was a unilateral, partisan decision made by a handful of Senators behind closed doors. The Republican Senators didn't bring their decision out into the open, not to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee, which they chair; they did it quietly behind closed doors.  But the American people heard what happened. Last Friday a letter was sent to the Republican members of the Judiciary Committee by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and Human Rights and 81 other national organizations.  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                February 26, 2016.     Hon. Charles Grassley, Chairman,     Hon. Orrin Hatch,     Hon. Jeff Sessions,     Hon. Lindsey Graham,     Hon. John Cornyn,     Hon. Michael Lee,     Hon. Ted Cruz,     Hon. Jeff Flake,     Hon. David Vitter,     Hon. David Perdue,     Hon. Thom Tillis,     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: We, the undersigned organizations, urge you      to reconsider your unprecedented and destructive refusal to      give fair consideration to any Supreme Court nomination until      after the next President is sworn into office on January 20,      2017, as announced in your February 23rd letter to Senate      Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.       Your letter claims that your refusal to hold a hearing on--     or to even meet with--any potential nominee is part and      parcel to executing your ``constitutional authority to      withhold consent on any nominee.'' This is a clear perversion      of your constitutional duties as understood by almost every      scholarly authority on the topic and by most Americans.       It is a dereliction of your constitutional duty to handcuff      the Supreme Court for two terms. Your proposed course of      action would cause a constitutional crisis that would shake      the very foundation of our democracy.       We condemn this unprecedented overreach, and call on you to      uphold the Constitution by giving fair consideration,      including timely hearings and votes, to the next nominee to      the Supreme Court.       Under Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the      President shall nominate a Justice to the Supreme Court ``by      and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.'' This does      not give a select few senators veto power over the      President's role in selecting and nominating a candidate. The      Senate's duty is to evaluate a nominee's fitness and      qualifications, not to pick the President making the      nomination.       Our legal system is based on the rule of law and requires      stability and certainty. The course you have charted would      mean that a new justice would not be confirmed until well      into 2017 at the earliest. Shackling the court for two terms      would undermine the rule of law, leave legal questions      unresolved, and hamper the administration of justice across      our nation.       Refusing to consider any nominee, without due evaluation of      his or her merits, credentials, and experiences, is a direct      repudiation of your constitutional duties.       We believe in upholding the Constitution. So should you.
