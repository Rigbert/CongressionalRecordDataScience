Chairman, I rise to offer this amendment which has to do with the way in which our Food for Peace commodities are delivered in other countries. Essentially, what this does is it allows the U.S. Agency forInternational Development, which is a part of the Department of State, to hire contractors in-country for this work on PL-480, title II commodities, just as the U.S. Department of Agriculture does.  During hearings on these important humanitarian programs, it became very clear to us on the committee that the U.S. Agency for International Development does not have the same ability to hire contractors in-country to work on the Food for Peace program that USDA has.  I know this sounds like kind of a technical bureaucratic problem but, in fact, it is; and we worked with AID and the chairman to identify the best way to correct this problem.  I want to thank the chairman deeply for his support. We want to make sure that when wheat or soy meal or any product is delivered to a very needy country that the private voluntary organizations that are there and AID contractors are able to find the most efficient way to get food into the villages, to the people, maybe refugees, living very far from the point where the food actually comes to port.  AID is having particular problems with this, we think simply because the legislation was written in a way that AID and USDA are under different committees here in the House.  Truly, with many of the private voluntary organizations doing this work in-country, which is one of the most risky jobs in the world, because they go into areas sometimes that are war torn, deep in-country. It is not easy work. We have had plane crashes around the world where many of these volunteers are going. All we are trying to do is to find a more efficient way to help them do the job that all of us want to do and that is to bring food to hungry people.                              {time}  1845  No bureaucratic snafu should prevent that kind of person-to-person assistance from occurring. We still want to find a way to allow greater authority for the Department of Agriculture, to use administrative funds in countries to provide and monitor food assistance in needy areas of the world. Essentially, this would provide additional contracting latitude to the U.S. Agency for International Development, so it parallels what USDA is able to do in moving these commodities to people that truly need them.  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen) very, very much for his cooperation and participation in this.
