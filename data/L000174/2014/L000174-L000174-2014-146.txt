The story the senior Senator from Tennessee told about the lightbulbs is--those of us who knew Senator Baker could well understand that. He was a man who brought Senators together--both parties.  I will tell two very quick stories. One is referencing a leadership race won by one vote. He had called a good friend of his, who was at home on official business, and said: I know the press says I am going to lose this race, but I know you are voting for me. Can you come back and vote?  That Senator did. The Senator was the then-senior Senator from Vermont, Robert Stafford, and he flew back to get to the caucus to vote for his friend Howard Baker--the first one by one vote; all the rest by acclamation. I know this because both Senator Stafford and Howard Baker told me that story. They were also two of the finest Senators with whom I have ever served. Both tried to work things out.  My other story is we were going to be in session until midnight one night on a technically contested matter.  Senator Ted Stevens and I and a few others went to see Howard Baker, who was the majority leader. We talked about the issue that was divisive. We said: We think we have a solution. We have all been talking. We can work it out but it is going to take some time for the drafting. Could you recess and not stay until midnight when all it is going to do is exacerbate tempers? Come back in the morning and we will have it all worked out, and we will get this done.  Senator Baker knew that we were all Senators in both parties who kept our word. He said: ``Of course.'' So we recessed. Now, as the Senator from Tennessee knows, we have cloakrooms here in the back of this Chamber. We all--if we have late-night votes, most of us hang around the cloakroom between votes. At that time they had beautiful stained glass windows in the alcoves.  We recessed and went home. An hour or so after we went home a bomb went off out here in the corridor. When we came in the next morning, this place looked like a war zone. Shards of glass from those windows in both cloakrooms were embedded in the walls. The door to where the distinguished Republican deputy leader has his office now was blown in, the stained window above of it was ruined. Paintings out here were shredded, and some of the marble busts of former vice presidents were damaged. You could smell the gunpowder of the explosive when we came to work.  I mention this because his form of leadership was that if we could get together and work things out, he preferred we do that. He would encourage it--both Republicans and Democrats. Then because he could rely on those of us--again both Republicans and Democrats--who would keep our word, he agreed to that. We knew he would keep his word.  I wonder how many lives of Senators were saved that night because of that. How many would have been terribly injured. Of course our staffs who work often long after we have gone--how many people could have been harmed if it had not been for the fact that the Senate was a different place, and I believe a better place.  But I say this not so much to tell historical stories, but I say this out of my great respect for Howard Baker. Somebody calculated the other day that Ihave served with 18 percent of all of the Senators since the beginning of this country. If I put my tiny handful of the best, Howard Baker is in there, hands down--a wonderful, wonderful man. He was a Senator's Senator. He believed in the Senate. He believed what a privilege it was to serve here.  He believed that the Senate could be the conscience of the Nation. I appreciate the tribute that was paid by my dear friend, the senior Senator from Tennessee, who I knew as Governor and as Cabinet member. We have always had a good personal relationship. I listened to his tales of Howard Baker. His colleague from Tennessee painted quite a picture of him. I thank them for doing that. I thank them for adding to the history of the Senate by doing it.                           Order of Procedure
