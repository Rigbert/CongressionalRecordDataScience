 President, I rise today to pay tribute to North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, a dedicated public servant who has served with distinction for five terms in the United States Senate. During this time, Senator Helms has had a tremendous influence on the issues which have faced our country and his reasoned and determined beliefs on foreign policy have helped to shape the direction of America's relationships around the globe. In doing so, Senator Helms has always put the interests of the United States above all else, and his efforts were often rewarded with hard-fought concessions. Indeed, when others would hope to expedite and rush through legislation, it was often Senator Helms who called for deliberation and patience. Senator Helms truly understands the Senate's function as a deliberative body and takes to heart the great responsibility the Constitution has given the Senate in its role as a check to the powers of the Executive branch. I have had the pleasure to work with Senator Helms for the past 16 years and it is with great appreciation and respect that I commend him for all of his meaningful work as he retires at the end of the 107th Congress.  Senator Helms was born in Monroe, NC in 1921. A product of the public schools of Monroe county, he took to heart the lessons he learned early in life. A firm believer in family, respect for one's elders, morality, patriotism and religious faith, Senator Helms has let these convictions be his guide throughout his life. After serving his country in the Navy during World War II, Senator Helms came back to his home State as a city editor of the Raleigh Times. It was not long before he received his first exposure to Senatorial duties working as an Administrative Assistant to U.S. Senator Willis Smith and later for Senator Alton Lennon. Politics seemed to agree with Senator Helms, for in 1952, he directed the radio-television division of the presidential campaign of Democratic Senator Richard B. Russell of Georgia. For the next 7 years, Senator Helms served as the Executive Director of the North Carolina Bankers Association and editor of the Tarheel Banker, which grew under his guidance into the largest banking publication in the United States. Following this remarkable success, Senator Helms in 1960 became the Vice-President, Vice-Chairman of the Board and assistant Chief Executive Officer of Capitol Broadcasting Company. It was from this post that Senator Helms became a familiar voice in politics, filing daily editorials for WRAL-TV and the Tobacco Radio Network. Over the next 12 years, Senator Helms became known as an articulate conservative across the nation, where his editorials were printed regularly in more than 200 newspapers throughout the United States and broadcast by more than 70 stations in North Carolina. Senator Helms capitalized on his familiarity and popularity with the voters of North Carolina in 1972, when he was elected to the U.S. Senate on his first attempt at state-wide elective office. His election marked the beginning of a long and distinguished career in the Senate, whereSenator Helms has been an active and consistent presence dedicated to preserving American freedom and liberty.  Senator Helms has had a tremendous influence on policy matters over the last 30 years. He has been an outspoken critic of ceding American power to international organizations and an ever-vigilant watch dog of any treaty or agreement which may not be in the best interests of the United States. He has been a reliable conservative voice on many social issues and a consistent critic of government bureaucracy. Of his many achievements, Senator Helms has been the most active through his position on the Foreign Relations Committee, which he took over as Chairman in 1994. He sponsored the Helms-Burton Act, which codified the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba and allowed lawsuits against foreign companies who benefitted from American property expropriated by Castro's Communist dictatorship. Senator Helms also achieved another remarkable feat, when in 1998, he worked across the aisle to achieve passage of historic legislation reorganizing the State Department. Senator Helms has also maintained flexibility in his thinking, working closely with other members of the Foreign Relations Committee to examine and solidify the relationship of the United States and the United Nations, examine trade relations with China and examine the policies surrounding U.S. foreign aid.  Senator Helms has had a significant impact in his 30 years here in Washington. His absence from important policy decisions will truly be missed. Anyone who has dealt with Senator Helms knows that he is a man whose conviction to his beliefs will not be easily swayed. They will also tell you that there are few people who are more congenial and charming than Senator Helms. I wish he and his wife, Dorothy, and the rest of his family all the best. It is with great appreciation and admiration that I offer these words to commemorate his retirement.                          ____________________
