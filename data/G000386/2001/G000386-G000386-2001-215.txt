 President, we know of the need to recognize the contribution of 22 million family caregivers in the United States. We know the need to encourage people to save for long-term care through tax credits for long-term health care.  Following a hearing I held last month on long-term care, Senator Graham and I introduced legislation to do what this amendment creates. He and I worked jointly on a similar bill last year and pressed hard for its passage.  As I stated at the hearing, I am committed to addressing the pressing financial long-term care challenges that accompany the retirement of the baby boom generation. However, I cannot support the inclusion of his amendment in the bill since it raises taxes on people to pay for it.  I will be offering a second-degree amendment. I yield back my time.
