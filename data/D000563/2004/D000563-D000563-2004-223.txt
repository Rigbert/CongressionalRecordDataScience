This is an amendment that will be a familiar amendment to many Members of the Senate. It is an amendment I offered before on an appropriations bill and was adopted with an overwhelming vote in the Senate. Unfortunately, it was stripped out of the bill in conference.  This amendment to the Defense authorization bill addresses the financial burden facing many of the men and women who serve in the military Reserve and National Guard and are forced to take unpaid leave from their Federal jobs when called to active duty. I offered this amendment to the fiscal year 2004 supplemental. It passed by a margin of 96 to 3 before it was removed in conference.
