Speaker, I have no further speakers and am prepared to yield back, with one brief comment to my friend from Texas.  I am sure that everybody here in this Chamber does know somebody who has suffered with ovarian cancer. Hopefully this bill, the ``Grace Bill,'' will make it a few less down the road. We appreciate the gentleman's leadership and her continued charge for this legislation as well.
