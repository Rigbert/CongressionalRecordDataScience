Mr. Speaker, today I rise to introduce legislation that will ameliorate problems stemming from the U.S. Postal Service policy that prohibits the users of commercial mail receiving agents [CMRA's] from submitting a standard change of address form to expedite routine mail delivery service.  In nearly all cases when an individual changes residency, the U.S. Postal Service facilitates prompt and accurate mail delivery by encouraging the postal customer to file a mail forwarding change of address form. Atypically, when a CMRA customer relocates, that individual is responsible for informing all potential mailers of any change of address. This policy creates delays and may exacerbate mail fraud as testimony has shown that the first line of defense against fraud is accurate information regarding postal addresses.  Current policy is contradictory to the Postal Service's charge to ensure prompt, accurate mail delivery service. This important legislation will benefit all parties in this particular mail delivery chain: the U.S. Postal Service, the CMRA's, and most important, the postal customer.                          ____________________
