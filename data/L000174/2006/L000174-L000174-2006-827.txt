I would also like to thank Senators Alexander, Bayh, Brownback, Coburn, Cornyn, DeWine, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, Levin, Reed, Stabenow and Voinovich for their cosponsorship of the Senate companion legislation. Counterfeiting is a serious problem that does not lend itself to a quick and easy solution. This legislation is an important step toward fighting counterfeiting. I hope we can build on the success of this law.                          ____________________[Pages S1124-S1125]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]             STOP COUNTERFEITING IN MANUFACTURED GOODS ACT
