Thank you.  I wish to say a few things about the people who are involved in this. They are faceless and nameless until we bring them to the floor. This is Benita Veliz. Benita Veliz has an amazing story which I wish to share with my colleagues. Benita was brought to the United States by her parents in 1993, when she was 8 years old. She graduated valedictorian of her class, received a full scholarship to St. Mary's University in Texas, majoring in biology and sociology. Her honors thesis was on the DREAM Act. She sent me a copy of it.  What she has asked for, basically, she says in these words: I was called to a Cinco de Mayo community celebration and asked to sing the national anthems of the United States and Mexico. I couldn't do it. I only knew the words for the American national anthem. I am an American. I want to live my dream. Benita Veliz.  Meet this young man, another who would benefit from the DREAM Act. His name is Minchul Suk. This is an amazing story as well. Brought to the United States from South Korea at the age of 9, graduated from high school with a 4.2 GPA, graduated from UCLA with a degree in microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics. With the help of the community, they raised enough money for him to finish dental school. He has taken his boards, but he cannot become a dentist in America because he is undocumented. Do we need more dentists in America? Yes, we do, and we need a man of his quality to serve our Nation.  I want you to meet this young man too. His name is David Cho. David is a man you might have seen on television. It is kind of an amazing story. David was brought to the United States at the age of 9, graduated with a 3.9 GPA in high school. He is now a senior at UCLA and the leader of the marching band. He wants to serve in the U.S. Air Force. I say to my friends who stand on the floor and protest their true belief that the military means so much to us as Americans, why would you deny these young people a chance to serve in the military? That is all I am asking.  The last story I wish to tell is about a young man from New York: Cesar Vargas. He has an amazing story. He was brought to this country at a very young age and when 9/11 occurred, he was so mad at those who attacked America he went down to the Marine Corps and said: I want to sign up, and they said: You can't; you are undocumented. So he continued on and is attending the New York University Law School now. He speaks five languages. He has had offers from the biggest law firms, for a lot of money. He turned them down. His dream, under the DREAM Act, is to enlist in the Marine Corps and serve in the Judge Advocate General Corps.  These are the faces of the DREAM Act, and the people who stand before us and try to characterize this as something else don't acknowledge the obvious. These are young men and women who can make America a better place.  I understand this is a difficult vote. It is a difficult vote for many. As a matter of fact, I am not asking for just a vote for the DREAM Act today. From some of my colleagues I am asking for much more. I am asking for what is, in effect, an act of political courage. Many of my colleagues have told me they are lying awake at night tossing and turning over this vote because you know how hard it is going to be politically; that some people will try to use it against you. But I would say, if you can summon the courage to vote for the DREAM Act today, you will join ranks with Senators before you who have come to the floor of this Senate and made history with their courage; who stood and said the cause of justice is worth the political risk. I am prepared to stand, they said, and vote for civil rights for African Americans, civil rights for women, civil rights for the disabled in America. I am prepared to go back home and face whatever comes.  Most of them have survived quite well because of their genuineness, their conviction and their strength and the fact that their courage is recognized and respected, even if someone disagrees with part of their vote. That is what we face today. We face the same challenge today. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will summon the courage to vote for justice. We don't get many chances. When it comes to justice for these young people of the DREAM Act or justice for those of different sexual orientation to serve in the military, this is our moment in history to show our courage.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
