I want to add something.  We are in a period of sacrifice. We will have to cut back on Federal spending. We are asking people to accept that reality. But think about some of the people affected by this debate. Some of the people literally dependent on Medicare and Medicaid are in nursing homes, totally unable to take care of themselves. They have exhausted all of their savings. They are dependent on Government programs and what their families can come up with. As we increase their expenses, there is nowhere for them to turn to make up the difference.                          ____________________
