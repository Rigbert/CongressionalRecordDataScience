Established in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1833, Kalamazoo College--affectionately known as K College--has distinguished itself as one of the Nation's oldest and most respected institutions of higher education devoted to the study of the liberal arts.  In addition to being nationally recognized for its high standards of academic excellence, K College has been a pioneer in the field of overseas studies, offering global learning opportunities to its students for the past 50 years. Over 80 percent of all K College students spend a portion of their undergraduate education abroad, partnering with over 50 foreign universities on 6 continents.  As a global champion of lifelong learning, Kalamazoo College also produces, per capita, more students who go on to earn a doctorate than any other American college or university. K College graduates also rank nationally amongst those who are accepted in the Peace Corps, Teach For America, and the Fulbright Scholar Program.  With new challenges emerging at home and around the world, it is comforting to know that Kalamazoo College continues to maintain its longstanding tradition of producing globally-minded leaders.  Again, it is my honor to stand today in recognition of Kalamazoo College for its 175 yearhistory as well as its 50 years of international fellowship. The college and its graduates have not only made a positive impact within the greater Kalamazoo community and the State of Michigan, but throughout the entire Nation and the world at large.                          ____________________
