 President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator Boxer to introduce the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Expansion Act of 2009, which will reduce demand for limited fresh water supplies by providing recycled water to 6 communities across the Bay Area.  It will make 6 additional Bay Area recycled water projects eligible for a 25 percent Federal cost-share, and expand the authorizations for two more, totaling $38,075,000. The activities authorized by the new legislation include installing new piping, storage tanks, and pump stations to convey the recycled water to a number of cities across the Bay Area.  These projects collectively will save 2.6 billion gallons per year of regional water supply by providing a new water supply of clean treated wastewater for irrigation and industrial use. It will free up the amount needed to supply 24,225 households in the growing Bay Area region. And to the regional agencies, over 3,500 local green jobs will be supported by this legislation.  The adoption of water recycling technology is an invaluable conservation method which will result in 8,000 acre-feet of new and reliable water which will reduce demand on fresh water from the Delta.  California is facing phenomenal water supply challenges that are affecting our economy, our communities and our environment.  California's water infrastructure is woefully out of date. Drought, population growth, climate variability, ecosystem needs and a broken Delta are making it even more difficult to manage our water system and deliver reliable supplies.  And unless we take action to address climate change, we could lose a significant portion of the Sierra snowpack, which stores water for 2/3 of California, by 2100.  Increasing the capability for and use of recycled water will help address California's cycles of drought and reduce dependence on water from the troubled Bay-Delta ecosystem.  Water recycling projects are already under way in several local Bay Area communities, and have qualified for Federal funding under the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program. This program allows local water managers to treat wastewater and use the clean, recycled water for landscape irrigation and other uses, including at golf courses, schools, city parks and other municipal facilities. Under the new legislation, the six additional Bay Area communities would be allowed to work with the Federal Bureau of Reclamation to use water supplies more efficiently.  With the increasing strain on Bay-Delta and other natural resources, it is vital that we look to adopt innovative water recycling technologies which sustain permanent clean water supplies and support existing water resources and local economies.  Nine Bay Area congressional representatives in the House put this regional approach together, and I'd like to recognize and thank them for their leadership: George Miller, D-Martinez, Pete Stark, D-Fremont, Ellen Tauscher, D-Concord, Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, Mike Honda, D-San Jose, Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose and Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, worked together to address the Bay Area's water needs.  This bill reflects a federal-local partnership and will provide communities in the San Francisco Bay Area with reliable and sustainable water supplies, and be a benchmark for other major American cities.  Declining water supplies affects people from all across the United States. Now is the time to invest in new water technologies, such as water recycling, to meet increasing needs. Wastewater recycling is an important part of a multifaceted water supply strategy that also includes surface and groundwater storage, improved conveyance, conservation, and desalination.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1138       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
