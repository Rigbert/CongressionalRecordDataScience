 With that, I believe we are ready.  Mr. President, I will propound a unanimous consent request before we go to the vote. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the vote regarding the foreign operations conference report, to be followed by 4 minutes of debate with closing remarks with respect to the pending Feingold amendment to S. 2508 and that vote immediately occur following those closing remarks, to be followed by a vote in relation to the continuing resolution.
