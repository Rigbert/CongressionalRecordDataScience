KLUG. I went to the Committee on Rules, if the gentlewoman will yield further, and the Committee on Rules voted to allow my amendment to get to the floor. It is no special privilege. It is only the vote of the Committee on Rules which, as you know, determines any amendments which may be brought to the floor, and earlier today, this House supported the rule that came out of the Committee on Rules. So the House essentially has already signed off on the opportunity to bring this to the floor to be debated.
