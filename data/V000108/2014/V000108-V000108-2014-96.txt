But the gentleman is correct; there are occurrences of waste, fraud, abuse, or inefficiencies.  The investment the gentleman is talking about I think is a wise one, to make sure that we do protect the taxpayer's dollar, ferret out those monies that are ill spent to make sure it doesn't happen again, and to make sure that those who are doing the right thing are protected in the performance of their duty on behalf of the Government of the United States.  So I appreciate the gentleman's amendment.
