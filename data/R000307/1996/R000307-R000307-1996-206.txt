Speaker, today we are introducing what some have called Farm Bill II. More accurately we are calling it the Agriculture Regulatory Relief and Trade Act of 1996. This is a small step toward providing American farmers with the regulatory relief that will enable them to compete in a very competitive global environment.  Many of my colleagues have seen the Agriculture Policy Ledger. The Agriculture Committee has told farmers that there will be less money in the future but in return we have also promised less Government involvement in their lives. The Contract With America contained many of those promises. The Clean Water Act adopted by this House and awaiting action in the Senate would go a long way in addressing a wetlands regulatory nightmare.  I am firmly committed that we should consider many of the policy issues impacting farmers in a calm and careful manner. This bill will lay the cornerstone for the Agriculture Committee's effort to provide some regulatory relief to producers in the agricultural policy area. This bill reflects our commitment to a two-track approach. The first track, the Agricultural Market Transition Act, contains the major spending items in the agriculture budget. The second track, the one that we are embarking on today, deals with many of the policy issues under the House Agriculture Committee's jurisdiction.  I firmly believe rolling all of the budget and policy issues into one huge farm bill is a mistake. The Senate chose to pursue this approach and in that process ended up spending at least $800 million above the December CBO baseline. In fact, when you compare the Agriculture Market Transition Act to the Senate bill, we save over $5.4 billion more than they do.              regulatory relief and reauthorizing the crp  The conservation title of the Agriculture Regulatory Relief and Trade Act fulfills a promise we made to our producers during the 1994 elections and the budget debate--in return for reduced Government support, we reduce the Government's involvement in their lives. The 1985 farm bill established a partnership between the Federal Government and the farmers. That agreement in essence said we will provide income support payments in return for compliance with government regulations.  However, since that time we have reduced payments by nearly two-thirds. At the same time Government regulations have increased exponentially. This is the first step towards stopping increased Government regulation on producers and making the regulations that remain meet the common sense tests that all regulations should have to meet--technical and economic feasibility and a focus on results, not on process.  The bill that I am introducing today with my subcommittee chairmen meets these tests. It protects the environment and allows producers to use their own innovation to meet environmental goals instead of forcing them to use the innovations of Government bureaucrats. This legislation will also halt several instances of regulatory overkill that have plagued producers since these laws were passed. This legislation goes a long way toward ending this overkill and putting producers back in charge of their land.  Specifically, this legislation will expedite procedures that producers must go through when requesting variances from conservation compliance due to circumstances beyond their control. Conservation systems and plans are clearly defined so that they are technically and economically achievable, are based on local resource conditions and can be met in a cost effective manner. Penalties will remain in place for producers who violate compliance, but will be tempered when producers unknowingly violate compliance. This legislation also encourages producers to request technical assistance from NRCS without fear of being found out of compliance and then penalized.  We also move forward in reducing the paperwork burden on producers by consolidating cost-share programs that producers use to meet environmental goals. Through consolidation we allow producers to fill out one set of paperwork to access cost share programs, instead of the current system that requires producers to identify their needs then identify which government program they can access and then filling out duplicative government forms. This is common sense and should expedite the process. Finally, this legislation authorizes a new program for livestock produces to improve water quality. This is a mandatory program that is fully paid for and should help livestock operations improve the quality of rural areas.  In addition, this bill provides for the reauthorization of the Conservation Reserve Program up to 36.4 million acres. This program has been a very valuable program that has been enormously popular with farmers, environmentalists, sportsmen and conservationists. Our provision is a simple reauthorization of the program, without modifications to the criteria for enrollment in the CRP.  Mr. Speaker, this is common sense reform that both sides of the aisle should be able to support.                        Government Credit Reform  Farmers and ranchers learned the hard way in the late 1970's and 1980's that they could not borrow their way to prosperity. All of us here in Washington concerned with Federal farm policy know that American taxpayers are increasingly unwilling to pay for a continuation of status quo farm policy. USDA farm credit programs that have resulted in billions and billions of dollars going uncollected are high on that list of benefits we can no longer afford.  The bill introduced today seeks to realign Federal lending policies that have been patched together during the last two decades in response to the farm problems in the 1970's and 1980's. Statutory prescriptions that read like regulations are eliminated or streamlined by this bill. USDA farm loans should be used for income generating purposes to enhance our farmers survivability, not support environmental policies that are contained in regulatory activities under other laws. In that regard, the local Farm Service Agency credit office should not be a procurement agency for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The bill strikes this law.  We all have heard the stories about the farm and home borrower who got his debt written down one day and bought a new pickup the next. Or, farmers, who are always the last to plant in the spring and leave their crops in the fields all winter, are first in line at the county office when it comes time to get their debt forgiven. Of course, a lot of this is coffee shop talk but, on the other hand, the General Accounting Office [GAO] has spent a number of years examining USDA lending practices and has found USDA to be lax or deliberately permissive in response to congressional wishes. There have been nearly a dozen of these GAO reports over the years.  As a 1992 report says, ``Lenient loan-making policies, some congressionally directed, have further increased the government's exposure to direct loan losses.'' The GAO says the old FmHA provided $38 million in new loans to some 700 borrowers who had already defaulted on loans resulting in losses of $108 million. Half of these borrowers became deliquent on their second round of loans. This is nothing but throwing good money after bad, and I might add it has done nothing for the farmers but delay the inevitable. This kind of policy cannot continue.  GAO looks at one borrower who ``* * * received a $132,000 direct farm operating loan from the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) even though, just 2 months earlier, he had received about $428,000 in debt relief. By March 1991, he was $28,000 past due on payments.'' This may be a single instance but is not likely to be unrepresentative when you consider the aggregate losses of billions.  Unfortunately, the disposition of inventory property, including provisions that make otherwise viable farming units into easements for environmental purposes--all at taxpayers' expense--has been just as irresponsible. This legislation is designed to change those policies as well.                                 Trade  Farmers know that there will be less money to spend on production agriculture in the future. The money we do spend must be spent wisely. Farmers must be prepared to respond to agriculture trade in a post NAFTA and GATT world. GATT and NAFTA opened up the world markets. We still must be competitive and fight for market share. That is the goal of this trade title, to give farmers and ranchers the tools necessary to respond to the exploding world demand we see in the Pacific Rim countries, China, and Latin America.  In the 70's exports were largely bulk grains. Today we are seeing more grain than ever move overseas, but it is in the form of processed products, beef, pork, and poultry. Red meat exports are three times the 1986 level. Poultry exports are six times the 1986 level.  The bill we are introducing today continues and fully funds the Market Promotion Program. While the MPP program has come under attack, I remind my colleagues that farmers and ranchers produce a commodity. By the very definition a commodity is just that--nondifferentiated. One bushel of wheat pretty much looks like another bushel of wheat.  Any economist will tell you that the way to move more of a commodity is turn it into a value added product. Differentiate the product and you will add value. Convince the overseas consumer that U.S. poultry or beef is better and you have sewn up market share. That is the goal of the MPP program and we need to retain the MPP program. Exports are moving toward value added products and MPP will facilitate that movement.  Specifically, the trade title allows credit guarantees for high value and value-added products with at least 90 percent U.S. content by weight.  Next, it provides protection to producers of any agriculture commodity who suffers a loss due to an embargo imposed for reasons of national security, foreign policy, or limited domestic supply.  The Secretary is given the flexibility to use the funds of the various export programs in ways that better accomplish the programs' objectives and to ultimately increase U.S. agriculture exports.  The Secretary is given the responsibility to monitor compliance with the agriculture provisions and sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the Uruguay Round Agreement. The Secretary will report any country failing to meet its commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement to the U.S. Trade Representative for appropriate action.                           rural development  The committee considered three important objectives when developing the rural development title: flexibility, local planning and decisionmaking, and sustainability. The rural development reforms included in this package meet all three.  In regards to flexibility, GAO issued a number of reports concerning the cumbersome and counterproductive regulations associated with present rural development programs. The programs are small and narrowly focused and each is equipped with its own rules and regulations. Many communities do not bother applying for funding due to the time and money involved in completing an application. And, since every rural development dollar is designated for a particular use, applicants often apply for available, instead of needed, funding. The Senate bill makes some improvements in terms of how rural development money can be spent. However, all the regulations, limitations, and restrictions would still apply. Our bill provides maximum flexibility by consolidating all rural development funding and including precious few regulations. The regulations are essentially two-fold. First, the money must be used for rural development activities currently eligible for funding. And, second, the money must be used to the benefit of small towns, particularly those with 10,000 people or less. That's it. This kind of flexibility cuts costs and confusion, saves time and energy, and allows rural America to get down to the business of rural development rather than bogged down in the business of bureaucracy.  A theme that dominated one GAO report is the need for local leadership and long-range planning in rural development. According to the report, ``each area has unique qualities that require customized, rather than off-the-shelf, solutions to its economic problems.''  The report continues, ``While the effectiveness of Federal programs may be uncertain, their inefficiency in delivering benefits is self-evident.'' Finally, the report concludes by recommending ``* * * exploring alternatives to the current set of Federal rural development programs, not merely better ways to coordinate them.'' While the Senate bill does throw a bone or two at State and local government, it jealously holds control of rural development programs in Washington--settling for off-the-shelf solutions to local problems. Our reform bill promotes local solutions to local problems by distributing consolidated rural development funds to the States. In turn, each State may administer its own rural development programs in close consultation with local government and the private sector. It is worth noting that State and regional governments already administer 4 out of the 5 major sources of Federal funding for water and waste projects. The States will gain one more if Senators Chafee and Kempthorne's safe drinking water amendments become law. It just makes sense to turn these rural development programs--which include water and waste--over the States to maximize coordination and get the job done.  Finally, in regard to sustainability, we all know that Federal funding for rural development is shrinking, In a single year--from fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1996--funding for rural development will be cut anywhere from 25 to 43 percent, depending on how USDA arranges its portfolio--ratio of grants to loans and loan guarantees. With the possibility of even deeper cuts coming in order to balance the budget and to provide increased funding for some programs that usually see annual increases, rural development programs may be sacrificed. What will rural towns, hospitals, and water districts do when the money runs out?  The Senate bill would wait and see. Our reform bill preempts the problem. It transfers administration of rural development to the States and requires each State to establish a revolving fund to be used for rural development. By capitalizing State revolving loan funds, which grown in size and operate in perpetuity, States can continue to provide rural development financing long after Federal funding comes to an end. In addition to sustainability, there's also efficiency in the State revolving fund. Even EPA Administrator Browner agrees that States--through State revolving funds--can actually provide more money at lower interest rates than traditional Federal programs--and do it all faster.  One final point in regard to rural development. I asked the administration and many Democrats on the committee who had concerns about this title to work with me to achieve flexibility, State, and local planning and decisionmaking, and sustainability. But, all I ever heard was the status quo. In light of GAO's criticism of current programs, I think we owe rural America better than that.                                Research  The bill provides for a simple 2-year reauthorization of the research, education, and extension functions of USDA. Research should be the cornerstone of our farmers ability to compete in world market places. A simple extension of authorities will allow the committee to finish the work we have begun on an extensive review of the Federal research programs.  The Agriculture Committee has embarked on an extensive review of the Federal research effort. Last summer, I along with Representatives Allard, de la Garza, and Johnson sent out a comprehensive questionnaire. We asked researchers and research users what can be done better and how can we spend the $1.7 billion annual commitment to agricultural research and extension to make sure producers and consumers will have a competitive and safe food supply in the 21st century.  In addition to the survey which I just discussed, the House Agriculture Committee has had the General Accounting Office conduct the first accounting of our Federal agricultural research investment since 1981. This report will be delivered to the committee by the end of next month.  Finally, we have scheduled a series of hearings this March and plan on producing a comprehensive rewrite of our Federal Research Program. Unfortunately, the other body has chosen to simply clean around the edges leaving in place research policies that fail to meet the needs of the agricultural sector as we transition into the free market. That is unacceptable and I urge my colleagues to support the Agriculture Committee in our effort to modernize USDA's research program.  This is a board overview of the Agriculture Regulatory Relief and Trade Act. Taken together, it's a strong package that will relieve the regulatory burden in rural America, reduce redtape and provide a consistent and dependable export policy.                          ____________________
