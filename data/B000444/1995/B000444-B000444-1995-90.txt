 Res. 177       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, one      hundred eighty-two thousand      women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 1995, and forty-six      thousand women will die from this disease;       Whereas in the decade of the 1990s, it is estimated that      about two million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer,      resulting in nearly five hundred thousand deaths;       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with      a woman at age seventy having twice as much of a chance of      developing the disease than a woman at age fifty;       Whereas 80 percent of the women who get breast cancer have      no family history of the disease;       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a      certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method      of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is      the key to saving lives; and       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers      of up to two years or more before regular clinical breast      examination or breast self-examination (BSE), saving as many      as a third more lives: Now, therefore be it       Resolved, That the Senate designate October 19, 1995 as      ``National Mammography Day.''       The Senate requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling upon the people of the United States to observe such      day with appropriate programs and activities.
