President, I am pleased to recognize the Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band for providing 75 years of entertainment. More than 500 individuals have played the pipes and drums of the Shannon Rovers Band. Currently, the band is made up of over 75 pipers, drummers and color guard members, and includes a student program with over 20 individuals actively learning the pipes and drums.  The band was organized in 1926 by a group of Irish immigrants, and was originally named the Shannon Rovers Fife and Drum Corps. The group was directed by Dan Hennessy and played for every Irish gathering in Chicago during the late 1920's and early 1930's. In 1932 the decision was made to switch from fife and drums to the ``Irish Warpipe'' or bagpipe. Thus, the Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band was introduced.  In the 1930's the band performed for Presidential candidate Franklin Delano Roosevelt and has continued to play for Presidents and distinguished guests to this day, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Pope John Paul II.  The band's popularity has grown immensely over the years. The demand for them to play continues to grow in the Chicago land area, as well as across the Nation, and around the world. The Rovers continue to excite Chicagoans with performances at halftime of Bears games, leading the pre-race ceremonies at Chicago Motor Speedway, performing at the Celtic Fest, and at the Irish Heritage Center. They make an annual trip to Springfield, IL, for the Illinois State Fair and they also perform at countless rallies and dinners. The members of this group freely volunteer their time for all types of civic and charitable events.  Internationally, the band is a perennial contender in Ireland's Fleadh Cheoil, a world-class traditional Irish music event. The Rovers have placed first, second, and third in this prestigious competition.  The Shannon Rovers Irish Pipe Band has accomplished much in the 75 years since its founding. It is my pleasure to extend my congratulations and thanks to this group for their decades of service and dedication to their music and to the people of Illinois.                          ____________________
