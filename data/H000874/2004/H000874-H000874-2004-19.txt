Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In closing, let me again thank the majority whip for his diligence and leadership in working on this legislation and for ensuring its passage before we leave here for the election period. He has been a privilege to work with. His commitment to this objective is very clear and very powerful. I thank him. I join with him in supporting this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
