  Mr. DeFAZIO. The Bush-Rove administration has delivered cronyism, incompetence and corruption in spades. Mike ``you're-doing-a-heck-of-a-job-Brownie'' Brown is the poster child for the hundreds of unqualified, often incompetent, political hacks chosen to head, to demean, demoralize and dismantle critical Federal agencies like FEMA.  Then there is the corruption side. Mr. Brown, as he was resigning, at the same time one of his buddies, David Safarian, the head of Federal procurement for the entire government of the United States, $300 billion a year, is being led out of the White House in handcuffs for perjury, influence peddling and bribery, but he did his job till the end as a Bush political appointee. Before they drug him out in handcuffs, he let billions of dollars in no-bid contracts, awarded to Halliburton and other favorites of this administration.  Good job, Mr. Safarian. I hope prison is a good reward for you.                          ____________________[Page H8393]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                            POLITICAL HACKS  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
