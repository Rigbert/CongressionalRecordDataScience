First, a quick word on my proposal, which is available from the Congressional Research Service and Jane Gravell, the top economist who is there to discuss it with Senators. It would actually reduce the deficit by about $100 billion over 5 years, making downpayments in terms of deficit reduction.  But here is what the distribution profile looks like in terms of our legislation. We believe that upwards of 70 percent of the people in this country would get a solid tax cut. These are middle-class folks making $60,000, $70,000, $80,000, and $90,000. Essentially, what the Congressional Research Service has shown is that millions of middle-class people would get relief. It is upwards of 70 percent. We have calculated that about 15 percent of the people in this country would be treated about the same.  For example--and it is matter of public record, and I can discuss it--I have a Senate wage of about $160,000, and I have a bit of investment income. I come out about the same under my proposal as under the status quo. We have to make 6 or 7 percent of the people in this country who make virtually all their income from capital gains and dividends--not from wages--pay a bit more.  So that is what the distributional effect of one actual proposal looked like. That was again very similar to what happened in 1986 when Ronald Reagan, after having started his Presidency with a set of tax changes--and my colleague will remember they were largely for investment--did an about-face and passed a reform proposal that gave real relief to middle-class people.  I want to close by thanking the Senator from Illinois, who I know has a great interest in this subject and has been a strong champion of the middle class.
