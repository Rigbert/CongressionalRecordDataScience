Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of the Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments, and I compliment the author of the bill, Jim Saxton, for his continued efforts to move this legislation.  The Atlantic coast stock of striped bass are found in waters from North Carolina to Maine. They are highly migratory but move primarily along the coast within the 3-mile zone, which is subject to State fishery management.  While striped bass populations have fluctuated dramatically in the past, the population suffered a drastic decline in the 1970's. Striped bass harvests plummeted from 15 million pounds in 1973 to 3.5 million pounds in 1983.  In response to this serious problem, Congress approved an emergency striped bass study and the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act of 1984. This law requires all affected coastal States to implement management measures to conserve and protect Atlantic striped bass stocks.  After 15 years of careful management, the striped bass population has fully recovered to pre-decline levels. This is a major fishery management success. H.R. 1658 will ensure that this remarkable recovery is not compromised in the days ahead.  As reported by the Resources Committee, this legislation reauthorizes the study provisions of the Striped Bass Act and related laws, makes technical changes to increase consistency with other fishery conservation laws, and encourages greater public participation in the writing of management plans.  Mr. Speaker, I hope more of our fishery management efforts prove to be this successful in the future. I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1658.
