President, I thank my friend from Nevada. The committee of conference went across the political spectrum. Every conferee--Republican and Democrat--signed that conference report. They passed it 400 to 4 in the House. I am amazed that we are still even on the floor. I have been advised by the Republican side that a Republican Senator wants to come over and speak. Otherwise, I would have said let us go to a vote now. Obviously, I don't want to cut off any Senator who wishes to speak. But I tell my friend from Nevada that, as far as this Senator is concerned, I am perfectly willing to go to a vote anytime we want. It is now 4:30. I can't imagine why we need to wait beyond 5 o'clock.  Again, just before the Senator from Nevada came to the floor I read a list.
