President, I recently received a letter that remarked upon the bravery and fortitude of a former U.S. Coast Guard member, Mark D. Chamberlain.  On a chilly, rainy winter day, three generations of the Chamberlain family, Dale, Mark, and Justin set out on snowshoes in a wooded area of Lyndonville, VT. After 5 hours of trekking in the woods, the eldest Chamberlain, Dale, attempted to forge an ice-covered river when the ice gave way and dragged him under. Mark, his son, managed to grab a hold of his coat and pull him back to safety amid the chunks of ice and strong river currents. Despite the fact that Dale was numb with cold, Mark assured his father that he would be fine and convinced him to begin walking. Mark led the party back to their vehicle and the three Chamberlains returned safely to the warmth of their home.  Mark Chamberlain, not only set an heroic example for his son, Justin, to admire and follow, he also demonstrated the strength of the bonds that tie families together.  Mr. President, I ask that an article about this experience which appeared in the Caledonian-Record be reprinted in the Congressional Record.  The article follows:              [From the Caledonian-Record, March 10, 1997]           St. Johnsbury--Father Credits Rescue To Daring Son                           (By Andrew Turner)       Dale Chamberlain knows a thing or two about life, now that      he's looked death in the face and survived to tell about it.       On March 2, Chamberlain was snowshoeing with his son Mark      and grandson Justin on his property in Lyndonville when      tragedy nearly struck.       As Chamberlain tells it, the weather was about 45 degrees      and drizzly that day, the kind of mid-winter thaw that      deceives snow travelers so often       Chamberlain, his son and grandson, had been trekking the      woods near the South Wheelock River for about five hours, he      estimated, before coming to the river.       ``We were making tracks back to the river. I could hear the      roar of the water draining into channels in the ice Arriving      at the river, I could see a possible way to cross,''      Chamberlain stated.       He said he began the attempt to cross and the way was      slippery. Water covered the ice to roughly 6 inches deep in      parts and he was able to use his ski poles to stabilize      himself, poking the ice ahead of him to make sure that it was      solid.       ``I punched a hole in one area (and) the ice let go in the      whole area around me. I went into the water and under the      ice,'' Chamberlain recounted.       Chamberlain floundered in the water helplessly, his head      just above the surface as ice continued to break away, making      it impossible to grasp onto anything firm. Hindering him was      the fact that his snowshoes had become tangled around each      other. He couldn't move his arms or legs.       ``My muscles were going numb. The only thing I was really      aware of was the roar of the rushing water,'' he said.       The next thing that he remembered was the feeling of his      son's hand on the back of his waterlogged jacket, tugging him      out of the current of the water and eventually to the shore.       ``He talked to me and assured me I was OK. He said he was      going to stand me up. He said it wouldn't do me any good to      just lie there,'' Chamberlain said.       Eventually they were able to get to their cars and make it      home, and to warmth. Chamberlain never received medical      treatment but was comforted by the fact that he had a son who      challenged adversity to save his father's life.       ``Thanks to the quick thinking and strength of my son I am      still among the living. I now know that no matter how much      experience you have in the woods the unexpected can always      happen. I just thank God for Mark's ability to analyze the      situation and spring into action immediately,'' he      said.                          ____________________
