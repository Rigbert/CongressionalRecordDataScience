Explain all the technical aspects you would like, but the fact is that $13.2 million goes to the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program. And the 1,300 students currently in the program will be protected and will receive the tuition--a grant of $7,500 per student--in the coming year. That is a fact. To stand there and say otherwise is wrong.  Mr. DeMINT. You grandfather it in--if the Senator will yield for a question, does this bill fund the continuation of the program beyond the 1,300 who are already in it?
