 Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Schroeder amendment. There are some Members in Congress who are pro-choice, and I am one of them. There are others who are anti-choice, but there should be no Member of Congress who is tolerating the kind of outrageous violence that is taking place all across this country against doctors, nurses, and personnel in clinics that are performing abortions.  Mr. Chairman, this legislation is terribly important because it sends a signal to the entire country that the U.S. Congress will not tolerate for one moment the calculated and organized reign of terror which is existing today against those people who are helping women take advantage of their constitutional rights to choose abortion. That is what this issue is about.  Let us send a message loud and clear, Mr. Chairman, throughout this country that we will not accept this violence, and we will protect a woman's right to choose.
