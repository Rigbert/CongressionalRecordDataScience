 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 325, which authorizes the use of the rotunda for the observance of the Days of Remembrance.  Congress provides for this ceremony every year at this time, and other related events will be occurring all over this country. This is an opportunity for Americans of all faiths and nationalities to reflect on the Holocaust, to remember its victims and to strengthen our sense of democracy and human rights. Very frankly, it is more appropriate perhaps than most years, post-September 11, to remember the atrocities that have been committed against innocent people for reasons of their nationality, their ideology, their place of birth, their place of residence.  It is appropriate, Madam Speaker, that we use the rotunda, which has been the location of so many historic events, to again draw attention to one the greatest tragedies in human history. It reminds us that such events must never be permitted to recur. Very frankly, Madam Speaker, it reminds us that, inevitably, perhaps not on the scale, but that they will reoccur, as they did in New York.  Each year the ceremony has a theme geared to specific events which occurred during the Holocaust. This year's theme for the observance is Memories of Courage, to honor communities and individuals who resisted Nazis and ethnic religious genocide they practiced against Jews, Roma, homosexuals, and, yes, others who were perceived to be different than they.  Such resistance was practiced all across Europe. In Poland, Oskar Schindler, memorialized in the great Spielberg movie Schindler's List, was the subject of the Oscar-winning movie and related how he used jobs in his company as a way to protect a large number of Jews, one of literally thousands of individuals who displayed courage to save others.  Polish Jews in Warsaw revolted in April and May of 1943, fighting street to street, hand to hand, building to building, in one the most dramatic examples of unexpected public resistance to terror and genocide.  It was not only Jews who resisted, of course. For example, in Denmark, in October of 1943, a German diplomat courageously alerted Danish authorities to the impending deportation order sending the occupied country's Jewish population to Nazi death camps. The Danes did not sit idly by. In fact, local fishermen, local citizens, banded together to make sure that almost every Jew got to a boat and was ferried to Sweden.                              {time}  1415  In fact, Denmark, with a population of over 5,000 Jews, perhaps as many as 7,000, lost only 50 Jews in the holocaust. In fact, Denmark is the only nation, and Yad Vashem, that memorial in Israel that has a tree planted, all the other trees are planted for individuals like Oskar Schindler. History, Madam Speaker, is replete with the example of those who gave shelter to Jewish families or helped smuggle them to safety, sometimes at the loss of their own lives. Those acts of courage and humanity are examples to us today, examples that we ought to act, not perhaps at the risk of our lives, but perhaps only at the risk of our inconvenience, that we ought to act, to reach out, to help, to lift up, and yes, perhaps save lives.  While the Days of Remembrance commemorates historical events of the days of the 1930s and 1940s in Europe, the issues raised, as I have said, by the Holocaust remain fresh in our memories as we survey the political scene in the world today. The nature of war, the identity of an enemy may change; but what remains is the terror, the cruelty, the madness and, yes, the evil of it. It is especially timely now to encourage public reflections on the fate of Holocaust victims and to remember that there was then, as there still is now, evil in the world.  The ceremony we are authorizing today reminds us that individuals as well as nations can be vigilant and can strike a blow to preserve the values on which human civilization rests. I urge passage of this concurrent resolution. I expect it, of course, to pass unanimously. But simply passing it unanimously will not be enough. It will be a time for us to rededicate ourselves as Oskar Schindler did, as the Danes did, as so many others did, to the defense of liberty, the preservation of freedom, and the protection of each and every individual with whom we live on this globe to the extent of our abilities.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
