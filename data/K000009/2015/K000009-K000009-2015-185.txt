Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Trade Review Accountability Needs Sunlight and Preview of Any Regulations and Exact Negotiated Components Resolution, or the ``Trade TRANSPAREN-C Resolution.''  Congress has granted the last eighteen presidents the authority to negotiate trade agreements withdrawing significant Congressional participation in the process. The recent past has seen a transformation in this authority, originally established to serve as negotiating guidelines. Today, it is little more than Congressional consent to be a rubber stamp as this implementing legislation sometimes referred to as ``Fast-Track'' or ``Trade Promotion Authority,'' grants sweeping authority to the Executive branch to negotiate trade deals. And it undercuts the Constitutional responsibility of Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations as outlined in Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Instead we are allowed merely an up or down vote.  Today, I introduce this resolution to take back our Congressional authority, and to shine light on the negotiation process and final text of these increasingly massive trade deals.  The Trade Promotion Authority currently under debate would usher through the top secret Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. It would also grant that fast track authority for up to six years. During that time we would be prohibited from any Congressional amendments or hearings, and given at most 60 days to review any proposed trade deal. This is a very short window if you consider that the draft TPP is between 800-1000 pages.  My Trade TRANSPAREN-C Resolution will put a hold on consideration of any implementing ``Fast-Track'' bill for any trade agreement until the full, final text of that agreement has been available to the public for no less than 60 days. This includes the secretive TPP.  In its current form, the TPP would outsource good jobs, degrade global environmental and working standards and allow investor rights to overrun the rights of workers. The TPP is also packed with special-interest perks thanks to the more than 600 transnational corporations that weighed in on, and in some case wrote, the agreement in secret. Meanwhile the American people have still not been allowed to read it.  For six years the U.S. trade representative has kept the TPP buried under a top secret classification. Even Members of Congress can only read it in a secure room under the watchful eye of a security monitor. I visited that room to review several sections of the deal and was not allowed to make copies, keep notes, take pictures, or share anything I learned with anyone unless they have Top Secret security clearance, all under threat of prosecution.  Despite the secrecy, this deal has provisions the American people need to know about.  The Trade TRANSPAREN-C Resolution will reaffirm Congress's Constitutional authority to set the terms for international trade. It will allow the American public time and sunlight to see the Trans-Pacific Partnership and future trade deals for themselves. As Members of Congress, we have a duty to our constituents to play the role mandated by the Constitution. Not allowing the people access to the full discussion would be a disservice to them. I urge my colleagues to support the Trade TRANSPAREN-C Resolution to ensure U.S. trade policy reflects American principles of representative governance.                          ____________________
