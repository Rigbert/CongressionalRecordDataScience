Speaker, I want the 2.3 million unemployed Americans to know that not all Members of this House are heartless. In fact, 193 Members of this House stand with the unemployed of this country, the 2.3 million mothers and fathers who have children and families to feed as we move through this very, very poignant holiday season.  I hope when we come back in January we can do what's right for America. But we fell 36 votes short.  That's because the Republicans, and I hardly see any of them on the floor at this point, care more about taking care of those who earn over a million dollars than they do about the people who are falling off the edge.  I feel sorry for our country today. But you know what? The American people have a way of righting the tables when they get sadly out of balance, and that moment is coming.  I feel sorry for the people who are unemployed. Be strong during this season, know that when we return in January, we have a chance to correct what sadly was voted down today.                          ____________________
