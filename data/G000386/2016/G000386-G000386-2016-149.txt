 President, this body was last in session during Sunshine Week, but the principle of government transparency is one that does not expire. So I would like to take a few moments now to reiterate my support for that timeless principle.  Open government is good government. And Americans have a right to a government that is accountable to its people. In 1978, following the lessons learned from the Watergate scandal, Congress created Inspectors General--or IGs--to be our eyes and ears within the executive branch.
