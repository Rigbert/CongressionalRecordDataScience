President, I rise today to recognize John Rednour, who has recently been named the millennium ``Outstanding Citizen of the Year'' by the Du Quoin Chamber of Commerce.  John Rednour has been a friend of mine for over thirty years. His life story is a fascinating tale of humble origins, a great family, hard work, and success. When others might have relaxed or retired, John and his life's partner Wanda continue to give to others every day. John's record as Mayor of Du Quoin is proof positive of his commitment to public service.  John Rednour has served as the Mayor of the City of Du Quoin, Illinois, for the past 11\1/2\ years, and his contributions to the city during his tenure have been outstanding. His hard work and dedication have had a tremendous impact on the city and its people, and it is only fitting that he be singled out for the City of Du Quoin Chamber of Commerce's highest honor.  During his time as Mayor, John Rednour has been instrumental in building new public facilities, including a city hall, library, and police department. These are just the beginning of the list of accomplishments in which Mayor Rednour has played the leading role. The strengthening of the infrastructure through water and sewer improvements may be among the less glamorous projects he has undertaken, but they are very important to Du Quoin. Over the years Mayor Rednour assured the safety of the community by fully staffing the Du Quoin police and fire departments. Also, during his administration, for the first time in the history of the 150-year-old city, Du Quoin has secured city wide fire protection.  John Rednour has also greatly increased the economic vitality of a city that is proud of its mayor. One of the ways in which he was able to boost its economic status was through the construction of the Du Quoin Industrial Park, completed with the aid of the Chamber of Commerce. Over the years, he has also helped to attract numerous businesses to the city, resulting in new jobs to the area. His actions have contributed to a fully staffed tourism commission that has helped to give Du Quoin a firm footing in the tourism industry in Southern Illinois. Mayor Rednour has helped Du Quoin through his ability to gain access to state and federal funding, which has helped the city to complete many of these important projects during his administration. His vision is transforming Du Quoin into a 21st century city.  In closing, Mr. President, all of these achievements, and many more, are the fruits of the labor of John Rednour. His dedication to his job as Mayor and to his city have made his administration a great success. I applaud John Rednour for his achievements and his many successful efforts to improve the quality of life for the citizens of Du Quoin.                          ____________________
