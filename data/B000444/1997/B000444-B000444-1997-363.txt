  Mr. President, I will yield myself 15 minutes.  Mr. President, let me begin, while both my senior colleagues are on the floor here, by complimenting SenatorByrd on his ringing endorsement of Madeleine Albright. Senator Helms and I have been around here a long while, 24 years. But that is a short time compared to the senior Senator from West Virginia. We all know that when he stands to take the floor and give his endorsement to a candidate who requires confirmation, probably more than any other Senator on this floor, the Chamber listens.  Madeleine Albright is a fine candidate, but she is also a lucky candidate today to have such strong support from the Senator from West Virginia, and, as well, she is fortunate to have the Senator from North Carolina as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I publicly thank him for how gracious he has been and for how he has expedited this nomination. We all know he is a man of very strong convictions, and we all know that when Senator Helms concludes that there is something moving in the Senate too swiftly, or it is something he does not support, he is, along with the Senator from West Virginia, maybe the most effective person on the Republican side of the aisle in slowing things down.  There was a lot of discussion in the press and a lot of discussion in the Cloakrooms about whether or not Senator Helms was going to cooperate. I am here to tell you that he has not only cooperated, he has expedited it, and he has been, as always, the consummate gentleman in the way in which he has dealt with his colleagues, the new ranking member in particular, but the committee in general and the Senate as a whole. I personally thank him for doing what I never doubted he would do once he concluded he was going to get this on the floor early. I want the record to note that we are moving on one of the two most important Cabinet posts, and we are doing it before anything else has happened in this body. I thank the chairman.  Mr. President, to state the obvious, I strongly support Madeleine Albright's nomination to become the 65th Secretary of State of the United States of America. Obviously, along with others who have spoken, I commend the President for nominating her.  There was a friend of ours who doesn't always like having a quote attributed to him, but I must attribute every quote. I never want to make that mistake again. I will not use his name, but I will acknowledge that this is not emanating from me. We had a colleague who served with the Senator from North Carolina and me for some years--and I will tell him the name after I finish--who used to say, ``It is great in politics when conscience and convenience cross paths.''  I would suggest that Madeleine Albright's nomination to be Secretary of State meets that test like none other since I have been here. This is truly a historic occasion. I know we do not and should not think in terms of quotas and affirmative action. But the fact of the matter is this is one of two remaining bastions where the mindset, I think, of a foreign policy establishment, the mindset of the public, the mindset of everyone, is that it is sort of the province of men. And that stereotypical notion is, in large part because of the cooperation of the Senator from North Carolina, about to end today. That does not mean that makes anyone a good Secretary of State or makes her the most qualified person. But that is where the conscience part comes in. It just so happens that the woman we are about to confirm--God willing and the creeks not rising--is also eminently qualified to be Secretary of State.  I have been here too long to use phrases like ``this is the most qualified person.'' There are 50 people maybe in America who are qualified to do this job, and there are probably 10 as qualified, but none more qualified than Madeleine Albright.  One of the things I think that has endeared her and recommended her to Senator Helms and to me, both of us having served on the Foreign Relations Committee for so long, is that we have encountered Madeleine Albright in our official capacities and our personal political lives on a number of other occasions, and we have found her, as professor, as foreign policy adviser, and as a politically active academic, to be extremely incisive, blunt, to the point, and honest with us in her assessments. You have no idea--maybe you do, Mr. President, but the longer you are here it will become even more apparent. I find that the hardest speak to understand is foreign policy speak. And I sometimes used to kid, after years of being the chairman or the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I would say to the witness, ``You sound like you are from the State Department.'' That means that you get a nonanswer; never a wrong answer, but a nonanswer. Madeleine Albright is very straightforward. And it is a welcome thing. We had that in other Secretaries of State, Democrat and Republican. But it is always nice to know.  In her 4 years as our Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Albright has ably demonstrated her qualifications to carry American foreign policy into the 21st century. Her personal history, her academic research and writing, her diplomatic experience, and her political acumen make her uniquely qualified to lead this country in working with our friends and allies--and our adversaries, and there are some--to further our national interests and the ideals of freedom and democracy that we espouse as a nation.  As we all know by now, Ambassador Albright was not born an American. She and her family chose to come to these shores out of a deep appreciation of what America stands for. She was born in Czechoslovakia, which between the two world wars was the only country in Central Europe to share our commitment to freedom and democracy.  She was twice forced to flee her native land, first in the wake of the Nazi occupation, then 10 years later after a Communist coup. She has seen first-hand the two worst forms of tyranny of this century, and she vividly understands the importance of standing firm against aggressors who seek to subvert freedom.  The young Madeleine Korbel earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in political science in 1959, worked briefly as a journalist, then married and raised three bright, accomplished, and lovely daughters, two of whom I have had the occasion to get to speak with and get to know a little bit better.  At the same time she was raising her family, she attended graduate school at Columbia University. In 1968, she earned her master's degree and the certificate of the Russian Institute at Columbia. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1976.  With her doctorate in hand, she came to Washington to work for one of the finest men ever to serve in this Senate--the late Senator from Maine, Edmund Muskie, who himself went on to become Secretary of State. As his chief legislative assistant, she gained an appreciation for the role of the Senate in helping the President and the Secretary of State craft American foreign policy, experience on which she will draw as we work with her in the years ahead.  Ambassador Albright left Senator Muskie's staff in 1978 to work for her former professor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, on the staff of President Carter's National Security Council. She then worked at two of the most prestigious think-tanks in Washington--the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars--before becoming a professor at Georgetown University in 1982.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the official biography of Madeleine Albright.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Madeleine Korbel Albright       Madeleine Korbel Albright was appointed by President      Clinton on January 27, 1993, as the United States Permanent      Representative to the United Nations. President Clinton      elevated this position and made the Ambassador a member of      his Cabinet and a member of the National Security Council.       Prior to her appointment, Ambassador Albright was the      President of the Center for National Policy. The Center is a      non-profit research organization, formed in 1981 by      representatives from government, industry, labor and      education. Its mandate is to promote the study and discussion      of domestic and international issues.       As a Research Professor of International Affairs and      Director of the Women in Foreign Service Program at      Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, she taught      undergraduate and graduate courses in international affairs,      U.S. foreign policy, Russian     foreign policy, and Central and Eastern European politics,      and was responsible for developing and implementing programs      designed to enhance women's professional opportunities in      international affairs.       In 1981-82 Ambassador Albright was awarded a fellowship at      the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars at the      Smithsonian following an international competition in which      she wrote about the role of the press in political changes in      Poland in 1980-82.       She also served as a Senior Fellow in Soviet and Eastern      European Affairs at the Center for Strategic and      International Studies, conducting research in developments      and trends in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.       From 1978-1981 Ambassador Albright was a Staff Member on      the National security Council, as well as a White House staff      member, where she was responsible for foreign policy      legislation.       From 1976-1978, she served as Chief Legislative Assistant      to Senator Edmund S. Muskie.

Citizens for Better Public      Education, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Beauvoir      School, Public Relations Staff of the Encyclopedia      Britannica, and Reporter on the Rolla Daily News, Rolla,      Missouri.       Awarded a B.A. from Wellesley College with honors in      Political Science, she studied at the School of Advanced      International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, received a      Certificate from the Russian Institute at Columbia      University, and her Masters and Doctorate from Columbia      University's Department of Public Law and Government.       Ambassador Albright is fluent in French and Czech, with      good speaking and reading abilities in Russian and Polish.       Selected writings include ``Poland, the Role of the Press      in Political Change'' (New York: Praeger with the Center for      Strategic and International Studies, Georgetown University,      Washington, D.C. 1983); ``The Role of the Press in Political      Change: Czechoslovakia 1968'' (Ph.D. Dissertation, Columbia      University 1976); and ``The Soviet Diplomatic Service:      Profile of an Elite'' (Master's Thesis, Columbia University      1968).
