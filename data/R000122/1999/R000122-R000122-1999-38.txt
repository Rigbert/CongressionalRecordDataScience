President, I rise today to submit a resolution which would designate October 24-30, as ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.'' Despite steady progress over the past two decades to regulate inappropriate uses of lead, the tragedy of childhood lead poisoning remains very real for nearly one million preschoolers in the U.S.  Most children are poisoned in their own homes by deteriorating lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust. While lead poisoning crosses all barriers of race, income, and geography, most of the burden of this disease falls disproportionately on low-income families or families of color who generally live in older, poorer quality housing. In the United States, children from low-income families are eight times more likely to be poisoned than those from high income families. African American children are five times more likely to be poisoned than white children. Nationwide, almost 22 percent of African American children living in older housing are lead poisoned, a staggering statistic, particularly given the overall decline in blood lead levels in the last decade.  Unfortunately, many communities have not experienced a major decline in blood lead levels. In fact, in some communities, more than half of the preschool children are lead poisoned. Baltimore, Providence, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, St. Louis, and Chicago all have lead poisoning rates that are three to nine times the national average.  Even low levels of exposure to lead impair a child's ability to learn and thrive, causing reductions in IQ and attention span, reading and other learning disabilities, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, hearing loss, and coordination problems. These effects are persistent and interfere with their success in school and later in life. Research shows that children with elevated blood lead levels are seven times more likely to drop out of high school and six times more likely to have reading disabilities. State health officials believe that the need for certain education services is 40 percent higher among children with significant lead exposure.  Mr. President, lead poisoning is entirely preventable, making its prevalence among children all the more frustrating. In addition, lead poisoning has many dimensions, and therefore we have to tackle it from all directions. Specifically, our efforts should include screening and treating poisoned children, identifying and removing the source of their exposure, educating parents, landlords and entire communities about the dangers of lead, and ensuring that resources to address the problem are available and accessible to all who need them.  I have been working on a number of initiatives in the Senate to address this problem including urging Senate leaders to provide for more funding for lead abatement. Last year, I sponsored an amendment that resulted in an increase of $20 million in funding to eliminate lead hazards in the homes of young children. This year, the Senate has supported a similar figure.  Also, I have become deeply concerned, along with my colleague Senator Torricelli, about recent reports that children at risk for lead poisoning are not adequately screened or treated for the disease, even if they are enrolled in Medicaid. Although children enrolled in Medicaid are three times more likely than other children to have high amounts of lead in their blood, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently reported that less than 20 percent of these young children have been screened for lead poisoning. Even more disconcerting is that half of the states do not have screening policies that are consistent with federal requirements. For this reason, we have introduced the Children's Lead SAFE Act (S. 1120) to ensure that all children at risk of lead poisoning receive their required screenings and appropriate follow-up care by holding states accountable.  Mr. President, I have been working on making important, yet common-sense, policy changes to ensure that children are screened and treated for lead poisoning and to provide critical funding for leadsafe housing. Beyond these efforts, I believe we need to take further steps to raise pubic awareness about the dangers of lead poisoning. Last month, Senator Collins and I hosted a Public Health Subcommittee hearing in Rhode Island to highlight the importance of the issue and to hear about the successful approaches undertaken by organizations in my home state to address the problem. We plan to hold a similar hearing in Maine next month. Because lead poisoning is a national problem, we believe it deserves national attention.  That is why Senator Collins and I, along with 26 original co-sponsors are introducing this bipartisan resolution that would commemorate the week of October 24-30, 1999 as ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.'' Designation of a national week for lead poisoning prevention would raise public awareness about the issue and highlight the need to protect children from lead poisoning to ensure their healthy development.  The Senate resolution would serve to further our efforts to recognize lead poisoning as a national problem and declare lead poisoning prevention as a national priority. The proposed resolution would also acknowledge the suffering of the many children with lead poisoning and their parents whose active involvement individually and through grassroots organizations has been instrumental in efforts to reduce lead poisoning. The resolution is supported by the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, the Children's Defense Fund, the Environmental Defense Fund, and more than one hundred state and local organizations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the Children's Defense Fund and the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning, along with the list of the 100 supporting organizations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Children's Defense Fund,                               Washington, DC, September 27, 1999.     Hon. Jack Reed,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I am writing in strong support of      resolution to commemorate the week of October 24-30, 1999 as      ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.''       Lead poisoning in children can cause learning disabilities,      behavioral problems, and at extremely high levels of      poisoning, seizures,     coma, and death. According to the Centers for Disease Control      (CDC), about 890,000 children in the United States have      elevated blood lead levels, including one in five African-     American children living in housing built before 1946.      Infants and toddlers are most susceptible because they spend      so much of their time with their hands in their mouths--hands      that may have been on the floor, on the windowsill, on the      wall, along the stairway, places where lead paint particles      exist.       Over 80% of the homes and apartments built before 1978 in      the United States have lead-based paint in them. Paint      doesn't have to be peeling to cause a health problem;      particles can circulate in dust and air circulation systems.      Although elevated blood lead levels in children have declined      in the last few decades, lead poisoning is preventable; any      level of lead poisoning in children is too high.       Your resolution will highten awareness of this tragic and      preventable health problem. I commend your attention to the      issue and look forward to working with you to ensure that all      children have the chance to grow up healthy and reach their      fullest potential.           Sincerely yours,     Marian Wright Edelman.                                  ____                                                   Alliance to End                                     Childhood Lead Poisoning,                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1999.     Hon. Jack Reed,     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I am writing in support of your      resolution to designate the last week of October ``National      Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week.'' This measure is      supported by over 100 local health departments, housing      agencies, community-based organizations and lead poisoning      prevention programs from across the country (see attached      list).       Despite steady progress over the past two decades to      regulate inappropriate uses of lead, the tragedy of childhood      lead poisoning remains very real for nearly one million      preschoolers in the United States. Children are most often      poisoned in their own homes by lead-contaminated dust from      lead-based paint that is deteriorating or disturbed by      repainting or renovation projects.       While lead poisoning crosses all barriers of race, income,      and geography, the burden of this disease falls      disproportionately on low-income families or families of      color, who generally live in older, poorer quality housing.      In some communities, more than half of preschool children are      lead-poisoned. Even low levels of exposure to lead can impair      young children's ability to learn and thrive, causing reduced      IQ and attention span, learning difficulties and behavior      problems. These effects are persistent and interfere with      success in school and later life.       Formal designation of a national week for lead poisoning      prevention will instrumentally advance national, state, and      local efforts to educate communities about the threat of lead      to children. Thank you again for supporting designation of      the last week of October ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning      Prevention Week.''
