President, I rise to voice my concerns about Section 335 of the Transportation Appropriations bill.This section flatly bans the Department of Transportation from even considering any reform of the commercial drivers' Hours of Service (HOS) regulations, which limit the time that drivers spend behind the wheel of large trucks and buses. The provision shuts off all funding for DOT current and future efforts to ensure drivers receive adequate rest. This sweeping ban on any further consideration of HOS regulations goes too far.  Section 335 would not even give DOT a chance to try to address concerns that have been raised about its proposed regulations. DOT would be prohibited from holding public hearings on the changes (several are planned for this month alone) or from even talking with drivers, law enforcement groups, and highway safety groups about the proposed changes. The measure also halts efforts to enhance HOS enforcement through on-board recorders--one of the National Transportation Safety Board's ten most wanted safety improvements.  The ban on any consideration of HOS reform also contradicts Congress' recent action to improve truck safety. Just last year Congress mandated the creation of a new truck safety agency within DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. It is FMCSA's proposal to change the HOS regulations which has led to the ban in section 335 of the Transportation Appropriations bill. Moreover, in 1995, the Congress, through the medium of the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act (ICCTA), directed DOT to study the HOS regulations and suggest reforms. DOT and FMCSA have done so. The result of their efforts should not be the foreclosing of all debate on new driver safety rules.
