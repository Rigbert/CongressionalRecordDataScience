 President, there does not appear to be an effort on the part of Members to consider this bill which is up for discussion. It will take a few days to get through all the amendments. Given the lateness of the year as far as the total legislative session is concerned and considering all the other work that needs to be done to wind up this legislative session, there may not be an appreciation of all the amendments we have to deal with on this bill. I encourage Members who have amendments to come here on the floor to offer their amendments. This bill is very complex. Some of the amendments are also going to be very complex. So please come here and offer your amendments.                           Amendment No. 1730(Purpose: To amend title 11, United States Code, to provide for health           care and employee benefits, and for other purposes)
