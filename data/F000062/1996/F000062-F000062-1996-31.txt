  Mr. President, this amendment, which I strongly support, would repeal the prohibition of requiring or even studying the use of taggants in black and smokeless powder. What we are saying is, let's take a look, in a comprehensive, well-done, study of using taggants in black and smokeless powder. It provides the funding, $21 million, for the examination of the safety and the effectiveness of taggants, which is required before they can be used.  Why do we want black and smokeless powder? Senator Kerry was eloquent. Ninety percent of all of the pipe bombs have black and smokeless powder. Therefore, not to be even able to study it renders us impotent in ever using taggants in a meaningful way to trace those who practice terrorist incidents.  Why is this important? It is important because today--today--the United States of America is in the top 20 nations with the highest level of terrorism in the world. We have more incidents than Lebanon.  The Senator has indicated the number of incidents: well over 4,000 now since 1990. We all know of the Unabomber. We all know a pipe bomb was used at the Atlanta Olympics. We all have seen what happened in the World Trade Center. We are all deeply concerned about TWA Flight 800.  What is a taggant? A taggant is a small sandwich-shape microchip. It is color coded in different codes. When it is broken down, it looks like the smallest little flecks of sand, different colors, so small you can barely see them at all. These are put in the powder. And then depending on the color coding of the taggant, you can trace where this was purchased.  So it becomes like a fingerprint that enables somebody to go back to the source and trace a perpetrator. It is not a solution, but it is an aid to law enforcement to be able to ferret out and arrest, I think, the biggest cowards of all time--the people who use bombs on innocent people. That is why it is important.  We have heard a lot about the fact that this information to make pipe bombs is so easily available. Youngsters are making these bombs from information available on the Internet--pipe bombs, 80 percent of all of the bombings according to one study have become all too common.  Let me go back to some of the concerns. Some of the concerns are safety: There was an explosion in 1979 at a firm called GOEX Manufacturing Co. in Arkansas. I have here an affidavit, which I would like to submit for the Record, from a gentleman by the name of James P. Palmquist, who was the senior attorney with the office of the general counsel of 3M, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. He handled for 3M a lawsuit against 3M involving this explosion at GOEX in Arkansas in 1979.  I want to read three parts of his affidavit, and I quote:       4. That in the course of discovery concerning the      allegations made in this lawsuit, records were discovered      which identified the exact location at the time of the      accidental explosion of all MICROTAGGANT materials which were      then being evaluated, which records proved that there was no      MICROTAGGANT materials in the booster materials that were      being reworked at the time of the accidental explosion;  The point is Taggants were not in the materials that were exploded in 1979, which is the incident that the National Rifle Association most uses to discredit taggants.       5. That further information was discovered indicating other      reasons for the increased instability of the booster      materials which were being reworked at the time of the      accidental explosion;       6. That based upon such facts it became clear to all      involved in the lawsuit that there was no evidence whatsoever      that 3M's MICROTAGGANTs could have contributed in any way to      subject explosion, said lawsuit was dismissed.  It is signed by James P. Palmquist. It is notarized.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Affidavit     State of Minnesota     County of Ramsey       Known all men by these presents:       That, before me, the undersigned authority, on this day      personally appeared James P. Palmquist, who, after having      been duly sworn by me, upon his oath deposed and said the      following:       1. That he is a Senior Attorney with the Office of General      Counsel, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (``3M'')      with offices located at Building 220-11E-03, 3M Center, St.      Paul, MN 55144-1000;       2. That he has been employed by 3M since 1963 and has been      an attorney within 3M's Office of General Counsel from 1973      to present;       3. That in such capacity he handled for 3M a lawsuit filed      against 3M involving a July 25, 1979 explosion at GOEX,      specifically the GOEX manufacturing plant in East Camden,      Arkansas, which lawsuit alleged, among other things, that      3M's MICROTAGGANTs which were then being evaluated      as possible identification taggant materials for explosives,      was a contaminet in certain booster materials that were being      reworked and that the MICROTAGGANTs contributed or      caused the GOEX accidental explosion;       4. That in the course of discovery concerning the      allegations made in this lawsuit, records were discovered      which identified the exact location at the time of the      accidental explosion of all MICROTAGGANT materials      which were then being evaluated, which records proved that      there was no MICROTAGGANT materials in the booster      materials that were being reworked at the time of the      accidental explosion;       5. That further information was discovered indicating other      reasons for the increased instability of the booster      materials which were being reworked at the time of the      accidental explosion;       6. That based upon such facts it became clear to all      involved in the lawsuit that there was no evidence whatsoever      that 3M's MICROTAGGANTs could have contributed in      any way to subject explosion, said lawsuit was dismissed.       Further affiant sayeth not.                                               James P. Palmquist.
