 President, let me move to the next point that relates to the merits of this treaty. That is a legitimate area of disagreement. I will be brief because I am keeping the staff and the pages, who have to go to school tomorrow morning, very late.                              universality  Critics charge that the CWC will be ineffective because rogue states such as Syria, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya--all of whom are suspected of or confirmed to have chemical weapons--have not joined the convention.  Therefore, the argument goes, the United States should withhold its ratification until these states join.  I could not disagree more.  Just think of it. The logic of this argument would lead us to a world where rogue actors--not good international citizens--determine the rules of international conduct.  Such a policy would amount, effectively, to a surrender of U.S. national sovereignty to the actions of a few.  Instead of the United States actively leading international coalitions and setting tough standards on nonproliferation matters, the convention opponents would have us do nothing until every two-bit rogue regime would decide for us when we should act.  This reasoning is contrary to the record of the past 40 years, during which the United States has led the way in nonproliferation initiatives.  From the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, to the missile technology control regime, to the comprehensive test ban treaty, and to the chemical weapons convention itself, we have fought for establishing accepted norms of behavior.  I happen to believe that international norms count.  In a recent article that I coauthored with my distinguished colleague, Senator Richard Lugar, we noted that such norms provide standards of acceptable behavior against which the actions of states can be judged. They also provide a basis for action--harsh action--when rogue states violate the norm.  Suggesting that we should now take a back seat to the likes of North Korea and Libya does a grave injustice to our record of international leadership and leaves such nations free to act as free operators without fear of penalty or retaliation by the nations whose armies and citizens they threaten.  The fact that there is now no international legal prohibition against the development of chemical weapons should not be lost here.  The suspected programs that treaty opponents are so concerned about are right now entirely legitimate according to international law, and we have already had a telling example of what can result from this perverse situation.  The Japanese police were aware, before a cult attacked the Tokyo subway with sarin nerve gas in 1995, that the cult was manufacturing the gas--but they had no basis in Japanese law to do anything about it.  That will change, both internationally and domestically, once the CWC enters into force.  The convention will establish an international norm against the development of chemical weapons. It will provide the legal, political, and moral basis for firm action against those that choose to violate the rules. If the goal of treaty opponents truly is to target the chemical weapons programs of suspect states, then joining the convention is the best way to achieve this objective--and refusing to join is the surest way to protect the world's bad actions.                             verifiability  A great benefit of the chemical weapons convention is that it increases our ability to detect production of poison gas.  Regardless of whether we ratify this convention, regardless of whether another country has ratified this convention, our intelligence agencies will be monitoring the capabilities of other countries to produce and deploy chemical weapons. The CWC will not change that responsibility.  What this convention does, however, is give our intelligence agencies some additional tools to carry out this task. In short, it will make their job easier.  In addition to onsite inspections, the CWC provides a mechanism to track the movement of sensitive chemicalsaround the world, increasing the likelihood of detection. This mechanism consists of data declarations that require chemical companies to report production of those precursor chemicals needed to produce chemical weapons. This information will make it easier for the intelligence community to monitor these chemicals and to learn when a country has chemical weapons capability.  In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994, R. James Woolsey, then Director of Central Intelligence, stated: ``In sum, what the chemical weapons convention provides the intelligence community is a new tool to add to our collection tool kit.''  Recently, Acting Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, reemphasized this point before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Mr. Tenet stated: ``There are tools in this treaty that as intelligence professionals we believe we need to monitor the proliferation of chemical weapons around the world. * * * I think as intelligence professionals we can only gain.''  No one has ever asserted that this convention is 100 percent verifiable. It simply is not possible with this or any other treaty to detect every case of cheating. But I would respectfully submit that this is not the standard by which we should judge the convention. Instead, we should recognize that the CWC will enhance our ability to detect clandestine chemical weapons programs. The intelligence community has said that we are better off with the CWC than without it--that is the standard by which to judge the CWC.                           constitutionality  One of the issues that should not be contentious, and I hope will not continue to be a focus of attention, is whether the convention, and particularly its inspection regime, is constitutional.  Every scholar that has published on the subject, and virtually every scholar that has considered the issue, has concluded that nothing in the convention conflicts in any way with the fourth amendment or any other provision of the U.S. Constitution.  Indeed, to accommodate our special constitutional concerns, the United States insisted that when parties to the convention provide access to international inspection teams, the government may ``[take] into account any constitutional obligations it may have with regard to proprietary rights or searches and seizures.''  In plain English, this means that inspectors enforcing the Chemical Weapons Convention must comply with our constitution when conducting inspections on U.S. soil.  It also means that the United States will not be in violation of its treaty obligations if it refuses to provide inspectors access to a particular site for legitimate constitutional reasons.  In light of this specific text, inserted at the insistence of U.S. negotiators, I am hard pressed to understand how anyone can seriously contend that the convention conflicts with the Constitution.  There is nothing in the convention that would require the United States to permit a warrantless search or to issue a warrant without probable cause. Nor does the convention give any international body the power to compel the United States to permit an inspection or issue a warrant.  This is the overwhelming consensus among international law scholars that have studied the convention, two of whom have written to me expressing their opinion that the convention is constitutional. I ask unanimous consent that the letters of Harvard law professor, Abram Chayes, and Columbia law professor, Louis Henkin, be included in the Record following my statement.
