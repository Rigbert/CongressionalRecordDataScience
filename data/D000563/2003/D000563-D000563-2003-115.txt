 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so ordered.  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we have been in some intense negotiations on the Internet tax issue. We have made significant progress. We still have one significant hurdle remaining where we can perhaps get all sides together. There is about a 50-50 chance. But we should know in about 20 minutes as to whether we will reach this very important agreement which would basically eliminate any major issues associated with the Internet tax issue.  I thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding. I yield the floor.
