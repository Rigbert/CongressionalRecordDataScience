 I visited Northern Illinois University in De Kalb, Judson University in Elgin, and Lincoln Land Community College in Springfield, and University of Illinois at Chicago.  With an estimated 1.7 million Illinoisans holding a combined $47 billion in student loan debt, it is no wonder that it was on the minds of nearly everyone I spoke with. On average, Illinois graduates of the Class of 2012 left with $28,028 in debt--but individual debt is often much higher. I have had students contact me who have upwards of $100,000 in debt and no chance to ever pay it off.  For too many young Illinoisans, and students across the country, the opportunity for a fair shot at an affordable college education has become a long shot.
