President, hundreds, probably thousands, of letters from South Carolina citizens arrived in my office urging a closer look at Judge Shedd's nomination to serve in the Fourth Circuit.  So we don't have a Congressional Record tomorrow morning that will be several hundred pages long, I will not include all of them with my remarks today. However, I ask unanimous consent that a list of the letters of opposition to the nomination of Dennis Shedd to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of Dennis Shedd to the 4th                         Circuit Court of Appeals                       Local Civil Rights Groups       NAACP of South Carolina State Conference, June 24, 2002;      May 21, 2002.
