 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me.  I would just point out to the gentleman that in the good old days that he refers to, yes, this House had a great reputation for wanting to spend more money, and those days have changed in that the President is adamant about spending and spending the right amount of money to do the job and the House has concurred in that many times and have voted in the House. And it has been a pleasure to work with the President to hold down spending and make sure that every dollar is spent properly.
