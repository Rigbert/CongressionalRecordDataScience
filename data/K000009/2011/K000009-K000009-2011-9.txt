 In every business I go into, they say, Marcy, bring me customers, bring me customers.  Whether they're out of work and they receive unemployment benefits, which they have earned, or whether it's allowing an individual through a payroll tax holiday to have a few extra dollars of spending money, the advantage of helping the middle class is that it's going to go directly into our economy. It goes to every small business. Whether it's to buy vegetables at the corner stand, whether it's to buy gasoline for your car, whether it's to buy clothing for your children, when you think about where those dollars will go, it's going to go to essentials. It won't be wasted money.  All of history shows us, because their incomes have really not gone up, because buying power has gone down for the average family and prices are going up, that the middle class is guarding every penny so much more carefully.  I had to go out and buy some throw rugs the other day because of all the rain in the Midwest that had caused water to rise in our basement. I couldn't believe the price of throw rugs. I thought, oh, my goodness, and I went to two or three stores. I don't have time to do that, but I was reacting to the increase in prices. The average family has great difficulty in buying those kinds of items, so those few hundreds of dollars mean everything, and they will use it to improve their homes, for example.
