President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will correct an inequality in the Department of Justice's Public Safety Officers Benefits, PSOB, Program by extending benefits to non-profit EMS providers who die or are disabled in the line of duty. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Sanders.  Vermonters were deeply saddened earlier this week when we received word that veteran EMT specialist Dale Long died in a tragic, on-duty accident in Bennington. Dale Long had a superb 25-year career as a Vermont EMT, and I extend our deepest condolences to his family, to the Bennington Rescue Squad, and to the entire Vermont EMT community.  First responders nationwide literally put their lives at risk every day for the people of their communities. They represent the best of our nation's dedicated service to others, and Dale Long was a solid example of that tradition. He was Bennington Rescue Squad's 2008 EMT of the Year, and a 2009 recipient of the American Ambulance Association's Star of Life Award. I had the pleasure of meeting Dale just last month when he visited my office during the Star of Life festivities.  This tragedy highlights a major shortcoming in the current PSOB program, which Congress established over 30 years ago to provide assistance to police, fire and medics who lose their lives or are disabled in the line of duty. The benefit, though, only applies to public safety officers employed by a federal, state, and local government entity. With many communities around the United States choosing to have their emergency medical services provided by non-profit agencies, medics working for non-profit services unfortunately are not eligible for benefits under the PSOB program.  Non-profit public safety officers provide identical services to governmental officers and do so daily in the same dangerous environments. With a renewed appreciation for the important community service of first responders since the national tragedy of September 11, 2001, more people are answering the call to serve their communities. At the same time, more rescue workers are falling through the cracks of the PSOB program.  The Dale Long Emergency Medical Service Provider Protection Act would correct this inequality by extending the PSOB program to cover non-profit EMS officers who provide emergency medical and ground or air ambulance service. These emergency professionals protect and promote the public good of the communities they serve, and we should not unfairly penalize them and their families simply because they work or volunteer for a non-profit organization.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1353       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Dale Long Emergency Medical      Service Providers Protection Act''.     SEC. 2.
