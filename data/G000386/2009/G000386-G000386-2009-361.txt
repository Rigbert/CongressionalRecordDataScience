 President, I voted for Bunning amendment No. 531 because the $3,000 of capital losses that people can use to offset their ordinary income hasn't been indexed for inflation, and has been at that $3,000 level since 1976. The $15,000 level is only $4,500 higher than the level it would be--$10,500--if it had been indexed for inflation.
