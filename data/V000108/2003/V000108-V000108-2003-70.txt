Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate the Croatian Sons Lodge Number 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union of America on the festive occasion of its 96th Anniversary and Golden Member banquet on Sunday, April 27, 2003. In addition to honoring thirty new 50-year members, the Lodge will also honor Martha J. Woss with the Woman of the Year Award, and Valentine-Walter Bahun with the Man of the Year Award.  This year, the Croatian Fraternal Union will hold this gala event at the Croatian Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Traditionally, the anniversary celebration entails a formal recognition of the Union's Golden Members, those who have achieved fifty years of membership. This year's honorees include: Richard D. Bekelya, Josephine Blaschke, Violet Marie Boatman, Josephine Bobinac, Tom Bobinac, Nettie Brooks, Bernadette Chelich, Catherine Child, Yvonne Drysdale, Alice Erbesti, Matthew Erdelac, Sandra C. Giorgi, Marija Jugovic, Pauline Muraida, George Nosich, Carol Jean Pettit, John L. Ramuscak, Rudolph J. Ramuscak, Mary C. Rozmanich, Joanna Russ, Annie Jane Seral, Bartol Sikich, Jr., Rosemary Smith, Gertrude Studanich, Jean O. Surig, Dolores Teel, Jo Ann Tull, Irene Weger, Josephine Williamson, and Mary Yurkas.  These loyal and dedicated individuals share this prestigious honor with over 300 additional Lodge members who have previously attained this important designation.  Mr. Speaker, Martha Woss has been a fixture with the Croatian Fraternal Union for 78 years. She has served as president, vice president, recording secretary, and scribe, as well as serving as the chair for numerous committees. Martha also wrote a weekly column reporting the events of her Lodge, as well as other area Lodges. She was the first woman to bowl in the Joe Rady Tourney, and she was awarded a plaque from the national president for this honor. Martha has been a dedicated member of the Lodge since 1925, and because of her commitment and hard work, she has achieved the honor of being designated as Woman of the Year.  On January 17, 2003, Valentine-Walter ``Wally'' Bahun celebrated not only his 83rd birthday, but also 65 years of service for Lodge 170 of the Croatian Fraternal Union of America. Wally has served in various positions throughout his time with the Lodge, including president, vice president, and trustee. He was also elected as a delegate to the Toronto 15th Convention in 1979, and has been elected as a delegate each year since for his dedication to Lodge 170. His commitment to the Croatian community of Northwest Indiana serves as an example of the dedication we all must show to keep our nation great.  Mr. Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Lodge President Betty Morgavan, and all the other members of the Croatian Fraternal Union Lodge Number 170, for their loyalty and ongoing display of passion for their ethnicity. The Croatian community has played a key role in enriching the quality of life and culture of Northwest Indiana. It is my hope that this year will bring renewed hope and prosperity for all members of the Croatian community and their families. I am proud to represent these gifted residents of the First Congressional District of Indiana.                          ____________________
