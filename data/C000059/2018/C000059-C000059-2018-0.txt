Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry).                       Recognizing Parker Poling  Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, this is the first time, as a Member, I have given a speech like this. I have to say, in this body, Members understand that an essential ingredient for a successful Member of Congress and for this institution to function is our staff.  With good, talented staff, Members can be successful, the legislative process can work, and we can serve our country.  We have many faithful public servants here in the House of Representatives, and I rise today to recognize one of them.  Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize my chief of staff of 12 years, Parker Hamilton Poling. She has served this House of Representatives in many different capacities, but for the last 12 years, she has been my personal office chief and my leadership office chief.  She sits behind me today, and she is easily embarrassed. But if she looks at the gallery, her husband, Todd, and her two beautiful daughters, Barrett and Eliza, are here to recognize her service and the hard work she has put in for this country.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today because my chief of staff, Parker, has been an essential ingredient to my success as a Member of Congress, to serving the people of North Carolina's 10th District as a Member of Congress, to being a successful member of the House Financial Services Committee.  She has been an essential ingredient for House Republicans on getting the key votes over the last 4\1/2\ years for our agenda. She has worked tirelessly to count the votes on the House floor to get our agenda passed. She has worked tirelessly to build relationships with other chiefs of staff and Members, as well as other staff, to further this operation in the House of Representatives.  Eight years ago, Parker got a group of female chiefs of staff, Republican chiefs of staff, who were mothers together and said: We need to actually have an organization so we help each other and coach each other along the way through mentoring.  She has developed that into a very solid group that exchanges information and helps each other.  What I want to say here on the House floor and publicly is that my success in the last 12 years is as a direct result of Parker's work.  I met her 22 years ago through an organization called College Republicans. We both cut our teeth in the rough and tumble of that political operation. I was a student at NC State, and she was a student at Brown University. She grew up in upstate New York and took this sort of different background and perspective, and I realized her ingenuity, her creativity, her strength, and her passion for the cause. And I learned so much from her.  Then, 10 years after that, as a Member of Congress, I invited her in, between her law school classes. She thought I was trying to ask for free legal advice. She had, with coaching from her husband, a really set answer on how she could not, because she had not passed the bar yet, give me legal advice, much less free legal advice.  She came in, sat down. She put her book bag down, wearing a pair of jeans. I said: Well, I would like to hire you as my chief of staff. And she says: I didn't interview for it, and I am not sure I want it.  After she had a conversation with her husband, and some, you know, negotiation, she became my chief of staff, and my world as a Member of Congress changed much for the better.  But I am not the only one that Parker has had an impact on as a Member of Congress.
