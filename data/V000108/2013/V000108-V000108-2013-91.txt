Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mr. LaMALFA Mr. Chairman, I think that being such a narrow measure is what we have here, that we do need to send the proper message to our military, to our people, that when they serve in the military and would want to get out and be part of the GI Bill and, importantly, to the American taxpayers, that your dollars are actually being expended for this appropriation towards the type of thing that you care about, and that is defending the Nation and not having to defend themselves from overzealous regulations like anybody could enlist in California.  I hear CARB is one of the biggest complaints of my constituents all around my district, as well as from our friends in the military that are just there to try and defend us.  In taking up this measure here tonight, I think it is a very proper thing that we do to have the right signal that we do support our military, we do support our fighting men and women, and that it is best to put forward the defense of our country rather than defending some frivolous environmental regulation.  I yield back the balance of my time.
