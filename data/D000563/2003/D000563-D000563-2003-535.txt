I ask the Senator, if one believes in privatization and competition, why does the private sector need a $6 billion subsidy to compete with Medicare? If they are good, if they are efficient, if they are customer friendly, why do they need this Federal subsidy of $6 billion to offer an attractive health care package to seniors?
