Speaker, the application of the antitrust laws in the telecommunications sector has produced enormous competitive benefits. Market competition has fostered innovative technologies, greatly enhanced product and service choices, and reduced prices for millions of American telecommunications consumers. The threat of treble damages for antitrust violations has provided a powerful deterrent against anticompetitive misconduct in this marketplace.  Indeed, the primary catalyst for the structural changes that have produced the enormous competitive gains and expanded consumer choice in the telecommunications fields was the principled application of the antitrust laws. The legal basis for the elimination of Ma Bell's national telephone monopoly was rooted in the antitrust laws. While the former AT had operated in a highly intensive Federal and State regulatory regime for decades, the government relied on the antitrust laws to provide the robust procompetitive remedy that regulation could not, did not, and will not provide alone.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the ``Telecom Act''), was enacted ``to promote competition and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers . . . by opening all telecommunications markets to competition.'' In passing the Telecom Act, Congress did not create an ``antitrust free zone'' in which the regulatory provisions of the Telecom Act limited the historic application of the antitrust laws in deterring and punishing monopolistic misconduct in the telecommunications field.  Rather, to reaffirm the centrality of the antitrust laws in the overall regulatory scheme created by the Telecom Act, Congress included an explicit antitrust saving clause in the legislation. In clear and forceful legislative guidance, Congress said:       ``. . . Nothing in this Act or the amendments made by this      Act shall be construed to     modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of any of the      antitrust laws.''  The inadequacy of regulation to fully deter anticompetitive misconduct is widely recognized. In fact, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell, whose agency has authority to implement the Telecom Act, concluded in a 2001 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee that the FCC's current fining authority for anticompetitive violations is ``insufficient to punish and deter violations in many instances . . . given the vast resources of many of the nation's [incumbents.]''  Despite Congress's unmistakable resolve to preserve the vital role of the antitrust laws in this field, a record of considerable judicial confusion has developed in our nation's courts. In 2000, the Seventh Circuit issued the Goldwasser decision, ignoring the plain language of the antitrust savings clause and holding that the Telecom Act ``must take precedence over the general antitrust laws.''  In Law Offices of Curtis Trinko v. Verizon, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals sharply departed from Goldwasser's flawed reasoning and upheld the plain language of the Telecom Act, thus preserving an antitrust cause of action for anticompetitive misconduct in the telecommunications market in addition to the regulatory regime created by the Telecom Act.  In March of 2003, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case. In November of 2003, the Committee on the Judiciary conducted an oversight hearing titled: ``Saving the Savings Clause: Congressional Intent, the Trinko Case, and the Role of the Antitrust Laws in Promoting Competition in the Telecom Sector.'' This hearing examined the need to preserve an antitrust remedy for anticompetitive misconduct that may also violate provisions of the Telecom Act. During the committee's hearing, I stated that ``judicial circumvention or erosion of the savings clause contained in the 1996 Act will necessitate a swift and decisive legislative correction from this Committee and Congress.''  In January, 2004, the Supreme Court handed down its Trinko decision. While the Court upheld the antitrust savings clause on its face, the decision makes it nearly impossible to state an antitrust claim for anticompetitive conduct within the regulatory ambit of the Telecom Act.  In reaching its conclusion, the majority looked to the perceived institutional capacity of regulators to remedy anticompetitive misconduct. Specifically, the majority decision stated: ``One factor of particular importance is the existence of a regulatory structure designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm. Where such a structure exists, the additional benefit to competition provided by antitrust enforcement will tend to be small, and it will be less plausible that the antitrust laws contemplate such additional scrutiny. . . .'' The Court also stated that the ``regulatory framework that exists in this case demonstrates how, in certain circumstances, `regulations significantly diminished the likelihood of major antitrust harm.' '' The Court then concluded that ``against the slight benefits of antitrust intervention here, we must weigh a realistic assessment of its costs.''  This is precisely the judicial analysis that the antitrust savings clause in the Telecom Act precluded. This fundamental judicial error ignores the plain meaning of the antitrust savings clause contained in the Telecom Act and the intent of Congress, and undermines remedial antitrust enforcement in a manner that threatens continued competitive gains in the telecommunications marketplace.  Last November, I stated that ``judicial circumvention of the antitrust savings clause in the Telecom Act will necessitate a decisive legislative correction from this Committee and Congress.'' The legislation I introduce today, with the consponsorship of Ranking Member Conyers, delivers on this commitment. This bill reiterates Congress's intent that the full force of the antitrust laws apply to the telecommunications field. The ``Clarification of Antitrust Remedies in Telecommunications Act of 2004'' merely provides that unlawful monopolistic behavior that may also violate the regulatory obligations of the Telecom Act may constitute an antitrust violation. The legislation provides an antitrust remedy for these violations irrespective of the existence of regulations that apply to this industry. In so doing, the legislation merely reiterates the plain meaning of the antitrust savings clause and the broad bipartisan intent of Congress to preserve the application of the antitrust laws in the telecommunications field irrespective of the existence of the Telecom Act.  To be clear, the legislation does not automatically transform violations of the 1996 Act into antitrust violations: this is not, nor has it even been, the intent of preserving application of the antitrust laws in the regulatory scheme created by the Telecom Act. The ``Clarification of Antitrust Remedies in Telecom Act of 2004'' merely reaffirms that violations of the Telecommunications Act may constitute an antitrust violation in appropriate circumstances: this legislation restores the result Congress intended; it does not transform the antitrust laws nor create antitrust obligations that the Telecommunications Act did not contemplate.  Over the last five decades, the Committee on the Judiciary has played a central role promoting competition in the telecommunications market. It has drafted procompetitive legislation and overseen its implementation. The committee has also diligently preserved the application of the antitrust laws in the telecommunications marketplace. The ``Clarification of Antitrust Remedies in Telecommunications Act of 2004'' continues this important tradition by ensuring that the antitrust laws continue to provide a catalyst to promote competition and consumer choice in this vital marketplace.  In that vein, I wish to comment briefly on a related matter. The committee continues to monitor the status of negotiations between incumbent and competitive local exchange carriers requested by the Federal Communications Commission in light of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals March 2, 2004, invalidation of key aspects of the most recent FCC Triennial Review Order. While the Committee on the Judiciary does not intend to prejudice the outcome of these continuing talks, it reserves the right to review these agreements to ensure that they are consistent with the antitrust laws and promote competition and consumer choice in the telecommunications marketplace.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the antitrust laws produce the irreversibly open telecommunications markets that we all seek, and urge their support for this critical legislation.                          ____________________
