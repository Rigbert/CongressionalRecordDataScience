Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I wanted to especially thank my dear colleagues, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis), for reserving time this afternoon and checking in as this debate ensued on the floor in order to be able to join me in this debate.  Let me say that our amendment proposes that as a part of our national energy strategy that biofuels and bioenergy be more than an afterthought but, in fact, be a central pillar of helping America reach a renewable energy future.                              {time}  1700  If you look at America's trade accounts, our chief strategic vulnerability relates to imported fuels. We are willing to go to war, to send our young men and women to war, for oil, but we are not willing to invest the dollars here at home to propel ourselves into a more energy self-sufficient future.  When the President of the United States and new Vice President produced a national energy report with solutions for the future, there was one gaping hole: Not a single recommendation relates to renewables and the use of biofuels, what we can take off our fields and forests, in order to have ethanol, biodiesel, and other such fuels made a part of America's energy future.  We declare an emergency, we set aside $500 million, and we say thatbiofuels are as important as natural gas, they are as important as petroleum, they are as important as any other fuel, whether it is windmills or turbines or whatever, in order to put America on a sound energy footing. We want to make sure that our message is heard loudly and clearly.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who has experience in this area, and again I express gratitude for his coming to the floor.
