Mr. Speaker, it is all too easy to get discouraged when reading the latest statistics showing that marijuana and heroin use among teenagers has skyrocketed over the last 5 years. Day after day, it seems that our media reports are filled with reports of violence; depression, and lost opportunities. Yet as a counter-balance against these reports, I am encouraged to share the experience and success of the Anchor Connection in Trenton, NJ.  Anchor Connection is a specialized program operated within the Anchor House, a nationally recognized basic service center for runaway and homeless youth, and has served the residents of central New Jersey since 1979. The Anchor House also operates a Transitional Living Program, which helps reduce drug abuse by teaching independent living skills to troubled teens.  I am proud that Anchor Connection is being honored today for its hard work by three of ourNation's top drug prevention organizations at the Federal level: Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Nelba Chavez, Ph.D., Administrator of the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], and Stephania O'Neill, Acting Director of the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention [CSAP].  Anchor Connection's outreach director, Heidi Camerlengo, and their drug prevention counselor, Ann Suabedissen, are doing marvelous and critical work in Mercer County and have earned our Nation's collective applause today. Anchor Connection, as the only comprehensive alcohol, tobacco, and other drug [ATOD] prevention program for runaway and homeless youth in central New Jersey, saw over 800 youth and families last year to help them resist the deadly allure of drugs and alcohol.  These children stayed in the custody of Anchor Connection for an average of 6 to 8 months, where they were introduced to Anchor House's enormously successful family of comprehensive programs that help troubled runaway youths. Anchor Connection's programs include resistance skills education and social skills training so that these teens can adapt and cope with life's day-to-day problems without having to resort to illicit substances of alcohol.  Their programs also provide transportation to needed services within the community, drug and alcohol screening, as well as life, education, and job skills training. This is in keeping with the idea that people who lack these basic life skills are more likely to succumb to the temptation of drugs. Through these programs, Anchor Connection enables these teens to adapt more readily for a normal, drug-free life.  Anchor Connection also conducts community awareness and education seminars to get the facts out about drug and alcohol abuse, and conduct individual, group, and family counseling to help those whose lives are directly touched and affected by our Nation's drug epidemic.  This overall approach has paid big dividends to the troubled kids and teens of Mercer County. Anchor Connection boasts a drug-reduction rate of at least 25 percent for children who remain with the program for 12 months. Heidi Camerlengo has estimated that the program has an 80-percent success rate in reducing drug use and getting the youth participants interested in school and other activities.  Another important aspect of Anchor Connection's drug prevention program is its individual written service plan, which helps young persons understand and achieve set goals. Since the program has a focus on runaway youths, it actively gets involved in resolving family conflicts. Where possible, it encourages family reunification, and where this is not a viable option, Anchor Connection will place children into foster care or other families.  I have been a longtime supporter and advocate for the Anchor House and its family of runaway youth programs, including the Drug and Alcohol Prevention Program run by Anchor Connection, as well as the Transitional Living Program administered by the Anchorage. Over the years, I have been honored to author many letters of support and have followed-up with the key Federal officials who administer Federal grant programs. Given the solid record of accomplishment they have built for themselves, Anchor House and Anchor Connection have proven that every cent of Federal support they have earned has been well worth the investment in our children.  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me say that the employees and volunteers at Anchor Connection have every right to be proud and gratified by this national award today. Today's award honors not only Mercer County's successes, but all the heroes across America who work in obscurity and anonymity on the front lines and in the trenches of America's war on drugs. These are the heroes who are out there on the streets of America day and night saving our children from the scourge of drugs one kid at a time. When the fanfare from today's ceremony ends, their quiet, patient task of rebuilding and repairing lives will go on. The hope and promise of a drug-free America that Anchor Connection has amply demonstrated in 1996, is and should be inspiration to teachers, parents, and students everywhere. It is right and fitting that we honor their arduous efforts and successes today.                          ____________________
