Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of Lake Elsinore is exceptional. Lake Elsinore has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated business and community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Donna Niehouse is one of these individuals.  On January 20, 2001, Donna Niehouse was honored as the outgoing 1999-2000 President of the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce. Donna's efforts over the past two years as President of the Lake Elsinore Chamber of Commerce led to the Chamber's financial stability through her sound judgement and leadership. Additionally, Lake Elsinore has seen the growth of the monthly Street Fairs and Cruise Nights held in the historic downtown Lake Elsinore--leading the Chamber's ability to turn over the operation of these events to the Downtown Merchants Association.  The leadership of Donna Niehouse has also led to the Economic Development Committee's returning to their original concept of monthly luncheons, now one of the most highly attended events in the community, and the establishment of the Chamber website. Donna has been instrumental in strengthening the bonds between the Chamber, City and business community.  Donna's work to promote the businesses, schools and community organizations of the City of Lake Elsinore make me proud to call her a community member and fellow American. I know that all of Lake Elsinore is grateful for her contribution to the betterment of the community and salute her as she departs the Lake Elsinore Valley Chamber of Commerce after two years of service. I look forward to continuing to work with her for the good of our community in the future.                          ____________________
