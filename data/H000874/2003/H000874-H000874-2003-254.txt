Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate that. I think we have made our point. I do hope that the chairman, although we may differ on intents, but in any event, I think the gentleman is absolutely correct, nobody has introduced something like that. Nobody has been so bold as to introduce a specific proposal, although many have been bold enough to discuss that objective and result, I say to my friend from California. Some have been that bold to discuss that result, if not introducing such a bill.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Rules.  On the appropriation bills, again, this is a concern that we have, because we have heard some discussions, Mr. Leader, about having restrained rules for appropriations. As the gentleman knows, more often than not, when we were in the majority, we brought many appropriation bills to the floor without a rule. As the gentleman knows, under the rules, appropriation bills do not need a rule.  Can the gentleman tell me what the majority contemplates for appropriation bills as they come to the floor and the rules that they may be coming to the floor under?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
