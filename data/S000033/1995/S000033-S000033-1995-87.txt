 Chairman I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio].  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, we have heard a bizarre version of reality from the other side of the aisle. First of all, let us talk about at what stage that 2 percent of the money that goes into research, in drug research in this country, is paid for by the taxpayers of the United States.  Often private companies enter into agreements with the NIH to develop new drugs using that public research. In my State they developed a drug which came from a yew tree, a tree that grew on public lands. Here is the way it works: The taxpayers paid for all the research, we discovered and developed Taxol, the NIH entered into an exclusive agreement with one company, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, to sell that drug. The drug research was done by the taxpayers. The resource grew on public lands. The company got the profits. A $500 production cost dose of that critical cancer drug for ovarian cancer costs $10,000.  Now we are saying, ``Oh, well, these drug companies, we would not want to control their prices.'' Then if they do not want to have price controls, they should not benefit free from public research. That is the bottom line here. They are not paying the development costs; the taxpayers are. Then the taxpayers have to go out and pay for profit rates of 20 times the cost of production.  Mr. Chairman, this is, plain and simple, another ripoff. It is all about money. It is not only about taxpayer money, it is about political contributions; $357,500 in the first 2 months of this year were contributed to the Republican National Committee by the pharmaceutical industry. We can bet there will be a lot of righteous indignation on that side of the aisle tonight, because it is about what really runs this place, campaign contributions, and taxpayers' money, while we fleece them out of the other pocket by talking about free enterprise.                              {time}  2315
