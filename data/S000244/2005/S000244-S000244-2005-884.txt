Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.  Mr. Chairman, I rarely disagree with my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), but I want to take some time to correct the record.  The delayed notification or so-called ``sneak-and-peek'' warrants were authorized in the late seventies for purposes of racketeering and drug-trafficking investigations and were held constitutional by the Supreme Court in the early eighties as not violative of the fourth amendment.  What the PATRIOT Act did was expand this previously existing authority to terrorism investigations. So if the PATRIOT Act never existed, the 18 instances where the delayed-notification warrants were used for terrorism investigations would have been illegal. But all of the other investigations that the gentleman from North Carolina referred to would have been legal under existing practice which have been held constitutional.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
