 President, I rise today to praise the Senate for the passage of the African Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act of 2004 which was completed before we adjourned for the Fourth of July recess. The House of Representatives passed the legislation on June 14, 2004, and it was imperative the Senate quickly follow suit.  The passage of AGOA is great news for Africa. Since AGOA was first enacted in 2000, investment in Africa is up, and trade from Africa is up. Because of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, many African families can now feed their children. For the first time there is a new sense of hope in many countries. Many provisions of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act were set to expire this year. This created an environment of uncertainty, which as leading to investment flight and lost opportunities. Passage of this bill will help people in Africa reap the full benefits of the program.  It is encouraging that this bill received such strong bipartisan support in the House and Senate. Trade can be a powerful tool of growth, and I am pleased that the majority of my colleagues share this view.  Although passage of this bill is a great step forward, there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, the United States is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with members of the Southern African Customs Union. This will include the nations of South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Namibia. Completion of this agreement will help foster trade and investment in the region, which could lead to a new period of sustained economic growth.  For trade to work, it has to be two-way street. Foreign aid and preference programs are always a short-term answer. For long-term growth, Africans must work hand-in-hand with the United States to open markets both in Africa and around the world. History proves that the most economically advanced nations are those that embrace free trade and free markets. Too often, unduly high tariff barriers in developing countries hinder the trade and investment that is so vital to economic growth. I want to help create a climate of sustained prosperity in Africa, so we can eliminate poverty and provide hope for a better future. Passage of this bill is a good first step. I hope we can continue our work with the African people to help advance both our economies and build toward a brighter, more prosperous future.  I would now like to take a minute and thank my staff who helped bring this legislation into realization. First and foremost is my staff director and chief counsel, Kolan Davis, for his leadership and loyalty. I would like to thank Everrett Eissenstat, my chief international trade counsel, for his hard work as well as that of the rest of my trade team, including Stephen Schaefer, David Johanson, Zach Paulsen and Dan Shepherdson. I must not forget to mention Carrie Clark--now Carrie Clark-Philips--who competently covered this issue for me before leaving the Committee. And finally, I want to thank the ranking member on the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and his able trade staff of Tim Punke, Brian Pomper, Shara Aranoff, Sara Andrews, John Gilliland and Pascal Niedermann, for the work they did in getting this bill compelted.  I look forward to seeing the President sign this legislation into law quickly, so we can continue to work with the African nations in furthering economic progress. I thank the Senate for the bipartisan nature extended in the passage of this important legislation.                          ____________________
