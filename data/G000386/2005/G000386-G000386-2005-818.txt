 Under the agreement reached tonight, we will have up to 40 minutes of debate on a series of amendments, which will be followed by four stacked rollcall votes. That will be on these amendments. The first vote will be in relation to the Durbin paperwork amendment, and that vote will begin at approximately 11:30 tomorrow morning. For the remainder of the day, we will continue working through the amendments to the bankruptcy bill. There are a number of amendments pending, and it is my hope that most of them will not require rollcall votes.  Earlier today, cloture was invoked on the bill by an overwhelming margin. It is the leadership's intention to complete action on the bill during Wednesday's session.                          ____________________
