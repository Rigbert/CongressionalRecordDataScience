President, amendment No. 3584 was accepted earlier. The sponsor of that amendment, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, has agreed to a modification of his amendment. I ask unanimous consent to send the modification to the desk and ask that it be accepted in lieu of the earlier amendment No. 3584.
