President, I hope that the Senate will celebrate America's independence by focusing its energy on issues that create American jobs, protect American ingenuity, and improve the lives of the American people.  One such issue that I would like to talk about today is as American as fireworks on the 4th of July. This is our nation's patent system. Patents are the life's blood of America's industry and economic strength.  America's patent system was established in the Constitution itself. It is no coincidence that some of those who framed our government were inventors. Both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were avid inventors. Indeed,Jefferson invented a cryptographic system that was used by the United States during World War II.  The Founders included in our enduring Constitution as an enumerated power of the Congress, the power ``To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' (United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8.) This Constitutional provision was carefully drafted to reflect a recognition by the Founders that our patent system would have to evolve in order to serve its intended purposes.  Congress, from its early days, implemented this constitutional prerogative. The First Congress, in its second session, passed an ``Act to Promote the Progress of Useful Arts.'' President Washington signed that law on April 10, 1790, and the United States Patent Office was thereby created.  Since that time, Congress has updated the patent laws of this country to make sure that the fuel of American genius was well stoked. Indeed, on an Independence Day more than 150 years ago, on July 4, 1836, Congress reorganized the patent system, created the office of ``Commissioner of Patents'' and reinstated the requirement that patent applications be examined. The Act provided that if the Commissioner deemed an invention ``to be sufficiently useful and important, it shall be his duty to issue a patent therefor.''  Abraham Lincoln, the only President to be issued a patent, declared that ``patents add the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.'' The patent system has continued to evolve over the last century and one-half as we have adapted to changing times and advances in technology. All the while American innovators have remained at the forefront of useful invention.  I, for one, would like to keep American innovators in the lead. Our jobs and our economic security depend on it. As we enter a new millennium, however, fewer and fewer of America's innovators feel confident that our patent system is keeping pace.  According to the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), in the last fiscal year, the PTO received 237,045 patent applications--a 14.9 percent increase over the previous year. Inventors are rightly demanding that the PTO conduct quicker and more careful searches. After all, in today's digital world, an innovator cannot afford to wait two years for his or her patent application to be processed. And once that application has been processed, an applicant wants to know that the patent will hold up and that the patent holder will not be caught up in litigation for years attempting to defend it.  It is for this reason that American inventors of all shapes and sizes, large and small, independent inventors and large corporations, have been pleading with Congress to improve our current patent system. They are asking us to help cut the red tape at the PTO, provide our inventors with stronger patent applications, reduce the cost of resolving patent disputes, and put an end to rules that favor foreign applicants over American applicants. What they have been asking us to do is to pass the Omnibus Patent Reform Act of 1997, S. 507.  Who wants this bill? American innovators and businesses large and small.  The White House Conference on Small Business Technology Chairs wrote to me on May 7, 1998 urging passage of S. 507 because, and I am quoting from their letter:       We believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the      litigation costs for small businesses, make it easier to know      what areas of technology are open for innovation, and will go      a long way towards giving us a more level playing field vis-     a-vis our foreign competitors. We wholeheartedly support      passage of the bill and appreciate the attention and support      you have given to small business.  The Chief Executives of 48 of America's largest companies wrote the Senate Majority Leader, asking him to schedule a vote on the bill before the Senate adjourns in the fall because ``S. 507 makes several major improvements in U.S. patent law that will greatly benefit American companies and inventors.''  So what has been stopping this bill? Well, one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill has been the Eagle Forum. The Senate Republican leadership should not clip the wings of technology for the benefit of the Eagle Forum. That would be no way to honor America's independence and no way to honor America's proud tradition of innovation.  Instead, let us celebrate America's independence by helping out the millions of Americans who owe their jobs and prosperity to industries created by America's innovators and creators. The Senate should take up and pass S.507.  I inserted into the Congressional Record on June 23, letters of support from the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National Venture Capital Association, and the 21 Century Patent Coalition.  I ask that additional letters of support for S. 507 be included in the Record following the conclusion of my statement. These letters are from The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, PhRMA; the American Automobile Manufacturers Association; the Software Publishers Association; the Semiconductor Industry Association; the Business Software Alliance; the American Electronics Association; and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. and Industry Corporation.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Chamber of Commerce of the                                     United States of America,                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1997.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Trent: As you know, this time of year brings a flurry      of bills to the fore, each with its own strengths and      argument why it deserves floor time prior to adjournment. One      bill that clearly merits your consideration for debate is S.      507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997.       In the chamber's view, the Hatch/Leahy bill has      successfully bridged the debate between proponents of      modernizing the patent system (the Chamber has long supported      this) and a relatively small group of independent inventors      who feared their patent rights might be abridged. The      resulting compromise will help strengthen our competitiveness      and create jobs while encouraging the inventiveness that      always has been an American hallmark. We urge your support      for this important legislation.       The House has already passed their corresponding bill. S.      507 was reported from the Judiciary Committee earlier this      year by a bipartisan vote of 17 to 1. We believe the time is      right now to move these needed reforms, adding another solid      accomplishment to this session.       Thank you again for your support.           Sincerely,     R. Bruce Josten.                                  ____                                       Pharmaceutical Research and                                     Manufacturers of America,                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 1998.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the research-based      pharmaceutical industry, we urge you to schedule a vote on S.      507, The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. This bill, which passed      out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 22, 1997 by      voice-vote, will strengthen U.S. patent law, advance      innovation, and increase our global competitiveness.       We appreciate your interest in moving legislation that will      not result in undue delay in the Senate. We question,      however, whether opposition can ultimately be sustained on      the Senate floor against S. 507 given its importance to      American industry and innovation. Of particular interest to      the pharmaceutical industry are provisions that would:      Strengthen the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) by making it      a government corporation ``with resulting operational and      fiscal flexibility;'' restore patent life lost as a result of      unusual administrative delays at PTO; and provide for      publication of patent applications 18 months after their      filing to allow U.S. companies to have access to applications      filed in the U.S. by foreign applicants.       Our industry, which in 1998 will spend over $20 billion in      research and development, depends on strong patent protection      to ensure that pharmaceutical companies are able to maximize      their efforts to discover new medicines that prevent, cure,      and treat disease. S. 507 will foster that and deserves floor      consideration soon.       Thank you for you attention to this important legislation.           Sincerely,         Raymond Gilmartin, Chairman President and CEO, Merck &            Co., Inc., PhRMA Chairman; David R. Ebsworth, Ph.D.,            Executive Vice President and President, Pharmaceutical            Division, Bayer Corp.; Robert A.

Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: The American Automobile Manufacturers      Association and its members, Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor      Company and General Motors Corporation, urge you to support      S. 507, the ``Omnibus Patent Act of 1997,'' co-sponsored by      Senators Hatch and Leahy. The House passed patent reform      earlier this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee      favorably reported S. 507 by a vote of 17 to 1. The bill has      been modified in numerous ways to accommodate the concerns of      small inventors, universities, and other interested groups.       We believe S. 507 is a fair and balanced bill that will      significantly improve the U.S. patent system. Modernization      of the Patent and Trademark Office will permit it to offer      improved services to patent applicants and owners. The      publication provisions will help avoid duplicative research      efforts and will accelerate the development of technology by      speeding the dissemination of research advances. Those who      file only in the U.S. can avoid early publication if they      desire, and new provisional royalty rights will ensure that      no inventor is deprived of the economic value of his or her      invention between the date of publication and patent      approval. The bill also provides a safe harbor for domestic      users of new manufacturing processes through the provision of      prior user-rights. And, an improve patent reexamination      process will provide a low-cost, speedy alternative to      expensive litigation for determining the validity of any      challenged patent.       The provisions of S. 507 will substantially improve our      nation's patent system. This will serve the interests of      inventors and technology users alike. More importantly, it      will benefit the entire American public by further      encouraging technological advances and the products such      advances bring. We urge you to vote for S. 507.           Sincerely,                                              Andrew H. Card, Jr.,     President and CEO.                                  ____                              Software Publishers Association,                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Software Publishers      Association (SPA), I am writing to ask you to urge Senate      Majority Leader Trent Lott to schedule a floor vote on S.      507, the Omnibus Patent Act, early this summer, and call on      you to vote to enact its important patent reforms into law.       SPA has more than 1,200 member companies, ranging from      large well-known companies to hundreds of smaller companies      and Internet start-ups, that develop and market software for      business, education, entertainment and the Internet. Patents      represent an increasingly important means for these companies      to protect the intellectual property in their software-     related inventions. In fact, a 1997 survey of over 800      software companies found that over 20 percent either owned or      had applied for a patent.       As the collective voice of one of the fastest growing, most      competitive industries in the world, SPA supports S. 507      because it would enact patent reforms that would encourage      investment and innovation in the software industry and other      industries that will create more high-paying jobs in America.      This legislation would make significant improvements in U.S.      patent law, including early publication of pending patents,      expanded reexamination, and a provisional right to a      reasonable royalty.       Leading members of SPA long ago came out in favor of S.      507, and Eric Ruff, CEO of Utah-based PowerQuest Corp.,      testified in support of the bill before the Senate Judiciary      Committee (his statement is enclosed). In May 1997, the      Judiciary Committee favorably reported S. 507 by a vote of 17      to one. S. 507 continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support.       In closing, I urge you to support S. 507 without amendments      that would undermine its objective--a patent system that      produces high quality, carefully and examined patents. The      House has already passed a similar bill, but time is running      out for the Senate to ensure that these important patent      reforms become law this year.           Sincerely yours,                                                        Ken Wasch,     President.                                  ____                                            Semiconductor Industry                                                  Association,                                      San Jose, CA, July 24, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Re Omnibus Patent Act of 1997.       Dear Senator: The Semiconductor Industry Association urges      you to support S. 507, the ``Omnibus Patent Act of 1997'', by      Senators Orrin Hatch, and Patrick Leahy.       The U.S. semiconductor industry employs over 235,000      Americans, including in California. Semiconductors are the      enabling technology for the nearly $400 billion U.S.      electronics industry, an industry that provides jobs for 2.5      million Americans.       The U.S. semiconductor industry invests over 11% of sales      on R, $7 billion in 1996 and leads the world in microchip      technology. A strong and efficient U.S. patent system is      essential for the U.S. to maintain this technology      leadership. S. 507 will create a Patent and Trademark Office      that is more efficient and responsive to the needs of U.S.      investors, mandate the speedy issuance for patents, and      reduce lawsuits and legal bills paid by American inventors      and companies. American companies will become more      competitive by speeding up research and development and      brining new products to market faster.       S. 507 is a carefully crafted measure that will encourage      new inventions and protect American innovators and      corporations while at the same time addressing the special      concerns of small inventors, small business and universities.      S. 507 cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in May and a      similar measure, H.R. 400, already passed the House.       Please vote for S 507 when it comes to the Senate floor. If      you or your staff would like to discuss this legislation and      its importance to the semiconductor industry, please do not      hesitate to call.           Sincerely,                                                   George Scalise,     President.                                  ____                                   Business Software Alliance,                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the members of the      Business Software Alliance (``BSA''), I want to thank you for      your leadership on the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507.      This legislation will make many significant improvements to      the U.S. patent system that will greatly benefit the U.S.      software industry and other users of the U.S. Patent Office.       We appreciate your efforts on this important issue and look      forward to working with you to seek its enactment before the      end of the session. Again, thank you for your hard work on      behalf of our nation's high technology industries.           Sincerely,                                          Robert W. Holleyman, II,     President & CEO.                                  ____                             American Electronics Association,                                    Santa Clara, CA, June 1, 1998.       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the more than 3,000      member companies of the American Electronics Association      (AEA) to urge you to support S. 507, the ``Omnibus Patent      Act,'' and respectfully request that you contact the Senate      Leadership and urge them to schedule debate and a floor vote      on S. 507 in the near future.       The AEA's member companies span the spectrum of electronics      and information technology companies, from semiconductors and      software to mainframe computers and communications systems.      For over 50 years, AEA has helped its members compete      successfully in the global marketplace and has been the      accepted voice of the American electronics and information      technology industry.       According to AEA's Cyberstates Update report, the high-tech      industry added some 200,000 new jobs in the U.S. between 1996      and 1997, for a total of nearly 4.5 million U.S. high-tech      workers earning salaries 73 percent higher than the average      private sector wage. AEA believes that modernizing the U.S.      patent system is critical to sustain the innovation that has      resulted in this tremendous job growth and the global      competitiveness of U.S. high technology companies.       S. 507, which was introduced by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT)      and Patrick Leahy  (D-VT), contains critical reforms that      will protect the interests of American inventors and      innovators while preparing the U.S. Patent and Trademark      Office (PTO) to meet the needs of our nation's high      technology firms as we enter the 21st Century. The reforms      contained in S. 507 will increase the value of patents to      inventors and companies, slash red tape in the PTO, and make      it easier for U.S. inventors and companies to research,      develop, and commercialize inventions.       AEA urges you to support this critical legislation to      further advance American technology and strengthen our      nation's global competitiveness. If you or your staff have      any questions regarding S. 507 or patent reform, please      contact Stephanie Stitzer of AEA at (202) 682-4431.           Sincerely,                                                William T. Archey,     President and CEO.                                  ____                                       Institute of Electrical and                                        Electronics Engineers,                                                  October 9, 1997.     Hon. Trent Lott,     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the Institute of Electrical      and Electronics Engineers United States Activities Board      (IEEE-USA) and its 220,000 electrical, electronics and      computer engineers who are U.S. members of IEEE, we urge you      to place the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997 (S. 507) on the      legislative calendar during this session of Congress.       The Omnibus Patent Act and its various provisions have      already had extensive analysis, numerous public hearings and      full consideration of a wide range of perspectives. We      believe that it is now time to call for a vote on this      important legislation before the end of the first session of      this Congress.       IEEE-USA supports the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997 (S. 507)      and its publication provisions. Many important compromises      have been made and we are now confident that the bill will      strengthen the U.S. patent system. S. 507 takes into account      many of our members' concerns regarding the disclosure of      their technology prior to receiving patent protection. The      Omnibus Patent Act provides inventors with the option of      delaying the publication of their application until the      patent is awarded--as long as they choose to file solely in      the United States.       The bill provides our 220,000 U.S. members with a      strengthened patent system and arrives as a reasonable      balance between inventor protection and public disclosure of      technology. We believe that his balance will assist in      promoting U.S. innovation and competitiveness,       If you or your staff would like to discuss this with us      further please contact Scott Grayson in our Washington, D.C.      office at (202) 785-0017.           Sincerely,                                                Daniel Fisher,                                                   Chair, IEEE-USA     Intellectual Property Committee.                          ____________________
