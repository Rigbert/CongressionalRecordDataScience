President, I welcome the recent statement of the distinguished Senior Senator from New York on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor last Friday, July 10. I have been concerned for several months that consideration of this nomination was being unnecessarily delayed. I am encouraged that Senator Moynihan's evaluation of this judicial nomination for the longstanding vacancy in the Second Circuit is similar to mine.  I know that the Senator from New York support this nomination and recall his statement of support to the Judiciary Committee at her hearing back in September 1997, almost 10 months ago.  I appreciated his joining with me and all the Senators from States within the Second Circuit when we wrote to the Majority Leader on April 9, 1998 urging ``prompt and favorable action on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor.'' We noted then the extraordinary action that had to be taken by the Chief Judge of our Circuit due to the vacancies crisis plaguing the Circuit. Since March 23, he has had to cancel hearings and proceed with 3-judge appellate panel that contain only one Second Circuit judge. Indeed, Chief Judge Winter has had to issue such orders in connection with matters heard this week.  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a well-qualified nominee. She was reportedly being held up by someone on the Republican side of the aisle because of speculation that she might be nominated this month by President Clinton to the United States Supreme Court. Last month a column in The Wall Street Journal discussed this secret basis for the Republican hold against this fine judge. The Journal revealed that this delay was intended to ensure that Sonia Sotomayor was not nominated to the Supreme Court. That was confirmed by a report in The New York Times on June 13.  How disturbing and how shameful. I am offended by this anonymous effort to oppose her prompt confirmation by stealth tactics. Here is a highly-qualified Hispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to help end the crisis in the Second Circuit more than four months ago.  Judge Sotomayor rose from a housing project in the Bronx to Princeton, Yale and a federal court appointment by President Bush. She is strongly supported by the Senator from New York and has had bipartisan support.  The excuse that had been used to delay consideration of her nomination has been removed. Perhaps now that the Supreme Court term has ended and Justice Stevens has not resigned, the Senate will proceed to consider Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the Second Circuit on its merits and confirm her without additional, unnecessary delay. There is no vacancy on the Supreme Court. The nominee has been held hostage over four months on the Senate calendar. It is past time to consider and confirm this nomination to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Second Circuit.  Unfortunately, this past weekend the Republican Leader of the United States Senate indicated on television that he has decided to move all nominations to the ``back burner.'' A spokesperson for the Republican Leader indicated that the Senate will not be considering any more nominations this year. That is wrong. I hope that the Republican leadership of the Senate will reverse itself and proceed to consider the nomination of Judge Sotomayor and those of all 10 judicial nominations now stalled on the Senate calendar.  In his annual report on the judiciary this year on New Year's Day, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' I would add vote her up or vote her down.  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the Senate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its unprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and 105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. This is wrong and should end.  Today is the anniversary of the Judiciary Act of 1789. Pursuant to its constitutional responsibilities, the Senate gave meaning to the provisions of article III of our Constitution and established the lower federal courts as a means to implement the exercise of the judicial power of the United States. That was an historic act and created the foundation for our federal court system. The Senate was led in that effort by a Senator from what is now the Second Circuit, Senator Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut.  Likewise, when the Senate established the Judiciary Committee 27 years later, it was first chaired by a Senator from the Second Circuit, Senator Dudley Chase of Vermont.  It is sadly ironic that on this the 209th anniversary of the Judiciary Act of 1789, when the Second Circuit needs the Senate's help, the Senate majority is, instead, holding off taking action on a qualified nominee without explanation or justification.  The Senate should consider the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit without further delay.                          ____________________
