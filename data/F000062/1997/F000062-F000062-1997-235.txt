 President, I want to express my support for the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1997. I believe that extending the basic term of copyright protection by 20 years is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps the most compelling reason for this legislation is the need for greater international reciprocity in honoring copyright terms. The European Union has formally adopted a life plus 70 copyright term, and countries currently awaiting admission to the Union will adopt this standard in the future. Several countries outside of the European Union also have turned to the life plus 70 term, and many expect it to become the international standard.  By extending to life plus 70 years, Congress will help ensure that American creators receive comparable protection in other countries. If we do not act, other nations will not be requiredto provide American authors and artists with any more protection than we offer them at home.  And, before the United States is the world's leader in the production of intellectual property, and because the State of California is home to many of the leading copyright industries, this issue is of great importance to me. We could be the net losers if we do not move toward greater harmonization.  Intellectual property--the collective creative output of America's makers of movies, music, art, and other works--is an enormous asset to the Nation's economy and balance of trade.  The International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates that copyright-related industries contributed more than $385 billion to the U.S. economy in 1994, with more than $50 billion in foreign sales.  Many other countries have preferred to appropriate and re-sell American films, music, and computer programs--some of the great exports of my State of California--rather than license American works.  The United States suffers greatly from illegal duplication of our work. Why, then, should we sit back and allow European companies to legally profit from the use of our works, without paying us in return?  As Prof. Arthur Miller of Harvard Law School aptly, albeit bluntly, put it: ``Unless Congress matches the copyright extension adopted by the European Union, we will lost 20 years of valuable protection against rip-off artists.'' Since America is the world's principal exporter of popular culture, extension of the basic copyright term is an important step in the right direction.  Reciprocity in copyright protection becomes even more necessary in today's global information society, where computer networks span the continents, and intellectual property is shuttled around the world in seconds.  The world has changed dramatically since 1976, when Congress established the present copyright terms. Many copyrighted works have a much longer commercial life than they used to have.  Videocassettes, cable television, and new satellite delivery systems have extended the commercial life of movies and television series. New technologies not only have extended but also have expanded the market for creative content. Cable television, which promises hundreds of different channels, has vastly expanded this market. Networked computers add to the demand for content. Interactive television promises to do the same.  The Copyright Term Extension Act will go far to address the global developments I have mentioned.  After introduction, I recommend that my colleagues and I further develop the language of the act to ensure that all contributors to the creative process receive benefits from the extended copyright term.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                                 S. 506       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(a) In General.--Except as provided in subsections (b) and      (c), the amendments made by this title shall take effect on      the date of the enactment of this Act.       (b) Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994.--The amendments made      by section 2 shall be effective as if enacted as part of the      Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-369).       (c) Technical Amendment.--The amendment made by section      12(b)(1) shall be effective as if enacted on November 9,      1987.                                                                    ____  Summary of Provisions--Copyright Clarification Act of 1997 (S. 506)       The Copyright Clarification Act is intended to make several      technical, yet important, changes to Copyright law, as      suggested by the U.S. Copyright Office. The following is a      brief summary of its provisions.       Satellite Home Viewer Act Technical Amendments. Section 2      makes technical corrections to the Satellite Home Viewer Act      of 1994 (SHVA), as recommended by the Copyright Office.      First, the bill corrects the dollar figures specified in the      Act for royalties to be paid by satellite carriers--the 1994      SHVA amendments mistakenly reversed the rates set by      arbitration in 1992 for signals subject to FCC syndicated      exclusivity blackout rules vs. those that are not subject to      such rules. Second, the bill corrects errors in section      numbers and references resulting from the failure of the 1994      SHVA amendments to account for changes made to Title 17 by      the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Act of 1993. Third, the bill      replaces references to ``the effective date of the Satellite      Home Viewer Act of 1988'' with the actual calendar date so as      to avoid confusion caused by the two Acts bearing the same      name.       Copyright Restoration. Section 3 clarifies ambiguities and      corrects drafting errors in the Copyright Restoration Act,      which was enacted as part of the 1994 Uruguay Round      Agreements Act to restore copyright protection in the U.S.      for certain works from WTO member countries that had fallen      into the public domain. First, the bill corrects a drafting      error that precludes U.S. creators of derivative works from      continuing to exploit those works if copyright protection in      the underlying foreign work is restored under GATT. Second,      the bill eliminates a duplicative reporting requirement.      Third, the bill clarifies Congress' intent that the effective      date of restoration is January 1, 1996 (not 1995 as      interpreted by some commentators). Fourth, the bill clarifies      the definition of ``eligible country'' as it pertains to      limited rights of continued exploitation for those who rely      on public domain works that were restored under GATT. An      ambiguous reference in the original bill left open the      possible interpretation that a party would not qualify as a      ``reliance party'' where reliance had not predated adherence      to the Berne Convention for the country of origin--a date      that goes as far back as 1886 for many countries.       Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings. Section 4      ensures that the effective rates under the 1995 digital      performance rights bill will not lapse. That bill requires      new rates to be established during 2000, and the 1996 rates      are to expire at the end of 2000. In the case where the      copyright arbitration royalty panel (CARP) does not complete      its work by the end of the year, or where the Librarian of      Congress does not complete its review of the CARP's report by      the end of the year, this section provides that the 1996      rates will continue beyond the December 31, 2000, expiration      date until 30 days after the Librarian publishes a decision      to adopt or reject the CARP's rate adjustment. This section      (as well as provisions in Section 5) also eliminates      authorization for a CARP to publish its report in the Federal      Register since only federal agencies are permitted to do so.      Instead, CARP decisions will be published by the Librarian.      Section 11 corrects a numbering mistake in the 1995 Digital      Performance Right bill.       Negotiated Jukebox License. Section 6 restores the      definitions of a ``jukebox'' and a ``jukebox operator'' to      Sec. 116A of Title 17. These definitions were mistakenly      eliminated from the old Sec. 116 jukebox compulsory license      when that section was replaced by the current Sec. 116A      negotiated jukebox license in the 1988 Berne Convention      implementing legislation. This section also clarifies that      all jukebox negotiated licenses that require arbitration are      CARP proceedings.       Advance Notice of Intent to Copyright Live Performances.      Section 7 changes the current 10-days advanced notice      requirement for a copyright owner who intends to copyright      the fixation of a live performance to a 48-hours advanced      notice requirement. The current provision has proven      unworkable for sporting events, in particular, where the      teams and times of the event may not be known 10 days in      advance.       Copyright Office Fees. Section 8 responds to ambiguities in      the Copyright Fees and Technical Amendments Act of 1989. That      bill allows the Copyright Office to increase fees in 1995,      and every fifth year thereafter to reflect changes in the      Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Copyright Office did not      raise its fees in 1995, because it determined that the costs      associated with the increase would be greater than the      resulting revenue. Uncertainty has arisen as to whether the      failure to increase fees in 1995 precludes the Copyright      Office from increasing its fees again until 2000 and whether      the increase in the CPI to be used in calculating the fee      increase is the increase since the last fee settlement (1990)      or only that since 1995. The bill clarifies that the      Copyright Office may increase its fees in any given year,      provided it has not done so within the last five years, and      that the fees may be increased up to the amount required to      cover the reasonable costs incurred by the Copyright Office      plus a reasonable inflation adjustment to account for future      increases in costs. The bill also allows the Register of      Copyrights to invest funds from the prepaid fees in interest      bearing securities in the U.S. Treasury and to use the income      from those investments for Copyright Office expenses. It is      expected that the proceeds will be used for the development      of the Copyright Office's new electronic registration,      recordation, and deposit system.       Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs). Section 9      clarifies administrative issues regarding the operation of      the CARPs. First, it gives the Librarian of Congress express      authority to pay panel members directly in ratemaking and      distribution proceedings and clarifies that these arbitrators      are independent contractors acting on behalf of the U.S.      (thus subject to laws governing the conduct of government      employees). Second, it clarifies that copyright owners and      users are responsible for equal shares of the costs of      ratemaking proceedings. Third, it clarifies by way of example      the procedural and evidentiary rulings the Librarian of      Congress can issue with respect to CARP proceedings. Fourth,      it clarifies that the 1997 ratemaking proceeding for the      satellite carrier compulsory license is a CARP proceeding.       Digital Audio Recording Devices. Section 10 provides added      flexibility for the Librarian of Congress in setting the      negotiation period for the distribution of digital audio      recording technology (DART) royalties, with the intention of      promoting settlements and timely distribution of royalties.      The current March 30 annual deadline for determining whether      there exist controversies among claimants has proven      unworkable and is eliminated by this section.       Miscellaneous Technical Amendments. Section 12 makes      various technical corrections, such as spelling, grammatical,      capitalization, and other corrections, to title 17.                                                                    ____                                 S. 507       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Subtitle A--Establishment of the United States Patent and Trademark                               Organization     SEC. 111. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND                    TRADEMARK ORGANIZATION AS A GOVERNMENT                    CORPORATION.       (a) Establishment.--The United States Patent and Trademark      Organization is established as a wholly owned Government      corporation subject to chapter 91 of title 31, separate from      any department, and shall be an agency of the United States      under the policy direction of the Secretary of Commerce.

(d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be      construed to nullify, void, cancel, or interrupt any pending      request-for-proposal let or contract issued by the General      Services Administration for the specific purpose of      relocating or leasing space to the United States Patent and      Trademark Organization.     SEC. 113. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT.       (a) Offices.--The United States Patent and Trademark      Organization shall consist of--       (1) the Office of the Director;       (2) the United States Patent Office; and       (3) the United States Trademark Office.       (b) Director.--       (1) In general.--The management of the United States Patent      and Trademark Organization shall be vested in a Director of      the United States Patent and Trademark Organization      (hereafter in this title referred to as the ``Director'',      unless the context provides otherwise), who shall be a      citizen of the United States and who shall be appointed by      the President, by and with the advice and consent of the      Senate. The Director shall be a person who, by reason of      professional background and experience in patent or trademark      law, is especially qualified to manage the Organization.       (2) Duties.--(A) The Director shall--       (i) be responsible for the Management and direction of the      Organization and shall perform this duty in a fair,      impartial, and equitable manner; and       (ii) strive to meet the goals set forth in the performance      agreement described under paragraph (4).       (B) The Director shall advise the President, through and      under the policy direction of the Secretary of Commerce, of      all activities of the Organization undertaken in response to      obligations of the United States under treaties and executive      agreements, or which relate to cooperative programs with      those authorities of foreign governments that are responsible      for granting patents or registering trademarks. The Director      shall also recommend to the President, through and under the      policy direction of the Secretary of Commerce, changes in law      or policy which may improve the ability of United States      citizens to secure and enforce patent and trademark rights in      the United States or in foreign countries.       (C)(i) At the direction of the President, the Director may      represent the United States in international negotiations on      matters of patents or trademarks, or may designate an officer      or officers of the Organization to participate in such      negotiations.       (ii) Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to      alter any statutory responsibility of the Secretary of State      or the United States Trade Representative.       (D) The Director, in consultation with the Director of the      Office of Personnel Management, shall maintain a program for      identifying national security positions and providing for      appropriate security clearances.       (E) The Director may perform such personnel, procurement,      and other functions, with respect to the United States Patent      Office and the United States Trademark Office, where a      centralized administration of such functions would improve      the efficiency of the Offices, as determined by agreement of      the Director, the Commissioner of Patents, and the      Commissioner of Trademarks.       (F) Except as otherwise provided in this title, the      Director shall ensure that--       (i) the United States Patent Office and the United States      Trademark Office, respectively, shall--       (I) prepare all appropriation requests under section 1108      of title 31, United States Code, for each office for      submission by the Director;       (II) adjust fees to provide sufficient revenues to cover      the expenses of such office; and       (III) expend funds derived from such fees for only the      functions of such office; and       (ii) each such office is not involved in the management of      any other office.       (3) Oath.--The Director shall, before taking office, take      an oath to discharge faithfully the duties of the      Organization.       (4) Compensation.--The Director shall receive compensation      at the rate of pay in effect for level III of the Executive      Schedule under section 5314 of title 5, United States Code      and, in addition, may receive as a bonus, an amount which      would raise total compensation to the equivalent of the level      of the rate of pay in effect for level II of the Executive      Schedule under section 5313 of title 5, based upon an      evaluation by the Secretary of Commerce of the Director's      performance as defined in an annual performance agreement      between the Director and the Secretary. The annual      performance agreement shall incorporate measurable goals as      delineated in an annual performance plan agreed to by the      Director and the Secretary.       (5) Removal.--The Director shall serve at the pleasure of      the President.       (6) Designee of director.--The Director shall designate an      officer of the Organization who shall be vested with the      authority to act in the capacity of the Director in the event      of the absence or incapacity of the Director.       (c) Officers and Employees of the Organization.--       (1) Commissioners of patents and trademarks.--The Director      shall appoint a Commissioner of Patents and a Commissioner of      Trademarks under section 3 of title 35, United States Code      and section 53 of the Act of July 5, 1946 (commonly referred      to as the Trademark Act of 1946), respectively, as amended by      this Act.       (2) Other officers and employees.--The Director shall--       (A) appoint officers, employees (including attorneys), and      agents of the Organization as the Director considers      necessary to carry out its functions;       (B) fix the compensation of such officers and employees,      except as provided in subsection (e); and       (C) define the authority and duties of such officers and      employees and delegate to them such of the powers vested in      the Organization as the Director may determine.       (3) Personnel limitations.--The Organization shall not be      subject to any administratively or statutorily imposed      limitation on positions or personnel, and no positions or      personnel of the Organization shall be taken into account for      purposes of applying any such limitation.       (d) Limits on Compensation.--Except as otherwise provided      by law, the annual rate of basic pay of an officer or      employee of the Organization may not be fixed at a rate that      exceeds, and total compensation payable to any such officer      or employee for any year may not exceed, the annual rate of      basic pay in effect for level II of the Executive Schedule      under section 5313 of title 5, United States Code. The      Director shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary      to carry out this subsection.       (e) Inapplicability of Title 5, United States Code,      Generally.--Except as otherwise provided in this section,      officers and employees of the Organization shall not be      subject to the provisions of title 5, United States Code,      relating to Federal employees.       (f) Continued Applicability of Certain Provision of Title      5, United States Code.--       (1) In general.--The following provisions of title 5,      United States Code, shall apply to the Organization and its      officers and employees:       (A) Section 3110 (relating to employment of relatives;      restrictions).       (B) Subchapter II of chapter 55 (relating to withholding      pay).       (C) Subchapters II and III of chapter 73 (relating to      employment limitations and political activities,      respectively).       (D) Chapter 71 (relating to labor-management relations),      subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (g).       (E) Section 3303 (relating to political recommendations).       (F) Subchapter II of chapter 61 (relating to flexible and      compressed work schedules).       (G) Section 21302(b)(8) (relating to whistleblower      protection) and whistleblower related provisions of chapter      12 (covering the role of the Office of Special Counsel).       (2) Compensation subject to collective bargaining.--       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of      law, for purposes of applying chapter 71 of title 5, United      States Code, pursuant to paragraph (1)(D), basic pay and      other forms of compensation shall be considered to be among      the matters as to which the duty to bargain in good faith      extends under such chapter.       (B) Exceptions.--The duty to bargain in good faith shall      not, by reason of subparagraph (A), be considered to extend      to any benefit under title 5, United States Code, which is      afforded by paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection      (g).

TITLE IV--PRIOR DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL USE     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Prior Domestic Commercial      Use Act of 1997''.     SEC. 402. DEFENSE TO PATENT INFRINGEMENT BASED ON PRIOR                    DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL USE.       (a) Defense.--Chapter 28 of title 35, United States Code,      is amended by adding at the end the following new section:     ``Sec. 273. Prior domestic commercial use; defense to        infringement       ``(a) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--       ``(1) the terms `commercially used', `commercially use',      and `commercial use' mean the use in the United States in      commerce or the use in the design, testing, or production in      the United States of a product or service which is used in      commerce, whether or not the subject matter at issue is      accessible to or otherwise known to the public;       ``(2) the terms `used in commerce', and `use in commerce'      mean that there has been an actual sale or other commercial      transfer of the subject matter at issue or that there has      been an actual sale or other commercial transfer of a product      or service resulting from the use of the subject matter at      issue; and       ``(3) the `effective filing date' of a patent is the      earlier of the actual filing date of the application for the      patent or the filing date of any earlier United States,      foreign, or international application to which the subject      matter at issue is entitled under section 119, 120, or 365 of      this title.       ``(b) Defense to Infringement.--       ``(1) In general.--A person shall not be liable as an      infringer under section 271 of this title with respect to any      subject matter that would otherwise infringe one or more      claims in the patent being asserted against such person, if      such person had, acting in good faith, commercially used the      subject matter before the effective filing date of such      patent.       ``(2) Exhaustion of right.--The sale or other disposition      of the subject matter of a patent by a person entitled to      assert a defense under this section with respect to that      subject matter shall exhaust the patent owner's rights under      the patent to the extent such rights would have been      exhausted had such sale or other disposition been made by the      patent owner.       ``(c) Limitations and Qualifications of Defense.--The      defense to infringement under this section is subject to the      following:       ``(1) Derivation.--A person may not assert the defense      under this section if the subject matter on which the defense      is based was derived from the patentee or persons in privity      with the patentee.       ``(2) Not a general license.--The defense asserted by a      person under this section is not a general license under all      claims of the patent at issue, but extends only to the      subject matter claimed in the patent with respect to which      the person can assert a defense under this chapter, except      that the defense shall also extend to variations in the      quantity or volume of use of the claimed subject matter, and      to improvements in the claimed subject matter that do not      infringe additional specifically claimed subject matter of      the patent.       ``(3) Effective and serious preparation.--With respect to      subject matter that cannot be commercialized without a      significant investment of time, money, and effort, a person      shall be deemed to have commercially used the subject matter      if--       ``(A) before the effective filing date of the patent, the      person reduced the subject matter to practice in the United      States, completed a significant portion of the total      investment necessary to commercially use the subject matter,      and made a commercial transaction in the United States in      connection with the preparation to use the subject matter;      and       ``(B) thereafter the person diligently completed the      remainder of the activities and investments necessary to      commercially use the subject matter, and promptly began      commercial use of the subject matter, even if such activities      were conducted after the effective filing date of the patent.       ``(4) Burden of proof.--A person asserting the defense      under this section shall have the burden of establishing the      defense.       ``(5) Abandonment of use.--A person who has abandoned      commercial use of subject matter may not rely on activities      performed before the date of such abandonment in establishing      a defense under subsection (b) with respect to actions taken      after the date of such abandonment.       ``(6) Personal defense.--The defense under this section may      only be asserted by the person who performed the acts      necessary to establish the defense and, except for any      transfer to the patent owner, the right to assert the defense      shall not be licensed or assigned or transferred to another      person except in connection with the good faith assignment or      transfer of the entire enterprise or line of business to      which the defense relates.       ``(7) One-year limitation.--A person may not assert a      defense under this section unless the subject matter on which      the defense is based had been commercially used or reduced to      practice more than one year prior to the effective filing      date of the patent by the person asserting the defense or      someone in privity with that person.       ``(d) Unsuccessful Assertion of Defense.--If the defense      under this section is pleaded by a person who is found to      infringe the patent and who subsequently fails to demonstrate      a reasonable basis for asserting the defense, the court shall      find the case exceptional for the purpose of awarding      attorney's fees under section 285 of this title.       ``(e) Invalidity.--A patent shall not be deemed to be      invalid under section 102 or 103 of this title solely because      a defense is established under this section.''.       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections at the      beginning of chapter 28 of title 35, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following new item:``Sec. 273. Prior domestic commercial use; defense to infringement.''.     SEC. 403. EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPLICABILITY.       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take      effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, but shall      not apply to any action for infringement that is pending on      such date of enactment or with respect to any subject matter      for which an adjudication of infringement, including a      consent judgment, has been made before such date of      enactment.                  TITLE V--PATENT REEXAMINATION REFORM     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.       This title may be cited as the ``Patent Reexamination      Reform Act of 1997''.     SEC. 502. DEFINITIONS.       Section 100 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by      adding at the end the following new subsection:       ``(e) The term `third-party requester' means a person      requesting reexamination under section 302 of this title who      is not the patent owner.''.     SEC. 503. REEXAMINATION PROCEDURES.       (a) Request for Reexamination.--Section 302 of title 35,      United States Code, is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 302. Request for reexamination       ``(a) In General.--Any person at any time may file a      request for reexamination by the Office of a patent on the      basis of any prior art cited under the provisions of section      301 of this title or on the basis of the requirements of      section 112 of this title except for the requirement to set      forth the best mode of carrying out the invention.       ``(b) Requirements.--The request shall--       ``(1) be in writing, include the identity of the real party      in interest, and be accompanied by payment of a reexamination      fee established by the Commissioner of Patents pursuant to      the provisions of section 41 of this title; and       ``(2) set forth the pertinency and manner of applying cited      prior art to every claim for which reexamination is requested      or the manner in which the patent specification or claims      fail to comply with the requirements of section 112 of this      title.       ``(c) Copy.--Unless the requesting person is the owner of      the patent, the Commissioner promptly shall send a copy of      the request to the owner of record of the patent.''.       (b) Determination of Issue by Commissioner.--Section 303 of      title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 303. Determination of issue by Commissioner       ``(a) Reexamination.--Not later than 3 months after the      filing of a request for reexamination under the provisions of      section 302 of this title, the Commissioner shall determine      whether a substantial new question of patentability affecting      any claim of the patent concerned is raised by the request,      with or without consideration of other patents or printed      publications. On the Commissioner's initiative, and any time,      the Commissioner may determine whether a substantial new      question of patentability is raised by patents and      publications or by the failure of the patent specification or      claims to comply with the requirements of section 112 of this      title except for the best mode requirement described in      section 302.       ``(b) Record.--A record of the Commissioner's determination      under subsection (a) shall be placed in the official file of      the patent, and a copy shall be promptly given or mailed to      the owner of record of the patent and to the third-party      requester, if any.       ``(c) Final Decision.--A determination by the Commissioner      pursuant to subsection (a) shall be final and nonappealable.      Upon a determination that no substantial new question of      patentability has been raised, the Commissioner may refund a      portion of the reexamination fee required under section 302      of this title.''.       (c) Reexamination Order by Commissioner.--Section 304 of      title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 304. Reexamination order by Commissioner       ``If, in a determination made under the provisions of      section 303(a) of this title, the Commissioner finds that a      substantial new question of patentability affecting a claim      of a patent is raised, the determination shall include an      order for reexamination of the patent for resolution of the      question. The order may be accompanied by the initial action      of the Patent Office on the merits of the reexamination      conducted in accordance with section 305 of this title.''.       (d) Conduct of Reexamination Proceedings.--Section 305 of      title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 305. Conduct of reexamination proceedings       ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), reexamination      shall be conducted according to the procedures established      for initial examination under the provisions of sections 132      and 133 of this title. In any reexamination proceeding under      this chapter, the patent owner shall be permitted to propose      any amendment to the patent and a new claim or claims, except      that no proposed amended or new claim enlarging the scope of      the claims of the patent shall be permitted.       ``(b) Response.--(1) This subsection shall apply to any      reexamination proceeding in which the order for reexamination      is based upon a request by a third-party requester.       ``(2) With the exception of the reexamination request, any      document filed by either the patent owner or the third-party      requester shall be served on the other party.       ``(3) If the patent owner files a response to any Patent      Office action on the merits, the third-party requester shall      have 1 opportunity to file written comments within a      reasonable period not less than 1 month after the date of      service of the patent owner's response. Written comments      provided under this paragraph shall be limited to issues      covered by the Patent Office action or the patent owner's      response.       ``(c) Special Dispatch.--Unless otherwise provided by the      Commissioner for good cause, all reexamination proceedings      under this section, including any appeal to the Board of      Patent Appeals and Interferences, shall be conducted with      special dispatch within the Office.''.       (e) Appeal.--Section 306 of title 35, United States Code,      is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 306. Appeal       ``(a) Patent Owner.--The patent owner involved in a      reexamination proceeding under this chapter--       ``(1) may appeal under the provisions of section 134 of      this title, and may appeal under the provisions of sections      141 through 144 of this title, with respect to any decision      adverse to the patentability of any original or proposed      amended or new claim of the patent, and       ``(2) may be a party to any appeal taken by a third-party      requester pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.       ``(b) Third-Party Requester.--A third-party requester may--       ``(1) appeal under the provisions of section 134 of this      title, and may appeal under the provisions of sections 141      through 144 of this title, with respect to any final decision      favorable to the patentability of any original or proposed      amended or new claim of the patent; or       ``(2) be a party to any appeal taken by the patent owner,      subject to subsection (c) of this section.       ``(c) Participation as Party.--       ``(1) In general.--A third-party requester who, under the      provisions of sections 141 through 144 of this title, files a      notice of appeal or who participates as a party to an appeal      by the patent owner is estopped from asserting at a later      time, in any forum, the invalidity of any claim determined to      be patentable on appeal on any ground which the third-party      requester raised or could have raised during the      reexamination proceedings.       ``(2) Election to participate.--A third-party requester is      deemed not to have participated as a party to an appeal by      the patent owner unless, not later than 20 days after the      patent owner has filed notice of appeal, the third-party      requester files notice with the Commissioner electing to      participate.''.       (f) Reexamination Prohibited.--       (1) In general.--Chapter 30 of title 35, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new      section:     ``Sec. 308. Reexamination prohibited       ``(a) Order for Reexamination.--Notwithstanding any      provision of this chapter, once an order for reexamination of      a patent has been issued under section 304 of this title,      neither the patent owner nor the third-party requester, if      any, nor privies of either, may file a subsequent request for      reexamination of the patent until a reexamination certificate      is issued and published under section 307 of this title,      unless authorized by the Commissioner.       ``(b) Final Decision.--Once a final decision has been      entered against a party in a civil action arising in whole or      in part under section 1338 of title 28 that the party has not      sustained its burden of proving the invalidity of any patent      claim in suit, then neither that party nor its privies may      thereafter request reexamination of any such patent claim on      the basis of issues which that party or its privies raised or      could have raised in such civil action, and a reexamination      requested by that party or its privies on the basis of such      issues may not thereafter be maintained by the Office,      notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter.''.       (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--The table of      sections for chapter 30 of title 35, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following:``308. Reexamination prohibited.''.     SEC. 504. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.       (a) Patent Fees; Patent Search Systems.--Section 41(a)(7)      of title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as      follows:       ``(7) On filing each petition for the revival of an      unintentionally abandoned application for a patent, for the      unintentionally delayed payment of the fee for issuing each      patent, or for an unintentionally delayed response by the      patent owner in a reexamination proceeding, $1,250, unless      the petition is filed under sections 133 or 151 of this      title, in which case the fee shall be $110.''.       (b) Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and      Interferences.--Section 134 of title 35, United States Code,      is amended to read as follows:     ``Sec. 134. Appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and        Interferences       ``(a) Patent Applicant.--An applicant for a patent, any of      whose claims has been twice rejected, may appeal from the      decision of the primary examiner to the Board of Patent      Appeals and Interferences, having once paid the fee for such      appeal.       ``(b) Patent Owner.--A patent owner in a reexamination      proceeding may appeal from the final rejection of any claim      by the primary examiner to the Board of Patent Appeals and      Interferences, having once paid the fee for such appeal.       ``(c) Third-Party.--A third-party requester may appeal to      the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences from the final      decision of the primary examiner favorable to the      patentability of any original or proposed amended or new      claim of a patent, having once paid the fee for such      appeal.''.

(e) Proceedings on Appeal.--Section 143 of title 35, United      States Code, is amended by amending the third sentence to      read as follows: ``In ex parte and reexamination cases, the      Commissioner shall submit to the court in writing the grounds      for the decision of the Patent Office, addressing all the      issues involved in the appeal.''.

EFFECTIVE DATE.       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take      effect on the date that is 6 months after the date of the      enactment of this Act and shall apply to all reexamination      requests filed on or after such date.               TITLE VI--MISCELLANEOUS PATENT PROVISIONS     SEC. 601. PROVISIONAL APPLICATIONS.

If no such request is made, the      provisional application shall be regarded as abandoned 12      months after the filing date of such application and shall      not be subject to revival thereafter.''.       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)      apply to a provisional application filed on or after June 8,      1995.     SEC. 602. INTERNATIONAL APPLICATIONS.

(2) At the end of section 119 add the following new      subsections:       ``(f) Applications for plant breeder's rights filed in a      WTO member country (or in a foreign UPOV Contracting Party)      shall have the same effect for the purpose of the right of      priority under subsections (a) through (c) of this section as      applications for patents, subject to the same conditions and      requirements of this section as apply to applications for      patents.       ``(g) As used in this section--       ``(1) the term `WTO member country' has the same meaning as      the term is defined in section 104(b)(2) of this title; and       ``(2) the term `UPOV Contracting Party' means a member of      the International Convention for the Protection of New      Varieties of Plants.''.     SEC. 603. PLANT PATENTS.       (a) Tuber Propagated Plants.--Section 161 of title 35,      United States Code, is amended by striking ``a tuber      propagated plant or''.       (b) Rights in Plant Patents.--The text of section 163 of      title 35, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:      ``In the case of a plant patent, the grant to the patentee,      such patentee's heirs or assigns, shall have the right to      exclude others from asexually reproducing the plant, and from      using, offering for sale, or selling the plant so reproduced,      or any of its parts, throughout the United States, or from      importing the plant so reproduced, or any parts thereof, into      the United States.''.       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments by subsection (a) shall      apply on the date of enactment of this Act. The amendments      made by subsection (b) shall apply to any plant patent issued      on or after the date of enactment of this Act.     SEC. 604. ELECTRONIC FILING.       Section 22 of title 35, United States Code, is amended by      striking ``printed or typewritten'' and inserting ``printed,      typewritten, or on an electronic medium'' .                                                                    ____                  Omnibus Patent Act of 1997--Summary      title i--the united states patent and trademark organization       This title establishes the United States Patent and      Trademark Organization (USPTO) as a wholly owned government      corporation connected for policy-making purposes to the      Department of Commerce. Like the existing U.S. Patent and      Trademark Office, the USPTO is charged with patent and      trademark policy formulation and the administration of the      patent and trademark systems. But unlike the present      structure, the USPTO will be freed from a heavy-handed      federal bureaucracy, which inhibits the ability of the Patent      and Trademark Office to meet the demands of those who fully      sustain its operation through user fees. Heightened      efficiency is also achieved by separating the policymaking      functions from the day-to-day operating functions.       The USPTO is headed by a Director of the U.S. Patent and      Trademark Office, who is charged with advising the President      through the Secretary of Commerce regarding patent and      trademark policy. He or she is appointed by the President      with Senate confirmation, and he or she serves at the      pleasure of the President.       The USPTO has two autonomous subdivisions: the Patent      Office and the Trademark Office. Each office is responsible      for the administration of its own system. Each office      controls its own budget and its management structure and      procedures. Each office must generate its own revenue in      order to be self-sustaining and to provide for the Office of      the Director. The Patent Office and the Trademark Office are      headed by the Commissioner of Patents and the Commissioner of      Trademarks, respectively. The two Commissioners are appointed      by the Director and serve at his or her pleasure.                      title ii--early publication       Title II of the bill provides for the early publication of      patent applications. It would require the Patent Office to      publish pending applications eighteen months after the      application was filed. An exception of this rule is made for      applications filed only in the United States. Those      applications will be published eighteen months after filing      or three months after the office issues its first response on      the application, whichever is later. Additionally, once an      application is published, Title II grants the applicant      ``provisional rights,'' that is, legal protection for his or      her invention.                   title iii--patent term restoration       Title III deals with the problem of administrative delay in      the patent examination process by restoring to the patent      holder any part of the term that is lost due to undue      administrative delay. Title III gives clear deadlines in      which the Patent Office must act. The office has      fourteen months to issue a first office action and four      months to respond to subsequent applicant filings. Any      delay beyond those deadlines is considered undue delay and      will be restored to the patent term.                Title IV--Prior domestic Commercial Use       This title provides rights to a person who has commercially      sold an invention more than one year before the effective      filing date of a patent application by another person. Anyone      in this situation will be permitted to continue to sell his      or her product without being forced to pay a royalty to the      patent holder.                 Title V--Patent Re-examination Reform       Title V provides for a greater role for third parties in      patent re-examination proceedings by allowing third-parties      to raise a challenge to an existing patent and to participate      in the reexamination process in a meaningful way.                        Title VI--Miscellaneous     Provisional Applications for Patents       This title amends section 115 of Title 35 of the U.S. Code      to clarify that if a provisional application is converted      into a non-provisional application within twelve months of      filing, that it stands as a full patent application, with the      date of filing of the provisional application as the date of      priority. If no request is made within twelve months, the      provisional application is considered abandoned. This      clarification will make certain that American provisional      applications are given the same weight as other countries'      provisional applications in other countries' courts.     Plant Patents       Title VI also makes two corrections to the plant patent      statute. First, the ban on tuber propagated plants is      removed.
