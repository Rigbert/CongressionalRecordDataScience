Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the more than 1200 students from across the United States that traveled to Washington, D.C. this past weekend to compete in the national finals of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program. Administered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the U.S. Department of Education, We the People is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  I am proud to announce that students from West Anchorage High School in Anchorage represented the state of Alaska in this national event. These young scholars have worked conscientiously to reach the national finals by participating at local and statewide competitions. As a result of their experience, they have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. For the first time in the competition's history, a team from Alaska participated in the events' final round and finished the competition in 4th Place.  The three-day We the People national competition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges on constitutional topics. The students are given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and contemporary issues. Their testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the judges who probe the students' depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge.  The We the People program provides curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels. The curriculum not only enhances students' understanding of the institutions of American constitutional democracy, it also helps them identify the contemporary relevance of the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Critical thinking exercises, problem-solving activities, and cooperative learning techniques help develop participatory skills necessary for students to become active, responsible citizens.  Independent studies by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) revealed that students enrolled in the We the People program at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels ``significantly outperformed comparison students on every topic of the tests taken.'' Another study by Richard Brody at Stanford University discovered that students involved in the We the People program develop greater commitment to democratic principles and values than do students using traditional textbooks and approaches.  I am proud to have the class from West Anchorage High School represent my home state of Alaska and I applaud their historic 4th Place finish. It is inspiring to see these young people advocate the fundamental ideals and principles of our government, ideas that identify usas a people and bind us together as a nation. It is important for future generations to understand these values and principles, which we hold as standards in our endeavor to preserve and realize the promise of our constitutional democracy. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck in all of their future endeavors.                          ____________________
