Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to honor Mr. Gary Neale on the occasion of his retirement as Chief Executive Officer of NiSource, where he has served the people of Northwest Indiana since 1989 and who I am proud to call a friend.  Mr. Neale guided the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, a mid-sized utility provider, to become NiSource, one of the Nation's leading energy companies. Today, NiSource is a Fortune 500 company--the only one headquartered in Northwest Indiana, and one of the few located in the State of Indiana. Because of Mr. Neale's work, NiSource is nowthe largest natural gas distributor east of the Rocky Mountains. This incredible growth came under the talented leadership of Mr. Neale, as he has brought an unparalleled level of vision and energy to NiSource. Because of his commitment to the community and his company, he will continue to serve NiSource as Chairman of the Board of Directors after his retirement.  Upon his retirement, Mr. Neale will have nearly 40 years of experience in the energy industry. He has become one of the most well-respected leaders in the industry over the years. Mr. Neale has served as the chairman of the American Gas Association and the North American Electric Reliability Council. He was also appointed by former U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to serve on the U.S. Department of Energy's Electricity Advisory Board and was selected by former U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to serve on the National Petroleum Council.  His contributions to the economy of Northwest Indiana are only eclipsed by his commitment to community service. The NiSource Charitable Foundation contributes more than $5 million per year to non-profit organizations in the communities served by NiSource. Under his guidance, NiSource developed its Environmental Challenge Fund to support wildlife enhancement projects. To date, the fund has awarded more than $850,000 in support of wildlife projects. Mr. Neale himself is personally committed to public service, serving on the boards of the Northwest Indiana Symphony Society, the Lake County United Way Campaign, and the Northwest Indiana Americans With Disabilities Act Advisory Board. A leader in economic development and a man of foresight, Mr. Neale has worked to improve the efficiency of local government services through his involvement with the Good Government Initiative in Northwest Indiana. Additionally, he has invested great amounts of personal time and energy in the Indiana Dunes Environmental Learning Center. He is also committed to higher education in Northwest Indiana, serving as a Trustee of Valparaiso University.  Mr. Neale has accomplished much since coming to Northwest Indiana from his home state of Washington, where he received his B.A. and M.B.A. from the University of Washington. I wish him, his wife Sandy, his two children, Julie and David, and his five grandchildren the best of luck in his retirement.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Gary Neale for his outstanding contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana. His commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of the First Congressional District of Indiana is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended. Over the years, I have sought out Gary for his advice and counsel on energy issues and to seek his assistance on matters affecting Northwest Indiana. I have always found him to be conscientious, deliberate, and innovative in his guidance. As James Joyce said, ``not in time, place, or circumstance but in the man lies success;'' or, as my father would say, ``he's a 100% guy.''                          ____________________
