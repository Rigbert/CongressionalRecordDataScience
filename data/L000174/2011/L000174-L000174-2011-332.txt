President, I don't believe there is going to be a huge number of people lined up to speak on this nomination, but I will first use part of my reserve time on the Verrilli nomination to speak of another matter within the purview of the Judiciary. So I ask unanimous consent, with the time being charged to my half hour, that I be recognized to speak as in morning business.
