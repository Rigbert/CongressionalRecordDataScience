Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer a bill today which would allow for the traditional fishing of Red Fish in the Katmai National Park during the months of August to October of each year by a limited number of my Alaska Native constituency in the Bristol Bay area. This bill is the result of the work of the Bristol Bay Native Association in cooperation with the Alaska Federation of Natives.  This bill would allow approximately 30 to 40 local residents who live within the boundaries of the Katmai National park to fish for Red Fish during the months of August to October of each year. The ancestors of local residents who reside within the boundaries of the Park have participated in the annual harvest of Red Fish from August to early October every year. While Katmai National Park was designated a park in the 1930's, local residents were prohibited from the taking of fish except with a rod and reel. This bill would allow the local residents to again fish for a traditional dietary fish of their region.  Specifically, section one defines the Katmai National Park.  Section two is the provision which would allow local residents, to, again, begin their traditional fishery of Red Fish within the Katmai National Park during the months of August through October.  Finally, section three addresses the effect of title and jurisdiction of tidal and submerged lands within the Katmai National Park.  Mr. Speaker, I offer this bill at this time to begin the process of reviewing each of these important provisions which affect my Native constituency. I introduced an identical bill last year, H.R. 4943, and am pleased to report that I received no opposition to the intent of that bill from any State or Federal agency or from any other group which may have an interest in this bill. Thank you for the opportunity to briefly explain my bill today.                          ____________________
