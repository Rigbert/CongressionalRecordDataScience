Speaker, when the supplemental appropriation bill comes up this week, largely for defense purposes, the Republican majority will try to play games and use sleight of hand to slip an increase in the debt ceiling past the American people. These issues should not be linked. They should be voted separately.  Yes, America has returned to the days of a growing budget deficit. The President's economic policy will reduce our surplus by nearly $1.7 trillion. That is 42 percent. The government, therefore, is about to bump its head against the debt ceiling.  This situation makes it all the more irresponsible, Mr. Speaker, for this Congress in the same bill to throw more than $100 million in taxpayer money to the wind to protect a private oil pipeline in the nation of Colombia. Yes, that is right. American taxpayers are being asked to pony up over $100 million to protect a private oil pipeline in a foreign country. This oil pipeline is owned by two multinational corporations and also by the Government of Colombia.  I will be offering an amendment to strike the first $6 million down payment in funding in this bill to protect what is called the Cano Limon oil pipeline. Most Americans do not even know about this pipeline; but they should, because the Bush administration wants to use their tax dollars to protect it. This pipeline that pipes Colombian oil is owned by U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum, along with Repsol, a Spanish-Argentine combine, and Ecopetrol, which is an arm of the Government of Colombia.  Can you believe it? This is where our lack of a national energy policy has led us, into the jungles of a Colombian war and into the middle of a civil war that has raged for two generations. The Bush administration wants Congress to spend American tax dollars to defend a pipeline that is owned by the Government of Colombia, a Spanish-Argentine multinational corporation and Occidental Petroleum, an American-based multinational giant, to pump Colombian oil.  When you think about it, this first $6 million is but a down payment on $104 million which is supposed to come later. This particular pipeline has been repeatedly attacked in Colombia's 38-year-long civil war.  Occidental Petroleum is not a poor company. In fact, it earned profits of more than $2 billion over the last 2 years. So why in the world should the American people have to foot this bill?This gift to Big Oil is a waste of our taxpayers' money and will only lead to other Big Oil giants lining up for similar corporate handouts. We are going backwards. We have gone from shoveling money into the pockets of American multinationals like Enron, that is outrageous enough, to shoveling money into the pockets of foreign multinational corporations and foreign governments.  Where does it stop? Where do we draw the line? When do we adopt a real energy policy in this country that promotes biodiesel, ethanol and other renewable fuels and cures our addiction to foreign oil? How many wars do we have to fight? How many people have to die? How many taxpayer dollars have to be wasted to keep the foreign oil flowing?  The Colombian army brigade that will be trained with these funds will protect a pipeline that, when operational, will pump about 35 million barrels per year. This adds up to $3 per barrel in costs to U.S. taxpayers to protect a pipeline for which Occidental currently pays security costs of about 50 cents per barrel. Very interesting. Moreover, as military Occidental Oil spokesman Larry Meriage admitted before Congress in February 2000, ``This pipeline is 483 miles long, and so there aren't enough troops in all of Colombia to protect that pipeline along its corridor.''  Americans should not be in the business of paying for the protection of privately owned foreign oil pipelines abroad. We must act now to defeat this dangerous and wasteful pipeline protection proposal. If this $6 million down payment is provided now, it will be extremely difficult to stop the $98 million that is still due when the 2003 foreign operations bill is debated later this year.  Mr. Speaker, it is time to just say no. Say no to the Cano Limon pipeline. Say no to foreign oil. And say no to the Bush administration policy to keep our Nation addicted to foreign oil.                          ____________________
