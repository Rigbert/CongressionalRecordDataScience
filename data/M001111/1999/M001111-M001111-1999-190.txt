 I understand the Senator from Nevada would like to find a compromise, but the language of the second-degree says that:       . . .any operation or property for which a plan of      operations has been previously approved; any operation or      property for which a plan of operations has been submitted to      the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service prior to      October 1, 2000; or any subsequent amendment or modification      to such approved or submitted plans.  To me, it says that leaves the door open for any future, not just current, mine.
