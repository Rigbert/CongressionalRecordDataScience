. response to the scourge of conflict diamonds.  In war-torn areas in Africa, rebels and human rights abusers, with the complicity of some governments, have exploited the diamond trade, particularly alluvial diamond fields, to fund their guerrilla wars, to murder, rape, and mutilate innocent civilians, and kidnap children to be part of their guerrilla forces.  Since November, the press has reported a connection between al-Qaida operatives and conflict diamonds. Those connections were noted in advance of the September 11 attack. It stands to reason that when we have a terrorist organization and a country such as the United States in concert with its allies trying to trace the financial transactions that fund this terrorism, the terrorists will look for some other coin of the realm, some other way to fund their operations. Conflict diamonds turned out to be one of the most easy, portable, and least detected way to do it.  It is quite clear that Hezbollah, another terrorist organization in the Middle East, has had a long history of dealing in conflict diamonds.  While the conflict diamond trade comprises anywhere from an estimated 3 to 15 percent of the legitimate diamond trade, it threatens to damage an entire industry worldwide, an industry that is important to the economies of many countries and critical to a number of developing countries in Africa.  How does it work?  The terrorists go into the diamond fields where the natives of West Africa are trying to find these alluvial diamonds in the streams and the mud as they used to pan for gold in California and Alaska. They terrorize the local natives. They line them up in a row and walk through and hack off their feet and their hands until the natives and the miners in the circumstance are absolutely terrified. They threaten them with mutilation, with rape, and torture, destroying their villages and their lives. They literally become slaves to these terrorists, who then grab the diamonds and sell them into the terrorist networks.  Governments, the international diamond industry, and nongovernmental religious organizations have worked hard to address this complicated issue. They have set an impressive example of public and private cooperation. For the last 18 months, many countries involved in the Kimberly Process have been working to design a new regimen to govern the trade in rough diamonds. About 70 percent, by some estimates, of all the diamonds that are mined and found in the world are sold in the United States. The United States needs to show a leadership role in dealing with conflict diamonds so the terrorists know it is not going to be easy. Weare going to make it more difficult. We are going to try to establish controls so we know if diamonds were brought into the trade by illegal or legal means.  Last year, I introduced a bill called the Clean Diamonds Act, S. 1084, along with Senators DeWine and Feingold, to reflect the consensus that had developed between the religious and human rights communities and the diamond industry on the U.S. response to this issue. Senator Judd Gregg, who had introduced his own amendments and legislation dealing with this issue in the past, joined in cosponsoring our bill, as did a bipartisan group of 11 additional Senators.  In the House of Representatives, Congressmen Tony Hall and Frank Wolf have been leaders on this issue. They introduced several bills to address it. They worked with the Ways and Means Committee and the administration to pass the bill last November, H.R. 2722, the Clean Diamonds Trade Act, which, while a step forward, I am afraid, did not do enough to meet the original intent of our congressional effort. I had hoped Senator DeWine, Senator Feingold, and I might be able to work out an agreement with the administration to make some changes to strengthen the House-passed bill, but unfortunately that has not happened.  In the meantime, the international effort is continuing. Talks that we hope will one day lead to a final session of the Kimberly Process are underway today, tomorrow, and Wednesday in Ottawa. I am concerned key issues remain unresolved or have been addressed in ways that could undermine the whole initiative, leading to the failure to produce an effective Kimberly agreement.  Specifically, the negotiators need to address the issues of independent monitoring, the collection of reliable statistics, and the need for a coordinating body to implement the agreed-upon system of controls on rough diamond exports. In addition, the U.S. General Accounting Office, in its February 13 testimony entitled ``Significant Challenges Remain in Deterring Trade in Conflict Diamonds,'' outlined other potential witnesses in transparency, accountability, and risk assessment, particularly relating to controls from the mine to export.  We have decided we need to introduce a new, stronger Senate version of the Clean Diamonds Trade Act to move this issue forward and to address developments such as the revelations about terrorist exploitation of diamonds and the potential weaknesses in the international agreement.  Think about these diamonds moving across the world. You can put a fortune in your hand, put it into your pocket, and walk through any metal detector undetected. You can carry them on an airplane around the world, use them as people would use gold ingots or checking accounts. They are fungible wherever you go.  Our bill includes a broad definition of conflict diamonds, so it covers the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not simply areas that have been singled out by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. Our definition also covers the terrorists named by President George Bush in his Executive Order 13224.  The House bill does not give the authority to the President that he has already under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and has already in fact exercised to implement existing U.N. Security Council resolutions, nor does the House bill require the President to do anything to respond to this problem.  Our bill requires the President to prohibit the importation of rough diamonds from countries not taking effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds if that prohibition is in the foreign policy interest of the United States.  It is clear to me those responsible for the conflict diamond trade will stop at nothing in their efforts to circumvent the international efforts being negotiated. To transform a rough diamond into a polished diamond for purposes of import classification, all someone needs to do is make one cut. That distinction in the House-passed bill is a terrible loophole. The importation of polished diamonds or jewelry containing diamonds is a potentially huge loophole as well through which conflict diamonds could have been imported into the United States. The House-passed bill did not protect against that loophole.  The House bill also does not require but only permits the President to prohibit the importation of specific shipments of polished diamonds or jewelry containing diamonds into our country, if he has credible evidence they were produced from conflict diamonds. Our bill requires it.  Our bill also permits the President to prohibit the importation of polished diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds from countries that do not take effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds.  With these two provisions, we hope to send a strong message that the United States will close the polished diamond and diamond jewelry loopholes so that American consumers can have confidence that the diamond they buy for an engagement, an anniversary, or another milestone in their lives is from a legitimate and responsible source.  Finally, our bill eliminates the safe harbor provision contained in the House bill which would allow circumvention of the Kimberly Process before an agreement were even finalized. While these negotiations are proceeding and while we are trying to secure the cooperation of all parties concerned, this is not the time to undercut it.  The world was shocked and horrified by the murder, mutilation, and terror imposed on the people of Sierra Leone by rebels funded with conflict diamonds. The moral outcry by religious and human rights groups galvanized governments and the diamond industry to address the problem. Now is the time to close the deal and to secure an effective agreement, not an exercise in public relations. Now is also the time to have strong U.S. legislation to say to the world the United States will do as much as it can to stop this scourge.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                S. 2027       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Diamond Trade Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Funds derived from the sale of rough diamonds are being      used by rebels, state actors, and terrorists to finance      military activities, overthrow legitimate governments,      subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability,      and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians.      During the past decade, more than 6,500,000 people from      Sierra Leone, Angola, and the Democratic Republic of the      Congo have been driven from their homes by wars waged in      large part for control of diamond mining areas. A million of      these are refugees eking out a miserable existence in      neighboring countries, and tens of thousands have fled to the      United States. Approximately 3,700,000 people have died      during these wars.       (2) The countries caught in this fighting are home to      nearly 70,000,000 people whose societies have been torn apart      not only by fighting but also by terrible human rights      violations.       (3) Human rights advocates, the diamond trade as      represented by the World Diamond Council, and the United      States Government recently began working to block the trade      in conflict diamonds. Their efforts have helped to build a      consensus that action is urgently needed to end the trade in      conflict diamonds.       (4) The United Nations Security Council has acted at      various times under chapter VII of the Charter of the United      Nations to address threats to international peace and      security posed by conflicts linked to diamonds. Through these      actions, it has prohibited all states from exporting weapons      to certain countries affected by such conflicts. It has      further required all states to prohibit the direct and      indirect import of rough diamonds from Angola and Sierra      Leone unless the diamonds are controlled under specified      certificate of origin regimes and to prohibit absolutely for      a period of 12 months the direct and indirect import of rough      diamonds from Liberia.       (5) In response, the United States implemented sanctions      restricting the importation of rough diamonds from Angola and      Sierra Leone to those diamonds accompanied by specified      certificates of origin and fully prohibiting the importation      of rough diamonds from Liberia. In order to put an end to the      emergency situation in international relations, to maintain      international peace and security, and to protect its      essential security interests, and pursuant to its obligations      under the United Nations Charter, the United States is now      taking further action against trade in conflict diamonds.       (6) Without effective action to eliminate trade in conflict      diamonds, the trade in legitimate diamonds faces the threat      of a consumer backlash that could damage the economies of      countries not involved in the trade in conflict diamonds and      penalize members of the legitimate trade and the people they      employ. To prevent that, South Africa and more than 30 other      countries are involved in working, through the ``Kimberley      Process'', toward devising a solution to this problem. As the      consumer of a majority of the world's supply of diamonds, the      United States has an obligation to help sever the link      between diamonds and conflict and press for implementation of      an effective solution.       (7) Articles XX and XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs      and Trade 1994 allow members of the World Trade Organization      to take measures to deal with situations such as that      presented by the current trade in conflict diamonds without      violating their World Trade Organization obligations.       (8) Failure to curtail the trade in conflict diamonds or to      differentiate between the trade in conflict diamonds and the      trade in legitimate diamonds could have a severe negative      impact on the legitimate diamond trade in countries such as      Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Tanzania.       (9) Initiatives of the United States seek to resolve the      regional conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa which facilitate the      trade in conflict diamonds.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.       In this Act:       (1) Conflict diamonds.--The term ``conflict diamonds''      means--       (A) rough diamonds the importation of which is prohibited      by United Nations Security Council Resolutions because that      trade is fueling conflict;       (B) in the case of rough diamonds not covered by      subparagraph (A), rough diamonds used by any armed movement      or an ally of an armed movement to finance or sustain      operations to carry out systematic human rights abuses or      attacks against unarmed civilians; or       (C) diamonds that evidence shows fund the al-Qaeda      international terrorist network and related groups designated      under Executive Order No. 13224 of September 23, 2001 (66      Federal Register 49079).       (2) Diamonds.--The term ``diamonds'' means diamonds      classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 or subheading      7102.39.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United      States.

(4) Rough diamonds.--The term ``rough diamonds'' means      diamonds that are unworked, or simply sawn, cleaved, or      bruted, classifiable under subheading 7102.31.00 of the      Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.       (5) United states.--The term ``United States'', when used      in the geographic sense, means the several States, the      District of Columbia, and any commonwealth, territory, or      possession of the United States.     SEC. 4. MEASURES TO PREVENT IMPORTS OF CONFLICT DIAMONDS.       (a) Authority of the President.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law, the President shall prohibit, in whole or      in part, the importation into the United States of rough      diamonds, and may prohibit the importation into the United      States of polished diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds,      from any country that does not take effective measures to      stop trade in conflict diamonds as long as the prohibition is      consistent with the foreign policy interests of the United      States, including the international obligations of the United      States, or is pursuant to United Nations Security Council      Resolutions on conflict diamonds.       (b) Effective Measures.--For purposes of this Act,      effective measures are measures that--       (1) meet the requirements of United Nations Security      Council Resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds;       (2) meet the requirements of an international arrangement      on conflict diamonds, including the recommendations of the      Kimberley Process, as long as the measures also meet the      requirements of United Nations Security Council Resolutions      on trade in conflict diamonds; or       (3) contain the following elements, or their functional      equivalent, if such elements are sufficient to meet the      requirements of United Nations Security Council Resolutions      on trade in conflict diamonds:       (A) With respect to exports from countries where rough      diamonds are extracted, secure packaging, accompanied by      officially validated documentation certifying the country of      origin, total carat weight, and value.       (B) With respect to exports from countries where rough      diamonds are extracted, a system of verifiable controls on      rough diamonds from mine to export.       (C) With respect to countries that reexport rough diamonds,      a system of controls designed to ensure that no conflict      diamonds have entered the legitimate trade in rough diamonds.       (D) Verifiable recordkeeping by all companies and      individuals engaged in mining, import, and export of rough      diamonds within the territory of the exporting country,      subject to inspection and verification by authorized      government authorities in accordance with national      regulations.       (E) Government publication on a periodic basis of official      rough diamond export and import statistics.       (F) Implementation of proportionate and dissuasive      penalties against any persons who violate laws and      regulations designed to combat trade in conflict diamonds.       (G) Full cooperation with the United Nations or other      official international bodies examining the trade in conflict      diamonds, especially with respect to any inspection and      monitoring of the trade in rough diamonds.       (c) Exclusions.--The provisions of this section do not      apply to--       (1) rough diamonds imported by or on behalf of a person for      personal use and accompanying a person upon entry into the      United States; or       (2) rough diamonds previously exported from the United      States and reimported by the same importer, without having      been advanced in value or improved in condition by any      process or other means while abroad, if the importer declares      that the reimportation of the rough diamonds satisfies the      requirements of this paragraph.     SEC. 5. PROHIBITION OF POLISHED DIAMONDS AND JEWELRY.       The President shall prohibit specific entries into the      customs territory of the United States of polished diamonds      and jewelry containing diamonds if the President has credible      evidence that such polished diamonds and jewelry were      produced with conflict diamonds.     SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.       (a) In General.--Diamonds and jewelry containing diamonds      imported into the United States in violation of any      prohibition imposed under section 4 or 5 are subject to the      seizure and forfeiture laws, and all criminal and civil laws      of the United States shall apply, to the same extent as any      other violation of the customs and navigation laws of the      United States.       (b) Proceeds From Fines and Forfeited Goods.--     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the proceeds      derived from fines imposed for violations of section 4(a),      and from the seizure and forfeiture of goods imported in      violation of section 4(a), shall, in addition to amounts      otherwise available for such purposes, be available only      for--       (1) the Leahy War Victims Fund administered by the United      States Agency for International Development or any successor      program to assist victims of foreign wars; and       (2) grants under section 131 of the Foreign Assistance Act      of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2152a).     SEC. 7. REPORTS.       (a) Annual Reports.--Not later than one year after the      effective date of this Act, and every 12 months thereafter,      the President shall transmit to Congress a report--       (1) describing actions taken by countries that have      exported diamonds to the United States during the preceding      12-month period to implement effective measures to stop trade      in conflict diamonds;       (2) describing any new technologies since the date of      enactment of this Act for marking diamonds or determining the      origin of rough diamonds;       (3) identifying those countries that have exported diamonds      to the United States during the preceding 12-month period and      are not implementing effective measures to stop trade in      conflict diamonds and whose failure to do so has      significantly increased the likelihood that conflict diamonds      are being imported into the United States;       (4) describing appropriate actions, which may include      actions under sections 4 and 5, that may be taken by the      United States, or actions that may be taken or are being      taken by each country identified under paragraph (3), to      ensure that conflict diamonds are not being imported into the      United States from such country; and       (5) identifying any additional countries involved in      conflicts linked to rough diamonds that are not the subject      of United Nations Security Council Resolutions on conflict      diamonds.       (b) Semiannual Reports.--For each country identified in      subsection (a)(3), the President shall, every 6 months after      the initial report in which the country was identified,      transmit to Congress a report that explains what actions have      been taken by the United States or such country since the      previous report to ensure that conflict diamonds are not      being imported from that country into the United States. The      requirement to issue a semiannual report with respect to a      country under this subsection shall remain in effect until      such time as the country implements effective measures.     SEC. 8. GAO REPORT.       Not later than 3 years after the effective date of this      Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall      transmit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the      provisions of this Act in preventing the importation of      conflict diamonds under section 4. The Comptroller General      shall include in the report any recommendations on any      modifications to this Act that may be necessary.     SEC. 9. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       (a) International Arrangement.--It is the sense of Congress      that the President should take the necessary steps to      negotiate an international arrangement, working in concert      with the Kimberley Process referred to in section 2(6), to      eliminate the trade in conflict diamonds. Such an      international arrangement should create an effective global      system of controls covering countries that export and import      rough diamonds, should     contain the elements described in section 4(b)(3), and should      address independent monitoring, the collection of reliable      statistics on the diamond trade, and the need for a      coordinating body or secretariat to implement the      arrangement.       (b) Additional Security Council Resolutions.--It is the      sense of Congress that the President should take the      necessary steps to seek United Nations Security Council      Resolutions with respect to trade in diamonds from additional      countries identified under section 7(a)(5).       (c) Trade in Legitimate Diamonds.--It is the sense of      Congress that the provisions of this Act should not impede      the trade in legitimate diamonds with countries which are      working constructively to eliminate trade in conflict      diamonds, including through the negotiation of an effective      international arrangement to eliminate trade in conflict      diamonds.       (d) Implementation of Effective Measures.--It is the sense      of Congress that companies involved in diamond extraction and      trade should make financial contributions to countries      seeking to implement any effective measures to stop trade in      conflict diamonds described in section 4(b), if those      countries would have financial difficulty implementing those      measures.     SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       There is authorized to be appropriated to the President      $5,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2002 and 2003 to      provide assistance to countries seeking to implement any      effective measures to stop trade in conflict diamonds      described in section 4(b), if those countries would have      financial difficulty implementing those measures.     SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act shall take effect on the date of the enactment of      this Act.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about legislation that Senator Durbin, Senator Feingold, and I introduce today to address the continued profitable sale of what we refer to as conflict diamonds. We have been working together on this matter for some time, along with our colleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman Tony Hall from my home State of Ohio and Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia.  We have been working to help those in Africa who are suffering at the hands of this illicit diamond trade. Last spring, we introduced a similar bill to put pressure on the international community to implement a global agreement to stem the conflict diamond trade.  While the House passed a weaker version of that bill last November, my Senate colleagues and I have been working with the administration to pass a stronger, more meaningful bill. Unfortunately, these negotiations thus far have not been successful. That is why we join together today in the introduction of a new and even stronger measure: legislation that reflects both trade and humanitarian concerns.  The introduction now is particularly significant, as the international community begins the final session of the Kimberly Process today in Ottawa.  During these negotiations, it is critical that the United States send a strong message to the international community, a message that says we are committed to these efforts and are fighting for a strong, effective Kimberly agreement.  Mr. President, I believe the United States must take this leadership role so we can get ultimately the strongest possible agreement. That is the message I believe our bill sends today. I will spend a few minutes talking about why this bill is so important and why it is vital we get a strong measure passed and eventually signed into law.  The diamond trade is one of the world's most lucrative industries. With its extreme profitability, it is not surprising a black market trade has emerged alongside the legitimate industry. The sale of illicit diamonds has yielded disturbing reports in the media linking even Osama bin Laden to this trade. On February 22, 2001, the U.S. District Court trial, United States v. Osama bin Laden, attests to this.  Additionally, there is an established link between Sierra Leone's diamond trade and well-known Lebanese terrorists.  It is also not surprising that diamond trading has become an attractive and sustainable income source for violent rebel groups around the world, particularly in Africa. The information I am talking about today in regard to terrorists has been reported in the public news media. Currently in Africa, where the majority of the world's diamonds are found, there is ongoing strife and struggle resulting from the fight for control of the precious gems. While violence has erupted in several countries, including Sierra Leone, Angola, the Congo, and Liberia, Sierra Leone in particular has one of the worst records of violence.  In that nation, rebel groups, most notably the Revolutionary United Front, the RUL, have seized control of many of that country's diamond fields. Once in control of a diamond field, the rebels confiscate the diamonds. Then they launder them on to the legitimate market through other nearby nations, such as Liberia, and ultimately finance their terrorist regimes and their continued efforts to overthrow the government.  Over the past decade, the rebels reaped the benefits of at least $10 billion in smuggled diamonds, and the fact is it could be a lot more than that. Since the start of the rebel quest for control of Sierra Leone's diamond supply, the children of this small nation have borne the brunt of the insurgency. For over 8 years, the RUF has conscripted children, often as young as 7 or 8 years old. These soldiers and their makeshift army have ripped an estimated 12,000 children from their families. After the RUF invaded the capital of Freetown in January 1999, at least 3,000 children were reported missing.  As a result of deliberate and systematic brutalization, children soldiers have become some of the most vicious and effective fighters within the rebel factions. The rebel army, child soldiers included, has terrorized Sierra Leone's population, killing, abducting, raping, and hacking off the limbs of victims with machetes. This chopping off of limbs is the RUF's trademark strategy.  I believe we can do something about this. We can, in fact, make a difference. We have the power to help put an end to the indiscriminate suffering and violence in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa. As the world's biggest diamond customer, purchasing the majority of the world's diamonds, the United States has tremendous clout. With that clout, we have the power to remove the lucrative financial incentives that drive the rebel groups to trade in diamonds in the first place.  Simply put, if there is no market for their diamonds, there is little reason for the rebels to engage in their brutal campaigns to secure and then protect their diamonds. That is why our legislation is aimed at removing the rebels' market incentive. We need to work together with the international community to facilitate the implementation of a system of controls on the export and import of diamonds so that buyers can be certain their purchases are not fueling the rebel campaign.  Specifically, our new bill attempts to move this issue forward and to strengthen U.S. policy. For example, our bill would require the President to prohibit the importation of rough diamonds from countries not taking effective measures to stop the trade in conflict diamonds.  It also addresses potential loopholes associated with polished diamonds and diamond jewelry and includes a broader definition of conflict diamonds so that it includes conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other areas as well.  These are a few of the important provisions that were omitted in the House version, provisions that are essential in this legislation to make the difference we want to make. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this new bill and send an important message to the international community. As I see it, we do have an obligation, I think a moral obligation, to help eliminate the financial incentives for the illicit traders. We owe it to those who unwittingly buy these conflict diamonds but, more importantly, we owe it to the children who have suffered far too long.                          ____________________
