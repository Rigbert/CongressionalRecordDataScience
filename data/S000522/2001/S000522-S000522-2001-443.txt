Mr. Speaker, I am introducing today a bill to make certain reservists eligible for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. I am joined by the Honorable Frank Wolf, Honorable Mike Bilirakis, Honorable Steve Buyer, Honorable Mike Simpson, Honorable Richard Baker, Honorable Rob Simmons and Honorable Tom Davis in introducing this measure. Our bill would allow burial at Arlington National Cemetery of (1) reserve members under age 60 who but for their age would have been eligible at the time of their death for retired pay under title 10; and (2) reserve component members who die in the line of duty while on active duty for training or inactive duty training. The bill would be effective for interments occurring after the date of enactment.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this Nation affords a final resting place for every veteran who has honorably served in its Armed Forces. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers 133 national cemeteries throughout the United States, and since 1980 has provided $82 million in grants to states to establish or expand 42 state veterans cemeteries. Last year, over 82,000 veterans and family members were interred in VA cemeteries and more than 14,000 veterans and family members were buried in state veterans cemeteries. In addition, 3,727 veterans and family members were buried at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC), which is administered by the Department of the Army.  I will not recite the storied history of this cemetery nor the famous Americans who are buried there. However, because there is limited space for in-ground burial at the cemetery, in 1967 the Army adopted rules restricting eligibility as to which veterans can be buried at ANC. (ANC will provide space for cremated remains in its columbaria for an honorably discharged veteran eligible for burial at any of the other national cemeteries.) In general, Army rules restrict in-ground burial at ANC to veterans who were wounded in combat, died on active duty, received one of the military services' highest awards for gallantry, were held as a prisoner of war, or retired from military service. In addition, veterans who do not meet these criteria but whose served in a high Federal office (e.g. cabinet secretary, Supreme Court justice, Member of the House or Senate) are also eligible, as are the immediate family members of all veterans buried there.  Under the current Army rules, which few Americans are familiar with, a reservist who has retired from the Armed Forces but is not yet age 60 is ineligible for in-ground burial at ANC. Similarly, members of the reserve components who die while performing training duty on a weekend or for a two-week period are not eligible for in-ground burial at ANC, even though servicemembers who die in similar circumstances while on active duty would be eligible for such burial.  Given the increased responsibilities assigned to our Reserve and National Guard forces, I believe that a compassionate government should treat these reserve component members whose death is in the line of duty in the same manner as those active duty members whose death occurs in the line of duty. We should honor their service and the loss of their lives the same, even though their families may elect not to bury them at Arlington. That is the purpose of this legislation, and I urge Members to support it.                          ____________________
